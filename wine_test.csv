Description,Rating,Title
"This is a quintessential expression of young Nebbiolo, with pretty floral and strawberry notes that carry onto the palate, along with raspberry and mineral nuances and a whiff of spice. A bright, elegant wine made to be drunk young. Imported by Masciarelli Wine Co, Moonlight Wine Co.",88,Giacomo Fenocchio 2011  Nebbiolo d'Alba
"Honey, orange blossom and a little mustard make up the nose of this classic Loire Valley SB. Tangerine and bitter greens play a duet on the palate, and the finish is more or less a reduced version of those primary flavors. The overall impression is one of a simple, tight, easy-to-drink wine.",86,Pascal Jolivet 2000  Pouilly-Fumé
"This reserve offers rather light strawberry fruit, and some highlights of tobacco and milk chocolate. It spent 18 months in one-third new French oak. Despite the reserve tag and the excellent vintage, it comes across as simple and a bit dilute.",86,Vercingetorix VX 2014 Reserve Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Soft and herbal but quite delicious, this Cab offers flavors of blackberries, black currants and mocha, with a rich veneer of sandalwood. At its best now and through 2012.",89,Blue Rock 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Rich and opulent, this opens with toasted aromas of spice and nut, backed by accents of ripe fruit and blackberry jelly. The mouthfeel is soft, supple and slightly sweet.",88,Feudi di San Marzano 2010 Sud Red (Salice Salentino)
"Peppery, rich and low in pronounced oak, this estate-driven Cab has softened tannins and is most definitely drinkable now, with pungent, bright fruit and a lengthy, leathery finish.",88,Rutherford Grove 2010 Pestoni Family Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"Notes of ground coffee, cocoa and forest floor dominate this wine's aromatic profile. Supple, dusty tannins and soft acids frame the weighty palate. The finish is medium to long, but it comes with some warmth.",86,Vivác Winery 2009 Single Vineyard Syrah (New Mexico)
There's an electric current of spice on the first sip. Beyond it are waves of faint strawberry and thin layers of ripe red cherry and a touch of herb. The finish lingers.,87,Robert Mondavi 2012 Napa Valley Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"Concentrated aromas of berry fruits, spice and black currant jelly suggest that the wine is full and rich. In the mouth, severe tannins create a grinding sensation, while flavors of toast, blackberry, cassis and brown sugar lead to a heavy, burnt tasting finish that's blocky in feel.",88,Dominio de Atauta 2009 Parada de Atauta  (Ribera del Duero)
"Made entirely from Nebbiolo, this boasts finesse and structure. Aromas of rose and red berry carry over to the palate alongside bright cherry and yeasty notes of baked bread. Crisp acidity generates freshness, while the elegant perlage gives a silky texture. It finishes bone-dry. Oliver McCrum, Volio Vino.",92,Germano Ettore 2012 Rosanna Metodo Classico Brut Rosé Nebbiolo (Vino Spumante)
"A bit chewy, this brings old-vine texture into play, with herbal highlights around fruit flavors of mountain berry and pie cherry. The snap and tang of tart, just-ripe fruit is much in evidence. Young and sassy, this should continue to improve with further bottle age.",91,Winderlea 2013 Weber Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Very dark in color, this robust wine has enticing wood smoke and oak aromas, rich but dry fruit flavors like blackberry and blueberry, an abundance of muscular tannins in the firm texture and full but not overpowering body. It's very tight to drink now, so best consume it after 2022.",89,Le Casque 2014 Petite Sirah (Sierra Foothills)
"Hints of bramble, savory beetroot and spice lend complexity to lush, ripe black cherry and berry flavors in this full-bodied Cabernet Franc. Unctuous and juicy, it penetrates richly, shaded by soft layers of fine-grained tannins. Drink now–2017.",89,Dr. Konstantin Frank 2013 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes)
"This wine from the Tiefenbrunner estate at Castel Turmhof is a lively, crisp, fresh style of wine, with flavors of green peppers and mint, and good acidity.",86,Tiefenbrunner 2002 Kirchleiten Sauvignon Blanc (Alto Adige)
"This landmark Italian wine continues to show the best of Tuscany, as it faithfully does year after year. The quality is obvious, thanks to rich notes of chocolate, black cherry and spice that are wrapped tight within a lush, soft and texture. The close is velvety and very long.",94,Marchesi Antinori 2008 Tignanello Red (Toscana)
"Too soft in structure, and sweet, too, like berry fruit concentrate. Fans of sweet, simple red wines will like this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Zinfandel.",83,Pomar Junction 2010 Brooster Fighting Red Red (Paso Robles)
"The wine is two-thirds Grenache, 30% Syrah and the rest Mourvèdre. It's warm and fruity, lightly spicy and finishing with tannins showing green tea and leaf. This is mostly Elerding fruit from the Horse Heaven Hills vineyard; balanced and firm.",90,Owen Roe 2006 Sinister Hand Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"An attractive spicy, floral perfume joins rich fruit and spice flavors in this full-bodied, almost thick but luxuriously textured wine. An abundance of enticing oak aromas and flavors mingle with ripe cherry and blackberry notes, while piles of fine-grained tannin give a velvety mouthfeel.",91,Amador Cellars 2013 Ottimista Vineyard Sangiovese (Amador County)
"Grapefruit, crushed tomato vine, exotic fruit and aromatic herb are some of the aromas you'll find on this fragrant white. The elegant medium-bodied palate delivers green melon, citrus and white peach alongside a vibrant saline note that energizes the finish.",90,Castelvecchio 2015 Sauvignon
"This is a ripe and meaty wine (a second Riserva, next to the estate's Riserva Campocerchi) with enduring notes of wet earth, smoke meat, red cherry and dried apple skins. It tastes plump, succulent and bright and would pair well with stewed beef.",87,Collelungo 2006 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"Aromatically, this wine is currently subdued, with the notes of raspberry, cocoa and cherry that haven't fully blossomed. The flavors meanwhile are generous and ripe, while still showing a fine sense of balance. Additional time in the bottle or a long decant should allow it to open up.",91,Leonetti Cellar 2014 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"The bishop's (Evêque) vineyard has produced a stylish, full-flavored wine, densely packed with black cherry, ripe tannins and a juicy, fruity character. It is a dense wine with tannins that promise good aging. Drink from 2016.",91,Domaines Devillard 2011 Château de Chamirey Clos l'Evêque Premier Cru  (Mercurey)
"This is a refined wine, with a layered fragrance of black cherry, raspberry, black pepper and bell pepper. The palate reveals ripe blackberry, plum and baking-spice flavors that are supported by refreshing acidity. Enjoy now or hold for a couple more years.",88,Albino Armani 2010  Valpolicella Ripasso
"Rich and full in mouth, this has green and apple fruit flavors that are cut with acidity. The tangy texture gives a contrast and balance to the wine. Drink from 2017.",88,Isabelle et Pierre Clément 2014 Châtenoy  (Menetou-Salon)
"Mint and smoky aromas give this wine an attractive, juicy character. It is developing well and almost ready to drink. From Cahor's high altitude vineyards, the wine is bright and fruity with damson flavors and smoothed with wood aging. Drink from 2018.",90,Georges Vigouroux 2012 Château de Haute-Serre Malbec (Cahors)
"A big wine in every sense—including its heavy bottle—this is as dense as Zweigelt gets. It retains some of the great bitter-cherry flavor characteristic of the grape, adding spice and wood notes, plus a dense, firm texture. As it develops, this will show impressive depth of flavor.",91,Schwarz Wein 2010 Zweigelt (Neusiedlersee)
"The almost legendary wine of Gassac is in fact a deeply satisfying, rich but structured southern wine, with a fine balance between spice, red fruits and powerful tannins. There's a raw edge of youth here, confirming that these wines always have considerable aging potential.",92,Mas de Daumas Gassac 2005 Red (Vin de Pays de la Haute Vallée du Gassac)
"As gamy as foie gras, and just as rich, this 100% varietal wine fills the palate with baked plum, licorice and intense ripe fruit that borders on confected. Soft tannins and supportive oak give it structure and breadth.",90,Sbragia 2013 Teldeschi Vineyard Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley)
"One of the palest icewines to come across our tasting table, this is an extraordinarily fine example, with great purity of fruit and incredible balance. Tangerine and pineapple flavors shine with pristine clarity from start to finish, making it very drinkable.",95,Schloss Saarstein 2009 Serrig Schloss Saarsteiner Eiswein Riesling (Mosel)
"This wine—named for two adjacent vineyards—is 75% Dionysus Cabernet Sauvignon with the balance Bacchus Cabernet Franc. It provides a pleasing assortment of dried and fresh herbs, cherry, flowers and mocha with a seamless, almost creamy feel, bringing an impeccable sense of balance. It's irresistible now but has the stuffing to go the distance.",92,Trust 2012 A Stone's Throw Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This wine is bone-dry, although with some age the shock of the acidity has been rounded out by a hint of toast. It's linear, fresh and intensely crisp, with citrus and almond tones. Drink this wine from a good vintage now.",91,Aubry 2009 Le Nombre d'Or Brut Nature Chardonnay (Champagne)
"Shines with a nice purple lustre then opens with big blackberry and spiced plum flavors that are earthy and wild. The palate is round, ripe and feels good, and the flavors are centered on herbal blackberry and toast. Very good for the price range.",88,MontGras 2010 Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"Very young, needs plenty of time. Still showing fermentation notes, with brisk, grapey acidity and primary cherry and raspberry fruit flavors. Seems brilliantly constructed and capable of aging, though. Hold until after 2012.",92,Donelan 2009 Walker Vine Hill Syrah (Russian River Valley)
"This high-end blend of Montepulciano (70%) and Cabernet Sauvignon shows the best of winemaking in Abruzzo. This is a poised and confident wine, with defined aromas of ripe blackberry, leather and polished mineral. The tannins are plush and velvety; and the wine definitely delivers a very long and determined finish.",92,Illuminati Dino 2007 Lumen Riserva Red (Controguerra)
"Rounded and approachable, this estate-driven wine is 100% varietal and dusty on the palate in tight-grained oak and tannin. The flavors are richly rewarding, etched in chocolate-covered raspberry, clove and an herbal undercurrent that's hard to pin down.",90,Clos du Val 2014 Hirondelle Vineyard Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District)
"Hugely dense and dark, this is a powerful and concentrated wine. While all this structure is there, so are stylish fruits and the potential for suave elegance, which comes from the wood aging, the rich black fruits and the balance between tannin and fruit. Drink this impressive wine from 2018.",93,Luis Duarte 2013 Rapariga da Quinta Reserva Red (Alentejano)
"Fresh lemony notes are signalled on the nose and fizz on the simple, fruit-driven palate. There is an element of creaminess but the frothing mouthfeel is all about refreshment and easy fruit.",88,Cave de Ribeauvillé NV Giersberger Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Alsace)
"This has a dry finish with modest alcohol, and its emphasis is on phenolic flavors rather than the usual floral-perfumed aromas that characterize most versions of the grape. Here you'll find lemon rind, pineapple and tart, mineral-soaked acids. It's a fine match for white fish, shellfish, scallops or oysters.",88,Abiqua Wind 2015 Gloria Anne Gewürztraminer (Willamette Valley)
"The blend is 70% Syrah, 20% Grenache and 10% Carignan, and in 2009 the grapes were as ripe as they could be. Mocha and chocolate notes pick up a touch of prune. With its superripe fruit, ample weight, lush texture and warm finish, there are valid concerns about its ageability, but this offers hedonistic drinking for an affordable price.",91,Guillaume Gros 2009 El Niño Loco Red (Vin de Pays de la Méditerranée)
"Aragonez is the main force behind this smooth, rich wine. It has great tannins that are cushioned comfortably by the rich, juicy berry fruits. Spice and acidity roll around the mouth, giving a lift to the rich, still firmly tannic wine. Drink this impressive wine from 2018.",94,Fitapreta Vinhos 2012 Palpite Grande Reserva Red (Alentejano)
"What to mention first? A hint of mossy earth, chamomile tisane, Cox Orange Pippin apples or lemon zest? All of these aromas dance on the nose. They are still totally shy on the taut, dry and concentrated palate. For now, it is mossy citrus that is most aromatic while rich fruit still needs to unfurl. This strikes a note of utter purity, of something soaring and bright. Right now this is totally brisk, invigorating and refreshing but its true colors won't show for some time. Drink 2020–2035.",96,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2014 Clos Saint Urbain Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"Citrus and apple aromas are dusty. This is easygoing and just juicy enough, with apple, orange and tangerine flavors. A clean finish turns softer and more mealy the longer it sits.",85,Valdivieso 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley)
"The second wine of the Bruno Prats and Symington family joint venture, this is a deliciously fruity wine, but with a fine elegant backbone of light tannins and smoky wood. As befits a second wine in the Bordeaux tradition, this is ready to drink.",89,Prats & Symington LDA 2007 Post Scriptum de Chryseia Red (Douro)
"An aromatic wine with gardenia, ripe nectarine and honey. It's medium-plus sweet with jasmine and stone fruit flavors with the grape's natural acidity playing along nicely.",86,Washington Hills 2013 Riesling (Washington)
"This is a light and fruity wine that has some attractive red berry flavors and lively acidity. There is a tannic background that gives the a sense of structure, although the dry core lacks some fruit tones.",88,Quinta Santa Eufemia 2010 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port)
"This is a biodynamic blend of Merlot and Cabernet Franc that's focused on two principle components: green Cabernet Franc notes and dusty, mineral ones. Both speak to the wine's typicity yet the finish falls a bit short.",86,Duemani 2005 Altrovino Red (Toscana)
"This Chardonnay in a box is the equivalent of four regular bottles, but it's not a very good wine. It's ultradry and acidic, with unripe, vegetal flavors that just approach citrus fruits.",82,Monthaven 2008 Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"Clean, simple pear, melon and apple aromas are friendly. Reasonably full and fresh on the palate, this value-priced wine tastes of tropical fruits including banana and papaya as well as honey. A slightly oily finish gives weight to closing citrus flavors.",85,Viña Bisquertt 2014 Petirrojo Reserva Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley)
"This wine is rich and spicy. At this stage, with its muted fruit, it is all potential, but one can sense the ripeness and generous texture that will make it excellent once it matures. Give this powerful wine until 2023.",93,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2015  Corton-Charlemagne
"Once the sulfur aromas from recent bottling blow over, the wine shows ripe fruit with a soft texture. Pear and yellow fruits are going to come through in a few months. Drink from 2015.",86,Chanson Père et Fils 2012  Pouilly-Fuissé
"There's vibrant acidity and underlying flavors of pineapple, white peach and mango in this Chardonnay. The overall palate, however, is overwhelmed by oak.",84,Educated Guess 2011 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Light in color and stemmy and spicy in equal parts, this light, bright wine is complex and intriguing in its offering of white pepper, baker's yeast and cranberry coated in vanilla. It delivers flavor and nuance in a pleasing showcase of the variety.",91,Terlato 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This elegant blend of stainless- and barrel-aged lots captures the fresh fruit flavors of red apples, kiwi and lime, letting just a hint of barrel toast creep into the finish. It's leesy and bracing, finished at 14.8% alcohol but tasting much lighter.",88,Spindrift Cellars 2006 Woodhall Vineyard Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
"With 11% Petit Verdot, this hearty, full-bodied red shows crunchy, high-toned cranberry and elements of black pepper, pencil shavings and dried herb. A toughness of leather dives into the tobacco-laden finish.",88,Medlock Ames 2014 Bell Mountain Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"A majority of Merlot meets Cabernet Franc in this chocolaty-cherry wine, boldly full bodied and robust in tannin and oak. Brambly blackberry and black currant ride a soft mouthfeel that's moderate in acidity.",85,Stack House 2013 Red (Napa Valley)
"89-91 Both freshness and richness are well combined in this elegant Sauternes. What it misses in weight, it gains in honey and apricot flavors.",90,Château Raymond-Lafon 2010 Barrel sample  (Sauternes)
Strong mint and menthol aromatics give way to intense fresh-cut cedar flavors. There's just too much wood for this woodchuck to chuck.,82,Hargrave 1998 Merlot (North Fork of Long Island)
"This is a linear and polished Montepulciano, with bright fruit nuances of blackberry and cassis, followed touches of black stone, spice and mature plum. It feels smooth and fine in the mouth, with a rich berry-driven finish.",88,Illuminati Dino 2009 Ripamosso  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo)
"Harvested in December, this marries opulent flavors of honey and orange marmalade with intense acidity. Ready to drink in its youth, but it's likely to age for many years. Screwcap.",90,Türk 2010 Eiswein Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"This wine comes from the original, own-rooted, 1965 plantings. It would be interesting to trace the ancestry of these vines, as such things were far less understood 50 years ago. Soft, round and fruity, this offers pleasant flavors of melon and apple. A dash of vanilla cookie coming through as it finishes.",86,David Hill 2014 Estate Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley)
"The 8.3 designation refers to the residual sugar by weight. It is indeed a very sweet wine, rich in simple honey, orange and apricot flavors.",85,Santa Barbara Winery 2010 Lafond Vineyard 8.3 Riesling (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Orange blossom, nectarine and almond skin aromas are true to the grape and inviting. The palate maintains a light, juicy, citric feel as it delivers flavors of melon, apple and banana. Fresh and forward, with a hint of heat and bitterness to the finish.",87,Doña Paula 2010 Estate Torrontés (Salta)
"With a pale coral color and flavors like strawberry and watermelon, this wine is bright and appealing. It is medium bodied and has a hint of sweetness.",86,Peace Water 2015 Inspire Rosé (North Coast)
"The wine comes from vineyards planted close to the Atlantic Ocean, south of Lisbon. That gives cool character to this attractive blend of Alvarinho, Viognier and Sauvignon Blanc. It has green fruits over a perfumed character that is touched by a herbal edge. The finely wrought wine is ready to drink.",89,Cortes de Cima 2015 White (Alentejano)
"Toasted almond aromas lead the way in this elegant, harmonious offering. It's medium bodied and plump, easily supporting intriguing notes of smoke, pineapple, peach and citrus. Drink now–2020.",90,Kumeu River 2014 Estate Chardonnay (Kumeu)
"Sunbaked earth, mature black-skinned berry and brown spice aromas take center stage. The round easygoing palate doles out dried Marasca cherry, blackberry and a hint of star anise. Pliant tannins lend easy drinking support.",88,La Selva 2015  Morellino di Scansano
"A perfumed wine, it is big on spiced apricots and ripe fruitiness. It is rich, full in the mouth with a slight oxidative aftertaste of almonds and walnuts that gives a sense of maturity. Drink now.",90,Rijckaert 2009 Les Grands Elevages Savagnin (Arbois)
"This is sophisticated stuff that lives up to Oakville's reputation. It tastes rich and alluring from the first whiff of black currant and espresso to the ultrasmooth mouthfeel and elegant finish. Think extra-fine tannins, opulent currant, dark chocolate and black cherry flavors. Enjoy it now or save through 2023 to encourage even more bouquet.",93,Hoopes 2013 Oakville Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This is an odd and difficult wine. Strong chocolate aromas recall a just-snapped Hershey bar, and are bolstered with a touch of blackberry coulis. Cola and black cherry show on the palate, but play second fiddle to the overwhelming chocolate flavor.",83,Graveyard NV Deliverance Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"With its delicate layers of garrigue, black tea and black pepper, this wine hails from a vineyard on the edge of the ocean west of Occidental. Intriguing, it's light in its approach and texture, but completely beguiling and complex.",93,Red Car 2012 Hagan Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Fermented in clay amphora, this fascinating orange wine opens with alluring aromas of dried yellow stone fruit, baking spice, aromatic herb, pressed yellow flower and a balsamic note. Boasting more fruit and flavor than many other wines in this genre, the savory enveloping palate presents apricot, yellow peach, candied nectarine zest, crystallized ginger and a hint of flinty mineral. Tangy acidity provides balance and lift while a honeyed note closes the lingering finish. Simply gorgeous.",94,Tre Monti 2015 Vitalba in Anfora Albana (Romagna)
"Expertly integrated butter elements mix with peach and lime spritz on the nose. This single-vineyard Chardonnay offers stone fruit flavors, slight sea saltiness and a long vanilla finish for very easy drinking.",90,Clos La Chance 2012 Harman Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Deep and dense from head to toe, this Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend opens with heavy, loamy black-fruit aromas along with coconut, graphite, cedar and tobacco scents. A definitively rich and chewy palate is tannic and heady but cushioned, while baked, toasty blackberry flavors come with vanilla and marzipan notes and an inky, chewy, thick finish. Drink through 2019.",92,Finca Perdriel 2009 Vineyard Selection Red (Mendoza)
"A big, woody, totally modern style of Syrah. There is a lot more coconut, mocha and big berry fruit than anything you might find from France. It's dark and layered on the palate, with coconut and resin supporting black fruit. Finishes smoky and oaky, but structured, tannic and serious enough to impress.",88,Trivento 2006 Golden Reserve Syrah (Mendoza)
"Underbrush, tobacco, dark cherry, licorice and grilled herb are just some of the aromas offered by this structured wine. The palate delivers mature black cherry, black pepper, sage and licorice alongside tongue-coating tannins that need time to soften. It hails from a top vineyard site and is an impressive effort from this hot, dry vintage. Drink 2017–2024.",93,Produttori del Barbaresco 2009 Montestefano Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"Coppola turns to a respected grape source for Pinot, and what do you know? This is his best ever. It's a lovely wine, supple and bright, with cherry, pomegranate and spicy persimmon flavors. The 50% new oak is perfectly integrated into the wine's power.",91,Francis Coppola 2009 Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"An onion skin pink is an attractive start to this fresh, red fruited wine. It is crisp, but not bone dry, having a soft texture. There is a fine balance of acidity of fruit, giving a light-bodied wine good as an apéritif.",87,Nicolas Feuillatte NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne)
"Tastes a little sweet, which may be from the extremely high (15.4%) alcohol. There's a soft, sugary mouthfeel to the pie-filling cherry and oak flavors. Firm tannins round out the picture. Not an ager.",84,Thomas Fogarty 2004 Gist Ranch Cabernet Franc (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Attractive and fruity, this has red fruits at the fore. It is soft, round and balanced, with just the right amount of red currant acidity. Drink now.",85,Domaine Jessiaume 2009  Bourgogne
"All five Bordeaux grapes are blended in this aromatic wine sourced from the Seven Hills and Pepper Bridge vineyards. In the mouth it is compact with a dense verticality, opening with raspberry and moving on into cassis fruit. Tight and young, compact and nicely structured, this should be cellared through 2022 to 2024.",92,Pepper Bridge 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This is delicious, concentrated and showing a range of nuances; along with ripe apple and pear flavors come spicy hints of cinnamon and baking spices. Firm acids, good balance, and more texture and length than most domestic Chardonnays in this price range.",90,Dusted Valley 2007 Old Vine Chardonnay (Yakima Valley)
"This wine has an austere character with a hint of tannins in its structure. Crisp apple backs up the bright luminous acidity. Almost startlingly fresh, it needs time in the bottle—drink from 2017.",92,La Chablisienne 2013 Montmains Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"Restrained notes of yellow plum pervade the greenish, citric freshness. The palate is crisp and grassy, refreshing but textured, with added interest from fragrant lime peel. A concentrated palate leads to a superclean, lime-tingling finish.",90,Neumeister 2014 Steirische Klassik Sauvignon Blanc (Südoststeiermark)
"This ripe, soft wine is well balanced and offers attractive fruitiness. The creamy mousse and acidity bring richness and a fresh character. With its finely judged dosage, not too dry, not too sweet, the wine is very ready to drink.",88,Vollereaux NV Brut Réserve  (Champagne)
"Quite a lot of fruit flavor is packed into this straightforward, dry and non-oaky wine. It should be versatile at the dinner table because of its direct flavors, rather reserved texture and good balance.",87,Enotria 2011 Barbera (Mendocino County)
"Fragrant white florals and concentrated flavors of juicy pink pomelo are effortlessly decadent on this semidry Riesling. While soft and supple on entry, there's a nervy edge of Meyer lemon pith accentuated by a long, mineral-laced finish.",87,Glenora 2010 Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"This is an aromatic wine, with scents of green melon candy, lime zest, white flowers and white peach. It drinks off dry, with stone-fruit flavors brightened by zippy acidity leading to a mouthwatering finish.",90,Vino La Monarcha 2015 Riesling (Ancient Lakes)
"A 100% varietal wine, this is a tense study in black cherry, blueberry, and dry chalky tannins, which need further time to resolve. Still puckering on the finish, it offers streaks of cedar, pencil lead and coconut that are still integrating. Drink now through 2023.",91,Terra Valentine 2013 Wurtele Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District)
"Charcoal, cola and licorice are all components of this wine's dark and meaty nose. And the palate hardly disappoints; there's depth and harmony to the berry, coffee and mocha flavors. It feels good and has just enough kick to keep you thinking. A really nice crianza that will settle and only grow more complex over the next few years.",91,Peñagudo 2004 Crianza  (Rioja)
"This blend from Matthews is 47% Merlot and 33% Cabernet Sauvignon, with smaller amounts of Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec. It's thoroughly New World in style: thick, smoky, tannic and concentrated, with notes of black cherry and cassis at the core.",90,Matthews Estate 2009 Claret Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This red has a wide and broad personality that encompasses aromas of black fruit, leather and tobacco. There's less fresh fruit here: the wine definitely focuses on oak-driven tones, but it is lively enough to pair with roasted meat or dishes that require a touch of juicy succulence.",88,Donatella Cinelli Colombini 2004 Fattoria del Colle Cenerentola Red (Orcia)
"Part of a range of wines that have been made to showcase the different styles of Portuguese regions, this wine brings out the fruitiness of Tejo. It's easy drinking, with soft tannins, attractive acidity and fresh blackberry flavors. Drink now.",88,Wines & Winemakers 2012 Azul Portugal Red (Tejo)
"Made from 80% Syrah, 15% Grenache and 5% Riesling, this magenta-hued wine shows exuberant orange blossom and cherry flavors buoyed by moderate acidity and seaspray-like freshness. It finishes rich and fruity, bringing a creamsicle in summer to mind.",91,Ampelos 2016 Rosé of Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Sweet, candy-like aromas of raspberry, rose and white chocolate characterize this easy-going Riserva from southern Italy. The wine ends with spice and sour notes and offers lean consistency accented by piquant zest.",85,Leone de Castris 2003 Riserva Negroamaro (Salice Salentino)
"Very light in color, this wine has a pungent nose that features white flowers, cold steel and lime juice. The palate is bright with racy acidity, showing lots of honeysuckle, some ripe green apples and hints of honeydew and kiwi.",86,Irony 2013 Small Lot Reserve Chardonnay (Monterey County)
"Beeswax, light yellow melon, yellow peach and a touch of peach custard show on the nose of this blend of Grenache Blanc, Roussanne, Picpoul Blanc and Viognier. Lime zest and yellow pear dominate the palate, which is light, fresh, intriguingly textured and full of acidic sizzle.",91,Dubost 2015 Alexandrine White (Paso Robles)
"This is a smooth, rounded rosé made mainly from Négrette. Along with its youthful crispness, it also has a more creamy side and a crushed strawberry flavor, all lightened by balancing acidity.",85,Château Plaisance 2011 Rosé (Fronton)
"Coming from the relatively new but priming Kimsey Vineyard, this shows intoxicatingly rich yet never treacly aromas of ripe cantaloupe, ambrosia melon and peach-apple syrup. Glazed apples, walnut oil and orange bitters decorate the heavily layered and dense palate. Serve it with many varieties of cheese.",91,Zinke 2013 Roussanne (Ballard Canyon)
"The perfume of the Moscatel in this wine lingers satisfactorily, adding an exotic feel to what is otherwise a bright fruity wine. It is delicious to drink now as an apéritif.",85,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal 2016 JP Azeitão Moscatel Graudo-Fernão Pires White (Península de Setúbal)
"Apple, vanilla and a hint of sulfur is what you'll find on the nose of this consistently solid value-priced Cava. A slightly soft body and flavors of green herbs, melon and white pepper finish well.",87,Vins El Cep 2014 Kila Sparkling (Cava)
"Banrock Station's 2006 Shiraz is a throwback to the kind of super value Australian wines used to provide with more regularity. For $5, consumers get a decently textured, supple wine with plenty of forward blueberry and plum fruit and touches of chocolate and pepper. Look for it by the glass or buy it by the case for entertaining on a budget.",85,Banrock Station 2006 Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)
"This Chardonnay is one of the family-owned winery's workhorse bottlings, and it pulls its weight with finesse, showing light aromas of Pink Lady apple, grapefruit peel and almond on the nose. Lemon-lime acidity frames each sip, while grapefruit flavors meld with lemongrass and kaffir lime, finishing on riper stone fruit notes.",89,Gainey 2014 Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"This wine is tight, crisp with citrus flavors and intense acidity. It is developing into a refreshing, broader wine that will have a riper character. Wait until late 2017.",88,Château de Marsan 2016  Bordeaux Blanc
"Spice comes up in the nose and on the palate, punching up the fruit and bringing with it a nutty barrel-inflected base. Black cherry and blue plum cover the core fruit flavors, with a lovely sweet concentration dead center in the midpalate. This young wine is finely crafted and clearly built to age. Drink 2018 through 2028.",93,Furioso 2014 La Linea Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Heavily oaked up front, this smells of sweet spices, lactic berry fruits and hickory. The palate is fairly blocky and grabby, with resiny wood notes. Flavors of hickory and lactic berry match the nose on this oaky rendition of Malbec.",86,Kaiken 2014 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza)
"Blended from Syrah, Mourvèdre and the two Cabernets, Sauvignon and Franc, this wine feels bitter and acidic in the mouth. It's very tannic and overripe, with flavors of prunes.",80,Millésimé 2008 Scopire Red (Santa Ynez Valley)
"More like Zinfandel with its peppery, prickly mouthfeel, but not a bad wine for everyday purposes. It's dry and full-bodied and brisk, with blackberry, currant and herb flavors.",85,Oak Grove 2008 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Blackberry, violets, gingerbread, cola and cedar show on the great nose of this blend of 50% Grenache and 50% Syrah from the Fallbrook area north of San Diego. Complex flavors of incense and juniper spice up the backbone of blueberry and black plum, with a beef char component adding to the savory side.",91,2Plank 2013 Grenache-Syrah (South Coast)
"In so-called Penfolds years, when the stars align for the company, smart money is on the Bin series of wines like this Bin 407 Cabernet. It comes close to the luxury Bin 707 Cabernet in terms of quality, but at a much lower price, boasting ample body and velvety tannins. Hints of cedar, mint and mocha accent concentrated cassis and plum flavors. Drink now–2018.",92,Penfolds 2008 Bin 407 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia)
"Scoury and sweet in the mouth, this blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay has forward flavors of peaches, limes, oranges, honey and vanilla. With brisk acidity, it's a nice bubbly to drink now.",86,Korbel 2010 Natural Sparkling (Russian River Valley)
"Light and delicate, thist shows distant tones of fragrant fruit and tangy citrus. Its natural sweetness helps make the finish feel rich and generous.",87,Borgo Magredo NV Extra Dry  (Prosecco)
"Registering well over 16% abv, this blended Syrah nonetheless retains its complexity and avoids excesses of heat or barrel. In the blend are Mourvèdre and Merlot, adding some herbal highlights to the bright blueberry fruit flavors. This will benefit from another couple of years of bottle age.",88,:Nota Bene 2009 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The blend is almost equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc, with some Carmenet and Petit Verdot blended in for complexity. The wine is easy to like now for its dryness and elegance, despite relatively high alcohol. It shows California ripeness of fruit, with a smooth integration of oak. If there's a criticism, it's excessive softness. Drink up.",88,Niner 2010 Fog Catcher Red (Paso Robles)
"Pommery's style is soft and creamy, the richness coming from the dosage. But the wine is also elegant, everything in place, with a light, floating layer of Bartlett pears and light acidity. The soft finish could be fresher.",86,Pommery NV Brut Royal  (Champagne)
"No stuffing here, just thin berry and cherry fruit and a quick hit of chocolate.",84,San Juan Vineyards 2004 Red (Yakima Valley)
"A big wine with a nose defined by crushed coal and perfumed black fruit. The palate is plush and ripe, but also lively and pleasant. Tastewise, this is generous and defined by good berry, chocolate and herb flavors. Finishes with carob and cinnamon. Laudable New World Syrah, a k a Shiraz.",89,Ventisquero 2006 Grey Apalta Vineyards Shiraz (Colchagua Valley)
"An easy-drinking, sophisticated Sauvignon Blanc, very ripe in pineapples, oranges and kiwi fruit, but balanced with crisp acidity. A touch of new oak adds smoky creaminess. The single vineyard referenced on the label is in a warmer part of Napa Valley.",87,Maroon 2010 Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Sophisticated and subtle, this lovely wine expresses varietal elegance, with a bouquet of roses and raspberries to begin. The jumble of pretty fruits is framed with citrus peel and a dusting of chocolate.",91,Scott Paul 2013 La Paulée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Gritty berry and olive aromas are woodsy and a touch flat. This feels full and grabby, while flavors of tea, herbal blackberry, salt and roasted meat finish blackened and peppery, with a toasty element that gets more pronounced the longer this sits. Drink through 2022.",90,Valtravieso 2012 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"This is a strong, full-bodied rosé with ripe, jammy strawberry and raspberry flavors that finish off dry with fruity essence.",85,Taft Street 2012 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Pale straw in color with a faint touch of green, this wine has a nose of lemon blossom and freshly cut grass. Crisp, clean flavors of apple and lemon zest wash over the tongue, culminating in a burst of fresh acidity.",87,Puklavec & Friends 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Štajerska)
"This wine has a fine definition of minerality that's combined with tense structure. There is a hint of wood, a flavor of fresh-peeled apple and a taut, steely edge. Layers of acids mark the finish.",89,Jaffelin 2010  Puligny-Montrachet
"Aromas of lemon, white flower and white stone fruit lead the nose while the bright, juicy bright palate offers pear, peach and nectarine zest. A note of white almond caps off the finish.",87,Corte Mainente 2015 Cengelle  (Soave)
"Aromas of burnt orange peel, apricot, cinnamon and clove are accented by wild herb and nettle scents. This is full, resiny and borderline cloying in feel, while flavors of blow-torched caramel, peach, dried mango and oak finish honeyed and spicy, but also bitter. Drink this amber, mature wine now.",88,Telmo Rodríguez 2008 Molino Real Moscatel (Málaga)
"This is a tasty Pinot Noir, but it's not particularly characteristic of Doctor's Vineyard or Santa Lucia Highlands. It's soft, ripe and sweet, and while the raspberry, cherry and red currant flavors are balanced with acidity, the wine tastes like it could have been grown anywhere. Drink now.",86,Adelaida 2011 Vineyard Series Doctor's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Here's a gorgeous wine to pair with foie gras or pâté. A Riserva expression of Gewürztraminer, it opens with a bright golden color and segues to intense aromas of honey, candied peach, yellow rose, lemon curd and natural rubber. In the mouth, the wine is rich, opulent and long-lasting.",90,Cantina Cortaccia 2009 Brenntal Riserva Gewürztraminer (Alto Adige)
"This tilts the fruit emphasis away from peach and into pear, with a slight suggestion of vanilla cream. It's got medium weight and concentration, and it's supple, well integrated, and balanced for immediate consumption.",88,Winter's Hill 2015 Pinot Gris (Dundee Hills)
"Aromas of garden herbs, cherry and bittersweet chocolate lead to medium-bodied fruit and barrel flavors. The tannins are quite firm and need some time (hopefully) to soften. The oak seems to get out front.",88,Canoe Ridge 2014 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Fresh and full, with a deep berry nose, drying tannins and ample but not overdone oak. In the mouth, it's pretty solid, and the cherry and black-plum fruit is clean and tasty. It's on the stout side, with youthful acidity and a good deal of warmth to the smoky finish. From Poliziano.",88,Lohsa 2000  Morellino di Scansano
"This is a pretty wine, resplendent in jasmine and honeysuckle, with a light-bodied, integrated approach to highlighting fresh layers of apricot and peach. The viscosity is just right, focused and restrained, while the finish puts an exclamation point to the freshness of fruit.",92,Lawer 2014 Betsy's Vineyard Viognier (Knights Valley)
"Smoky cherry and the slightest whiff of bacon make for an appetizing proposition. The palate is lively, peppery and full of juicy black and red cherries. The tannins have some grip and are in tune with the freshness. This is lively, just medium-bodied and invigorating.",89,Hillinger 2013 Hill 1 Red (Burgenland)
"This Riesling is slightly sweet, but it's balanced by crisp acidity. The tangerine, green apple and peach flavors have a honeyed finish.",84,Kendall-Jackson 2009 Vintner's Reserve Riesling (Monterey County)
"The smoky, peppery aromas and smoky, pomegranate flavors may be atypical, but the wine is well-balanced and enjoyable to drink.",86,Peirano 2012 The Heritage Collection Tempranillo (Lodi)
"Reduced prune aromas are rubbery, herbal and not fully convincing. On the palate, this is gritty, tannic and tight, with tomatoey acidity. Oaky grapy flavors are compact, while graphite is noted on a finish that's weighted down by bulky tannins.",89,Señorío de Cuzcurrita 2011  Rioja
"Icarus, in Greek myth, got too close to the sun. So did this wine from Icaria. It's not bad, but simply overripe. Has a sweet taste of raisins, in addition to the sweet smokiness from oak. Drink now.",85,Icaria 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Aromas of underbrush, baked earth, oak, coffee, mature dark-skinned berry and a whiff of eucalyptus lead the nose. The firm, straightforward palate offers tart cherry, espresso, toast and menthol alongside fine-grained tannins.",88,Coppo 2012 Camp du Rouss  (Barbera d'Asti)
"Grapefruit flavor is the key to this attractive, fruity wine. Crisp and lightly herbaceous, it is fresh while also having a rounder background. Drink now, but better to wait until early 2016.",85,Domaine D'en Ségur 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Côtes du Tarn)
"A complex style of Muscadet, this starts with crisp citrus flavors and a tight structure. It has density and a fine, nervy edge that offers a delicate perfumed character as well as the possibility of aging. Drink from 2014. Screwcap.",90,Château de la Ragotiere 2012 Les Frères Couillaud Vieilles Vignes Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"This perfumed wine offers plenty (perhaps too much) acidity and red fruits, with only light tannins. That makes for a fruity wine, fresh and ready to drink now and until 2018.",85,Derey Frères 2012 Les Vignes Marie  (Marsannay)
"This is a dry, richly flavored and well-structured wine. A complex, spicy, earthy, cherrylike bouquet accompanies saturated flavors of currant, black cherry and pomegranate spiced with hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. It's not too full bodied and has good balance that comes from firm acidity and tannins.",89,Occasio 2012 Ghielmetti Vineyard Syrah (Livermore Valley)
"Dark purple flowers and tart boysenberry paste show on the nose of this intensely concentrated wine, alongside pencil shavings, bay lead and a lot of iron minerality. More bay leaf and pine needle show on the herbally full and texturally grippy palate, giving minty spice to the dark fruit flavors.",93,Tantara 2015 Dierberg Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"Dusty, earthy, soil and mineral notes lend complexity to sprightly lemon and honey aromas on this sweet, concentrated Riesling. The palate reverberates with tangy citrus flavors that cap off on a lingering kiss of honeysuckle.",91,Louis Guntrum 2012 Oppenheim Herrenberg Auslese Riesling (Rheinhessen)
"Superfresh raspberry aromas, rich cherry flavors and a texture that helps all that fruit cling to the palate make this medium-bodied wine compelling. It feels firm and structured due to good acidity, which supports the surprisingly bright and layered fruit flavors very well.",90,Uvaggio 2014 Barbera (Lodi)
"Made by 30-ish Roberta Borghese high above Manzano, which also happens to be the chair manufacturing capital of Italy, this is a perfect example of how good Tocai can be. The aromas are honey and grapefruit-orange. After an intro of crisp acidity, the same flavors appear and persist on the medium body. Match this one with a good seafood risotto.",91,Ronchi di Manzano 1999 Superiore Tocai (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"This is a big, voluptuous Pinot, solidly in the Garys' style, but it possesses a delicate silkiness despite the size. In its extreme youth, the wine is all primary fruit and oak, with flavors of cherries, black raspberries, red licorice, cola and smoky vanilla. It feels broad and obvious, in the way of a young wine. However, 1-3 years in the bottle should bring out complexity.",91,Vision Cellars 2006 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Dark blue-purple in color, this is a breezy, giving wine on the palate, fresh and light in blueberry preserves and soft layers of integrated oak and tannin. It finishes smooth and with a hint of chocolate.",88,Napa Cellars 2013 Classic Collection Winemaker Series Malbec (Napa Valley)
"Dark purple on the pour, this is a big, rich, Shiraz-style Syrah, dense in blackberries, black currants, grilled bacon on oak. It's tannic and dry, yet ripe with fruit. Very high alcohol gives it some heat that calls for barbecue.",87,Moonstone 2010 Syrah (Paso Robles)
"This Tempranillo-Cabernet blend begins with scratchy, earthy aromas of moss, leather and herbal red fruits. It's alert and lively in the mouth, with strawberry, plum, raspberry and citrusy flavors. The finish hollows out and shows good length and a light structure.",86,Bodega Otto Bestué 2009 Finca Rableros Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon (Somontano)
"Light salmon in color, this herbal rosé dances on the palate with a slight effervescence and 5% residual sugar. It offers a bouquet of robust red fruit and rose petal aromas, and saw no oak.",88,Ty Caton 2013 Rosé of Syrah (Sonoma Valley)
"In a departure from the fuller, riper style exhibited last vintage, this edition of Barbaresco Santo Stefano shows thorny, brambly elements of white cherry and forest floor. In the mouth, it shows tight astringency and not too much heft or supporting density. Drink after 2015.",89,Castello di Neive 2008 Santo Stefano  (Barbaresco)
"Vanilla and toasted almond aromas evolve into a scent of tarte tatin. Full bodied, with warm alcohol, this shows medium fruit concentration. The acidity is borderline in its balance, leaning to flabiness. The tactile heat on the medium finish is distracting.",84,Vignobles Garrigae 2010 Seigneurie de Peyrat Tradition Chardonnay-Viognier (Pays d'Oc)
"Even Cabernet Sauvignon, that defiantly international variety, takes on a Portuguese character. This has that dark chocolate, high acidity and dry, but juicy character that marks so many Portuguese reds. It also has a more unfortunate volatility that is just too prominent.",85,Companhia das Quintas 2005 Quinta da Pancas Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon Cabernet Sauvignon (Estremadura)
"A good, basic wine, this has a mix of fruity and vegetal aromas, tart cherry and watermelon flavors, firm texture with moderate tannins, medium body and a slightly astringent finish.",84,Cambridge & Sunset 2013 California Series Pinot Noir (California)
"Oak and matchstick are the early aromas on this barrel-heavy SB. The palate is smooth, mellow and a bit flaccid. Toasty, spicy flavors lead a mix of green herb, citrus and tropical fruit notes, while the finish offers residual woodspice but not much kick.",88,Lapostolle 2013 Cuvée Alexandre Las Kuras Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Cachapoal Valley)
"This successful riserva displays opulence and a bold, modern style that focuses on bright cherry and savory spice aromas. The wine is loaded with density and richness, and combines a ripe soft feel with a lively berries on the finish.",94,Collosorbo 2006 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"The winemaking efforts of Lazio (the region that houses the Italian capital, Rome) are slowly being noticed thanks to an admittedly small group of quality-minded producers. This Syrah shows ripe fruit and soft roundness with elements of prune, coffee and cherry liqueur.",87,Cantine Lupo 2010 Syranto Syrah (Lazio)
"A blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot, this bold wine features aromas of spiced plum, blackcurrant, leather and a hint of coconut. On the palate, assertive tannins support the mature blackberry, espresso and licorice flavors.",90,Feudo Principi di Butera 2012 Symposio Red (Terre Siciliane)
"Fermented in open lagars, this wine has a dense, almost dry and beautifully sculpted character. It's a solid, dark as well as juicy wine that's superripe yet kept in check by the powerful tannins. Age this wine for many years; don't drink before 2018.",93,Casa da Passarella 2010 Villa Oliveira Touriga Nacional (Dão)
"Pressed rose, slightly dusty mineral shadings, spice and black fruit make up the bouquet of this elegant, harmonious wine. This expression is astringent and firm, with bright acidity and a solid tannic backbone. Let it soften with more cellar aging.",93,Terralsole 2006 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Herb, spice, wild berry and wood aromas set up a round palate that's bigger than medium but not huge in size. Definitive Carmenère flavors of herbs, wild berry and spiced plum finish with moderate bitterness and tannic support.",88,Casa Silva 2012 Los Lingues Vineyard Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"The 2010 La Petite Chapelle is firmly structured and tannic, but presents attractive aromas of earth, roasted meat and cedar, rounded out by savory flavors of black olive and espresso. Give it another couple of years in the cellar.",90,Paul Jaboulet Aîné 2010 La Petite Chapelle  (Hermitage)
"Stalky, leathery berry aromas are a bit lacking in purity. This feels choppy, while stalky, lightly green berry flavors finish with herbal shadings and resiny oak.",84,Viña Eguía 2013  Rioja
"From the Vinho Verde subregion of Monção and Melgaço, this intense, bone-dry wine captures the richness of Alvarinho while not losing sight of its fresh lemon and crisp apple side. It has a tight texture that suggests the wine is still young, so drink from late 2016.",91,Anselmo Mendes 2014 Muros Antigos Alvarinho (Vinho Verde)
"Exceptionally ripe, concentrated mountain fruit as well as hard tannins characterize this fresh, young Cabernet. Through the tannic astringency, intense flavors of black currants, dark chocolate and the sweet sap of oak shine through. Needs time. Hold until 2016 and see how it's doing.",94,Terra Valentine 2010 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District)
"Great price for a Cabernet this smooth and tasty. Shows appealing blackberry and cherry flavors, with a sweet, smoky touch of oak. All five classic Bordeaux varieties constitute the blend.",88,Murphy-Goode 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Cinsault dominant, with Grenache and Rolle (or Vermentino), this is an enjoyable sipper of tart cherry and strawberry, with a delicate blossom note lingering underneath. Pair this with a some relaxation on a porch on a hot summer day.",87,McPherson 2015 Les Copains Dry Rosé (Texas)
"White-fruit aromas, brine and clam shell notes get this Albariño going. The mouthfeel is full and lemony. Flavors of pickled, briny citrus and nectarine carry onto the finish. This is at its best now; in 2014 it will not be so good.",85,Ramón Bilbao 2012 Valiñas Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"This huge, rich wine is great Grüner Veltliner. Despite the alcohol, Rupert Summerer has managed to keep the intense freshness, the lifted, crisp pear flavors and the exuberant pepper in control. Impressive.",91,Summerer 2006 Käferberg Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"According to Brigitte Roch, this was an exceptional year for the domaine. With such huge concentration, heavy black tannins, fine acidity and hugely ripe fruit, it is hard to disagree. This wine, made using an old-fashioned hand-operated basket press, is full of power, yet has an astonishing elegance.",93,Domaine Clusel-Roch 1999  Côte Rôtie
"Blending Encruzado and Malvasia Fina, this lightly wood-aged wine is rich, stylish and full of young fruit flavors. Green plums, apricots and a squeeze of lemon all give their bright character to the palate. There is a firm, mineral texture that promises some aging; drink from 2017.",89,Magnum Vinhos 2014 Ribeiro Santo White (Dão)
"Wonderfully rich, with a lush and luxurious mid-palate, this young wine is packed with berries and cassis, elevated with some citrusy acidity, and deep with notes of gravel and smoke. This wine is still hard and unresolved. Give it a lot of decanting, or just age for a few years.",92,Gorman 2007 The Bully Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"Showing as much freshness and acidity as the hallmark spice of a Gewürztraminer, this is a white-fruit-dominant wine, poised and elegant, with a touch of minerality. Keep for 2–3 years.",92,André Blanck et ses Fils 2010 Schlossberg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"An impressive Montsant blend of Grenache, Cabernet and Syrah with a purple color and friendly black fruit aromas. Not overly complex but deeply drawn and balanced. The plum, fresh raisin and blackberry flavors are smooth and structured, and overall flavor and liveliness are key attributes. Drink now through 2012.",90,Cellers Sant Rafel 2007 Solpost Fresc Red (Montsant)
"The wine is rich with layers of wood aging and ripe tropical fruits. Pineapple and peach dominate, cut with some attractive lime acidity. Full of the fruit of the vintage with a texture of serious intent, the wine is tight, tangy and likely to age well. Drink from 2022.",95,Château Latour-Martillac 2014  Pessac-Léognan
"Hints of ceder, bramble and smoked nuts add savory complexity to this ripe, full-bodied Syrah full of succulent black cherry and berry flavors. It's approachable yet elegant, framed by soft, feathery tannins and a zesty spray of cranberry acidity add. Drink now through 2018.",90,Chateau Lafayette Reneau 2013 Syrah (Finger Lakes)
"As you might infer from the name, this tastes sweet. It appeals to consumers who enjoy the trend of sugary red wines. You could almost drink it as a dessert sipper, with its candied blackberry and cherry flavors.",83,Jellybean Wines 2010 Candy-Apple Red Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Honey gold in color, this wine made from an indigenous Georgian grape has a bouquet of white cherries and lavender. Tart flavors of honeydew melon and white plum persist into the soft floral finish.",84,Gotsa Family Wines 2015 Dry Unfiltered Chinuri (Georgia)
"Light, clear and crisp, this is a soft, silky wine from several vineyard sources within the appellation, robust and rustic on the finish. Along the way, it exudes exotic hits of dark cherry, cola and vanilla, finding balance among the fruit and lively acidity, providing body without too much heat.",93,Papapietro Perry 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This cheerful, screw cap Valpolicella offers crisp raspberry and cherry flavors over a lean, compact body. It's a lightweight, easy-going wine that would pair with soups or sandwiches.",85,Speri 2007 La Roverina  (Valpolicella)
"A dusting of crushed slate and saffron accents this zesty lime and honey kissed Kabinett. It's dancingly light on the palate, but concentrated with swirls of marmalade and orange-peel flavors that extend through a long finish. Drink now through 2025.",90,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch) 2014 Thanisch Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"Dark hay in color with a concentration of oak on the nose, the palate retains that richness of nutty almond and apple pie, finding a balance that betrays the heavier implications of the initial aromas. On the finish it offers a lightness of being, as well as a touch of perfume.",88,Rally Point Wines 2013 Limited Production Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"From a 100-acre estate formerly the home of the Counts of Provence, this wine has a great fruity character allied to a more mineral texture. With richness and vanilla flavors it is both packed with raspberry fruits and showing structure. Keep until the end of 2014.",90,Château Réal Martin 2013 Perle de Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"There's lots of sweetness in this polished wine, with pretty orange, peach, vanilla and honeysuckle flavors. It would benefit from greater acidity, though, as it's a bit soft.",86,V. Sattui 2011 Riesling (Anderson Valley)
"This producer is making some fantastic best-bang-for-your-buck Cabernets. This one is an excellent case in point, a sultry, sophisticated and elegant take on the variety, with memorable characteristics of chocolate, raspberry and dried herb in the form of bay leaf. Structured and ready for the table, it's a standout.",94,JD 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)
"This wine demonstrates Viognier's exotic side, with flavors of tropical fruit, tangerine, white flower, vanilla, honey and spice. Despite the richness, it's dry and the acidity is mouthwatering. Don't serve this too cold, and pair it with Asian fare that's slightly sweet.",88,Fess Parker 2011 Viognier (Santa Barbara County)
The richness of vintage 2003  shows in this wine's layers of dried fruits on top of sweet tannins and a dense concentration. There is some licorice flavor arriving as the wine matures.,88,Château Puy-Servain 2003 Vieilles Vignes  (Montravel)
"A darker shade of yellow in the glass, this bottling from an Alban clone turns out to be a lighter, more delicate take on Roussanne. Touches of saffron, wax and toasted nuts show on the nose, and that light nutty character does extend to the sip. But the palate also offers apricot and lemon rinds against well measured acidity and a compelling minerality that combines white rocks and hot sand flavors.",92,Big Basin 2014 Homestead Block Roussanne (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"While delicious now with flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola and oak, all showered with tart, citrusy acidity, this wine also has a great future. Give it 6–8 years to evolve in the bottle for further complexity.",92,Talley 2011 Rincon Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"Here's a bright, fruity red that delivers blue flower, wild cherry, black raspberry and tart red currant sensations. Vibrant acidity and round tannins give this a delightful, easy-drinking quality.",86,Fattoria Bini 2013  Chianti
"There's not much pulp or grit here, but this easygoing (and well-priced) Chardonnay does offer distant aromas of stone fruit and honey. Citrus flavors and sharp acidity best describe the mouthfeel.",84,Moletto 2007 Chardonnay (Veneto Orientale)
"Coming from a who's who of Red Mountain vineyards, the inaugural release of this brand from Duckhorn Vineyards offers generous notes of dark coffee, espresso bean, dark cherries, sage and vanilla, with a pleasing interplay between fruit and barrel (64% new French). The plum and coffee flavors are restrained in style, with well-integrated tannins.",90,Canvasback 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"Focused flavors of mint and black currant come together in this distinctive Cabernet. There's a touch of oak too that adds spice, and the overall character is elegant. The wine will benefit from some aging to further integrate its parts.",87,Thelema 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch)
"This is a light and fresh wine with soft tannins and appealing red berry fruits. It offers attractive acidity at the end, a balanced wine that is ready to drink.",86,Gérard Charvet 2014 La Réserve d'Amélie  (Moulin-à-Vent)
"Unlike Marisco's 2015 The Ned Late Harvest, this is a botrytis-affected wine, featuring a darker color and more complex flavors. The aromas suggest Earl Grey tea and honey; the flavors resemble caramel-drizzled orange segments. A slightly bitter citrus-pith note marks the finish, providing balance.",91,Marisco Vineyards 2014 A Sticky End Late Harvest Waihopai Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"For a few years running we've been singing the praises of Abadal, a label from Catalonia that has been producing hit upon hit. This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah from the excellent 2001 vintage is in super form; the wine has a ripe, integrated nose of cocoa, dark fruit and chocolate, while the palate is bold and loaded with vivacious cherry and blackberry flavors. From front to center to back, this wine has it all going in the right direction. Good now through 2012.",92,Masies d'Avinyo 2001 Abadal Reserva Red (Pla de Bages)
"Aromas of crushed berry, fragrant purple flower, dark spice and a balsamic note almost jump out of the glass. The full-bodied structured palate delivers dried black cherry, raspberry compote, licorice and a hint of clove set against a backbone of firm, refined tannins. Drink 2018–2030.",92,Casanuova delle Cerbaie 2010 Vigna Montosoli Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"This reserve is actually one of the winery's less expensive Chardonnays. It's full, fruity and forward, with a lush mix of pineapple, peaches and tropical fruits, buttressed with juicy acids and highlights of toasted nuts. Thoroughly delicious, and ready for immediate enjoyment.",92,Domaine Serene 2012 Evenstad Reserve Chardonnay (Dundee Hills)
"This 100% Lagrein boasts alluring aromas of blackberry, tilled earth and a whiff of baking spice. The ripe luscious palate doles out black plum, cassis, star anise and a note of ground pepper alongside supple tannins. It will offer fine sipping over the next few years. Drink through 2020.",91,Terlan 2013 Porphyr Riserva Lagrein (Alto Adige)
"This is a fascinating wine, just by reading the list of grapes in the blend: Duras, Braucol, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon. The first two, local grapes, lend a rough edge of tannins, which demands aging, but also give flavors of herbs, wild thyme and solid meaty character. The roundness comes from the ripe Syrah, which adds perfume.",90,Domaine Rotier 2004 Renaissance Red (Gaillac)
"This tastes soft and simple now, although considering the vineyard sourcing, that could be misleading. There's a core of raspberry and cherry fruit, with intriguing forest notes of dried pine needles and mushrooms. The acidity is just right, neither bright nor too soft. The wine isn't showing much now, but could be a sleeper. Try after 2015.",88,Saxon Brown 2009 Durell Vineyard Hayfield Block Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Les Collines, Minick, Old Stones, SJR, Oldfield and Olsen provide the fruit for this wine. It's perfumed and leads with aromas of violets, dried herbs, olive and earth, with raspberry notes emerging over time. The palate is all about texture and elegance, while lingering on the finish.",93,Gramercy 2013 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"In the house style of this producer this wine is soft and fruity. Its strawberry aroma is followed by a gentle, ripe wine with red berries and balanced acidity. The wine is ready to drink.",89,Canard-Duchêne NV Charles VII Grande Cuvée de la Rose Brut Rosé  (Champagne)
"Dusty white-fruit and citrus aromas are more than adequate but nonspecific. This feels round, with salty citrus flavors. A modest finish is doing its best to stay fresh and vital.",86,Autoritas 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley)
"There is no lack of dark, smoky flavors in this 100% varietal bottling. Leather, cola, cassis, tar, burnt rubber and smoke all whirl about, with an underlying impression of dried leaves. The listed flavors may not stir you with longing when named in this way, but taken all together and accompanied by a bowl of beef stew, they will satisfy.",88,Silvan Ridge 2013 Tempranillo (Rogue Valley)
"Bold, full-bodied and polished, this opens with aromas that recall violets, ripe plums, red berries and cake spices. The smooth, savory palate delivers juicy Morello cherries, black raspberries, cinnamon, mocha, white pepper and a hint of mint. Generous, velvety tannins provide the framework and add finesse.",93,San Rustico 2010  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"The ripest of Breggo's '06 Pinots, the Ferrington stars red fruits, such as cherries, raspberries and persimmons, mingling with intricate Asian spices and a hint of mocha. Absolutely delicious, this silky, complex wine is pure pleasure.",93,Breggo 2006 Ferrington Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Roasted cherries, scorched earth, burnt coffee and dark brown sugar all mingle on the nose and palate of this wine. It's a bit rustic and old school, dusty and a bit dry on the finish. Try it in 2–3 years.",88,Pierre Amadieu 2010 Terroir d'Exception La Paillousse Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape)
"This gorgeous super Tuscan opens with inky dark concentration and bright aromas of dark cherry and prune. It feels soft, lush and creamy in the mouth. Pair it with stewed game meat.",90,Tenuta di Biserno 2011 Insoglio del Cinghiale Red (Toscana)
"Racy berry aromas come with a hint of oaky cinnamon. This feels raw, tannic and dense. Flavors of roasted plum, dry oak, savory spices and grilled meat finish firm and taste toasty. Drink through 2022.",89,Tionio 2013  Ribera del Duero
"Black cherry and black raspberry notes meet crushed mint, wet slate, Mediterranean spice, blistered tomato and Kalamata olive on the nose of this estate bottling. Lively herbs including marjoram and thyme mark the palate, then the wine warms toward tarter cherry, cranberry and turned earth on the midpalate. It finishes with aromatically lifting menthol notes.",92,Presqu'ile 2013 Presqu'ile Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"A deeply colored wine, reveling in the richness of 2007, a powerhouse of berry fruits, black plums and a layer of soft wood tannins. It certainly has plenty of ripe fruit, but the smoothness of the wine is the key here, a chocolate smoothness that wraps around the powerful fruit.",88,J. Portugal Ramos 2007 Marquês de Borba Red (Alentejo)
"Here's an earthy, dark red with soft tannins that's perfectly approachable now. Menthol, blackberries, cassis and leathery spice fill the nose and mouth, with moderate weight and a medium finish. A nice choice for grilled or herb-crusted lamb chops.",86,Graham Beck 2008 Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (Western Cape)
"Gritty aromas of asphalt, green peppercorn, saucy berry and hard spices precede a tight palate with grating tannins. This is oak-heavy, with sweet-and-saucy red-berry flavors. An oaky, tomatoey finish is rubbery in feel.",86,Viña Tarapacá 2011 Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"Rustic and sweet, a simple Syrah with flavors of candied berry, black pepper and sassafras.",84,Cameron Hughes 2010 Lot 292 Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)
"This full-bodied wine packs a lot of punch in terms of mouthfeel and flavor. The color is extremely dark, and the flavors resemble dark chocolate, black cherries and baking spices. It is dry in style, with lip-smacking, nicely astringent tannins that counterbalance all that richness.",92,Eruption 2013 Volcano Ridge Vineyard Red (High Valley)
"This is a very correct and straightforward Aglianico that delivers all the basic promises of the variety. There's firmness and deep structure here, but the wine is also flush with chewy fruit, tobacco, leather and dusty mineral tones on the close.",88,Mastroberardino 2008 Aglianico (Campania)
"Light in color, this shows red cherry and strawberry flavors. The tannins are soft, creating an easy wine that is ready to drink.",84,Barton & Guestier 2011  Beaujolais
"This brisk Pinot offers a rich array of raspberries and cherries, with oak influences. It's bright in acidity, with a dry finish, and the alcohol is relatively low. It tastes a little rude and rustic now, but could develop some bottle complexity over the next 5–6 years.",87,Kokomo 2011 Peters Vineyard Winemaker's Reserve Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Shafer's Merlot is very vintage driven, and this 2009 shows exceptionally ripe, sweet cherry and blueberry-pie flavors, enriched by 75% new French oak that brings toasty, spicy vanilla notes. It's flashy, opulent and delicious, but a bit forward and warm. Drink now.",90,Shafer 2009 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Very perfumed, this wine is exotic and rich with fruit, but also remarkably dry. Drink from 2017.",88,Domaine Sorin 2011 Red (Bandol)
"A big Pinot Noir, darkly colored and full-bodied in the mouth. The depth of fruit is impressive, packing a solid core of black cherries and plums. Might gain some bottle notes over the next 4–6 years.",90,Heart O' The Mountain 2008 Triple Seven Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"A blend of 85% Petite Sirah and 15% Petit Verdot, this is a mouthful of intense, smoky blueberry and leather. Licorice and tar intermingle on the midpalate with the finish decisively earthy in graphite.",86,Michael David 2011 Petite Petit Red (Lodi)
"Rodney Strong's Symmetry is more tannic than their '05 Reserve Cab, and it also has more complex flavors from being a blend of all five Bordeaux varieties. It shows a deep streak of dark stone fruits, black and blue berries, cassis, carob, violets and smoky cedar. Fine and elegant now, and it should develop nicely over the next decade.",94,Rodney Strong 2005 Symmetry Red Meritage (Alexander Valley)
"Touched by wood, this is a warm wine with soft plum flavors and light tannins. It could age well for 4–5 years, but is ready to drink now.",86,Domaine d'Eole 2011 Red (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence)
"The vineyard source for this tasty wine is farmed by a fifth-generation Japanese-American originally from California's Central Valley. Tightly wound in oak and tannin, it opens pleasantly to reveal a wealth of rose petals, earth and youthful ripe, dark cherry. With moderate acidity and body, it lingers on the palate.",91,Spell 2014 Umino Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Dramatically dark, staining the glass with glycerine streaks, this wine  unabashedly celebrates its hot country origins. Considerable tannins  frame a core of berry fruit, with a zingy, peppery note that stimulates  the taste buds, but acidity is soft. At the same time, it retains a  rustic character typical of the varietal.",86,Imagery 2000 Artist Collection Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)
"Fresh, bright and super lively on the palate, this very attractive Prosecco Superiore would pair with bite-sized quiche with cheese and ham or mini-pizza appetizers. Citrus and green melon are backed by acidity and tight, steely perlage.",87,Merotto NV Bareta Brut  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"This wine shows hints of tar or rubber when first poured, so decant it for best effect. Once past those, berry and citrus aromas and flavors emerge, lingering on the long, mocha-tinged finish.",89,Les Vignerons de Tavel 2016 Les Lauzeraies  (Tavel)
"This white blend is comprised of 50% Chardonnay and 50% Gewürztraminer. It has delightful aromas of white flowers, honeysuckle and lime pith and flavors of jasmine, lemongrass and dried rosemary in the mouth. The finish is clean, crisp and refreshing.",89,Ross-idi 2014 Nikolaevo Unison Chardonnay-Gewürtztraminer White
"This well-structured effort is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, and it bears nuances of herb and briar. There is a balanced mix of plum and black cherry flavors that are wreathed in smoke and coffee notes, which resolve into firm but smooth tannins.",89,Owen Roe 2010 Red Willow Vineyard 1973 Block Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley)
"A very nice Bordeaux-style blend ready to drink now. It's soft, dry and complex, offering waves of blackberries, black currants, blueberries, cedar and herbs, wrapped into fine, rich tannins.",87,Cameron Hughes 2005 Lot 119 Meritage (Alexander Valley)
"This is an inaugural release of this variety from the Mount George Vineyard in cool Coombsville, granted AVA status in 2011. Juicy and soft in blackberry and stone fruit, the wine is cradled by generous tannins and herbal tones. Full bodied, its sinewy structure suggests it would benefit from more time in bottle; cellar through 2022.",91,Silverado 2012 GEO Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville)
"Hot and fiery, this red is meaty, spicy and herbal on the nose. The disjointed palate shows baked, spicy plum and herbal flavors. A smoky, meaty flavor and forced, creamy-oak tone carry the finish.",85,Santa Alba 2013 Reserve Carmenère (Curicó Valley)
"Fenestra's whites tend to taste a little sweet, which helps in the case of this Kabinett-style Riesling. It's very fruity and floral, and the ripe citrus, peach, diesel and honeysuckle flavors are balanced by crisp acidity.",86,Fenestra 2007 White Riesling (Arroyo Seco)
"This is intense in both color and aromatics. Potent scents of black fruit, animal hide, graphite and bold oak are at the fore. It feels pure, lush and well built, with dark flavors of blackberry, chocolate, toast and spice. Coffee and pepper are the prime finishing flavors; drink now through 2015.",92,Peique 2007 Viñedos Viejos Mencía (Bierzo)
"Hugely concentrated wine, full of new toasty wood flavors, its structure packed with tannins. That said, there is also a weight of black currant fruit, richly jammy, adding to the sense of power.",90,Château Tour des Gendres 2008 Moulin des Dames Red (Côtes de Bergerac)
"One of the best Syrahs at this price point in California. It's lush in blackberries, blueberries, chocolate and sweet oak, with a creamy mouthfeel. Drink now for freshness.",92,Rusack 2009 Ballard Canyon Estate Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"This is rich with fruit as well as a mineral, tangy texture. A ripe character comes from the delicious raspberry fruit and acidity (60% Grenache, 40% Cinsault). The aftertaste is fresh, while remaining textured and ready for food.",90,Château de Calavon 2014 Rosé (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence)
"A bit on the light-bodied side, but nice and dry, with plenty of personality. The flavors are of briary, brambly wild blackberries, raspberries and blueberries, dusted with black pepper and cinnamon.",86,Maddalena 2011 Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"This is an attractive, fast-maturing wine with soft tannins, ripe fruits and a juicy, perfumed acidity. It has considerable weight and concentration, along with firm red-plum and berry flavors. It's an elegant wine that should be drunk from 2017.",91,Bouchard Aîné & Fils 2011 Cuvée Signature  (Clos de la Roche)
"One of the “12 Zins of Lodi 2014,” it was chosen in a judging by the Lodi Winegrape Commission to represent the region's finest. The deep red-black color is saturated to the rim. Deep, evocative aromas lead to ripe cherry, boysenberry, chocolate and nutmeg flavors that echo on the finish. The texture is full and smooth.",92,Za Zin 2010 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi)
"Not a bad wine but definitely overoaked for what it is. The nose bleeds resin and faux milk chocolate, while the chunky, herbal palate offers pretty good mouthfeel but also roasted berry flavors. Menthol and herbal notes rise up on the hot finish.",84,Simone 2008 Special Reserve Carmenère (Maule Valley)
"In line with the winery style, this is lean and tight on the palate, a bit of a citrus laser blending lime and grapefruit. Try it with raw seafood dishes, like a fluke carpaccio or ceviche.",89,Shaw and Smith 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills)
"Delicate flavors of baking spices like cinnamon, allspice and ginger light up this very dry, firm-textured bubbly. Vivid acidity keeps it light and lively. Plenty of citrus and green apple notes and a refreshing dryness make the mouth water.",91,Schramsberg 2010 Blanc de Noirs Sparkling (North Coast)
"An awkward, unbalanced wine. Has green, vegetal flavors alongside sweet candied raspberries.",82,Cline 2009 Zinfandel (California)
"Striking and sincere Sauvignon Blanc. One whiff, one taste and one swish across the palate and you'll know that this is elevated stuff. For starters, the bouquet delivers honest bell pepper, melon, passion fruit and apple aromas; and along with the fruit there's nuance, structure and balancing herbal notes. Full, long and regal. Drink now to capture this wine's powerful essence.",91,Cono Sur 2008 20 Barrels Limited Edition Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"This fruity, off-dry Riesling is sourced from the Lawrence Vineyards on the Royal Slope. Despite the relatively cool climate site, it has a ton of very ripe fruit, peaches and apricots. There is a slight bitterness, perhaps from skin contact, in the finish.",87,Finn Hill 2012 The Gnome Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Aromas bring notes of vanilla bean, black cherry and cassis, along with light volatility. The palate packs a big punch of fruit and barrel flavors, with vanilla notes running high throughout, causing some distraction.",88,Dumas Station 2013 Minnick Hills Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This is a lovely example of Ventoux Grenache (80%), with 15% Syrah and 5% a blend of Mourvèdre, Cinsaut and Carignan. It's slightly warm in style and supple in structure, but with hints of dried flowers and licorice to give verve and dimension to the black cherry fruit. Drink now and over the next few years.",90,Martinelle 2009 Red (Ventoux)
"This wine's light and refreshing nose cuts between orange-blossom ripeness, lime-juice sharpness, chalky minerality and a touch of milk fat. There is good energy on the palate, powered by tart green apple rinds and citrus zest.",88,Fess Parker 2014 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County)
"This is the winery's big, barrel-fermented Chard. Even under all that creamy, smoky oak and leesy richness, those Edna Valley acids shine through, making the lime, kiwi and pineapple flavors bright, and leading to a zingy, crisp finish.",91,Tolosa 2005 1772 Edna Ranch Chardonnay (Edna Valley)
"A detailed wine, with notes of wet slate, apricot and pear alongside high toned spices. It drinks off dry, with ripe stone-fruit flavors balanced by crisp acidity, leading to a lingering finish.",90,Cave Spring 2011 Cave Spring Vineyard Estate Bottled VQA Riesling (Beamsville Bench)
"Tart cherry, tobacco and leather present themselves on the nose, leading the way to fruit forward flavors of red plum and cherry pie backed by pleasant hints of vanilla.",85,Cramele Recas 2014 Dreamfish Cabernet Sauvignon (Viile Timisului)
"Just 75% Cabernet, the rest a mix of Merlot, Syrah and Petit Verdot, this turns generic, with bitter berry flavors. There's a little toastiness backing the tannins but a short finish, overall.",85,Mercer 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The use of 100% Syrah gives a deep pink color that borders on purple. Aromas are rather strong too, with the flaky, buttered crust of a hot cherry pie running into the more bitter elements of citrus rinds. Those characters play leading roles on the palate as well, cherry candy toying with just-ripe grapefruit, providing tensions that keeps the sipping interesting. Just 72 cases produced.",87,Solminer 2013 Linus Rosé (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Ripe berry, plum, milk chocolate, leather, truffle and balsamic notes lead the nose. The dense palate weaves together crushed black cherry, baking spices, mint and white pepper alongside underlying mineral notes. It's already accessible so enjoy now–2020.",90,Sorelle De Nicola 2009 Bordini Vigna di Montesommo Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"Extremely seductive aromas of caramel, toasted oak, beach campfire, blackberry, black cherry and thin mint cookies welcome the nose to this bottling. The palate is equally complex and inviting, with milk chocolate, cherry pie, smoked pork and dried oregano flavors, tongue-tantalizing all around.",93,Monticello Vineyards 2012 Jefferson Cuvee Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Ripe, soft red cherry fruits are linked to a light texture and soft tannins in this ready-to-drink wine. The final acidity brings out the attractive fruitiness of this fresh wine. Drink now.",87,Jean Reverdy et Fils 2013 Les Villots  (Sancerre)
"Boasting cherry-vanilla cola and ripe fruit notes, this is a young, fresh wine that shows hints of savory tones on the palate. Drink now.",86,Pali 2012 Riviera Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Pure notes of Conference pear define both nose and palate. The body is textured and concentrated but remains slender. Fresh acidity, dryness and slightly bitter pitch make for a beautiful, poised outline. Purity and length stand out.",91,Domaine Roland Schmitt 2015 Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Truly classy, with a deep nose of earth, tar and pure berry fruit. This wine delivers both the sweetness and ripeness that it should along with some rugged, spicy edges. The finish is big and packed with licorice, spice and pepper. A fine wine. Hold until 2006.",92,Collosorbo 1999  Brunello di Montalcino
"Fillaboa ranks among the most consistent high-quality producers of Albariño. This vintage delivers fresh lemon, melon and apple aromas. The palate is pointed but with some leesy richness and flavors of lemon, lime and stones. Finishes in mouthwatering style, with pineapple essence as the final act.",90,Fillaboa 2007 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"An ill-defined wine, closed and tight, this just hints at fruit without showing much intensity. The aftertaste has some bright lemon zest texture.",84,Seguin-Manuel 2013  Viré-Clessé
"Velvety, rich and intense upon first sip, this is a lively, well-built wine, held back in bottle and offering layers of blackberry, black cherry, anise and sage flavor. Fruity and feral, it delivers a lot of nuance within its powerful presentation.",91,Eric Kent 2013 Stiling Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This smoothly round and full-bodied wine offers a taste of the tropics, combining pineapple, payapa and coconut in tone and flavor. The oak (only 20% of it new) is pronounced, though on the way to integration, .",86,Levendi 2013 Reserve Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"The berry flavors in this wine are fighting to emerge, but they are overwhelmed by dusty tannins and a lack of texture.",80,Baron Herzog 2009 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi)
"Brick House was one of the first to plant Gamay Noir in the Willamette Valley, and may well be the state's leading producer in terms of quantity. This is loaded with chunky cherry fruit, a penetrating style that simply brings a grin with every sip. Aromatics of root beer, sassafras and hard cherry candy add to the complexity.",91,Brick House 2014 Gamay Noir (Ribbon Ridge)
"Red apple and brioche aromas are tinged with lemon. The palate has the same fruit, richness and freshness, but expresses this with lightness and ease. It's a versatile sparkler, ideal for both apéritif and dinner. The finish is dry, balanced and elegant.",92,Cave de Turckheim NV Mayerling Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"This structured wine opens with quintessential Sangiovese aromas of violet and black berries punctuated with whiffs of leather and balsamic herbs. The palate delivers a core of black cherry accented with mint, black pepper and licorice notes that add depth. The hint of prune on the finish reflects the warm, challenging vintage, but this is a delicious, well-balanced wine. Enjoy soon. Soilair Selections, Vineyard Road, WineCraft.",90,Riecine 2011  Chianti Classico
"A fine blend of equal parts of Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier, this ripe wine is crisp with acidity and a nervy mineral texture. It is still young, still tight and structured. But it will be a fine wine as it matures. Drink from 2019.",93,Chanoine 2012 Tsarine Millésime Brut  (Champagne)
"A mix of fruit spanning across the Russian River Valley, this complex Chardonnay is so inviting and approachable. Brimming in ripe Gravenstein apple and baking spices, it conveys alluring and lush crispness as well as balanced fruit and floral aromas.",90,Gary Farrell 2012 Russian River Selection Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This blend of Grechetto and Trebbiano Spoletino opens with a fragrance of tropical fruit and cantaloupe. The fresh but creamy palate offers rich flavors of green melon, pineapple and green apple, brightened by citrus notes and refreshing acidity.",87,Perticaia 2012 White (Umbria)
"Tropical fruits and richly herbaceous flavors come together in this ripe, fruity wine. It has a citrus core along with a fine tang of orange zest and pineapple. Ready to drink.",89,Domaine Fouassier 2010 Les Grands Groux  (Sancerre)
"Inky violet-red in color, this blend offers vivid aromas of cranberry, pomegranate and aniseed. Flavors of black cherry, blueberry pie, caramel and a dash of salinity endure through the lingering finish, against a backdrop of grippy tannins.",92,Golan Heights Winery 2010 Yarden 2T Touriga Nacional-Tinta Cão Red (Galilee)
Heavy toast aromas follow through to a wine that is packed with new wood and some fruit. It has a biting burnt edge that may soften.,83,Château Bourbon 2010 Clos Bourbon  (Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux)
"An attractive price for a straightforward, Amador County Zin, full-bodied and tasting of ripe blackberries and cocoa.",86,Shenandoah 2010 Zinfandel (Amador County)

You can taste the integrity of the fruit here and you will enjoy its clean freshness.",87,Leone de Castris 2007 Five Roses Rosé (Salento)
"This is a full-bodied version of the variety and yet it rides a line of soft texture and floral aromatics that ground it in nice ways. Meaty and fruity in cherry, it finishes thick and rich.",90,C R Graybehl 2014 Mathis Vineyard Grenache (Sonoma Valley)
"Forward and accessible, this wine has broadly displayed flavors of berry and milk chocolate, along with more subtle details of cayenne and herb. The nuances sneak up on you, but make for a fascinating ride. Drink now or give it another 3–4 years.",90,Lemelson 2009 Mt. Richmond Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Zinfandel is joined by Mourvèdre and a few other minor grape varieties in this overtly sweet, high alcohol wine. It's soft and glyceriney, with cherry, blueberry, dark chocolate and pepper flavors. You have to give it credit for being true to its style.",88,Peachy Canyon 2010 Especiale Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
Both fresh and baked apple make an appearance on the nose. Aromatic hints of citrus peel highlight the nuance of apple fruit in this slender but rounded wine. The spicy midpalate anchors this firmly and gives backbone to the beauty.,92,Weszeli 2014 Käferberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"Rich, dry and tannic, this Syrah has elaborate flavors of dried plums, blackberries, coffee, dark bitter chocolate and black pepper. It's a complex wine, compromised only by the heat of 15.4% alcohol.",87,Cinnabar 2008 Sextant Vineyard Syrah (Paso Robles)
"Aromas of forest floor, game and ripe berry come together on the nose. The earthy palate delivers dried black cherry, clove, smoke, baked plum and aniseed alongside chewy tannins. Drink through 2016.",88,Cafaggio 2012 Single Estate  (Chianti Classico)
"The aromas of apple, herb and mineral are light yet provocative. It's rounded in feel, with the Chardonnay (10%) and Marsanne (4%) in the blend providing additional heft and a finish that lingers. It doesn't seem entirely varietal but offers plenty of enjoyment.",86,Hedges Family Estate 2014 C.M.S. Unoaked White Wine Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))

It nicely blends structure and elegance.",92,Pala 2013 Riserva  (Cannonau di Sardegna)
"Sourced from the oldest vines in the vineyard, this lovely wine is scented with rose petals, cranberries and sour cherries. Those flavors continue in a light, elegant framework, that gains power and focus as it works its way through the palate. Don't quit on this; it won't quit on you, finishing with a lick of sea salt caramel chocolate.",91,Hyland 2014 Coury Pinot Noir (McMinnville)
"Dark raisin and dried apricot flavors manifest on this immensely dark, old goldhued wine. Enormous concentration, as with the initially, almost painful acidity that comes through the spirit. This is an old wine, no question, but not too old, one to be savored in sips with all the flavors working at high intensity.",93,Sandeman NV 40-years Old Tawny  (Port)
"MacPhail's basic Anderson Valley Pinot is a good wine, dry and silky, with spicy flavors of cherries, currents and cola. It's a bit light in body, but tasty and interesting.",87,MacPhail 2006 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"The wine has a dark, crusty top to the nose, with solid berry aromas under that. The palate is bright, zesty and features familiar plum and black cherry flavors. And the finish is straightforward but smooth. Stylish, with a little snap, crackle and pop.",90,Graffigna 2006 Grand Reserve Malbec (San Juan)
"Celebrate the best of Lazio cuisine (think platters of frutti di mare or puntarelle, a spear-like endive salad dressed in anchovies and garlic) with Frascati Superiore Luna Mater. The wine's soft aromas include subtle pulses of vanilla, banana and stone fruit.",88,Fontana Candida 2009 Luna Mater  (Frascati Superiore)
"Smoky beef aromas meet with crushed pencils, toasty oak, cola and sweet tobacco set against a subtle purple-fruit backdrop on this bottling by Rick Longoria. The palate is dry, easy to quaff and quite refreshing for a dark-red wine, with subtle touches of clove, black currant and more oak-smoked meat.",89,Longoria 2014 Tempranillo (Santa Ynez Valley)

"Aromas of scorched earth, underbrush, spicy plum, allspice and graphite lead the nose. On the palate, notes of cracked pepper and clove accent the mature blackberry, raspberry and fig flavors. It's balanced with well-integrated tannins and finishes on a note of bitter almond. Drink through 2016.",88,Mocavero 2010 Curtirussi Negroamaro (Salento)

"Aromas of red berry, toast, and a hint of vanilla come together on this. The palate is a bit lean, exhibiting unripe red cherry accented with black pepper, anise and dried sage. Solid tannins provide structure.",88,Tenimenti Famiglia Cavallero 2011 La Fenice  (Barolo)
"Plump tree fruits carry the weight, with a dash of toast—though the winery notes say the fermentation was 100% stainless steel. It's delicious and ready to drink, now through 2018.",91,The Four Graces 2014 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"This is the winery's best Cabernet Sauvignon in years. It has classic black currant flavor, enhanced by smoky oak, and feels distinguished in the mouth. It's young, but should begin to mellow and show its stuff by 2017.",90,Rutherford Hill 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Crisp in tart, luminescent lemon, this variety was once much more prevalent in Sonoma County, but now presents itself as a rarity worth finding.

"This wine delivers a fresh hit of zesty acidity and earthiness that balance each other well, that liveliness a good match against more brooding aspects of black tea. Light bodied with just enough weight on the palate, it finishes with tastes of wild raspberry and strawberry.",91,Martin Ray 2013 Tina Marie Vineyard Pinot Noir (Green Valley)

"Based in the Côte de Sézanne, this producer has created a Pinot Noir-dominated blend. Its white stone-fruit aromas and soft texture point to a wine that is generous with its fruitiness, citrus and pear flavors leading the way. The wine is soft with a relatively high dosage. It is ready to drink.",88,Bernard Remy NV Carte Blanche Brut  (Champagne)
"Fragrant and aromatic with soapy, floral intensity and notes of mango and papaya, this is a vibrant Traminer that would pair well with spicy, exotic foods. It has a lean feel and ends with bright fruit flavors.",86,Ca'Tullio 2007 Traminer Aromatico Traminer (Friuli Aquileia)
"Aromas of asphalt, milk chocolate and generic berry fruits come with notes of creosote and chimney. This feels tannic and a bit flat. Savory, rubbery berry flavors are roasted and taste like oak-based clove on the finish.",84,Junta 2015 Momentos Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Curicó Valley)

The bracing freshness of green pear peel mixed with lemon freshness soon yields to a softer fruit note on the nose. Some creamy midpalate texture lends extra weight to this slender wine that charms effortlessly with lemony verve.,91,Stift Göttweig 2014 Göttweiger Berg Riesling (Kremstal)
"Offering fine flavor for the price, this release emphasizes spice over fruit, with a sharp, slightly herbal edge. Crisp apple and pear show ginger highlights. Drink this lightly chilled with some spicy Thai food.",88,Rainstorm 2014 Pinot Gris (Oregon)
"Creamy and smooth with soft oak shadings, this balanced 70-30 blend of full-bodied Grillo and fragrant Viognier is redolent of honey and bee's wax with softer tones of apricot and pear in the background. The wine has good density and structure but ends on a bright, crisp note.",87,Feudo di Santa Tresa 2006 Rina Ianca White (Sicilia)
"Wisps of smoke meld into fresh apple and lemon notes in this dry, light-bodied Pinot Blanc. It's not robust in flavor or complexity, but refreshing and lively on the palate.",85,Glenora 2013 Pinot Blanc (Finger Lakes)

"This is a crisp, fresh and red-currant flavored. It is lively, tight and fruity. A touch of perfume adds to the pleasure of this ready-to-drink wine.",86,Château de Bergun 2015 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
"Big and lush, this has graphite, coconut, minty oak and huge berry fruit aromas. It's plush in the mouth but not wayward or overly big, with roasted plum, ­molasses, leather and raspberry flavors and a forward barrel note. Savory and long on the finish, this is a blend of 40% Monastrell, 30% Tempranillo and 15% each Syrah and Cabernet.",91,Bodegas Carchelo 2009 Sierva Red (Jumilla)
"This delicious, refreshing wine has crisp acidity and bright red apple fruit. Shot through with with zesty lemon character, it finishes with a waft of white floral perfume. Drink now.",89,Clos Poggiale 2016 Vermentino (Corse)
"Dark in color, intense in fruit flavor and firmly packed with tannins, this blockbuster Bordeaux-style blend feels massive and grippy. It tastes like cranberry and blackberry, leaving astringency on the palate that will match up to the richest foods. Age a few bottles through 2019 to see how it matures.",88,Marietta Cellars NV Arme Lot Number 3 Red (North Coast)
"This wine adds to the growing case to be made for Cabernet Sauvignon in Livermore Valley. Mother Vine Reserve is a smallish offering for Concannon, loaded with black olive, tea and black pepper. It's Cab Franc-esque in some way, yet intensely dark, brooding and velvety.",88,Concannon 2008 Mother Vine Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley)
"Rich and herbal in cranberry and cherry, this is a soft and approachable wine that's been tamed yet manages to retain a spicy, clove and cardamom edge.",86,Rodney Strong 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)

The full-bodied palate offers wild cherry, raspberry, star anise, ground pepper a hint of orange rind alongside firm fine-grained tannins. Drink 2018–2023.",91,Villa Poggio Salvi 2011 Pomona  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"This single vineyard Malbec belongs with Washington's best. The mix of purple fruits and intense barrel flavors of clove, cocoa and dusty mocha inspires an impromptu “wow” once in the mouth. Smooth, satiny and seamless, it has a gentle hint of earth and herb threaded through the finish.",92,Walla Walla Vintners 2010 Sagemoor Vineyard Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a big, kick-butt wine that shows the powerful fruit and hard tannins that make Pinots from this vineyard ageable. You'll find it tough and gritty now, with rich, deep flavors of cherries, currants, cola and cedar. Best beyond 2011.",93,Testarossa 2007 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Boasting weight and some richness, the wine shows that the northern Beaujolais crus are the most successful in 2010. The cherry and sweet plum flavors are laced with ripe acidity as well as a mineral edge.",87,Georges Duboeuf 2010 Sélection  (Saint-Amour)
"Aromas of moist underbrush, saddle leather, dried herb, menthol and a whiff of game take shape in the glass. The firm palate offers raw sour cherry, cranberry, cinnamon and a hint of tobacco while close-grained tannins provide the framework and leave an astringent finish. Give the tannins a few more years to unwind then drink.",89,Cantine Russo 2010 Rampante Rosso  (Etna)
"High acidity marks this wine, giving it a crisp character with subdued fruitiness. That should change over the next few months, so drink from late 2017.",86,Château la Verrière 2016 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
"With acrid matchstick aromas and little else, this wine gets off to a rough start and never finds solid footing. The palate is chunky and grabby, while the flavors are burnt and stalky, with bitterness to the finish.",81,Solo Contigo 2011 Premium Series Sauvignon Blanc (Mendoza)
"Aromas of spiced plum and chopped mint lead the nose and carry over to the brawny, one-dimensional palate along with vanilla, toast, coffee and liquor-soaked cherry. Dusty tannins dry out the finish while the heat of searing alcohol that throws it off balance. Drink sooner rather than later.",86,Carus Vini 2011 Baldero  (Chianti Classico)
"A grapefruit pith note dominates the finish, taking away from the more traditional refreshing lift that one might expect from Sauv Blanc. But the rest is gorgeous and inviting, with notes of white peach, hard gooseberry and white cranberry throughout.",86,Mulderbosch 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape)
"Perfumed aromas of flowers, orange peel and smoked meat are followed by full-bodied fruit and savory flavors. It delivers a lot of enjoyment.",91,Gård 2012 Grand Klasse Lawrence Vineyards Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))

"This late-harvest wine has hints of honeyed botrytis as well as apricot fruitiness, though it is far from cloyingly sweet. The texture is soft and mature, with good integration of the fruit and the botrytis character. Try it now with cheese or foie gras.",90,Global Wines 2012 Outono de Santar White (Dão)
"Compelling scents of white spring flower, stone fruit and a whiff of nut weave throughout this blend of Friulano, Chardonnay, Sauvignon and Pinot Grigio. The vibrant palate delivers yellow apple, orange zest, almond and mineral alongside tangy acidity.",90,Zuani 2014 Vigne White (Collio)

The tight palate isn't quite as expressive as the nose, offering sour cherry, tart cranberry and a hint of clove alongside bracing tannins that grip the finish.",88,Bel Colle 2013 Montersino  (Barbaresco)
"Crisp and creamy, with red apple flavors. The wine is lifted by its crisp, green acidity, lightly coating the apple skin structure and tautness.",87,Domaine de la Grenaudière 2007  Muscadet Sèvre et Maine
"A beautiful sparkling wine that shows the Iron Horse signature of balanced elegance. The lime, raspberry, vanilla and brioche flavors are rich and intricate, but particularly lovely is the texture, which is soft and silky.",92,Iron Horse 2007 Ocean Reserve Sparkling (Green Valley)
"From the producer's dry-farmed estate vineyard, and supported by small amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this wine is elegant in sage and black cherry, silky on the palate in satisfying ways. Savory tea and an element of chocolate truffle give it additional complexity around a core of silky tannin.",91,Smith-Madrone 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District)
"This is a rich and full-bodied wine. While it is certainly packed with crunchy cherry flavors, it also has a more tannic and structured side giving it a firm texture to back up the fruitiness. The aftertaste is juicy and ripe.",90,Domaine de Roche-Guillon 2015  Beaujolais-Villages
"This is the casual sipper of the Château de Nages rosé pair, offering slightly briny, fumé notes on the nose, but following them up with peach and melon fruit flavors that finish long, crisp and dry.",88,Château de Nages 2014 Buti Nages Rosé (Costières de Nîmes)
"This wonderful and youthful wine shows how the Rhône varieties blend so well. It tastes as if the Grenache gives ripe fruit and the Syrah adds power and tannins. It's a big wine, with ample grippy texture, full body and good potential for aging through at least 2019.",92,Baiocchi Wines 2013 GB del Maggio Red (Fair Play)
"Il Massiccio is 85% Sangiovese with Merlot and Alicante, opening with bright cherry and raspberry aromas, with sour acidity and a touch of almond. Pair it with pepperoni or sausage pizza.",87,Tamburini 2008 Il Massiccio Sangiovese (Toscana)
"This estate Chardonnay is keeping stylistically with the winery's other offerings, though a tad weightier and richer in oak and crème brûlée. Fresh peach, pineapple and anise intermingle on the palate, with a silky yet complex texture. There is a palate-refreshing hint of lime on the finish.",93,Iron Horse 2012 Estate Chardonnay (Green Valley)
"This offers aromas and flavors of red raspberry, blue flowers, weedy underbrush and a whiff of dried sage. It's rather simple and already accessible.",86,Villadoria 2012  Barbaresco
"This easy-drinking Cabernet has flavors of blackberry jam and toast, wrapped into firm tannins. It won't improve with age, so drink up with a juicy burger.",84,Acronym 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Robert Mondavi winemaker Genevieve Janssens makes this wine, a small-production solo project that's worth seeking. The 83% Cabernet Sauvignon is sourced from Hendry Ranch and the 17% Cabernet Franc from Detert East Vineyard, a stone's throw from To Kalon. Impressively concentrated and lengthy, within a wealth of power, it is nuanced in black cherry, leather saddle and crushed rock, with the scent of violet never far behind.",96,Portfolio 2013 Limited Edition Red (Napa Valley)
"A bit sharp in acidity, with a bite right down the middle, but elegant and silky in mouthfeel and dry. Rich in flavor, too, offering waves of cherry, pomegranate, cola, persimmon and red plum fruit. Drink now.",90,Roadhouse Winery 2009 Purple Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)

"Bread, apple cider and yeasty complexity grace the nose on this Brut Nature. A smooth palate is now mature, ready and doesn't scrape or scour. Dry stone-fruit flavors blend with apple notes in front of a bready, toasty finish that has seltzer-like crispness. Drink through 2020.",90,Agustí Torelló 2007 Kripta Gran Reserva Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava)
"A wood-aged wine from the heart of the Dão, it has tannins, a tense mineral structure and layer after layer of black currant fruit and acidity. Dark and brooding at this stage, it needs to age for several years. Drink from 2016.",93,Sogrape 2010 Quinta dos Carvalhais Colheita Red (Dão)
"Apple and mild spice aromas kick off this simple white from the land of red Garnacha. The palate is fresh and juicy but light on character, while the flavor profile offers pithy, easygoing apple and melon flavors. This defines quaffable white wine.",84,Borsao 2011 Viura (Campo de Borja)
"The companion to the Hombre blend, this is 80% Malbec and 20% Syrah. The pairing works nicely, with the Syrah bringing details of anise, pepper and coffee. The wine has decent grip and definition, along with a pretty, toasty top note.",90,Stottle 2011 Homme Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Floral hints, latex, vanilla, oak and ripe berry aromas all show up on a fine bouquet. Ripe and creamy in feel, it holds dark, hard-pushing flavors of licorice, anise, coffee and blackberry. There's agility, elegance and complexity to this Malbec. Drink through 2017.",91,Los Vencejos 2010 Malbec (Uco Valley)
"This has extra richness that lends the wine concentration and ripeness. An intense structure of minerality is balanced by yellow fruit, bearing a round and full texture, with great depth of flavor. Age for at least five years. Screwcap.",93,Domaine Laroche 2010 Les Fourchaumes Vieilles Vignes Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"This is a juicy, earthy and expansive wine, with highlights of rose petal and wild strawberry. Pretty and ethereal, it offers body without an abundance of weight, the oak and tannin both integrated well.",91,MacMurray Estate Vineyards 2015 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"While there is plenty of acidity in this wine, it also has red fruit character that conveys a ripe, full feeling. It's juicy and fruity, crisp but still warm at the end.",85,Louis Jadot 2013 Cuvée Deux  (Beaujolais)
"What sets this Taurasi apart is a distinct floral note of blue flower or pressed rose that sits over a much broader and bolder base of dark spice, black fruit, prune, resin and cola. The little floral accent adds a feminine touch to what is without a doubt one of Italy's most masculine wines.",92,Villa Matilde 2005 Tenuta di Altavilla  (Taurasi)
"There's quite a showy, fragrant nose on this widely available bottling, with apple blossoms, tuberose and a touch of quinine. The palate also takes on a gin-and-tonic character, powered by lime juice, white peach and botanical notes.",85,Castle Rock 2014 Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"Fresh and inviting on the nose, this bottling shows sweet white flowers, Asian pear, yellow-grapefruit rind and lemon blossoms on the nose. Acidity explodes onto the palate, where a grassy, grapefruit-pith-driven tension rides into a rounded midpalate full of pear, nectarine and honeydew flavors.",92,Grassini 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
"Light, off-dry and refreshing, this would make an ideal poolside sipper. Hints of damp moss and fern add complexity to green apple and citrus flavors. Drink now.",88,Frisk 2014 Prickly Riesling (Alpine Valleys)
"Rugiens,  which is named after its red soil, is located in the south of Pommard. Dense, structured and powerful, this is a brooding wine that has concentrated tannins and fruit that is offset by a tight line of acidity. This is a wine that demands aging.",91,Albert Bichot 2010 Domaine du Pavillon Rugiens Premier Cru  (Pommard)
"Very sweet in black cherry and chocolate flavors, basically a Port-style wine, yet too soft, with a melted candybar feeling. Would benefit from greater acidic structure, but it sure is delicious.",86,Quady 2008 Elysium Black Muscat (California)
"This is a warm, rich wine with spicy black-fruit flavors. Touches of coffee have come through with the wood aging. Bright acidity gives a touch of freshness to the firm tannins at the end. Drink this generous, while still serious wine from 2020.",93,Château Canon la Gaffelière 2013  Saint-Émilion
"Savory whiffs of ramps and pollen blow off with aeration to reveal fresh scents of tangerine and apple. On the palate, it's off dry with intensely concentrated flavors of pink grapefruit and white peach. Zesty lime acidity lingers on the finish.",88,Dr. Fischer 2012 Ockfener Bockstein Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"There's lots to like about this wine, from its soft tannins and floral opening aromas to its spicy layers and integrated tannins. But at 16.5% alcohol, it's a crazy big wine, which makes it a difficult wine to pair with food or enjoy over a night without regrets in the morning.",86,Occasio 2010 Del Arroyo Vineyard Zinfandel (Livermore Valley)
The blend is 60-40 Grillo and Viognier and the wine offers aromatic components of both varieties. The first imparts green notes of kiwi and cut grass and the second offers sweet floral fragrances.,86,Duca di Salaparuta 2010 Calanìca Grillo-Viognier White (Sicilia)
"Some reduction still swings on the nose in the form of flinty smokiness, once this wears off, pure, taut, zesty lemon comes to the fore and remains the central feature of this streamlined, slender wine. There is midpalate texture and whistle-clean length.",91,Allram 2014 Hasel Alte Reben Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"This begins with a reserved nose that unfolds into deep, black aromas of licorice, turned earth and graphite. Pomegranate and acai fruit flavors mix with red clay and touches of whiskey, but the tannins are powerful. Give it until at least 2018 to smooth out.",88,Testarossa 2012 Brosseau Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chalone)
"Grassy aromas and a whiff of celery lead to a snappy palate with fresh but tart lemon, gooseberry and white-currant flavors. A juicy fresh finish with citrus flavors is typical of well-executed Txakoli.",88,Lasalde Elkartea 2015 Txakoli Aitzalde Hondarrabi Zuri (Getariako Txakolina)
"Green pear peel and flesh dominate nose and palate and make for a fruit-driven, slender but concentrated white. The melting texture is an added bonus.",89,Stadt Krems 2013 Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"Compact and full in the nose, with a fine level of berry fruit and some attractive wood spice. The mouth offers sweet berry flavors and some toasty oak, while the finish is round and soft. There's little complexity or style—what you smell and taste at first is what you get.",85,Valdivieso 2000 Single Vineyard Reserve Malbec (Lontué Valley)
"This is classic Santa Maria Valley Pinot Noir, with its dark color, full body, ripe berry and currant flavors and, especially, the array of exotic crushed brown spices. New French oak brings lots of smoky, buttery, toasty richness. Great to drink now with tuna, salmon, lamb and beef dishes.",93,Foxen 2010 Julia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"Owned by the Abeille family of Château Mont-Redon in Châteauneuf-du-Pape, this wine is delicious. Crisp and clean with great red currant and citrus fruitiness, it is finely judged with acidity and a light texture balancing the fruit. Drink now.",90,Château Riotor 2016 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Distinct aromas of cola, cedar and Bing cherry, as well as flavors of mocha and blackcurrants, weave fascinating complexity into this supple, full-bodied wine. The texture feels broad and relaxed, while the acidity and tannins are moderate. A nice viscosity carries its plump appeal through the finish.",92,Panthea 2012 Klindt Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"This wine is dark garnet to the eye, with a fragrance of raspberry, cherry and Mediterranean herbs. There is a pleasing balance of fruit and dried herb notes. Smooth tannins prevail, with flavors of black cherry, blueberry, eucalyptus, smoked meat and fresh-cut herbs of thyme and oregano paving the way for a blueberry, oregano and orange rind finish.",92,Golan Heights Winery 2010 Yarden Merlot (Galilee)
"Underbrush, dried plum, resin, leather and a whiff of baking spice aromas slowly emerge in the glass. The big chewy palate shows juicy blackberry, ripe black cherry, tobacco and clove set against a backbone of firm velvety tannins. Despite its heft, it also boasts surprising finesse. Hold for even more complexity. Drink 2017–2025.",94,Venturini Massimino 2005 Riserva  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"The Ormonde Chardonnay has a fresh, floral nature that is slightly feminine. Pretty floral and refreshing fruitelements mingle with hints of spice, resulting in a clean and friendly white that is both elegant and fun.",87,Ormonde 2006 Chardonnay (Darling)
"89-91 Very structured, the wood permeating the fruit, giving a toasty, spicy character. The fruit shows in the juicy under taste. Extraction might be a problem.",90,Château Tour de Pez 2010 Barrel sample  (Saint-Estèphe)
"An unusual and inviting lemongrass aroma and flavor go well with a buttery and vibrant texture in this medium-bodied and almost sweet wine. Blended from Sémillon, Chardonnay and four other grapes, it makes a nice change of pace.",89,Murrieta's Well 2014 The Whip White (Livermore Valley)
"Made in a rich, ripe style that perhaps favors power over elegance, this is delicious from start to finish. It's a big, intense wine, massive in blackberry and mocha flavors, with a bacon meatiness that's part Syrah, part smoky oak. While it's a little obvious in its appeals, it does show Syrah at its flashy Napa best.",94,Montagna 2009 Triangle Syrah (Napa Valley)
"Don't discount this Pinot Noir because it's in a screw top and the price is under $20. It's quite a nice wine, dry and silky. Made in a lighter style to be opened now, it has pleasant cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors.",86,Jekel 2008 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
"This barrel selection is loaded with tart cherry and blackberry fruit. Scents and accents bring hints of bread, butter, vanilla and coffee. The finish is lengthy and detailed, with no fall off in complexity. It was aged 18 months in roughly half new French oak.",92,Lachini 2015 Cuvée Giselle Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"Intensely floral on the nose, this is a blend of 70% Pinot Grigio grown in Carneros, 15% Traminer also grown in Carneros, and 15% Moscato giallo from Lodi, which the producer has previously employed in delightful wines of its own. Lilting and bright, it has substance behind the equal balance of fruit and spice, offering a taste of lemony ginger and pear.",90,Uvaggio 2014 Zelo Bianco White (Carneros-Napa Valley)
"Pepper Bridge and Stoney Vine vineyards contribute equally to this 100% varietal wine. It's the barrel influence that shows through first, with woodspice followed by green herbs, coffee and dark plum. The palate is rich with focused coffee and dark fruit flavors that have a touch of astringency.",89,Beresan 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"With its strongly mineral-textured base, this is a complex, impressive wine. It has fruit weight with lychees, mangos and spiced pears along with acidity that gives the wine just the lift it needs. Power and style go hand-in-hand in this wine. Drink from 2019.",96,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2012 Clos Saint Urbain Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
Peppery spice and simple but fresh dark fruit reminiscent of blueberry characterize this simple but very enjoyable rendition of Blaufränkisch. It may not be as concentrated as some but makes up for that in sheer drinkability.,88,Lenz Moser 2013 Blaufränkisch (Burgenland)
"Delicate aromas of lemon blossom, ripe Asian pear and a touch of yellow melon show on the nose of this versatile and tasty bottling. Grippy tension consumes the palate, led by lemon rind, but there's also a richer yellow-apple and pear core as well as a bit of pineapple.",92,J. Lohr 2014 October Night Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco)
"Close to the beaches of Saint-Tropez, this estate has produced a light-hearted wine that is fresh and crisp. The blend of Ugni Blanc, Clairette and Rolle give a light, bright character, with lemon and refreshing final acidity.",88,Château Saint-Maur 2014 White (Côtes de Provence)
"The 2003 Barbaresco is evolving well, if quickly. It shows mature flavors of smoky fruit, sweet plums, graphite and a touch of rubber. Soft on the palate, and delicious now, it should drink well for another five years.",87,Pio Cesare 2003  Barbaresco
"There's a bit of warmth to the nose of this wine, but forest berry and red cherry aromas and flavors keep things vibrant and flavorful. It's approachable now with soft tannins and an easygoing structure, ending with a hint of milk chocolate.",87,Flam 2009 Classico Red (Israel)
"Rich, with a hint of toast, this floral wine, with its almond blossom aromas, is drier than many other bottlings from this producer. It has a crisp, tight texture, with a mineral edge as well as a firm structure that suggests it is still young, so drink from 2018.",91,Canard-Duchêne NV Charles VII Grande Cuvée le Victorieux Brut  (Champagne)
"Dusty potpourri tones pepper the perfumey floral and fruit aromas on this dry, light-bodied Gewürztraminer. It's lithe and refreshing with a crisp finish.",85,Stony Lonesome 2014 Estate Reserve Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes)
"Dry, acidic and tannic, in the manner of a young Barbera, but the flavors of cherries, blackberries and currants aren't powerful enough to outlast the astringency. Drink this tough, rustic wine now.",84,Eagle Castle 2007 Barbera (Paso Robles)
"A good, although somewhat tough and gritty, Pinot Noir that just wants a steak to cut through its tannins and acids. Shows a dry, silky texture with flavors of cherries, tobacco and peppery spices.",86,Manzoni 2007 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"A bright cherry-red color, this lively, sweet-scented wine proves that Oregon can still make a Pinot Noir in a lighter style without having it turn vegetal. Despite a citrusy snap to the palate, it feels smooth and even a bit satiny, and the pretty cranberry/cherry fruit is annotated with cinnamon and light toast. A superb value.",87,Firesteed 2005 Pinot Noir (Oregon)
"This tastes like an alcoholic fruit drink with apricot, orange and mango flavors. Still, it's clean and pleasant.",83,Jenica Peak 2011 Coastal Series Chardonnay (California)
"A full-bodied, fleshy expression of the variety, this wine opens in aromas of toasted marshmallow and caramel, the oak impressive and memorable. From there it offers a wealth of baked apple and pear, finding its footing along a lush, richly defined path.",90,Michael Mondavi Family Estate 2015 Emblem Chardonnay (Carneros)
"In the crisp, balanced style of the producer, this nonvintage Champagne is light, poised and elegant. It is satisfyingly mature with good acidity and minerality. Lively and perfumed, it is ready to drink.",90,Billecart-Salmon NV Brut Réserve  (Champagne)
"Light citrus, green herb and nettle aromas are just what you'd expect from Leyda SB, and the palate has a plump, easy feel along with fresh flavors of melon, tangerine and nectarine. More round than linear, with good length and clarity.",87,Santa Carolina 2009 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley)
"Leathery and rubbery at first, with aromatic accents of celery seed, barnyard and melted tar. The palate is lighter than the nose, with herbal plum flavors and a lean, strained body. Thin and fresh, but nothing special.",84,De Lozar 2007  Ribera del Duero
"Oxidized aromas of spent yeast and stale fruit are not fresh. This feels foamy, wayward and unfocused. Citrus flavors are unconvincing, while this rosé tastes soapy on the finish.",83,Codorníu NV Anna Brut Rosé Sparkling (Cava)
"This impressive operation covers much of eastern Waiheke, although only a small portion of the property is planted to vines. The 2010 vintage was especially good on the island, and this wine is crammed with ripe, peachy fruit, framed by smoky oak and roasted nuts. Despite being weighty and round in the mouth, it finishes well, on a lingering citrusy note. Drink it over the next couple of years.",92,Man O' War 2010 Valhalla Chardonnay (Waiheke Island)
"Crisp and tightly wound, this is a relatively austere Cabernet with an astringent finish. Cassis emerges with enough airing, accompanied by tart cranberries, which act to accentuate the drying tannins. Try after 2020.",86,D'Arenberg 2013 The High Trellis Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)
"This wine is a blend of Grenache (53%), Syrah (22%), Mourvèdre (17%), Counoise (5%) and Cinsault. Smoke, char and black pepper aromas are predominant along with notes of tire rubber, white pepper and red fruit. The red-fruit flavors are lighter in style, showing a pretty sense of styling.",89,Brian Carter Cellars 2013 Byzance Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"As is right for a Bandol, Mourvèdre is the dominant grape in this rich wine. It is spicy from the same wood aging that also gives a mint-chocolate flavor to the powerful red-plum and berry fruits. The wine is still young, still firm. Drink from 2019.",91,Château d'Azur 2014 Tradition Red (Bandol)
"A velvet-textured wine, relatively light because of the vintage, but oh-so tender, the tannins whispering behind the sweet fruits. This is regarded as the second wine of Clos de Tart Grand Cru and shows the same generous, plush character.",91,Clos de Tart 2007 La Forge de Tart Premier Cru  (Morey-Saint-Denis)
"A warm, sunny blend of local grapes, this is ripe while still having a fresh, fruity character. The acidity at the end reinforces this contrast between richness and crispness. Drink now.",86,Cartuxa 2015 EA Tinto Red (Alentejano)
"White and black pepper jump out of the glass, calling to the senses in this wine from the Wallace Creek Vineyard. A complex tangle of body and texture interweaves between an underlying elegance that belies the considerable ripeness behind this wine.",93,Francis Coppola 2013 Reserve Syrah (Dry Creek Valley)
"Big, rich, and dramatic are just a few words that describe this 100% Cabernet grown on the low-yielding estate vineyard in Coombsville. It's lush with black currants, yet bracing in tannins, with a minerality that makes it feel firm and grounded. The barrels are 100% new French oak, lending a savory level of char and vanilla. This is clearly a wine to cellar for a long time. Start enjoying it in 2018, and it is likely to develop bottle complexity throughout the 2020s.",95,Caldwell 2010 Gold Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Beautiful to drink now, one of the most rewardingly plush Syrahs on the market. It's easy to like, with soft tannins and a creamy mouthfeel housing ripe, savory cherry and blueberry pie flavors. If only more Syrahs were this delicious.",92,Terlato 2008 Syrah (Dry Creek Valley)
"A fine, concentrated, mineral-textured wine, with pink grapefruit and lemon zest flavors. It is vivid, fresh, layered with crisp acidity that blooms in the mouth. There is a great, taut aftertaste.",92,Roger et Didier Raimbault 2007 Vieilles Vignes  (Sancerre)
"Smooth and rounded with light, perfumed sweetness, this is an easy and approachable wine. Its pear and kiwi flavors come together easily. Screwcap.",84,Adega Cooperativa Ponte de Barca 2011 Hera White (Vinho Verde)
"Fruity, rich and satisfying. Shows a mélange of pineapple, pear and peach flavors, with creamy vanilla and spice notes, brightened with crisp acidity. Could be a tad drier.",86,Happy Camper 2008 Chardonnay (California)
"Produced from the old vines of one of Cahor's emblematic estates, this is a dark, dense and concentrated wine. Full of black plum skins that are balanced with acidity, it is rich with black cherry and a smoky character from the wood aging. This 100% Malbec does need aging and should be drunk from 2019.",93,Domaine de Cause 2012 La Lande Cavagnac Malbec (Cahors)
"While the nose is subdued, lush honeydew and white peach flavors shine brilliantly on the palate of this taut, nervous wine. Streaks of steely mineral lend a polished feel that lingers on the finish. It's strikingly acidic still, but should meld together beautifully with some cellaring, ideally from 2019 on.",93,Fritz Haag 2013 Brauneberger Juffer Sonnenuhr Auslese Riesling (Mosel)
"Raspberries, cherries, cola and persimmons are the flavors of this fairly standard Pinot Noir. It's dry and delicately structured, with good acidity and a discrete coating of oak. Drink now.",86,Envolve 2012 Lennox Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Some caramel and candied fruit goes well with the flowery element on the bouquet. In the mouth, lime, peach and mineral run the show. After that comes a clean, light finish with just a hint of stone-fruit flavor. A good mouthfeel ensures that this will be a decent wine for trout caught during the summer.",84,Montecillo 2002 White (Rioja)
"This perfumed wine from a great year is rich in both fruit and structure, solid with tannins as well as ripe fruit. It is still youthful, dense and powerful. Wait and drink from 2018.",89,Château Garreau 2010 Cuvée Armande  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"The best thing about this oddball Best Buy is that it doesn't require a big investment in order to try something way different. The wine is packaged nicely in a stout bottle, and it does give some cava-like flavor due to the fact that it's 100% Xarello. Beyond that, it smells and tastes like kiwi, banana, papaya and other green fruits. Weird but good in its own way. Give it a shot.",87,Marqués de Alella 2007 Pansa Blanca (Alella)
"This ripe and full-bodied wine has a wonderful balance between pure acidity and ripe yellow fruits. From chalk and clay soils, it's both mineral and rich, both fresh and warm. It could be drunk now, although it will be much better from 2016.",88,Domaine Sangouard-Guyot 2013 Authentique  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
"This intriguing wine is dominated by the 60% of normally rare Petit Verdot. Made by the same team as Château Paloumey, this wine shows an impressive color, and a rich, black berry juicy character. The tannins are solid, but the exuberant fruit overrides everything else.",88,Château la Bessane 2006  Margaux
"Blended with 6% Petit Verdot, this wine is treated as a reserve-tier bottling. It delivers high-toned red fruit and plum notes dusted with spice and dried herb. It's robust in body and weight and long on the finish.",93,Rombauer 2014 Diamond Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Lots of oak and lees on this Chardonnay, but is never feels overworked. The acidity is brisk, and fruit flavors are rich in apricots, mangoes, tangerines and pears. Don't drink this delicious wine too cold, as it picks up nuances in the glass.",91,Dutton Estate 2012 Kyndall's Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Winemaker Brian Loring's take on this coveted vineyard shows rhubarb, pencil lead and a very clove-y cinnamon aspect on the nose. Raspberries mark the core of the palate, but the edges are speckled with strong herbs, from oregano to juniper. It offers a great mix of fruit and spice.",93,Loring Wine Company 2013 Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"More of an orange shade of pink, this rosé of Syrah offers red plum, grapefruit pith and chalky minerality on the nose. The palate shows broad red-apple and tangerine-skin flavors, although the texture is lacking a bit of grip and acidic brightness.",87,Refugio Ranch 2016 Rosé (Santa Ynez Valley)
"A rich, elegant and accessible blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre with well-ripened cherry, berry, currant, spice and cedar flavors. Showing its best now, so drink up.",87,Koehler 2008 Les 3 Cépages G-S-M (Santa Ynez Valley)
"On the nose this is classic Bordeaux, the dusty black currant and tight fruit very obvious. This is a lean wine, with a core of dry tannins, but there is definite black currant juice freshness, the wine showing high finishing acidity.",87,Hans Moser 2005 Cabernet Merlot (Burgenland)
"A tender notion of slightly bitter, dark fir honey appears first before a touch of smoke and ripe peach come in. The off-dry palate uses its sweetness to underline the rich peachy fruit that also has a touch of golden mirabelle. The big bold palate is concentrated and energetic, pervaded by a streak of zesty lemon freshness that keeps this from becoming too rich. There is undeniable drive here, and a very lasting persistent length of peach and lemon flavors which will develop much more with bottle age. Drink. 2017–2037.",95,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Clos Saint Urbain Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"A fruity and aromatic wine that is a blend of Syrah and Castelão. It has bright red fruits and a soft, ripe character. Berries and acidity complement the round finish.",84,Wines & Winemakers 2012 Samora Rosé (Tejo)
"This vintage of Rupìcolo (a 70-30 blend of Montepulciano and Nero di Troia) is an austere wine with brooding aromas of spice, blackberry jam and bitter chocolate. The wine has drying tannins with deep dimension and persistency. The price is just right too.",87,Rivera 2006 Rupìcolo Red (Castel del Monte)
"A blend of 81% Merlot, 12% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot. An unusually tight Pedestal, this absolutely must be decanted. It opens well, with black fruits, toasted grain, and firm tannins, then hits a wall and stops short. However, with a lot of breathing time and/or aerating, it broadens out a bit and shows more length and finesse.",91,Pedestal 2008 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A touch of peach colors the white and green fruit notes of this zippy white, its freshness amplified by a slight spritz. It's light bodied, dry and very refreshing, with a lovely herbal edge on the palate.",90,Jurtschitsch 2016 Terrassen Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"Well-rounded pear and apple aromas get a fresh squeeze of lemon in this good-deal Sauv Blanc. It's easy to drink, with apple popover flavors (whose toasty elements come from the 20% barrel fermentation) and a brisk acidity.",87,Santa Barbara Winery 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Solidly structured, this wine is medium- to full-bodied, moderately tannic and heading toward maturity in flavors. The medium garnet color goes to tawny at the rim. Aromas of cola, cherries and a touch of smoke are followed by rather lean fruit and clove flavors. Unfined, unfiltered and fermented with wild yeast.",86,Foursight 2011 Charles Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Citrus aromas are familiar. Lively and zesty in the mouth, with refreshing acidity. Orange and passion fruit lead the palate, which transitions to grapefruit. Crisp on the finish. Good for an everyday white wine.",86,Viña Casablanca 2010 Cefiro Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"There's a savory roasted-meat quality to the nose of this blend of 68% Grenache, 20% Mourvèdre and 12% Syrah that also offers crushed riverstone, a touch of violet and coffee-syrup scents. The hefty, meaty character carries right into the palate that is thick in body, chalky with structure and redolent in roasted blackberry and tangy elderberry fruit.",92,Alta Colina 2014 Estate Cask Reserve G-S-M (Adelaida District)
"Made entirely with Refosco, this robust red has a shy nose that eventually reveals prune and a whiff of ground green pepper. The dense palate offers mature plum, vanilla and a hint of cocoa alongside the heat of evident alcohol and evolved tannins. Drink soon.",87,De Stefani 2014 Kreda Refosco (Veneto)
"This flavorful blend of Müller-Thurgau, Muscat and Riesling is lightly fizzy, and off dry, with residual sugar listed at 22.5g/L. Citrus fruits are limned with ginger, and it is a thoroughly refreshing and low-alcohol delight.",88,Season 2014 Transparency White (Southern Oregon)
"The sweetest of the Madeira single-variety wines, this Bual is still laced with intense acidity. That brightness is contrasted by the toffee and caramel flavors, yielding a wine that is superrich while remaining so fresh at the end. This fine wine is ready to drink.",95,Blandy's 2002 Colheita Bual (Madeira)
"Ripe pear-pineapple fruit is layered with vanilla and tinged with citrus. This is a plump, slightly heavy Chard best served cold at parties and picnics.",84,Concha y Toro 1999 Xplorador Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)
"This bold wine has a charred oaky aroma, flavors that are almost sweet and also plenty oaky, along with ripe and concentrated berry flavors that peek out from under the smoky toasted layer after a few moments.",86,Dante Robere 2014 Zinfandel (San Francisco Bay)
"This conveys pure strawberry fruit with just the right amount of tannin, making for a beautiful, perfumed wine. The dry core is still juicy with acidity and raspberry fruits, while acidity shoots through at the end. Drink from 2020.",92,Domaine Bruno Clair 2014 Les Longeroies  (Marsannay)
Cherry and cassis aromas are fiery but acceptable. This Cab has a medium-bodied palate and flavors of salty berry fruits and creamy oak. Dry oak spice is the most noticeable flavor on a mellow finish.,88,Porta 2015 Single Vineyard Estate Bottled Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"Lifted lemony freshness greets the nose, while savoriness dominates the palate. It offers pear and citrus, as well as riper stone-fruit, earthy hints and pungent watercress and white pepper—all packaged in a ripe but streamlined body.",90,Türk 2013 Kremser Weinberge Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
This round yet direct Cava offers stone-fruit aromas that are upright and clean. Simple citrus and nectarine flavors hold steady on the finish.,86,Marqués de la Concordia 2012 MM Reserva de la Familia Brut Rosé Sparkling (Cava)
"This vineyard selection offers a compact and clean aromatic package that hits all the right notes without being overdone. Blackberry, cherry, vanilla and spice chime in on the palate and help drive the wine's long, chewy finish.",91,Poggio Antico 2003 Altero  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"This opens with aromas that recall spring flower, citrus and a whiff of honeydew melon. The rather lean, linear palate shows grapefruit and flint alongside racy acidity. A bitter almond note signals the finish.",86,Broglia 2013 Bruno Broglia del Comune di Gavi  (Gavi)
"Immaculate freshness abounds in this zesty Chardonnay. While supple and quite creamy on the palate, pristine lemon and pear flavors and a vibrant backdrop of lemony acidity invigorate. Elegantly meshed vanilla and spice tones linger on the finish.",89,Bellangelo 2014 1866 Reserve Chardonnay (Seneca Lake)
"The nose offers plenty of cooked plum preserves, warm spice and toasted, nutty oak. There's a nice, lush texture and body, and bright red cherry and plums flavors on the palate. The fruit flavors may be slightly lacking in concentration, but supple tannins make for smooth, easy sipping.",86,Comtesse Thérèse 2006 Aquebogue Estate Merlot (North Fork of Long Island)
"Light graphite notes of pencil shaving and slate roof come on the heels of wild berries, orange zest and powdered licorice. Shadings of ash and smoke liven the mouth but the finish is exceedingly tannic and dry.",86,Cantina del Nebbiolo 2007  Roero
"Right now, although the nose is closed, exposure to air reveals the purity of lemon oil on a taut and tight palate still singing with yeasty notes. This is in its very infancy and promises to open up beautifully with its straight, soaring backbone of freshness. Underneath all the tightly curled layers of citrus peel slumbers a salty stoniness that signals ageability; the long, lemony finish corroborates this. How utterly lip-smacking. Drink 2020–2030",95,Josef Jamek 2014 Ried Klaus Riesling (Wachau)
"This starts off slightly rubbery, but comes around quickly enough to display ample white grapefruit and pith notes. It's a bit tight and austere from start to finish; probably at its best with seafood.",84,Hope Estate 2009 Verdelho (Hunter Valley)
"Notes of red currant, rhubarb, tart strawberry and Cherry Dr. Pepper grace the nose and mouth of this straightforward and easy-drinking red. It's lightweight and softly structured, with a short but clean and pleasant finish.",84,Laroque 2015 Pinot Noir (Vin de Pays Cité de Carcassonne)
"The nose hovers somewhere between pink grapefruit and Cox Orange Pippin apple: that is to say the flavors are pure, fruity and crisp. The palate is dry and aromatic, fizzy and easy, foaming and light. This is an ideal party wine, enlivening everything with its weightless freshness.",88,Allimant-Laugner NV Rosé Pinot Noir (Alsace)
"Under the same family ownership as Château Lamothe-Cissac, this estate has produced a broa rich wine, dominated by its 60% Cabernet Sauvignon. It is rounded already with juicy blackberry fruits and dark tannins. Drink this already fruity wine from 2019.",88,Château la Tonnelle 2014  Haut-Médoc
"This is a medium-dry Riesling with plenty of weight and richness, but also wonderfully perfumed aromatics of citrus blossom. Lime and green apple fruit carries the palate, and finishes long, with an almost tactile sense of minerality.",91,Spy Valley 2009 Riesling (Marlborough)
"This is a fresh and easy selection, with low-intensity aromas and flavors of tart gooseberry, lemon-lime citrus and soft grass. The mouthfeel is light and breezy, and the finish is clean and brisk. Drink now.",86,Pelter 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Galilee)
This soft wine is easy and open. It has generous fruits and gentle acidity. The result is a smooth wine that is ready to drink now.,85,Bailli de Provence 2016 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"The rustic aromas are off-putting in this wine. It has a proper density but seems to have a musty character. This could blow off over time, because the fruit is here.",85,Château Bellegrave 2008  Pauillac
"Dark, alluring aromas of licorice, blackberry and toast share space with earthy, mossy notes on the nose of this full-bodied winner that's showing wall-to-wall weight and tannins. Black plum, cassis and tobacco flavors are a common Rioja trifecta, as are dry, peppery, figgy flavors on the finish. Drink from 2018–2028.",92,Bodegas Landaluce 2009 Capricho  (Rioja)
"The aromas are surprisingly light considering the variety, with whiffs of both lime and peach. It drinks dry, with the variety difficult to discern.",84,Armstrong Family 2015 Dineen Vineyard Riesling (Yakima Valley)
"An interesting blend of 24% Viognier, 24% Roussanne, 24% Chenin Blanc, 14% Chardonnay and 14% Sémillon, this offers aromas of buttered brioche, waxy apple, white melon rind and firm pear. The medium-weight palate is well-balanced and harmonious, the ripe fruit tones countered by ample acidic lift. A hint of salinity enlivens the finish. Drink now–2018.",90,Avondale 2013 Cyclus White (Paarl)
"Yellow peach, apricot and tangerine aromas lead to the tangy palate along with notes of ginger and white pepper. Crisp acidity gives it a clean, crisp finish.",87,Cantina Valle Isarco 2014 Kerner (Alto Adige)
"As is normal for Embruix, the nose is generous and jammy, with extracted flavors of grapy black fruits and earth. The palate is smooth and jammy, with easy tannins and ripe flavors of plum and cassis. The finish is loamy, plump and soft. Drink through 2017.",90,Vall Llach 2011 Embruix Red (Priorat)
"This Syrah-Grenache rosé is intensely herbal, with strong notes of thyme, sage, parsley, laurel and lavender, all grounded by a tart cherry character. The palate is pleasantly zippy in acidity and a touch astringent through the close, with notes of orange pith and melon rind that linger nicely. Drink now.",87,Château la Grave 2015 Expression Rosé (Minervois)
"A blend of 54% Merlot with smaller percentages of Cabernet Sauvignon (28%) and Cabernet Franc (18%), this is a nicely structured red that's soft, accessible and juicy, with notes of cranberry and cassis liqueur coming to the fore.",88,Wise Villa 2011 Wisdom of Wise Red (Sierra Foothills)
"This is a very pleasant and elegant blend of Nero d'Avola, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot that does a great job of presenting a united aromatic front. There are no loose edges here and the wine is compact and smooth in the mouth. Very nice.",89,Duca di Salaparuta 2005 Triskelè Red (Sicilia)
"Here's a wine that delivers big, ripe fruity tones such as sticky black cherry and blackberry comfiture but that leaves just enough room for those distinctive Sardinian notes of Mediterranean herbs. Pair this wine with red meat, especially lamb, and roasts.",87,Pala 2005 Silenzi Red (Isola dei Nuraghi)
A waxy vein of petroleum cuts enticingly through juicy-sweet pink grapefruit and peach flavors in this dainty semisweet Riesling. It's vivaciously spry yet finishes long on a lingering lacy veil of sweetness. Drink now through 2022.,91,Boundary Breaks 2013 No. 198 Single Vineyard Reserve Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"It's easy to like this vibrant Chardonnay for its generous fruit flavors, subtle oak influence  and creamy texture. It smells like a fruit tart and tastes fresh and rich at the same time. The ripe fruit flavors grow on the finish.",87,Belle Ambiance 2012 Chardonnay (California)
"Dry and silky but heavy, with earthy flavors of herbs, mushrooms, cherries, cola and spice. Drink now.",84,TreViti 2006 Stolo Family Vineyard Anno di Isabella Pinot Noir (Central Coast)
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère, Rara Neagra, Shiraz and Malbec, this Moldovan wine has aromas of sweet cherry juice and vanilla. It has flavors of dried figs, fresh black plum and dried red plums. The finish is persistent with grippy tannins.",89,Equinox Estate 2012 5 Elemente Red (Moldova)
"This offers fruity and spicy fragrances of blackberry and clove. On the palate, it has a tight core of black cherry and spice, with firm, chewy tannins that are tightly wound. Give this a few more years to come around.",87,Valentina Cubi 2010 Arusnatico  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
"A rich, opulent Cabernet, made in the modern style. It's firm in tannins and dense with blackberry, currant, olive, dark chocolate and new oak flavors, but is really too young to drink now. Give it at least 6–8 years.",90,Bacio Divino 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Hints of milk chocolate and spice accent this sumptuously rich, silky wine. Ripe black cherry and berry flavors are approachably juicy and fruity, fringed by soft, feathery tannins.",87,The Old Field 2010 Commodore Perry Merlot (North Fork of Long Island)
"Ripe pomegranate and candied raspberry aromas meet with potpourri and cinnamon touches on the nose of this bottling from the Franscioni family. The palate is very approachable, with raspberry sorbet flavor and a graphite edge, providing both the richness that the appellation is known for and smart restraint.",92,Roar 2015 Sierra Mar Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Firm and juicy, this Pinot has a core of berry fruit and plenty of acidity. The earthy, herbal accents are typical of this AVA. Overall, it shows fine balance and decent concentration.",87,Cherry Hill 2010 Dijon Cuvée Estate Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Heavy oak, vanilla and lightly herbal black-fruit aromas are savory and border on soupy. In the mouth, this is rich, saturated and jammy. Flavors of maple, chocolate and toast accent fully extracted dark-fruit flavors. Full chewy tannins result in a pounding finish. Drink through 2022.",91,Viña Chocalan 2013 Vitrum Malbec (Maipo Valley)
"Glimmers of minerality lend elegance to zesty white grapefruit, lemon and pear notes in this dry, full-bodied Pinot Gris. A brisk backbone of acidity balances nicely against a mouthfeel that's succulent and satisfying. Drink now through 2016.",87,Thirsty Owl Wine Company 2014 Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes)
"Dry on the nose, with balsam shavings, pepper and secondary red fruit aromas. The palate has a choppy, fairly hollow feel and then short flavors of plum and berry. Spice and mint notes work the finish, which is mellow. Overall this is standardfare RDD.",85,Splendore 2007  Ribera del Duero
"Blue flower, red berry and mint aromas lead the nose. The straightforward palate offers fleshy wild cherry, raspberry, vanilla and mocha alongside chewy tannins. Drink through 2019.",88,Gattavecchi 2011 Poggio alla Sala  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano)
"Soft and direct. Tastes like a liquid granola bar, with melted flavors of raspberries, cocoa, roasted almonds, vanilla, cinnamon and brown sugar. Drink now.",85,Verve 2007 Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"While the producer does have vines in Volnay, this wine comes from the negociant side of the business. The wine has structure and some firm tannins. At this stage, the Volnay roundness lies behind the dry surface. But it does have weight and the potential to age well. Drink from 2021.",90,Maison Jessiaume 2015  Volnay
"This is a beautiful Cabernet for drinking now. It's soft and lush and dry, with complex flavors of red and black currants, sweet herbs and cedar. Shows real class and elegance.",88,Geyser Peak 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Apple and nectarine aromas are clean and snappy, with a hint of yeast-based vanilla. A fresh, citric palate delivers lime, green apple, pineapple and nectarine flavors, while the finish is clean as a new razor, with nothing off, bitter or pithy.",88,Marqués de la Concordia 2013 Vega de la Reina Hacienda Zorita Verdejo (Rueda)
"Forest floor, truffle, new leather and woodland berry scents mingle in the glass. The palate is linear, taut and austere, offering sour cherry, licorice and sage notes, framed by firm acidity and assertive, close-grained tannins that grip the finish. Drink after 2019.",89,Tenuta Valdipiatta 2013  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano

"True to the variety, this expression of Riesling offers touches of nature rubber and kerosene backed by a light and luminous mouthfeel. There's a touch of sweetness as well as a polished mineral aftertaste.",87,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano 2010 Montiggl Riesling (Alto Adige)
"A good Pinot Noir, lusty, dry and fruity, although it's a bit raw in youth. Shows rich cherry marmalade, cola, spice and sandalwood flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. The vineyard is not among the valley's best, but Siduri interprets it as well as anyone.",90,Siduri 2009 Keefer Ranch Pinot Noir (Green Valley)
"Trollinger, also known as Schiava or Vernatsch outside of Germany, is a rarity in the U.S. market, but this delightfully crisp, raspberrry-scented bottling is worth seeking out. It releases sweet raspberry and cherry perfume, but also darker notes of smoke, granite and cedar. Cranberry and strawberry flavors are tingling and tart, framed by tight tannins and a deep granite finish. Drinks well now but should improve further from 2021.",93,Wachtstetter 2013 Steillage Trollinger (Württemberg)
"Odd aromas of talcum powder and bath oils are fragrant but not very wine-like. This is flat on the palate, with very little cut and oily tasting flavors of ripe white fruits.",81,Casa Solar 2011 Viura (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"A dark, masculine, brooding Brunello, with savory aromas of leather and cured meat behind ripe fruit and blackberry. It's tight and clean, with a streamlined mouthfeel that testifies to the wine's firm tannic structure. Executed in a traditional style, it shows possibilities for long-term aging.",91,Altesino 2007  Brunello di Montalcino
"Legendary winemaker Jim Clendenen delivers aromas of sour cherry, dried pine needles, bay leaf and kirsch-like brandy on this wine. The full, dense palate features butter-fried herbs including tarragon, marjoram and black pepper, all laid across a roasted lamb-like gaminess, followed by hints of dark chocolate and mint.",94,Clendenen Family 2009 Le Bon Climat Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"This wine is both fruity and creamy, with a profile that's heavy in tropical peach and vanilla. Medium-bodied and bold, it has a softness to the palate buoyed by natural structure and length.",90,Apsara 2014 River's Reach Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford)
"This garagiste-sized project presents a complex take in this 50% Grenache and 50% Syrah project, with tight boysenberry, slight asphalt, pressed violets and black pepper on the nose. There is a pronounced density of black fruit on the palate, with blueberry dominant, as well as gingerbread warmth, roasted pork, hoisin sauce and a strong tannic grip.",92,Rendarrio Vineyards 2012 First Born King Grenache-Syrah (Paso Robles)
"Sulfur, burnt matchstick and powdered sugar aromas make up the bouquet. This Malbec-derived sparkler is round and full, with a light bubble bead. Heavy, sweet-tasting stone-fruit flavors finish melony and sugary sweet.",84,Reginato 2011 Celestina Método Tradicional Rosé of Malbec (Mendoza)
"Ripe plum, dark coffee and spice flavors join the firm tannins in this intense wine. It has a strong structure that needs to soften to allow the juicy black-currant flavor to surface. Give it 4–5 years.",90,Château Tour Seran 2010  Médoc
"This is a softly floral wine, with citrus and fresh pear notes that accompany green apple. It is ripe and fruity, with a light tang of orange on the finish. Screwcap.",87,Pierre Sparr 2011 Riesling (Alsace)
"Peach and a hint of fresh lettuce are the key aromas to a basic bouquet. This feels solid but pithy, while orange and other generic citrus flavors turn slightly bitter on the finish.",86,Paramus 2014 Verdejo (Rueda)
"Sour and thin, this has green mint, cherry and spice flavors.",82,Cannonball 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Matriarch often measures up to the level of BOND and Harlan Estate itself. It is a blend of various BOND components. The '06 is a classically structured Napa blend, fat and flashy in youth, offering complex waves of blackberry and cherry tart, black currant, cola, licorice and sweet, spicy oak. There's a savory meatiness reminiscent of salty bacon. But the tannins are significant. Drink now through 2018.",94,Matriarch 2006 Red (Napa Valley)
"This cellar-worthy treasure has attention-grabbing spice, leather and smoky oak aromas. Ripe fruit flavors are heavily shaded with undeniably delicious accents of cedar and chocolate. It is bold in flavor, full in body and quite tannic in texture. Hold until at least 2018; the wine should improve even more after that.",93,Hoopes 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This wine is firmly in the herbal-vegetal camp. It smells like yellow tomatoes and tastes like tarragon and parsley, with a full body and soft acidity. It finishes slightly sweet.",86,Langtry 2014 Lillie Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Guenoc Valley)
"Big, fruity, mature wine, showing a petrol character as well as a rounded texture and a shot of minerality. The wine is both chewy and generous, packed with fruit skins and green bean-acidity. It is ready to drink, very fresh.",93,Domaine FL 2008  Savennières-Roche-Aux-Moines
"88-90 Barrel sample. Very sweet fruit, deliciously approachable. Chocolate and ripe black fruit. The layer of tannin is important to keep all this opulence together.",89,Château la Pointe 2008 Barrel sample  (Pomerol)
Pretty mineral tones of delicate talc power and dried flowers frame a powerful wine that reveals a dense core of dried fruit and raisins at its heart. This Amarone is dense and sweet in the mouth with chewy tannins and good length.,90,Sartori 2003 Corte Brà  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
This blend of Pinot Noir and the rare local César grape is as light as red wine can get in Burgundy. This northern region close to Chablis produces bright fruity expressions that attractively balance red cherry flavor with racy acidity. Drink now.,87,Simonnet-Febvre 2014  Irancy
"Rich, soft and luscious, this bottling shows ripe black cherry, caramel, crème brûlée and a tinge of herbs on the nose. It's creamy, dense and smoky once sipped, with baked plum and blackberry-pie flavors laced with vanilla and caramel, proving undeniably delicious and certain to please many palates.",91,Niner 2013 Heart Hill Vineyard Estate Grown Syrah (Paso Robles)
"Saffron and honey accent juicy tropical mango and pineapple aromas in this vibrant yet delicately framed ice wine. The palate is elegantly nuanced with hints of candle wax, herbs and crushed stone; savory spice notes linger on the finish.",87,Leonard Oakes 2011 Ice Wine Vidal Blanc (New York)
"Bristling in acidity and steely in wet stone, this SB is crisp and layered in lemon, with more lemon on the finish. It yearns for shellfish.",88,Ousterhout 2013 Redwood Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Alexander Valley)

"Winemaker: Boela Gerber. This is rich and oaky upfront, with forward scents of honeydew, orange creamsicle, pineapple cake and vanilla bean. Those notes carry through to the medium-bodied palate, alongside notes of wood-grilled peach and toasted walnut that are carried along by a bright seam of orange-flavored acidity. Some time in the cellar will allow the oak to further integrate with the ripe fruit tones; drink 2018–2022.",92,Groot Constantia 2015 Cape Winemakers Guild Auction Chardonnay (Constantia)
"This fresh white wine from Mt. Etna offers pristine aromas of honey, peach cream and white mineral. Lasting notes of brimstone and slate give the wine added dimension and you will surely imagine a natural pairing with seafood or shellfish risotto.",90,Le Vigne di Eli 2007  Etna
"A little too hot and brawny in tannins, which provides a cut across the palate that interferes with pleasure. If you can get past that, the wine is nicely dry and rich in fruit, with cherry, tobacco, spice and oak flavors.",86,Mounts 2007 Estate Grown Cabernet Franc (Dry Creek Valley)
"A zesty nose promises refreshment and poise. The palate not only keeps this promise but tops it. Orange, mandarin and lemon frame riper peach and Mirabelle plum explode like a firework of fruit on the palate. This is fruit-framed, citrus-focused joy, combining immense concentration with immense elegance. There is a long and exciting life ahead of this.",96,Franz Hirtzberger 2013 Singerriedl Smaragd Riesling (Wachau)

Perfect for summer drinking.",89,Viña Casablanca 2011 Nimbus Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"One of a series of releases by this Port producer, this Colheita, or Port from a single harvest, is beautifully poised between red fruits and mature almond and an old gold character. It has intensity, a product of the aging in wood that has just concentrated the wine. Like all Ports of this type, it is ready to drink.",95,Taylor Fladgate 1968 Single Harvest  (Port)
"Sweet, rich, dense, very much of its year. At the same time, there is the Barton touch that leaves some fine elegance, to go with the smoky fruits and richness, while acidity gives it a fine lift.",91,Château Langoa Barton 2003  Saint-Julien
"Violet red in the glass, this wine features a bouquet of cherry, violet and vanilla. Flavors of cherry, blueberry, anise, ground black pepper and green bell pepper are fixed in a framework of tannins that offer full mouthfeel right into the orange peel finish.",91,Pelter 2013 Matar Petit Verdot (Jerusalem Hills)
"One of the smallest crus, Saint-Amour produces firm and structured wines. This Sélection shows both rich black fruit and solid tannins that are typical. Over the next six months, it's likely the fruitiness will become more dominant.",87,Georges Duboeuf 2011 Sélection  (Saint-Amour)
"Racy acidity and oak-inspired lemon, lime and tropical fruit flavors mark this bone-dry, elegant wine, with a minerally edge. Don't drink it too cold.",87,Windsor Oaks 2012 Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This is a thick and savory wine, compressed and somewhat flabby on the palate. A curious nose takes time to develop into full-bodied black cherry and blackberry.",85,Wattle Creek 2013 Grenache (Russian River Valley)
"One of several Pioneer Block Sauvignons now coming out of St. Clair, the 2008 Snap Block leans toward the pungent side of Sauvignon Blanc, with aromas of crushed tomato leaf leading the way. The flavors are decidedly herbal, but, backed by a solid underpinning of citrus fruits, the results are zesty and refreshing.",88,Saint Clair 2008 Pioneer Block #18 Snap Block Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Aromatic hints of creamy stone fruit swirls about the nose. There are hints of Mirabelle plums and yellow pear but on the palate very fine, smoky and exquisitely integrated notes of French oak appear. There is rich vanilla and cream but with a counterpoint of fresh, bright lemony acidity. While stylistically unusual this barrique-aged Grüner certainly is a delicious, creamy and serious wine. You'd never even guess it's already four-years-old. Ready now but will evolve. Drink 2016–2022.",92,Laurenz V. 2012 Four Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"The dominant dark-cherry aroma smells bitter and high pitched. The palate feels supple and medium bodied, and it tastes a touch confected, like blackberry jelly used to fill donuts.",82,Ingleside 2007 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Virginia)
"A very light, almost rustic red that calls for hearty meals. A sonorous note of vanilla-oak amid the cherryish red fruit accompanies the streamlined acidity from start to finish.",89,Bründlmayer 2012 Reserve Zweigelt (Niederösterreich)
"The flavors of sweetened herb tea, pineapple and buttered toast mark this fresh, vibrant young Chardonnay. It's brisk in acidity and dry in the finish. A bit rustic, it's a fine wine to drink now.",86,Sojourn 2012 Campbell Ranch Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"Part of a series of sparkling wines from Piera Martellozzo, this is a blend of Raboso and Pinot Nero. In fact, the wine's bright pink color comes from the former varietal and its delicate floral bouquet from the latter.",86,Piera Martellozzo NV Perle di Piera Pink Pearl Rosé Sparkling (Delle Venezie)
"Barolo Conca opens with inky dark concentration and soothing aromas of black fruit, spice, cola, plum, prune and dried lavender buds. The nose presents those ethereal and delicate aromas, but in the mouth, it delivers thicker flavors of chocolate and mocha. Drink after 2018.",94,Renato Ratti 2007 Conca  (Barolo)
"Lime leaf, white peach and mineral aromas rise up from the glass, with botrytis adding a grace note. The spritzy stone fruit flavors are off dry and show spot on balance.",89,Charles Smith 2014 Kung Fu Girl Riesling (Ancient Lakes)
"Ripe Concord pear and an intriguing, phenolic mouthfeel combine in this highly drinkable light white. There is enough weight to support food and a pleasing hint of savoriness as well as depth.",90,Hugl-Wimmer 2013 Wimmer Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"A big, complex wine from this continually improving property, this is now performing at its classed-growth level with concentrated ripe berry fruits and chocolate flavors. The wood aging is still showing through and needs time to integrate better, but as it does, this will be a great wine.",95,Château Bélair-Monange 2010  Saint-Émilion
"Winemaker John Kinney blends 50% Cabernet Sauvignon from Galles Vineyard with 50% Del Arroyo Vineyard Petite Sirah, trying to take advantage of the Cab's floral, herbal notes and the Petite's concentration and wall of tannins. He has largely succeeded. This dark-black wine is very much full of intense cherry and structured tannins and leathery spice. Petite Sirah lovers will particularly swoon.",88,Occasio 2009 Sotto Voce Red (Livermore Valley)
"Made from Moscato di Canelli, this dessert wine is more like a still wine in bouquet, not exuding sweet as much as floral. On the palate, it's a different story, taking on richness and thickness around flavors of baked apple and nutmeg, finding a good balance on the finish.",88,Benessere 2013 Estate St. Helena Vineyard Moscato (Napa Valley)
Montagny is at the southern end of the Côte Chalonnaise before it merges into Mâcon. That gives this wine its warmth and ripe apple and peach fruits. It is crisp and fresh at the same time with great juicy acidity. The wine has a spicy aftertaste. Drink now.,87,Vignerons de Buxy 2014 Buissonnier  (Montagny)
"At 20g/L of residual sugar, this is sweet enough to work well with spicy dishes, like many curries. Green apple, peach and pineapple flavors show a fine balance of ripeness and acidity on the long, mouthwatering finish.",89,Mt. Difficulty 2014 Roaring Meg Riesling (Central Otago)
"An attractively fruity wine, this is rich in cherry and light spice flavors and is laden with acidity. It has a dry set of tannins, but it is so densely juicy that it is ready to drink now.",89,Clos de Haute-Combe 2011  Juliénas
"This Tuscan blend of 85% Sangiovese, 7% Ciliegiolo, 5% Canailo and 3% Malvasia opens with aromas of underbrush, oak and a whiff of farmyard. The palate is tired. While you can detect black cherry, plum, black pepper and espresso, the fruit is starting to fade, leaving astringent tannins unsustained by fruit richness.",84,Castellaccia 2008 Riserva  (Morellino di Scansano)
"Tangy and zesty, this crisp wine shows a strong sense of chalky terroir, with a mineral edge and tight acidity. These elements mean the wine will take time to age. Drink from 2021.",91,Bouchard Aîné et Fils 2015 Le Porusot Premier Cru  (Meursault)
"This wood-aged wine conveys mint aromas and new-wood flavors. It is rich, full in the mouth and developing quickly. The black currant fruitiness is fresh, giving a delicious, juicy wine to drink from 2016.",87,Les Hauts de Tousquiron 2012 Cuvée Lucie  (Médoc)
"Whatever the Jackson family does in Santa Maria works quite well, including this wine. The wondrous nose shows chives, exotic pears, mandarin pith, sesame seeds, a touch of smoke and chalky grip. On the palate, flavors recall fried green apple peels, lemon juice, quince, star fruit and lemon pith.",92,Kendall-Jackson 2013 Jackson Estate Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"Deep and hearty black cherry, vanilla, cola and black-pepper aromas make for a lush, imposing and yet classic nose on this bottling. It's simultaneously soft and powerful on the palate, with black-cherry foam, crème de cassis, vanilla custard and melted milk-chocolate flavors set against a backbone of vibrant acidity and plush tannins. It's a decadent mouthful.",92,Peachy Canyon 2014 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)
"Creamy vanilla and pear pie provide a fleshy and full-bodied texture to this wine, which leans tropical in guava and melon. Aged in entirely neutral oak, the fruit shows well within a wave of ripeness.",87,Sanglier Cellars 2014 River Tusque Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"Pale salmon colored, this is a straightforward summer sipper with notes of cherry, watermelon, and wet stone. It drinks dry with a hint of effervescence and tart flavors.",85,Waterbrook 2012 Rosé Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a fat, soft and smooth wine. It has juicy red fruit and acidity, with light tannins that lend support. It's ready to drink.",84,Terre de Vignerons 2016 Le Phare Merlot Merlot (Atlantique)
"Red plum and scratchy, herbal aromas form a decent bouquet. This Cab is modest and edgy in feel, with equally raw and edgy red-berry flavors that finish quick and punchy.",84,Acordeón 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Smoky flint and crushed mineral tones contrast concentrated raspberry and strawberry flavors in this richly concentrated rosé. Full bodied and supple in texture, it's sturdy enough to accompany heartier fish and fowl dishes far beyond the summer months. Sunny acidity brightens the finish.",88,Lamoreaux Landing 2015 Dry Rosé (Finger Lakes)
"This is roasted, savory and spicy up front, with solid berry aromas. It feels crisp and fresh, with a blend of cherry, strawberry and herb flavors. It's spicy, lively, fresh and clean on the finish.",87,Vaza 2008 Crianza  (Rioja)
"This is a perfumed wine. Although the tannins are still firm from 14 months in new oak, it does have fine, fragrant red-fruit and acidity. The texture is dense, still young, and will be fine from 2019.",87,Château Tertre de Belves 2014  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux
"This ripe and soft wine has a great balance between the rich red berry fruits, bright cherries and acidity. The structure is full, generous and gives the wine a comfortable feel. Acidity at the end lends a fresher aspect. Drink from 2017.",88,Domaine Parigot 2013 Les Peuillets Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune)
"This is classic in herbaceous aromas and flavors, rich in juicy blackberry and blueberry while also offering savory pencil shavings and dark chocolate. Leathered, firm tannins complete the picture, providing structure and integration to a wall of well-managed oak.",90,Arrowood 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
Zippy acidity drives this dry medium-bodied Riesling. Its fresh green-apple and lime flavors are delicate in concentration but refreshingly crisp. Drink now through 2020.,87,Barnstormer 2015 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Scents of roses and cherries fill the nose, followed by raspberries and light milk chocolate in the mouth. There's a suggestion of wet stone also. The balance is good, although the wine skirts the edge of being a bit too thin on the finish.",87,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2011 Tualatin Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"All the parts of this juvenile wine have not begun to come together. You have ripe, jammy blackberry, cassis and blueberry flavors, firm tannins, evident new oak, and crisp acidity. All they need is time to marry. The wine is 100% Cabernet, and the grapes used to be vineyard-designated by Beringer. Cellar until at least late 2008, and the wine should improve for many years.",91,Corley 2004 State Lane Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville)
"The slightest touch of wildfire kicks off the nose, followed by aromas of hibiscus, light cranberry, dried rose petal, roasted pork shank and white pepper. It's quite light upon first sip, then a peppery intensity builds as flavors of underripe raspberry, fresh thyme and dewy oregano arise. For a lighter style of the grape, it's a classic, and stays fresh for days.",94,Chanin 2014 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"Hints of honeycomb and beeswax add heft to the notes of fresh green flower and sweet citrus. Ripe yet elegantly composed, this has concentrated fruit flavors that extend onto a long, honeysuckle-kissed finish.",88,Penguin Bay 2011 Pinot Grigio (Finger Lakes)
"Very laid back, the nose shows some mango and pear, but you really have to go looking for them. In contrast, the palate is almost pushy–this is a big, fat intense wine. Essentially quite simple, but very tasty. Short to medium finish.",85,Il Falchetto 2006 Tenuta Del Fant  (Moscato d'Asti)
"Flashy and flamboyant, but smells and tastes overoaked, with buttered toast, caramel and vanilla meringue notes swamping the underlying tangerine, lemon and mango fruit. Drink now.",86,Dutton Estate 2009 Dutton Palms Vineyard Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Gentle friendly notes of yellow mirabelle plum play on the nose. The palate is equally fruity and appetizing, chock-full of fruit and freshness. Drink soon.",88,Dopff & Irion 2015 Cuvée René Dopff Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
"A pretty peachy color, this bottling, which is 100% Mourvèdre, shows an intriguingly salty strawberry hint to the nose, where dried cherries and brisk watermelon aromas also pop. There is zesty acidity to the sip with richness in the midpalate, offering flavors of sea-salted peaches, orange-rind tang and impressive length for a rosé.",90,Liquid Farm 2015 Vogelzang Vineyard Rosé (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
"Fairly tannic, this Merlot has some ripe, even sweet, cherry fruit. It's done in a light style, but it feels and tastes ripe, which means the winemaker knew what he was doing. A lovely effort that takes full advantage of the character of the region's fruit. —P.G.",88,Ste. Chapelle 2000 Winemaker's Series Merlot (Idaho)
"Reduced and extracted, with 10% Syrah blended in, this big-boned wine imparts big tannins around a taste of boysenberry, strawberry and tobacco.",87,Meeker 2013 Barrel Select Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"Squeaky-fresh lemon and lime shine a spotlight against sweet melon and stone fruit flavors in this gossamer-textured spätlese. It's dancingly delicate, yet deeply penetrating on the palate, finishing on lingering notes of hazelnut and white flowers.",93,Schloss Johannisberger 2013 Grünlack Spätlese Riesling (Rheingau)
"Nice manners and medium body make this an easy-drinking, lighter wine. The aromas are like cherries and strawberries, the fruit flavors are almost sweet, and the texture is soft and smooth.",86,R35 2013 Zinfandel (Lodi)
"Lovely aromatics mix floral, fruit and barrel components in equal proportion. The wine has some solid tannins, and sits in the mouth with a bit of gravitas. Wild cherry, raspberry, fresh herb, and a little stiffness to the finish. Definitely a wine to age a few more years.",89,Bethel Heights 2008 Flat Block Estate Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Like the label says, this is an everyday sort of wine. It's crisp in acids and off-dry, with pleasant orange, pineapple, lemon and vanilla flavors.",84,Dreaming Tree 2012 Everyday White (Central Coast)
"Solid fruit brings firm, taut black cherry and cola flavors to the front. This is a muscular, flavorful, somewhat blocky wine that brings Pinot Noir up to burger wine status—and you may take that as a compliment. Some barrel toast adds butter and almond to the finish.",89,Kason 2006 Black Label Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"The 10% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend adds extra muscle to this toasty, sleek wine. It's light but polished, with pretty scents and flavors of rose water and raspberries. The generous acidity of the grape keeps it lively and fresh.",88,Novelty Hill 2011 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Chopped mint, menthol, blue flower and red berry aromas take the lead in this wine. The taut palate offers Marasca cherry, raspberry, star anise and ground clove flavors alongside fine-grained tannins.",90,Rivetti Massimo 2014 Froi  (Barbaresco)
"There is already a hint of tawniness to this wine (second bottle— first was TCA-infected) that suggests a short life ahead. It's charming at the moment, surprisingly far along the aging curve, but with pretty cherry fruit and some sandalwood in the tannins. Drink up.",85,Longplay 2009 Lia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"With fruit from the Aube and from the Côte des Blancs, Drappier has been able to put together a blend of Chardonnay from four different vineyards. In taste, warmth dominates—this is not a hugely crisp wine, the richness prevailing. But the warm pear and peach flavors all come together, a wine that is in the Drappier pure fruit style.",88,Drappier NV Quattuor Blanc de Quatre Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)
"This soft and fruity wine is crisp, fragrant and fresh. It has light acidity that balances with the forward apple flavor, as well as a dry lime edginess and nervy texture. Drink now. Screwcap.",86,DFJ Vinhos 2012 Paxis Branco Arinto (Lisboa)
"Shows some notes of mold or vegetables, marring an otherwise fine wine. It's pale in color, dry and crisp in acidity, with a beautifully silky texture and flavors of cola and cherries.",83,W.H. Smith 2008 Umino Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Named after the series of vineyard terraces that rise steeply from the Lot river, this wine is soft and easily accessible. It does have the Malbec structure although this is comfortably balanced by the black fruit and acidity. The wine will be ready to drink from 2017.",85,Rigal 2014 Les Terrasses Malbec (Cahors)
"Lots to like in this Cabernet, which has ripe, juicy flavors of blackberry, plum, dark chocolate and flashy oak. Made thoroughly in the modern style, it's marked by soft tannins and a certain uniformity. Drink now.",87,Emblem 2008 Oso Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A soft, open wine, kept together by its dry tannins. Good black fruits, fresh acidity and an attractive smoky character.",85,Château Monroze 2008  Bordeaux Supérieur
"Ripe berry, black cherry and leather aromas come together nicely in front of a creamy palate with just enough acid-tannin tension. Lightly herbal, spicy blackberry flavors are savory rather than dark and fruity. The wine tastes spicy and peppery on a finish that feels right.",89,Catania 2014 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"Made from Cold Creek and Wahluke Slope fruit, this pure Syrah is compact and dense, and it reveals blueberry and boysenberry flavors that are set in a frame of coffee-flavored tannins. The acids are suggestive of lemon verbena, and the 15.5% alcohol shows a little heat in the the throat.",89,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2009 Ethos Reserve Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Several varieties figure into this blend, from 26% Zinfandel and 21% Syrah to smaller amounts of Merlot, Petite Sirah, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon. Big and powerful in smoky leather and black currant, it offers a rich softness on the palate, with a tightly wound savory, peppery aspect to the finish.",90,Roth 2012 Heritage Red (Sonoma County)
"A very nice wine for drinking now with roasts and Italian fare. It's a light- to medium-boded wine, marked by cherry, red currant, bacon and spice flavors brightened by a bite of acidity.",87,Sausal 2007 Estate Grown Sangiovese (Alexander Valley)
"Stony polished white-fruit aromas are lean and clean. This brut nature shows modest heft as it expands on the palate, but mostly this is racy and fit. Yeasty flavors of white pepper and lime finish with a leesy note and stoniness.",89,Cave Geisse 2013 Brut Nature Sparkling (Pinto Bandeira)
"Stainless steel-fermented and kept on the lees for two months, this new vintage still feels a bit dilute—a function of the low brix and difficult vintage. Pungent with scents and flavors of rosemary and citrus, it is best drunk chilled and young.",86,Walnut City WineWorks 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"Fermented in stainless steel, this is a crisp white with decent acidity that traffics in pomelo, white fig and peach fuzz. It stays light in style and refreshing before finishing with a somewhat diluted feel.",87,Napa Cellars 2014 Classic Collection Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
88–90. Barrel sample. This dry wine is balanced by a dark concentration of juicy fruit. It has enough density of both black fruit and dry tannins to promise good aging.,89,Château Coufran 2012 Barrel Sample  (Haut-Médoc)
"Aromas espresso, toasted oak and a whiff of exotic spice lead the nose while the evolved palate shows mocha, oak and a note of dried black cherry before a rather abrupt finish. It's shy on freshness and lacks the fruit richness needed to stand up to the dominant wood sensations.",87,Gianni Gagliardo 2009 Preve Riserva  (Barolo)
"Maybe a little more ripe and heady than some of its Chilean buddies, but this SB from Montes offers freshness, zip and good citrus, tarragon and other green-herb flavors. The feel is good, the character fresh, and the finish long and clean. Offers maybe a little more green-leaf character than some might like, but overall this is another fine value SB from Chile. Drink immediately.",87,Montes 2007 Classic Series Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca-Curicó Valley)
"A fairly standard Chardonnay, rich in oak, lees and ripe citrus and tropical fruit flavors, but raised up by brisk acidity and a fine minerality that gives it extra complexity. It's rich with honey and brown sugar, but doesn't feel cloying.",86,Icaria 2012 Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"Freshly baked bread, toasted hazelnut, yellow apple, ginger, subtle oak and vanilla are some of the sensations conveyed by this sophisticated sparkler. Made from 100% Chardonnay, it boasts a remarkably refined mousse and bright acidity. It also has great length and a crisp, dry finish.",91,Ferrari 2006 Riserva Lunelli Chardonnay (Trento)
"Coffee, beef stock, blackberry and graphite aromas require patience to process. A lively, ringing palate is jammy at its essence. Dark, toasty flavors of blackberry and blueberry are mildly green and herbal. It feels rubbery on a tannic finish.",89,Finca Flichman 2015 Paisaje de Tupungato Malbec (Mendoza)
"Ripe, rich and creamy, this is a dense wine from the lees aging. Spice and a touch of toast come from the wood aging that smooths the wine and gives it extra complexity. This is a rich wine, with a tangy aftertaste, that is ready to drink.",88,Borges 2015 Reserva White (Douro)
"Bursting with sweet toast from the barrel aging, this offers ripe and pretty berry fruit, deep and long, with highlights of oolong tea. The alcohol is not intrusive, and the acidity keeps it buoyed and lively.",95,Sequel 2008 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Made in limited quantities by consulting winemaker Paul Hobbs, this is 100% varietal from a single vineyard, aged entirely in new French oak. Soft and malleable tannins manage its tangy, succulent blue fruit, supporting all that full-bodied ripeness and girth.",92,Black Cordon 2012 The Black Cordon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Dating back to the early Middle Ages, the estate is based around an ancient chateau. The wine, from old vines, is structured and dense with firm tannins and ripe black-plum fruits. It shows fine acidity at the end. Drink from 2019.",88,Château Roustaing 2016 Vieilles Vignes  (Bordeaux)
"This opens with soft, bright fruit nuances of raspberry and crème de cassis and a smooth, polished quality of tannins. It finishes with a warming earthy tone of wild mushroom.",90,Fratelli Casetta 2007 Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"Reserved green apple, lees, flower and mineral aromas lead to off-dry green apple and stone fruit flavors. The acidity gives the palate some snap.",89,Savage Grace 2014 Underwood Mountain Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Gorge (WA))
"This Priorat-like blend of 50% Grenache, 28% Syrah, and 22% Mourvèdre is pungent and spicy, with a bit of menthol in the nose. Supple and luxurious fruit, a mix of raspberry and black fruits, baking spices, sweet barrel flavors. Powerful and rich, this is a big wine with tobacco and clove highlights and a little heat in the finish.",94,Gramercy 2009 The Third Man Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"From the family behind Bosquet des Papes in Châteauneuf, this is a solid Côtes du Rhône, with modest tannins but decent structure and typical notes of leather, dried cherries, chocolate and cinnamon. Drink it over the next few years.",87,Domaine Nicolas Boiron 2008 Red (Côtes du Rhône)
"Aromas of citrus, white stone fruit and a vegetal hint suggesting tomato leaf lead the way. The racy palate offers grapefruit, pineapple, fresh white peach and flinty mineral while a pleasantly bitter note closes the finish.",90,Cottanera 2015 Bianco  (Etna)
"This wine is soft, fruity, rounded and red fruit flavored. Soft tannins and black plum skins give the wine a light structure. The wine is developing well and will be ready to drink from 2016.",87,Casca Wines 2014 Cascas Winemaker Selection Red (Douro)
"This bottling blends 60% Monterey County, 23% Santa Barbara County and 17% Sonoma County fruit to deliver bright and juicy berries on the nose, from strawberry to blackberry as well as graphite and tree bark. The flavors are very full, with more berries and star anise, although the texture is somewhat simple.",88,Meiomi 2016 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County-Monterey County-Santa Barbara County)
"This multigrape blend opens with spicy aromas of baked plum, tomato and cumin. The mouthfeel is fresh and dry, with focus. In terms of flavors, it's earthy, with baked berry, baking spice and licorice notes. The finish is smooth and earthy tasting, with roundness. Drink now through 2016.",90,Marques de Griñon 2007 + Summa  Varietals Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon-Petit Verdot Red (Dominio de Valdepusa)
"Pleasant and tasty, this has the raspberry, lime, dough and smoke flavors typical of a fine California sparkling wine. It's a little scoury, especially by the standards of Iron Horse, with a sand­papery roughness to its bubbles. Drink it now, well chilled.",86,Iron Horse 2007 Classic Vintage Brut Sparkling (Green Valley)
"Sweet and simple, with sugary flavors of blackberry and cherry jam and smoky vanilla. Almost like a dessert wine.",82,Cupcake 2007 Merlot (Central Coast)
"A bold white wine, it smells and tastes like grapefruit, canteloupe and very crisp apples. It has a fresh, acidic texture that cleans the palate and makes the mouth water, but wraps in enough richness for good balance.",87,Steven Kent 2013 Lola Sauvignon Blanc (Livermore Valley)
"Well-rounded and integrated strawberry, black plum and licorice aromas show on the nose of this appellation blend from Paso Robles' most exciting Italian variety producer. It's light and easy on the palate, with red plum, cranberry and chaparral herb flavors packed tightly with tannin. It's good now but will improve with age.",90,Giornata 2014 Sangiovese (Paso Robles)
"This wine is from the home vineyard of the Larochette family. It has produced a ripe, still young wine that is full of yellow fruits. Hints of butter and vanilla add a rich dimension to this full-bodied wine. Drink now.",88,Domaine Fabrice Larochette 2015 Le Château de Chaintré  (Mâcon Chaintré)
"This blend is made with 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot—all Conner Lee fruit. Firm and supple, it's loaded with raspberry and cherry fruit that goes deep and stays balanced. One-quarter new French oak was used.",92,:Nota Bene 2010 Conner Lee Vineyard Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Despite being an Extra Dry Prosecco Superiore, this shows more dryness than it does sweetness. The finish is tonic and firm, with notes of white flower, peach and honey.",87,"Foss Marai NV Strada di Guia, 109 Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)"
"Just off-dry, this is a smooth, caramel and red fruit flavored wine. It has plenty of acidity to balance its soft texture, with red currant freshness coming in at the end. Drink now.",86,José Maria da Fonseca 2014 Periquita Rosé (Península de Setúbal)
"Spicy, fruity and nicely rounded, this wine boasts great flavor intensity without the sharp points sometimes associated with Montepulciano. It's an easy, approachable wine perfect for everyday dining with solid tannins and good length.",86,Masciarelli 2003  Montepulciano d'Abruzzo
"Boysenberry, cherry and a touch of minerality take over the nose on this wine from Mike Rennie and Gary Winder, who are pioneering grape growers of the Temecula Valley. Tar and tobacco pair up with bright acidity and smooth oakiness on the palate, making for easy drinking.",87,Leoness 2011 Lopez Ranch Vineyard Selection Zinfandel (South Coast)
"This starts off sweet and unctuous, with scents of superripe nectarine and apricot that flood the bouquet, followed by hints of baking spice, lightly toasted nuts and honey. The full, round texture is balanced by refreshing acidity that carries through to the long, bright finish. Drink now–2016.",90,Fleur Du Cap 2010 Noble Late Harvest Bergkelder Selection White (Stellenbosch)
"Made from organically farmed grapes, this is a simple Merlot for everyday fare. It offers a pretty fragrance of red berry and white pepper accompanied by raspberry, cherry and red currant flavors with a hint of pepper.",85,Pizzolato 2012 NSA Merlot (Veneto)
"From the Evergreen Vineyard, in the Ancient Lakes region north of the Wahluke Slope, this is surprisingly high-powered, at 13.9% alcohol, with a big smack of oak in the nose. That oak is wrapped around green banana and green apple fruit, with a little vanilla on the side. As young as it is, it seems likely to knit together and improve over the next year or two.",88,Milbrandt 2009 Evergreen Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Vibrant aromas of lychee, white flowers and spice give way to off-dry fruit flavors, with the concentration seeming a bit light. Still, it delivers a lot of appeal.",88,Pacific Rim 2015 Twin Vineyards Gewürztraminer (Yakima Valley)
"Pear drop, leafy arugula and faint lemon form the aromatic trio that governs nose and palate of this light, refreshing white. Drink soon.",87,Höpler 2014 Grüner Veltliner (Burgenland)
"Amarone sometimes benefits from a tiny dash of volatility (that usually comes across with aromas that resemble red apple or cider), but in this case those notes have turned to apple sauce and ultimately distract from the overall picture. The wine is chewy and bright in the mouth with firm tannins.",85,Pietro Clementi 2004  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"Grainy oak and green aromas rest on top of generic red-fruit scents. This feels chunky, blocky and tannic, with herbaceous medicinal flavors of tomato, oak resin and green herbs. A spicy saucy-tasting finish holds onto the wine's minty green herbal essence.",84,Loscano 2010 Gran Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Luján de Cuyo)
"This 100% varietal wine hails entirely from Hyde Vineyard, a meticulously farmed and magical site. With a rich nose leading the way, it shows dusty licorice and chocolate plum. Voluptuously well crafted, it finishes in a lengthy tinge of baking spice.",93,Duckhorn 2013 Merlot (Carneros)
"Ripe raisiny aromas are soft, maybe to a fault. This feels wide, grabby and modest in structure. Jammy raspberry and raisin flavors finish plump and easy, with low acidity. Drink now.",88,Ardales 2011 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"The nose is tightly closed, yet there is the suspicion of fine fruit. The grippy palate brims with peppery dark-plum fruit and very fine distinct tannins that give this a taut, rigid frame that still needs to relax. This is unusual in so far that it is a Cabernet Franc from Austria, grown on slate. It works well: The tannic structure and fruit are fully expressed. This needs bottle age and will blossom into a far more relaxed and fruitful wine. Drink 2020–2030.",92,Gunter Triebaumer 2014 Gillesberg Cabernet Franc (Burgenland)
"Hints of anise, black pepper and toasted coconut make this dark, smoky Merlot a bit exotic and unexpected. Full-bodied with a concentrated yet vibrant black fruit palate, it ends with flair on a rather tropical coconut finish.",87,Keswick Vineyards 2009 Merlot (Monticello)
"Here's a big, lush Cab, appealing now for its jammy blackberry, cherry, currant and chocolate flavors. But the tannins make for an unsettled astringency that needs rich meats to cut through. Fine now with complex beef dishes, but better after 2010.",88,St. Clement 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Firm tannins mark this as a wine for aging. At the same time, the sweet and ripe fruit gives weight and richness. Wood flavors just creep in to round out the tannins at the end. Keep for 7–8 years.",90,Château Fonréaud 2006  Listrac-Médoc
"The wine has fine, juicy fruit over smooth tannins. Its smoky flavors, touches of wood aging and rich tannic structure are integrating well. It will be ready to drink from 2020.",90,Château Baracan 2015  Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux
"A unique version of Andrew Will's Champoux, this is more than half Cabernet Franc, with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot filling in the rest. Thick and tannic, yet perfectly ripe and almost silky, it coats the palate with black cherry, graphite, slate and a bit of chalk. All that said, the fruit more than holds its own against the terroir's minerality. Drink this with your best steak, and give it plenty of breathing time.",95,Andrew Will 2007 Champoux Vineyard Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Structured wine with 30% of Cabernet to give shape to the very ripe Merlot. The wine has both acidity, some firm tannins and a concentrated, dry core. It's likely to age well over 3–4 years.",85,Domaine de Courteillac 2010  Bordeaux Supérieur
"Already delicious, this wine shows its wood aging with such finesse, while letting its elegant white-fruit flavor come through. It has an herbaceous edge, rounded out with a more ripe fruit character. This is meant for aging.",93,Château Latour-Martillac 2009  Pessac-Léognan
"Soft and rounded, this has an attractive fresh-fruit character. It's warm with a yellow fruit flavor; a crisp touch of grapefruit tempers the richness.",86,Pierre André 2010 Réserve  (Bourgogne)
"Beautiful savoriness rises from the glass—pepper and yeast, but also something of pine and watercress. The palate swings with all of these flavors and embeds them on a rich cushion of gentle fruit: ripe yellow pear and juicy yellow plum. The white pepper always edges its way in and tempers the generosity of the fruit. This simply is gorgeous and very moreish.",94,Eichinger 2015 Ried Lamm Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"Generous fruit flavors of strawberry preserves are the focus of this full-throttle Pinot Noir. Stone fruits and anise, along with a butterscotch vein from barrel aging, add further interest. Drink this over the near term.",89,Vista Hills 2009 Skyraider Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Dusty cedar and Bourbon-barrel notes dominate fruit on this unusual blend of New York Blaufränkisch and California Valdiguié, Petit Verdot and Syrah grapes. It's a delicate, wispy wine, with faint streaks of crisp red cherry and plum, but it finishes warmly on a vanilla spice note.",85,Cereghino Smith 2012 Super Hudson Red (America)
"Tight and earthy, this spent 18 months in French oak—30% new. Flavors of wild berry and light chocolate are set in a tightly wound wine, with a strong mineral accent and drying tannins.",87,Foris 2008 Siskiyou Terrace Cabernet Franc (Rogue Valley)
"Passion fruit, citrus and other nice aromatics make for a pretty nose, which is followed by genuinely good and correct flavors such as grapefruit, lemon and citrus rind. The finish is also quite nice, with a certain roundness and acidity that makes it tantalizing and tasty.",89,Bernardus 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey)
"This charming red opens with aromas of woodland berry and violet. The savory, easy-drinking palate offers plum, black cherry, a hint of spice and a smoky note alongside soft, polished tannins. Enjoy soon.",87,Val di Botte 2013  Chianti
"This tiny production Chardonnay shows the hallmarks of Edna Valley. It's bright and brisk in acidity, very clean and dry, and classically pure in lime, kiwi and papaya fruit. Bring on the Dungeness crab and buttered sourdough bread and enjoy.",90,Tolosa 2010 Edna Ranch Block 569 Chardonnay (Edna Valley)
"Initially this smells closed, charred, oaky and minty more than lush and fruity, but with airing things get reversed. The palate is rich, ripped and juicy, with excellent structure. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, spice and reedy tobacco finish dry, powerful and with a strong note of licorice. Drink through 2020.",92,Losada 2010 Altos de Losada Mencía (Bierzo)
"Tan in color, with stale aromas of apple cider, this feels simple, like fruit juice. Plain and straight, this tastes sour and spent, while citric flavors mix with tart apple notes on the finish.",81,Bodegas Aquitania 2014 Bernon Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"This 100% Grenache pink wine kicks off with a fairly light nose that shyly presents steely aromas of lemon wedge. There is a firm structure to the sip, where pink grapefruit and other citrus elements ride a chalky structure. Texture is key here.",88,Archium 2015 Rosé (Santa Barbara County)
"Subtle scents of white flower and peanut shell meld with core aromas of tropical fruits. The palate feels viscous and open knit, and the residual sugar makes for a clingy finish.",84,CrossKeys 2011 Ali d'Oro White (Virginia)
"This blends estate-grown Wädenswil and Dijon 115 clones into a briary, open and forward expression that accents its core of cherry fruit with a dash of cola. It lightens up as it finishes but remains nicely balanced and layered, with subtle hints of chicken stock.",90,Fairsing 2015 Dardis Pinot Noir
"Green notes reminiscent of tomato leaves accent fig and melon flavors. It's only medium in body, but comes across as otherwise ripe in style, with a medium-length finish.",88,Astrolabe 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Pale gold-colored wine from an exceptional vineyard. The warmth of the volcanic soil gives richness to the fruit while still keeping some feeling of dryness. It has weight, dried spice and pepper. Honeyed fruits show right at the end. Drink from 2014.",93,Domaine Schoffit 2009 Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Clos Saint-Théobald Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc offers aromas of red and black berries, bell pepper and cedar. The palate delivers concentrated blackberry, cherry, chocolate and spice. It has rich flavors but lacks freshness and energy.",88,Pratesi 2009 Carmione Red (Toscana)
"Give this gorgeous wine a few more years in the bottle so that the evident oak tones become tame and supple. You can count on the wine's aromas of cherry, blackberry and plum to carry it forward. At this young stage, however, those oak shadings are too evident and the wine is in its infancy. Drink after 2012.",91,Feudi di San Gregorio 2005 Serpico Aglianico (Irpinia)
"Soft and smooth around the edges, this Rhône-style red blend is made mostly from Grenache and is nevertheless assertive in its earthy, spicy aromas and baked fruit flavors. The texture feels polished while the fine tannins and acidity keep it firm enough to be appetizing.",88,Sol Rouge 2012 Gypsy Rouge Red (Red Hills Lake County)
"Dried apple skin, lemon peel and jasmine aromas make for a pleasant nose in this widely available screwcap bottling. The palate is tangy, with sour orange notes accenting its more rounded stone fruit flavor, making for a solid weeknight sipper.",86,Las Palmeras 2014 Chardonnay (Monterey County)
"Superripe Grenache gives this fortified dessert wine (16% alcohol) distinctly chocolaty overtones, but there's also an overripe note of prunes. Despite that, it doesn't pack the alcoholic punch or massive weight of Port, making it relatively easy to drink, with an affinity for chocolate desserts.",86,Les Clos de Paulilles 2005 Rimage  (Banyuls)
"Lightly aromatic, it offers notes of pencil shavings, dark fruit, coffee and pepper. It's medium bodied with a lower alcohol feel and abundant coffee flavors backed by gritty tannins.",87,Reustle 2012 Prayer Rock Vineyards Winemaker's Reserve Syrah (Umpqua Valley)
"This wine is lush, with aromas of cassis, lavender and kirsch enveloped in wafts of church incense. Bright cherry and violet meld with velvety tannins and delicate acidity. The finish is long and full of cedar and botanicals.",89,Veramar 2015 JB Winemaker Series Merlot (Virginia)
"This entry level cuvée is finished with a screw cap, and pulled from a mix of barrels and clones from across the estate. It's forward, fruity and big, like an especially bold Beaujolais. Along with primary berry fruit there are light touches of pine needle and chocolate. It's full bodied and ready to go with your winter meal's roasted fowl.",90,WillaKenzie Estate 2014 Gisèle Pinot Noir
"The wines from this remote ranch off of Jalama Road combine mossy forest-floor touches with dark hearty aromas, in this case showing pine, rust, juniper, thyme and purple fruit on the nose. The texture is grippy, and there is cranberry fruit in the background, but the palate's attention turns mostly to eucalyptus, dark spice and even tobacco toward the finish.",93,JCR 2014 Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
"Jumpy, bright berry and currant aromas come with a scent of wet dog fur. This is fresh but shallow, with simple, lively cherry and plum flavors. On the finish, this is easy and friendly but it evaporates quickly.",87,Zuccardi 2013 Serie A Santa Rosa Bonarda (Mendoza)
"For being one of the more widely available Chardonnays around, this vintage performs strongly against more expensive wines. Pineapple, vanilla and light caramel aromas lead the nose, while vibrant acidity kicks off the palate. Pear, Gala apple and pineapple flavors make it a reliable weeknight sipper.",88,Edna Valley Vineyard 2015 Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"Black cherries, turned loam and black slate swirl into a standard nose for this winery's workhorse bottling. It's quite tasty on the palate, with blackberries and boysenberries finding complexity amid licorice, slate and black dirt.",89,Jaffurs 2012 Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"Tannic and concentrated, this is a powerful wine from its first moment. Ripe perfumes confirm the wine's richness, while acidity and density show strongly. Power and concentration match big berry fruit and finishing acidity.",95,C. da Silva 2011 Dalva Distinctive Vintage  (Port)
"A fruity, juicy wine with balanced tannins and red fruits. It is a lively perfumed wine that has some toasty tannins in the background. Drink this ripe wine from 2019. One of five wineries owned by Bernadette Faure and Alain Aubert; their daughters oversee vineyards, winemaking and marketing.",90,Château German 2014  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux
"Exciting, fresh and full of spicy, toasted undertones, this wine immediately calls for a food pairing of a richer seafood (think oysters, crab) or poultry. The flavors are balanced and buoyed by crispness, but the wine still offers complexity and a lingering finish.",87,Lamoreaux Landing 2006 Estate Bottled Reserve Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"A single vineyard wine, with light soil producing a fruity style of Riesling, fragrant and fresh. It has currant and spiced pear flavors, with a bright texture. It is ready to drink.",87,Jean Becker 2009 Lerchenberg Riesling (Alsace)
"Black cherry to the eye, this wine has a bouquet of raspberry and Mediterranean herbs with a strong note of lavender. It is well-crafted, with flavors of cherry, blackberry, smoked meat, thyme and black pepper. Silky tannins line the palate, and the finish offers a burst of cranberry and pomegranate.",92,Yatir 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Judean Hills)
"Robust black-fruit aromas of berry and cassis come with a mild animal note and leathery scents. This is jammy and a bit loud in terms of mouthfeel, while flavors of raisin, berry and chocolate finish meaty and loamy. Drink  through 2017.",90,Campo Alegre 2011  Toro
"This dessert-style wine is very fruity, quite sweet and boosted in alcohol. It has a spicy, earthy aroma, lots of plum and prune flavors, a rich mouthfeel and lingering finish.",88,Shenandoah Vineyards 2013 Black Muscat Muscat Hamburg (Amador County)
"A barrel-fermented Chardonnay with creamy texture, this opens with bright, prominent Meyer lemon notes before delving into softer flavors of pear and vanilla on the midpalate. The acidity holds through to the finish, accented by a touch of honey.",90,B.R. Cohn 2011 Sangiacomo Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros)
"The Loureiro is the grape of the Lima Valley subregion in Vinho Verde. The texture of the wine is rounded and creamy, although the crisp green fruits give a great bright lift to this delicious, fresh wine.",90,Quinta do Ameal 2009 Loureiro (Vinho Verde)
"Pinay is a tight and defined red blend from northern Italy with bright accents of cherry cola, forest berry, licorice and dark mineral. There's a sharp, sour note on the close that would pair with smoked cheese.",87,Attilio Ghisolfi 2007 Pinay Red (Langhe)
"Probably the best wine we've tasted from Santos Beck. This has a jammy, meaty nose accented by hard spices, while the palate is creamy and a touch brambly. Coffee, pepper and tannins work the finish. Drink now.",85,Santos Beck 2004 Gran Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Concentrated black fruit flavors are pleasant but obscured by generous oak treatment and slightly confectionery flavors of cherry vanilla and mocha chocolate. Hints of tree bark and green, vinous flavors peep through cream and vanilla notes on the midpalate.",84,Hudson-Chatham 2010 Field Stone Old Stones and Old Vines Baco Noir (New York)
"Leafy underbrush, scorched earth, tobacco, vanilla, toasted oak and spiced plum aromas lead the nose. The smooth palate offers crushed black cherry, game, grilled herb, espresso and cooking spice. Firm, fine-grained tannins provide support.",90,Cecchi 2011 Riserva di Famiglia  (Chianti Classico)
"Great structure on this Cab, with firm tannins and a fine hit of acidity. It's ripe and appealing with black cherries, cherry liqueur, vanilla and oak. Already throwing significant sediment, it should continue to evolve in interesting ways for a few more years.",90,Windsor Oaks 2008 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Chalk Hill)
"The wood that dominated during the futures tastings in 2008 has calmed down, merging more easily into the rich fruits. There is an attractive smoky character, focused berry flavors and delicious spice. It should age well over 3–5 years.",91,Château du Tertre 2007  Margaux
"Ripe notions of juicy peach and yellow pear rise from the glass. Around the edges they have an aromatic touch of grapefruit zest. That zesty notion remains a constant fixture on the very rich medium-sweet palate, countering the luscious richness of the fruit which shines with honeyed peach, juicy pear and ripe tangerine. It is the zestiness that frames everything on this rich powerful palate. This is lovely now but it has all the fruit and concentration to age well. Drink 2017–2037.",94,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Hengst Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Possibly too rich, this is a full, sumptuous wine. It has great weight, density, a smooth, wood-aged character that shows through the sweet plums. For what it is, a very rich wine that shows some pepper alcohol—it offers a juicy character and ageability. Drink from 2016.",86,Château Canteloup 2010  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux
"Nectarine and white peach aromas are pithy, pointed and briny like sea water. This feels citrusy and pulpy, while zesty citric flavors of grapefruit, scallion and green herbs finish with residual pithy briny notes.",86,Mas Igneus 2013 Barranc Dels Closos White (Priorat)
"Forest floor, truffle, baked plum, eucalyptus and baking spice unfold on this structured red. The linear, elegant palate offers dried black cherry, clove, ground pepper and tobacco framed in polished, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2020.",90,Tenuta Villa Trasqua 2008 Nerento Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"A barrel fermented Chardonnay that is uncharacteristically soft and fruity. Aromas of bananas and bubble gum lead to slightly sweet, uncomplicated flavors. The texture and body are light.",80,Campus Oaks 2012 Chardonnay (Lodi)
"From a vineyard planted ni 1909, this is a soft, dusty Carignane swirling in acidity, bright red fruit and spice, among McCay Cellars' first forays into Rhône-inspired wines. Lightly textured and restrained in alcohol, it's wonderfully elegant.",90,McCay Cellars 2011 Carignane (Lodi)
"Earthy aromas of roasted red plum blend with scents of latex and cured meat on a jumbled nose. Like any Rufete, this feels drawing and rubbery, with choppy tannins. Flavors of tomato, currant and red plum are tart and narrow on a drawing finish.",85,La Zorra 2014 Teso de la Media Fanega Rufete (Sierra de Salamanca)
"Sourced from the family's Animo Vineyard atop Atlas Peak, this Cab comes from the highest-elevation blocks on the vineyard, some 1,350 feet up. Ripe plum fruit flavors surround savory elements of black tea, the structure well-honed and age-worthy through 2020–2025.",91,M by Michael Mondavi 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"The Gaiole in Chianti area of Chianti Classico tends to produce some of the most traditional and pure expressions of Sangiovese, so Tangano is aged for 18 months in oak to add a spice note and to soften the tannins. The wine opens with prune, dark fruit, leather and tobacco tones.",88,Cantalici L'Antica Fornace di Ridolfo 2008 Tangano Red (Toscana)
"A little too sweet, this has candied flavors of lemon, lime and vanilla. Brisk acidity provides balance, but it would be better if it finished drier.",84,Clif Family 2011 Rte. Blanc Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Has that pure appellation fruit taste of ripe green apples and sweet pears, framed in crisp acids. Feels bright and delicious in the mouth, accented with oak notes of vanilla and smoke. A creamy texture lends allure. This rich, hedonistic wine instantly appeals to the senses. Editors' Choice.",90,Ledson 2001 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Despite the broad appellation, South Coast fruit seems to dominate in the tropical fruit aromas, accompanied by a generous dose of spicy, vanilla-tinged oak. Similarly tastes very ripe and fruity, although has noticeable sweetness.",85,Kendall-Jackson 1998 Vintner's Reserve Chardonnay (California)
"Open and flattering, as are many of the 2000s, showing a dose of smoky, toasty oak layered over buttered nuts, honey and peach. Turns more citrusy on the finish, with tangerine and mineral notes lingering gently. Quite oaky, but has the depth of fruit to support it.",91,Louis Latour 2000 Le Referts  (Puligny-Montrachet)
"This pure, supple, fruit-laden Syrah is loaded with wild blackberry fruit, and detailed veins of licorice, coffee, and iron filings. The wine's excellent length and polished tannins showcase exceptional handling of superb fruit.",93,Syncline 2010 McKinley Springs Vineyard Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills)
"90-92. Barrel sample. A rounded rich wine, showing the juicy fruit of the year along with rich tannins. It is spicy, lively and impressive.",91,Château Citran 2011 Barrel Sample  (Haut-Médoc)
"With much of the freshness of 2006 now evolved into more mature flavors, this balanced if somewhat stalky wine has fine perfumed black currant fruit flavors, with a firm core of tannins and wood aging.",85,Château Hyot 2006 Cuvée la Fleur Tabenot  (Côtes de Castillon)
"This two-region Zin is from Atlas Peak and Amador County. It shows a really great Zin quality in the leathery spiciness that accompanies the berry flavors, and in the smooth, polished tannins. Amador seems to bring wildness, while Napa brings elegance. The result is a great Zinfandel at a great price.",91,Villa Mt. Eden 2004 Grand Reserve Antique Vines Zinfandel (Napa-Amador)
"Dusty, earthy berry aromas veer toward raisiny. This is 80% Tempranillo and the rest Cabernet Sauvignon. In the mouth, it's mostly smooth and voluminous; flavors of ripe, earthy cherry and plum finish dry and peppery. Drink this mature Andalucian wine now.",87,Al Zagal 2008 Rey Zagal Red (Vino de la Tierra Altiplano de Sierra Nevada)
"This is Knoll's flagship wine, from the Dürnstein Schütt vineyard. It is powerful, intense stuff, a roll-call of ripe flavors, even in the difficult 2007 vintage. The wine brings out spice, yellow fruits, fresh apple skins and peppered grapefruit. The extra element is the complexity that goes deep into flavors that need to develop over several years.",93,Emmerich Knoll 2007 Ried Schütt Smaragd Riesling (Wachau)
"A wine that appears almost too delicious at this stage. Through the black fruit and sweet tannins, the texture is immediately attractive. However, there is a dense structure behind this open exterior that should see it age well.",93,Château Branaire-Ducru 2008  Saint-Julien
"Hints of smoke, crushed mineral and pollen lend an earthen dimension to pristine white grapefruit and tangerine in this elegant off-dry Riesling. Juicy citrus flavors are satisfying and thirst quenching, accentuated by zesty acidity and a pleasant touch of astringency on the finish. Drink now through 2021.",90,Baron Knyphausen 2013 Charta Kabinett Riesling (Rheingau)
This no-fuss Valpolicella delivers light cherry and almond flavors. It's a wine to pair with a late-evening ham sandwich or with Chinese food.,84,San Cassiano 2010  Valpolicella
"The dense nose of this bottling intrigues as it unleashes dense blackberries, graphite, slate and a touch of licorice. The palate is tightly wound, with pomegranate, elderberry and tart plum enhanced by fennel, bay leaf and an aromatic lift on the finish. Bottle age will improve this wine immensely.",92,Tantara 2014 Lindsay's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"The underlying wine is thin in fruit, so what stars is oak, with its toasty, caramelized aromas and flavors. It's also fiercely tannic. You'll find some briary blackberries and blueberries, but the wine illustrates why Petit Verdot is best used as a blender.",86,Trinchero 2007 Central Park West Vineyard Petite Verdot (St. Helena)
"A concentrated and toasty raspberry flavor permeates the light- to medium-bodied palate, which is endowed with crisp acids.",83,Sutcliffe 2012 Rosé (Colorado)
"A new addition to the popular Indian Wells line, this consists of 60% Merlot, 28% Syrah and splashes of five other grapes. The Merlot, not surprisingly, dominates. Pretty and round, it has a soft, almost pillowy texture, with an easy, accessible mouthfeel.",88,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2010 Indian Wells Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Somewhat rugged and astringent now, with a bite of acidity, but it's an enormously rich wine, with blackcurrant and chocolate flavors. Best now with grilled meats. A Bordeaux blend based on Malbec.",86,Paoletti 2008 Piccolo Cru Red (Calistoga)
"Herbal aromas of tomato, spice and red plum are a fair announcement of what's to come, namely a sharp, acidic palate with sizzling plum and raspberry flavors. Blazing acidity and little body make for a long, tart finish.",82,Michel Torino 2014 Coleccion Pinot Noir (Calchaquí Valley)
"Fermented in a mix of stainless steel barrels and neutral oak barrels, this was fermented with native yeast and given sur lie aging. It went through 100% malolactic fermentation, which has softened the mid-palate, a mix of lemon, grapefruit and Satsuma orange. There are still traces of phenolic bite, but those citrus rind flavors have been well rounded also, though this carries some heat in the finish.",88,Coelho 2009 Renovação Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"Aromas of lemon-lime, jasmine and honeysuckle prepare the palate for crisp, clean flavors of lemon zest and lemon curd.",87,Minkov Brothers 2011 Le Photographe Rheinriesling Riesling (Thracian Valley)
"Pretty and polished Pinot, with a light, delicate mouthfeel and good varietal flavors. Offers waves of cola, red licorice, cherry pie and sandalwood. Notable for its attention to detail, and could even develop over the next six years.",88,Ancient Oak Cellars 2010 Siebert Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Blueberry, graham cracker and mild herbal notes define the nose on this high-altitude Malbec from Chile. The palate is rich and a bit zingy, with jammy density and mountainous flavors of boysenberry, blueberry and toast. A pure and zesty finish is the right ending to this dark, lusty Malbec.",90,Luis Felipe Edwards 2010 LFE900 Malbec (Colchagua Valley)
"From 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay, the tirage on this sparkling brut took place in 2008, the late-disgorgement in October 2013. The time in bottle has given it a honey-baked edge, sensibly dry, with highlights of baked apple and dried apricot.",88,Chandon 2007 Late Disgorged Vintage Brut Sparkling (Yountville)
"Part of a range of wines that showcases the different styles of Portugal's regions, This wine is smooth, creamily textured and with a warm ripe character. It has pineapple and mango as well as crisper lemon flavors to give a rich wine that is still poised and finely balanced. Drink now.",85,Wines & Winemakers 2016 Azul Portugal White (Palmela)
"Lightly herbal and slightly earthy aromas meet fresh, ripe berry flavors in this medium-bodied wine. It's smooth and soft in texture, low in tannins, and easy to enjoy.",86,Josh Cellars 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Almost instantly identifiable as a Napa Valley Cabernet for its classic black currant and cassis flavors, wrapped into sturdy tannins, and finished with acidity. The fruit is ripe and sweet, with an edge of green olives, yet the finish is thoroughly dry, with a complex spiciness. Drink now through 2020.",90,Napa Valley Cattle Company 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Hard, cool-climate aromas of asphalt and black olive are offset by stewy, savory notes. This Syrah is chewy and tannic in feel, with herbal, roasted flavors that suggest marginal ripeness. Earthy berry and salty flavors carry the finish.",86,Leyda 2012 Single Vineyard Canelo Syrah (Leyda Valley)
"An overt and attractive toasted-oak aroma leads to assertive, smoky, buttery flavors in this traditional reserve-style California Chardonnay. Full bodied, it pulls out all the stops for a grand expression of pear, toasted almond and nutmeg flavors that are backed by ample acidity.",90,Matchbook 2015 The Arsonist Chardonnay (Dunnigan Hills)
"The closed nose gives away very little, just the barest whiffs of yellow flowers. The one-dimensional palate offers fleeting sensations of tart apple and hints of green melon and lemon zest.",85,Corte Moschina 2012 Roncathe  (Soave)
"A vibrant pink hue in the glass, this rosé has nice ripe fruit aromas of wild strawberry and fresh cherry that follow through to the juicy, red fruit-dominating mouth. Round and full, the rich mouth could use a bit more cut.",86,Le Cirque 2010 Rosé (Vin de Pays des Côtes Catalanes)
"Chumash tribe descendent and Fresno State-trained winemaker Tara Gomez uses her extensive experience to make a solid lineup of wines. This one holds dense aromas of boysenberry extract, Dr Pepper, toast, condensed cedar and beef char. Elderberry is the dominant fruit flavor, showing both woodiness and dark purple fruit.",91,Kitá 2012 Camp 4 Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Layered and medium in weight, this is a well-crafted, concentrated wine from an exceptional vineyard site in the cool, southeastern reaches of Napa Valley. The rich pineapple and coconut is tempered by crisp acidity, finishing in caramel-accented oak.",94,Venge 2013 Maldonado Vineyard Dijon Clones Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"This is minty and light, with a soft texture and red cherry tones. The finish turns overtly earthy, even barnyard-like.",81,Chime 2011 Pinot Noir (California)
"This Two Blondes is the best ever—powerful and ripe, with a plush mix of raspberry and strawberry fruit, tart and tangy and mouthfilling. This wine has a huge midpalate, but doesn't stop there; as it slowly winds through a full-throttle finish, threads of chocolate, coconut, caramel and coffee appear. The flavors go on for several minutes.",94,Andrew Will 2007 Two Blondes Vineyard Red Wine Red (Yakima Valley)
"Made entirely with Sangiovese and without any added chemical sulfites, this wine leads off with earthy aromas of wet soil, leather, fragrant blue flower and red berries. The one-dimensional palate opens with sour cherry accented with a hint of cinnamon-spice alongside chewy but fleeting tannins. It's a bit diluted and finishes abruptly.",86,Terre di Melazzano 2012 Riscoperto  (Chianti Classico)
"This wine is rich, full of dark fruits and dusty tannins. It has a solid structure with ripe black fruits and concentration. Wood aging and a dry edge have given the wine a core that will allow it to age. Drink from 2018.",87,Parras Wines 2014 Montaria Reserva Tinto Red (Alentejano)
"This white blend is composed of 60% Chardonnay, 20% Sauvignon Blanc, 10% Riesling and 10% Gewürztraminer. It has aromas of lemon, mint and white peach, with flavors of green apple and white peach.",87,Bulgariana 2012 White (Thracian Valley)
"Smoke, toast, mesquite and barbecue tones emerge from the nose of this nicely concentrated Barbaresco from La Spinona. There's not much fruit here as the wine's aromas are mostly occupied by the secondary perfumes acquired through wood aging. Expect those to evolve and become more ethereal with time.",89,La Spinona 2007 Bricco Faset  (Barbaresco)
"Aromas of raspberry and blue flower open this lovely wine. The juicy palate offers ripe marasca cherry while cinnamon and white pepper add depth. This isn't very complicated, but who cares—the delicious flavors and smooth tannins make it an absolute joy to drink. Not an ager so enjoy soon.",89,Fattoria di Magliano 2012 Heba  (Morellino di Scansano)
"Sourced from a high-altitude vineyard near the top of the Awatere Valley, this wine shows some of the leafiness characteristic of the region. The fruit is more roasted root vegetable than tree fruit, with a potent savory and fairly muscular character.",86,Jules Taylor 2009 Ballochdale Estate Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
"Plump mulberry, asphalt, lavender and cola aromas power the good though slightly curious nose on this wine from a renowned vineyard. The distinctive palate is very aromatic and violet-like, with strong fennel elements alongside boysenberry and herb-laced cherry cola flavors.",90,Seven Angels 2010 Denner Vineyard Syrah (Paso Robles)
Organically grown grapes in an old field-blend vineyard make a juicy wine that is dominated by red fruits. It has structure under the red berry flavors and the acidity. It is still a young wine and shouldn't be drunk until 2018.,87,Secret Spot Wines 2014 Vale da Poupa Field Blend Biologico Red (Douro)
"A big-production, medium-bodied effort, this has noticeable sweetness that softens the acidity. Sweet apple and pear fruit dominate an easy-drinking, approachable, simple but enjoyable Pinot Gris.",87,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2014 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"Dry, minty and spicy, with cool, lightweight berry and cola aromas. The palate is fairly light and easy, with lean red-fruit flavors, dry spice and a creamy tasting accent. Spice more than fruit carries the finish. Pedestrian wine that's competent.",84,"Baron de Escal 2009 Tempranillo, Garnacha, Mazuelo  (Rioja)"
"Considered the flagship of the century-old Sella & Mosca fleet, this edition of 100% Cabernet Sauvignon disappoints. The supporting structure is fine, but the cherry fruit present on the nose and palate is too lean. The finish is short, too. This highly regarded wine is just not showing well at this time. Tasted twice with consistent notes.",84,Sella & Mosca 1995 Marchese Di Villamarina Cabernet Sauvignon (Sardinia)
"Pineapple, sulfur and matchstick, and finally some woody toast steer the bouquet. The palate is big and blowsy, with toasty baked apple and pineapple flavors. Finishes sweet, with honey and a sprinkle of white pepper. Yet another sweet, resiny, basic Chardonnay from Chile.",84,Santa Carolina 2009 Reserva Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)
"Squeezed lemon rinds and pith, wound up wet concrete notes, a touch of toasted almond and a slight show of nectarine flesh comprise the nose of this bottling. Classic Cali Chard buttery notes lead the sip, with ripe stonefruit, sea salt, caramel and jasmine, uplited by a decent acidity.",87,Byington 2014 Wrights Station Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Production from 41 acres of land donated over more than a century to the Hospices of Lyon produces an attractive and aromatic wine. It is full of light, juicy fruit and fresh red cherries. Drink this refreshing wine now.",85,Domaine des Hospices Civils de Lyon 2014  Beaujolais-Villages
"A six-barrel reserve selection, this offers a notch or two more depth and density than its companion Bayliss-Bower Vineyard designate. Along with the soft and sultry fruit flavors comes a cavalcade of barrel-generated details: baking spices, toasted coconut, caramel and salted peanuts.",94,Ghost Hill 2012 Prospector's Reserve Pinot Noir
"From a small north-east facing vineyard in the Vallée de la Marne, this ripe, soft, generous wine also has great intensity. It is full and concentrated, with pear and apple fruits allied to touches of bitter almonds, wood and fruit. It's a vintage that could age, although it is just right to drink now.",93,Tarlant 2003 La Vigne d'Or Extra Brut Pinot Meunier (Champagne)
"The aromas are up front, with barrel notes of char, vanilla, coconut and baking spice followed by cigar box. The wood really shows through on the palate as well, with the tannins bringing a strong sense of astringency.",86,Castillo De Feliciana 2013 Reserve Red Wine Tempranillo (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"High-toned apples and pears and a grassy, herbal note scent this unique blend of Croatian and international grape varieties. Deep gold in color, it's a savory wine with a bruised apple palate, but an interesting pick for everyday.",83,Bibich 2008 Riserva R5 White (North Dalmatia)
"Soft, fruity wine, with an earthy character. The wine has acidity and red fruits with a final fresh burst of ripeness. Not for aging, drink now.",85,Quinta do Crasto 2008 Crasto Red (Douro)
"Expanding on their fathers' legacies, the cousins Jean-Laurent and Jean-Dominique Vacheron have a deserving reputation for their almost-Burgundian Sancerre. This latest vintage, packed with both fruit and structure, shows why. It is ripe with red cherries and dark plums laced with acidity. The wine is full of great ripe fruit and generous tannins. Drink from 2018.",92,Domaine Vacheron 2015  Sancerre
"Soft, rich fruit, with layers of plum, cherry, berry and accents of toast and vanilla. Smooth, seductive style, plenty of acid, good balance and the fruit is pure, clean and ripe all the way to the lingering finish.",91,Steele 1998 Catfish Vineyard Zinfandel (Clear Lake)
"This is an approachable, lightweight Sauvignon Blanc with upfront tropical fruit aromas. The mouthfeel is clean and mild, while flavors of white grapefruit and lime finish sweet and easy, alongside notes of dried pineapple and mango.",85,Santa Rita 2013 120 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley)
"Stalky smoky aromas open a wine that is spicy, smoky from wood and full of red fruits. The wine is light with acidity as well as a layer of crisp tannins. Drink this from 2018.",86,Domaine du Petit Bondieu 2015 Vendôme Cabernet Franc (Bourgueil)
"Punchy, grassy aromas of citrus and tropical fruits capture most of what's good about coastal Chilean SB. This feels angular, fresh and minerally, with flavors of tangerine, lime, lemon and grapefruit. A tangy, lasting finish is pure Leyda.",89,Luis Felipe Edwards 2015 Marea Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley)
"This unoaked Chardonnay is marked by quite crisp acidity, as the malolactic fermentation was prevented. It's the opposite of opulent, a flinty wine with hints of Meyer lemons and Kaffir limes. Try with shellfish.",87,Wente 2006 Eric's Small Lot Chardonnay (Livermore Valley)
"Cute packaging belies the surprising depth to this Riesling. It's remarkably balanced, with an array of mineral, floral and fruit dimensions. Juicy, with preserved peach flavors and zippy lemon acidity, it's a thirst-quenching, solid pick from the Pfalz.",89,Blue Fish 2012 Sweet Riesling (Pfalz)
"). Phillip Zull's offering in the light, fresh Grüner Veltliner stakes is as light and fresh as they come. It's a burst of fruitiness across the palate, starring bright citrus and green fruits, with bone-dry acidity. Screwcap.",87,Zull 2010 Lust & Laune Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"The fruit has veered somewhat funky and stewy here, giving the wine a soft, lean quality that struggles to share its quiet undertones of cherry and vanilla.",85,Rutherford Grove 2009 Pestoni Family Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"A pungent Viognier, with aromas of oranges and apricots, and an appealing accent of English breakfast tea. The fruit flavors are almost Riesling-like, but fatter and rounder.",87,Illahe 2010 Viognier (Oregon)
"A pure-tasting wine, this has a mineral character, tight, balanced acidity and lemon and white-fruit flavors. One of the rare white wines from the Côte de Nuits, this has power and a toasty element.",91,Domaine Bruno Clair 2010 En la rue de Vergy  (Morey-Saint-Denis)
"A very strong wine of superior tannic and acid structure. You can feel the pedigree in your mouth, smooth, elegant and luscious. The fruit is as ripe as it might be. The flavors are earthy and tobaccoey, and the wine turns astringent on the finish.",86,Crane Family 2000 Don Raffaele Estate Merlot (Napa Valley)
"This fine producer, based in Morgon, has made a rich and structured wine. With its perfumed red-berry fruits and balanced acidity, it is a savory wine that is ripe and ready to drink.",89,Domaines Dominique Piron 2015  Beaujolais-Villages
"Here's a light, spicy, pretty red wine, mixing juicy and sweet plum and purple grape flavors with plenty of acid. You might pick up hints of tobacco, a little white pepper; the acids keep the wine fresh and the fruit is youthful and vibrant.",87,Abacela 2006 Umpqua Cuvée Tempranillo (Southern Oregon)
"This wine is brooding, with aromas of dark cherry and game. The palate boasts bold fruit and savory flavors along with slightly bunched-up tannins.",88,Hedges 2013 Descendants Liégeois Dupont Les Gosses Vineyard Syrah (Red Mountain)
"This quirky medium-bodied wine has a flavor spectrum all its own. It smells floral and tastes like spiced red candy, and is noticeably sweet.",81,One Hope 2013 Pinot Noir (California)
"A new offering made entirely from estate fruit, this is a selection of the best blocks and barrels of the vintage, with its core component being 90% Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon. The remainder is Zinfandel. Together they provide black color and a whiff of bay leaf and peppercorn, around well-integrated layers of black cherry, vanilla and black tea.",90,Paraduxx 2012 X2 Estate Red (Napa Valley)
"Fragrant notions of orange peel accompany the red apple freshness. This has ample apple and orange fruit at the core, along with a pure, lemony zestiness that pulls everything taut and into focus. Full of life and tension, the wine makes you want to sip and sip again.",90,Joseph Fritsch 2014 Riesling (Alsace)
"This wine is a blend of Merlot (58%), Cabernet Sauvignon (36%), Cabernet Franc (5%) and Petit Verdot. Vibrant aromas of cherry meats, raspberry, dried herb and barrel spice are followed by a fruit-forward flavorful palate backed by firm tannins. It has a high yum factor.",93,DeLille 2014 D2 Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This Reserve Series bubbly accents its crisp green apple fruit with toasty aromas. Done via Méthode Champenoise, it spent five years en tirage. There's a fine bead and lingering persistent flavors with hints of nutmeg and lemon curd. All in all, this is a very fine effort.",90,Seufert 2011 Blanc de Noir Sparkling (Willamette Valley)
"An unusual combination of flavors that are searingly tart and yet seem to have a sugary core, this is scented with honeysuckle and orange blossom, and opens out quickly into a fruitbowl of ripe, tangy flavors. Apples, pears, oranges, candied lemons, even a hint of papaya are all in the mix. But be ready for some tongue-tangling acidity.",88,Cathedral Ridge 2008 Riesling (Columbia Valley (OR))
"Intense tropical fruit aromas take the lead. The ripe, juicy palate offers banana, pineapple, grapefruit and white peach alongside lemon zest and mineral. Adding balance, refreshing acidity gives way to a clean, lingering finish.",89,Fattoria La Rivolta 2012 Falanghina (Taburno)
"Young Hunter Valley Sémillon is one of the most perplexing wines to evaluate, and I suspect that in 8–10 years' time, my rating will seem overly stingy. Still, this light-bodied wine appears to lack depth, complexity and length, offering just some odd, resiny scents and waxy, citrusy flavors.",83,Pepper Tree 2006 Reserve Semillon (Hunter Valley)
"Fruity, juicy wine, with some acidity pushing through the light structure. It is attractive, with a tangy, spicy edge.",86,Quinta de Ventozelo 2008 Vintage  (Port)
"There is a vividly refreshing nose to this biodynamic wine, full of aromatic lift from brisk stone fruit and white rock minerality. It's full on the mouth, nicely balanced with no edges sticking out at all, and just a tad of tart apple on the finish.",89,Demetria 2012 Cuvée Papou White (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Meaty, smoky aromas and good, high-amplitude fruit flavors give a robust personality to this full-bodied, dry and firmly tannic wine. It will make a good pairing with pasta, roasted birds or grilled meat.",90,Andis 2012 Cooper Ranch Barbera (Amador County)
"Scents of vanilla and baking spices frame bold raspberry fruit on the nose, while the flavors take a more savory turn, toward mocha and grilled meat. This is full bodied and maybe even a touch warm, but it works, ending long and plush. Drink now–2025.",93,Lambert 2013 The Commitment Shiraz (Barossa Valley)
"Fermented and aged in stainless steel, this is aromatic, with notes of ripe peach, melon and honeysuckle. It's full bodied, somewhat viscous in feel, carrying considerable alcoholic warmth.",85,Abacela 2013 Estate Grown Viognier (Umpqua Valley)
"There is good density of fruit tannins here, boosted by wood. The wine has dried fruit, spice, perfumed blackberry and lively acidity. It could well age for 1–2 years.",89,Domaine du Grand Bouqueteau 2006 Réserve  (Chinon)
"Generous, abundant, ripe fruit flavors and a tasty touch of spicy oak make a fine combo in this medium-bodied, plush-textured wine. With repeated sips the fruit flavors taste even more intricate and interesting. The texture firms up nicely due to fine tannins and welcome acidity. While tempting to drink now, this will be best after 2018.",93,Failla 2013 Savoy Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Rather light, easy-to-enjoy aromas suggesting fresh strawberry and raspberry, along with equally fruity flavors don't indicate how full-bodied and high-octane this wine is. Still, it has a smooth texture and lingering finish.",86,Iron Hub 2013 Esola Zinfandel (Amador County)
"Beautifully pure notes of crisp Cox's Orange Pippin apples shine on the nose. The palate is equally tart and wonderfully refreshing. This is a high-wire act of freshness and stony depth. You think you can almost taste the stone underneath all of these beautifully expressed apple notes that are pervaded by zesty freshness. What an invigorating, lip-smacking finish. This is lovely now but will develop. Drink now through 2030.",93,Maurice Schoech & Fils 2014 Kaefferkopf Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"Soft, fresh, just off dry, a fruity wine that is light and fragrant. Crisp acidity cuts through the wine, giving a tight, nervy edge along with bright fruitiness.",85,Cave de Cleebourg 2011 Riesling (Alsace)
"Very ripe pear fruit is dangerously close to tipping over into cloying richness, almost hinting at cream soda. The palate is less overwhelming. As always, that special streak of Alsace acid saves the day.",88,Kuentz-Bas 2014 Tradition Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"This generously structured wine is rich in tannins and fine, ripe black fruit. Its structure and juicy acidity will allow it to age well. Drink from 2020.",90,Château de Ricaud 2015  Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux
"Humo Blanco means “white smoke,” and the name applies to the daily morning fog that spreads over the Lolol area where this comes from. Leathery, earthy aromas of cherry and plum are ripe, while the palate is tannic and rubbery. Earthy cherry and plum flavors finish lasting and potent.",86,François Lurton 2013 Humo Blanco Gran Cuvée Pinot Noir (Lolol Valley)
"Not very expressive, this shows subdued aromas that recall coconut, toasted oak, espresso and raw, red berry. The palate delivers red berry, licorice, mocha and vanilla alongside mild tannins. It's already surprisingly accessible. Drink 2015–2020.",89,Domenico Clerico 2010 Briccotto  (Barolo)
"Markham has been a reliable Petite source over the years, and succeeded even in the difficult '98 vintage. Rich blackberries and blueberries are dusted with black pepper. The one indication of a tough year is the dry, tannic finish, but it should work fine with a rare steak. —J.C.",88,Markham 1998 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley)
"This will be a wonderful wine. Already, it is fine, with lovely acidity, bright and richly sweet at the same time. Yellow fruits mingle with honey, pear, almonds and the intense sweetness of botrytis.",97,Domaine Huët 2010 Le Mont Première Trie Moelleux  (Vouvray)
"Mazzocco's style has settled into high alcohol, in this case 15.8%, sweet, jammy pie-filling fruit flavors, and soft tannins. If this is the kind of Zin you enjoy, it's for you.",82,Mazzocco 2006 Maple Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"Savory and deep given the price, with dark color, obvious ripeness and even a touch of vanilla and mocha on the nose. Round in the mouth and immensely fruity, with plum and berry flavors blending with vanilla. Textured and medium-long on the finish. Good for everyday quaffing, especially in the cold fall and winter months.",86,Riscal 2006 Riscal 1860 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)
"This famous site was planted in 1972 by Dick Erath, and the 44-year-old vines deliver an aromatic, elegant yet substantive bottle of Pinot. It's a complex mix of wild berries, cherries and chocolate, showing the generous flavors of the vintage. Delicious already, it's got the power and presence to age gracefully through 2023.",93,Vidon Vineyard 2012 Maresh Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Not quite as distinctive as some of the other 2009 Block offerings from St. Clair, this is nonetheless a solid wine, exhibiting gently leafy nuances layered over pick grapefruit and melon flavors. It's mainstream in style, not overly heavy, with a crisp, refreshing finish.",88,Saint Clair 2009 Pioneer Block 1 Foundation Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"A ripe, pure wine of red fruit around a core of toast, dominated by vital acidity and an edge of dry tannins. The wine is linear, finely balanced, fruity and exuberant.",91,Domaine Jacques Prieur 2008 Champs Pimont  (Beaune)
"This wine shows the riper, spicier side to German Pinot Noir. Lush black cherry and plum flavors are fleshy and dense on the palate, tinged with notes of cassis and bramble. Crisp acidity adds elegance and structure, along with a penetrating layer of finely textured tannins. Drink now for its bold, decadent style.",91,Thörle 2011 Saulheimer Kalkstein Trocken Spätburgunder (Rheinhessen)
"Concentrated black plum and violet notes mesh with potting soil, cola and a candied black-raspberry character on the nose of this bottling. The palate combines boysenberry with woody elderberry fruit as well as a warmer red cherry and red-plum core, edged by pine needles, juniper and tart pomegranate complexity.",91,Cambiata 2014 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"A dark-red color, aromas like dark chocolate, flavors recalling black cherry, and a dry rather than sweet taste make this a great wine for a special meal. It has layers of fruit, a bit of smoke, and lots of fine tannins that pile up for a rich mouthfeel and lingering finish.",89,Girasole 2013 Hybrid Red Organic Grapes Red (Mendocino)
"From the northern Vinho Verde region of Melgaço which is the natural heartland of Alvarinho, this tangy, fruity wine bursts with acidity and creamed apple flavors. It is still young, a lively and fruity wine that will benefit from some calming down and broadening out. Drink from the end of 2015.",89,Wines & Winemakers 2013 Toucas Alvarinho (Vinho Verde)
"Fresh and zesty, this opens with aromas suggesting white spring flower, pear and exotic fruit. The tangy palate offers white peach, citrus and pineapple while a mineral note accents the finish.",87,Gran Passione 2015 Falanghina (Beneventano)
"This is modeled after a Rioja crianza, showing young, mixed fruits from a blend of 62% Tempranillo, 12% Graciano, 11% Merlot, 9% Cabernet Sauvignon and 6% Grenache. Showing generous acidity, hints of apple, peach, cranberry and herb, it's a fresh and fruit-driven young wine, perfect for warm weather enjoyment.",88,Brian Carter Cellars 2010 Corrida Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Full body, ripe grapy fruit flavors and a healthy pinch of spicy oak join with a smooth texture that is just slightly tannic. The feeling is mouthfilling, and the wine is dense enough with cherry and berry flavors to be satisfying. It's a blend of mostly Zinfandel and Syrah.",86,Dalliance 2012 Red (Lake County)
"Heavy, soft and a little dull, but it feels lightly silky in the mouth, and is fully dry, offering good flavors of cherries, currants and herbs.",85,Heron 2010 Pinot Noir (California)
"Bright and packed with succulent apple and pear fruit, this retains ample juicy acidity for a perfectly balanced, fresh style. With its underlying wet stone minerality, it offers exceptional value.",90,Foris 2016 Pinot Gris (Southern Oregon)
"Ripe oaky aromas of marzipan, vanilla and baked berry fruits are soft and raisiny. This blend of 40% Carignan and 30% each of Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon feels rich, saturated and smooth. Flavors of raisin, prune, spiced cherry and cheesy oak finish with a reprise of raisiny ripeness. Drink through 2018.",90,Berta Franquet 2010 Red (Priorat)
"A surprisingly tasty and well-balanced Pinot for this price category, this smells lightly spicy and ripely fruity. It feels smooth but not overly soft in texture and has lively, delicious fruit flavors.",86,Angel's Cup 2013 Vineyard Selection Pinot Noir (California)
"Meaty, earthy aromas of mixed berry fruits show a fair amount of wood. The palate is ripe and blocky, with black-fruit flavors, primarily blackberry and plum, accented by a noticeable herbal element. Toasty and spicy on the finish, this is a commendable value-priced Carmenère.",89,Santa Carolina 2013 Reserva Carmenère (Cachapoal Valley)
"Fruit and more mature flavors are coming together, giving a structured wine with black-currant flavors balanced with mint, spice and a rounded texture. This stylish wine is almost ready to drink; just wait until summer 2016.",90,Château de l'Annonciation 2012  Saint-Émilion
"This is a wine that is totally dominated by wood. So much so that there is little sign of fruit. Maybe it will integrate, but there is a question mark.",82,Maison Bouey 2011 Cuvée  (Bordeaux)
"At first taste, the tannins dominate. Then fresher fruit shows through. The wine is firmly dry, the texture linear, the fruit showing some black currant character.",87,Château Ramafort 2008  Médoc
"Smooth and generous, this wine is soft and missing any bite. It is round and unfocused, but ready to drink now.",84,Georges Duboeuf 2014 Le Clos Devouluet Durand-les-Verchès  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
"Clean, bright and focused, this is currently showing its youth, though with great promise to continue to mature and flesh out with another couple of years. Notes of yellow apple, beeswax, straw and honeysuckle abound on the nose, while flavors of orange oil and honeycomb flesh out the medium-weight palate, with great verve and lingering spicy elements through the close. It's approachable now, but should drink best from 2018–2021.",91,Hamilton Russell 2015 Chardonnay (Hemel en Aarde)
"Easy to like this softly appealing Merlot. It's a gentle wine, with a silky texture, and has candied flavors of cherries and raspberries. Pretty good price for a nice Napa Merlot.",86,Courtney Benham 2009 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Harsh and hot, with sweet and sour flavors of oranges and mint.",81,Bogle 2006 Petite Sirah (California)
The wine is velvet soft with smooth red berries and gentle tannins. It has a line in acidity along with spice and a rounded texture. Drink this lightly wood-aged wine now.,88,Henri Bourgeois 2014 Les Baronnes  (Sancerre)
"Pale orange-pink in color, this is a lightly fruited wine on the palate. Soft acidity, orange and lime fruits and a smooth, rounded texture all contribute to this open wine.",86,Château la Tour de l'Evêque 2014 Pétale de Rose Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Crisp, dry, and packed with red currants, this mineral-textured wine is ripe while also intensely crisp. Its acidity and taut character are delicious, refreshing and well in balance. The creamy mousse and lively aftertaste add to the brightness of the wine.",91,Mailly Grand Cru NV Rosé de Mailly Brut  (Champagne)
"Still quite young and showing some grapey fruit flavors, this second vintage release is bursting with purple fruit and chocolate malt flavors. Streaks of cola and a mineral-drenched finish add depth and texture.",93,Drouhin Oregon Roserock 2015 Zéphirine Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"This is downright herbaceous from front to back. Hard aromas suggest eucalyptus, black olive and sweaty leather. In the mouth, grit and high acidity provide little cushion, while herbal flavors of cherry and blackberry taste salty and baked.",82,Santa Rita 2010 Reserva Organic Carmenère (Central Valley)
"A fortified blend of Tannat and Malbec, this is a ripe and sweet, styled like a vintage Port. It has a powerful structure from the two tannic grapes in the blend, along with ripe damson fruit and spice, with acidity on the finish.",88,Lionel Osmin & Cie 2010 Estela Vintage Red (Vin de Liqueur)
"Femme is Duval-Leroy's top cuvée. This, from the great 1996 vintage, is as much wine as sparkling experience. It has great depth of flavor and a powerful steely background, with tight acidity. The grapefruit flavor is only superficial, because behind this crispness, the wine shows considerable richness.",94,Duval-Leroy 1996 Cuvée Femme Brut  (Champagne)
"Raisiny, inky aromas are ripe but not overly sophisticated. On the palate, grabby tannins are drawing and heavy. Flavors of raisin and prune carry over from the nose, while the finish is chewy, jammy, raisiny and offers a licorice/anise note.",88,Tossals 2012 Junior Red (Montsant)
"Generous and ripe, this is a wine that is finely balanced and very ready to drink. Ripe tannins, soft texture and final acidity make for an easy-drinking wine.",86,DFJ Vinhos 2014 Portada Winemakers Selecton Red (Lisboa)
"Dry and crisp, with good varietal flavors of citrus fruits and lemongrass. But this wine is also very potent in unripe, green notes that include the notorious feline component. That lowers the score.",83,Titus 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"With 4% Viognier giving this wine a distinct floral lift, it's aromatic with notes of nectarine, pear and toasty barrel spice. It's creamy, almost oily in feel, with an assortment of stone fruit flavors that carry through the finish.",88,Waterbrook 2013 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A showy nose of violet perfume and grape candy emerges from this bottling. Similar flavors persist on the palate, along with a touch of licorice. The wine is not overly complex, but it's quite easy to quaff.",88,Lusso Della Terra 2011 Sangiovese (Paso Robles)
"While the wine is soft and almost ready to drink, it does also have the Douro mineral texture and dry tannins. The Tinta Roriz (Tempranillo) dominates, giving the wine its round and rich character. Drink now or wait until 2016 for the tannins to soften further.",87,Caves Aliança 2013 Foral Red (Douro)
"Peach and yeast aromas are mostly fresh. This Xarello has a citrus-like palate with the suggestion of spritz. Melon, green banana and papaya flavors finish with mild pithy bitterness but nothing off-putting.",87,Albet I Noya 2015 XA Xarel-lo (Penedès)
"The winery continues to try to figure out how to grow Cabernet in this remote part of the county. Ripeness isn't the problem. Structure is. The flavors are upfront in blackberries, cherries and currants, but complexity and dryness remain challenges.",85,La Fenêtre 2006 Santa Barbara Highlands Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Barbara County)
"A very zinny Zin, packed with the variety's briary blackberry, anise, dark chocolate, bacon and crushed black-pepper flavors. It's the winery's best Zinfandel since the 2006 vintage.",91,Frank Family 2009 Zinfandel (Napa Valley)
"Hints of autumn leaf and bramble add rustic warmth to this delicate wine. Medium bodied, the palate is brisk with tart red cherry and berry flavors accented with soft tannins on the finish.",86,Heron Hill 2010 Ingle Vineyard Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes)
"This straightforward Verdicchio opens with subdued aromas of stone fruit and citrus. The palate is a bit lean but offers lemon and peach flavors. Bright and simple, with racy acidity, this will pair well with light seafood dishes.",86,Velenosi 2009 Querciantica  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi)
"The aromas seem a bit muddled, with notes of red fruit, herbs, vanilla and flowers. The cherry flavors are tart, with a kick of acidity on the finish.",88,Love That Red 2014 Stakes Race Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Made in the sweet, simple way, with pineapple and orange jam fruit, buttered popcorn and vanilla flavors. However, the price isn't bad, and it will appeal to a lot of your friends at parties for its California richness.",84,Mark West 2010 Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"The aromas are almost completely shut down, with light notes of corn on the cob and peach. The flavors are lightly concentrated, making it a strain to hear what they have to say.",85,Hogue 2014 Reserve Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A bit funky and gassy on the nose, and while the wine offers ripeness and sweetness on the palate, there's always a little something strange and sulfuric lingering. It has its plum and acidity, but the tannins and overall mouthfeel are grabby.",84,Martín Berdugo 2006 Joven  (Ribera del Duero)
"A 50/50 blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this brings sweet cherry flavors to the forefront, albeit with some noticeable volatility. You can taste it in the slightly vinegary finish; but that said, it's a perfectly pleasant wine with enough fruit to carry it for a couple more years.",87,Foundry Vineyards 2006 FV Red Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"A tannic, structured wine, full of rich stone fruit flavors, with the acid hints of red berry fruits. It is fragrant and ripe with some depth and intensity.",88,Domaine du Clos du Fief 2006 Cuvée Tradition  (Juliénas)
"This blend of Merlot and Sangiovese offers a bright aroma of red berry with hints of orange peel and violet. The palate delivers juicy black cherry, raspberry and black pepper flavors in a straightforward and easy-drinking style.",87,Bigi 2012 Vipra Rossa Red (Umbria)
"Solid cherry and berry aromas are smooth and appealing, while a spot of pinched leather adds character to the nose. This feels tight and good, with racy acidity leading a red plum flavor to a dry, tight finish. Nice in a no-nonsense way.",89,Viña Mayor 2008 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"Intense scents of violet and iris lead the nose of this wine, along with a whiff of woodland berry. The fresh, linear palate offers Marasca cherry, crushed raspberry, star anise and chopped herb flavors framed by youthfully assertive, fine-grained tannins and bright acidity.",92,Cigliuti 2013 Serraboella  (Barbaresco)
"This is the winery's first varietal Malbec. Estate grown at the Bella Terra vineyard, it's an exciting debut, with floral scents over vivid purple fruit, and residual flavors of cured meat, smoke and pepper. About 14% Petit Verdot has been added to the blend.",88,Ash Hollow 2005 Malbec (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Rich and thick in leathery blueberry, this Syrah from the great Carneros-based Hyde Vineyard is a study in full-bodied black licorice and dark chocolate caramel. Though bigger in style, it retains acidity and balance.",91,Mira 2010 Hyde Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley)
"Pungent and sweaty, this makes an immediate impact on the nose. That vibrancy carries over onto the plushly textured palate and electric, mouthwatering finish. A fun, flashy wine for near-term consumption.",87,Hunky Dory 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Chris Gorman's “Devil” project includes this juicy, fruity red blend, based mostly upon Bordeaux grapes. The forward cherry-berry flavors push through with some power into a chocolate-malted explosion with peppery highlights.",89,Gorman 2012 The Devil You Know Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A bit rough and scouring in texture, this tastes too sweet. Its orange and strawberry notes have a sugary edge. It's an easy bubbly to drink at parties.",85,Gloria Ferrer NV Sonoma Brut Sparkling (Sonoma County)
"Dusty, earthy plum and cherry aromas are a bit scratchy but enjoyable and powerful. A smooth, plummy palate entertains flavors of toasty black fruits and peppery spice, while the finish is meaty and full, with easy tannins. Drink through 2017.",91,Montgó 2012 Monastrell (Alicante)
"Vanilla, coconut and baking spice aromas are at the fore, with the wood primary. The palate is rich and full bodied, with dark fruit and oak spice flavors. There are some good things going on but the oak—half new American and half seasoned French—rides right over them.",87,:Nota Bene 2013 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Syrah (Red Mountain)
"It's almost two-thirds Riesling, which gives the wine its tight focus and strong mineral and citrus overtones, but there's also Sauvignon Blanc, Marsanne, Viognier and Chardonnay in the mix, giving it layers of fruity complexity. Awfully good for the price.",88,D'Arenberg 2007 The Stump Jump White (McLaren Vale)
"Fresh, minerally red-fruit aromas set up a light but good palate. Modest oak and red fruit flavors are earthy and a bit warm, while the finish is easy, clean and fresh. For $7, there's almost nothing to take issue with.",86,Beach Kite 2012 Pinot Noir (Central Valley)
"Le Rime is made as both a Chardonnay-Pinot Grigio blend and as a pure expression of Pinot Grigio for the U.S. market. Easy and fresh, this wine has touches of pear and citrus.",85,Banfi 2011 Le Rime Pinot Grigio (Toscana)
"Aromas of rubber, leather and herbal berry suggest ripeness issues, but in the mouth this is upstanding, with mild acidic cut. Flavors of leathery berry filter into an earthy, slightly muddled tasting finish with warmth and weight.",86,Denario 2012 Malbec (Patagonia)
"Staunch but murky aromas of coffee grounds, leafy berry, olive and lemon peel announce a tight raw palate. Flavors of olive, plum skins and herbs finish with a reprise of spent coffee along with scratchy tannins.",84,Viña el Aromo 2011 Private Reserve Carmenère (Maule Valley)
"A rather high-toned note akin to resin appears at first but quickly turns into the sweet notion of fir honey. The palate is honeyed, too, with a rich, almost candied center of caramelised peach. There is concentration at the core and a convincing freshness.",90,Domaine Fernand Engel 2013 Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Quite lively and solid, offering loads of black currant and bramble on the nose, and ripe dark fruit with smoky accents on the palate. The mouthfeel is supple, with a nice peppery tang, and it finishes well, with tart berry and licorice notes.",88,Stonehaven 1998 Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)
"Racy and precise, this opens with scents of white spring flower and orchard fruit. The chiseled palate delivers yellow apple, peach, aromatic herb and flinty mineral set against vibrant acidity.",90,La Lastra 2014 Riserva  (Vernaccia di San Gimignano)
"The nose gives little away, the clean palate falls in line with almost equal neutrality. It's only on the aftertaste that you get some of that savory yeastiness we so associate with fresh, young Grüner. Drink soon while there still is some freshness.",85,Lenz Moser 2015 Prestige Grüner Veltliner (Austria)
"A blend of grapes, so maybe it is not surprising that the aromas and flavors are a blend: melons, pears and limes, all presented with great freshness and verve alongside a rich texture. Editors' Choice.",88,Cantina Terlano 2002 Terlano Classico White (Alto Adige)
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese and Merlot (with small percentages of other varieties mixed in), this extracted wine delivers mature fruit, dried rose petal and dark chocolate. The wine is fresh but gritty and thickly textured as well.",88,Michele Satta 2009  Bolgheri
"This wine shows a more savory side of Cabernet Sauvignon without being in any way underripe or malnourished. It's a big, ripe wine, but the mulberry and cassis fruit is marked by cinnamon and clove shadings. It finishes lush, velvety and warm, with hints of chocolaty richness. This should drink well through at least 2024, and possibly for longer if it firms up a little.",92,Penley Estate 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra)
"This wine fills the senses with notes of grass, lemon curd, slate and unripe green apple. Flavors of peach-ring candies and lemon come though on the zesty and tangy palate. The finish is long and tingly, although the flavors quickly dissipate.",87,Veramar 2015 Seyval Blanc (Virginia)
"Soft, peppery and a little on the sweet side, this Cab Franc has upfront flavors of cherry preserves. Rich tannins provide much-needed balance. Drink now.",85,Arger-Martucci 2004 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley)
"The pencil lead, herb and vanilla aromas start out light and elusive. The black-cherry flavors, in contrast, are expressive, showing a good sense of balance and length.",90,Genoa 2012 Danforth Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"Made with 80% Sangiovese, 10% Ciliegiolo and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has subdued aromas suggesting espresso and toast. The palate is rather lean in terms of fruit richness, offering red currant, clove and a hint of vanilla alongside close-grained tannins that lead to a mouth-puckering close.",86,Collemassari 2013 Riserva  (Montecucco)
"Dark and somewhat heady, this opens with dense aromas of mashed blackberry, black tea, bark and peppery spice. The palate is similarly dense and concentrated, although the medium tannins lend the wine a crushed-satin texture that keeps it from feeling too decadent. The finish is long, with a solid pepper streak.",89,Saronsberg 2008 Provenance Shiraz (Coastal Region)
"A Bordeaux-style blend, predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon, from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley. This red is made in a more robust style, the tannins still a tad dry, the fruit earthy in sage and cedar with black cherry and chocolaty spice at the fore.",87,Atalon 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A tight wine, the tannins almost too much for the fresh but lightweight fruits. The wood element is poised to soften the edges of the acidity and black currant fruits, but it needs another six months. The aftertaste is dominated by soft Merlot.",86,Château Grivière 2007  Médoc
"Wild berries, white cherry and even a touch of green olive or caper come to the forefront of this delicately colored rosé from Sicily. The wine loses momentum in the mouth, however, because of its bitter, slightly astringent feel.",84,Avide 2008 Herea Frappato Rosato Rosé (Sicilia)
"Freshly cut pear and tropical aromas lead to medium-bodied flavors. The style is clean and well made, with the concentration dipping a bit at times.",85,Columbia Crest 2014 Grand Estates Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A big, ripe and spicy wine, this is packed with woody notes as well as powerful fruit. It has solid tannins and dark flavors of bitter chocolate and black cherries. It's rich and concentrated, with good aging potential. Drink from 2018.",93,Poças 2012 Reserva Red (Douro)
"One of the few Finger Lakes' Gewürztraminers to exhibit such spot-on varietal typicity, this is gorgeously aromatic with loads of honeysuckle, lychee, stone fruit and exotic spice notes. Off-dry, concentrated and bold on the palate, it's balanced with just a touch of phenolic bitterness.",88,Sheldrake Point 2011 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes)
This estate-grown inland Mendocino Zin has an inviting spiciness and is plenty briary with a full body of flavor but its high-alcohol level masks any other nuances.,85,Nelson Family Vineyards 2007 Estate Zinfandel (Mendocino)
"This has creamy flavors of vanilla, honey, lime and orange.",82,Bogle 2011 Chardonnay (California)
"Caramel flavor and ripe red fruits give this organic Malbec (60%) and Merlot (40%) blend some weight. Pink in color, it has ripe crushed strawberry flavors and light acidity at the end. Drink now.",84,Château de la Vieille Tour 2014 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
"Pretty green floral, apple and pear notes scent this fresh, easy-drinking Riesling. Brisk and semidry in style, it seems sweetened by a lacy haze of sugar that lingers on the finish. Drinking now.",87,Pflücken 2014 Semidry Riesling (Mosel)
"A rich, mouthfilling,  sophisticated wine. The secret is in the balance, with the concentrated fruit flavors—dried apricot, mango and lemon—in just the right proportion. It tastes delicious now, but will certainly age over five years or more.",94,Domaine Leflaive 2006 Les Pucelles Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet)
"This pretty rosé sparkler from Prosecco producer Villa Sandi boasts a nice, easy style that manages elegance and dimension at the same time. Evident yeast tones create softness and buoyancy.",88,Villa Sandi NV Opere Trevigiane Brut Rosé Pinot Nero (Veneto)
"Nicely made, this enters the palate with confidence and strikes a juicy pose, layered with white peach, apricot and pear. The fruit flavors gather strength in the midpalate, dappling in bits of baking spice, cinnamon and custard, and then gently fading into a smooth, supple finish. Classy winemaking here; this is a lovely, fruit-driven bottle with extra dimensions of texture and spice.",90,Rex Hill 2006 Pinot Gris (Oregon)
"Light in color, with basic apple and green-melon aromas, this is a mild Verdejo with a fairly plump mouthfeel. A cross of melon and citrus flavors falls off on the finish before turning bitter.",85,Mocén 2016 Eco Made From Organic Grapes Verdejo (Rueda)
"From one of the most familiar brands of Franciacorta, this opens with aromas of red apple skin, lemon zest and candied nectarine slices. The palate offers Golden Delicious apple and hints of liqueur alongside zesty acidity and tight, persistent bubbles that leave a crisp finish.",88,Bellavista NV Alma Cuvée Brut Sparkling (Franciacorta)
"Make no mistake—the model for this wine can be found among the classified growth white wines of Bordeaux. The barrel influences are many and varied, layering in a mix of smoke, caramel and cracker; and the fruit is supple and beautifully blended. White raisins, Asian pears, pineapple and peaches blend together gracefully, and the alcohol remains at a moderate 13.8%.",92,Chaleur Estate 2007 Blanc White (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Heavy oak on top of cherry aromas results in a chemical-driven, woody bouquet. This feels high in acid, with an oaky, resiny offset. Sour plum, vanilla and resiny flavors finish short, lean and citric.",81,Tramuz 2013  Ribera del Duero
"This opens with aromas suggesting pressed yellow flower, orchard fruit and an unusual whiff that recalls brimstone. The brisk palate offers yellow apple, citrus and a bitter medicinal note.",86,Terredora 2015 Corte di Giso Falanghina (Irpinia)
"This is a dry, richly flavored and well-structured wine. A complex, spicy, earthy, cherrylike bouquet accompanies saturated flavors of currant, black cherry and pomegranate spiced with hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. It's not too full bodied and has good balance that comes from firm acidity and tannins.",89,Occasio 2012 Ghielmetti Vineyard Syrah (Livermore Valley)
"Round and welcoming up front, with toffee, caramel and mocha aromas that are not too sharp. Feels smooth, with pure flavors of toasted nuts, caramel, cocoa dust, dried apricot and underripe peach. Complex and nutty on the finish, with a sweet aftertaste of chocolate and toffee.",90,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L. NV Élite Oloroso Sherry (Jerez)
"Aromas of truffle, ripe dark-skinned berry, baking spice and grilled herb unfold on this structured red but accessible red. The ripe, chewy palate doles out fleshy wild cherry, raspberry jam, cinnamon and clove. Well-integrated tannins lend an almost weightless quality. Drink 2018–2023.",92,Il Poggione 2011  Brunello di Montalcino
"A blend of Aglianico and Piedirosso, this savory, hearty wine opens with earthy aromas of underbrush and dark spices. The dense palate delivers ripe black-cherry flavor that's layered with black pepper, clove and cinnamon. A mineral note closes the juicy finish, alongside firm but silky tannins.",90,Tommasone 2010 Pithecusa Red (Epomeo)
"For whatever the reason, this winery's Bordeaux reds, including Merlot, have shown tremendous improvement over the last few years. This Merlot is soft, sensual and lovely, with cherry pie, red currant, violet, mocha and new French oak flavors. Easy to drink now with robust grilled meats or stews.",90,Gundlach Bundschu 2010 Merlot (Sonoma Valley)
"Aromas of blue flowers, dried aromatic herbs and dark-skinned berry lead the nose. The juicy palate offers fleshy black cherry, raspberry, white pepper and roasted coffee bean alongside assertive, dusty tannins. A green note of powdered sage leaves an astringent finish.",87,Paniole 2012  Maremma Toscana
"On one of the high terraces above the river Lot, Château du Port produces a highly structured wine. It is full of tannins as much as fruit, with a dark, firm character that brings out the potential of this concentrated wine. Drink from 2017.",91,Château du Port 2012 Cuvée Prestige Malbec (Cahors)
"Stewed cherry, exotic cardamom and mace spices and hints of juniper and bay leaf bring an earthy component to the nose of this Pinot. Dark cranberry and black-plum-skin flavors meet with earth tones of turned loam, pine needle and menthol on the palate.",92,Black Ridge 2012 Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Lightly herbal, scented with tart pear and tasting the same, this organically grown estate wine is King Estate's best Pinot Gris. Their signature bottling sets a good standard for the grape in Oregon; this elevates it with more detail, density and personality. The alcohol is a sensible 13%, allowing subtle green fruit and herb grace notes to emerge.",89,King Estate 2008 Domaine Pinot Gris (Oregon)
"Crisp in citrus, with noticeable tension that softens in the glass, this wine offers tremendous value and elegance. Medium bodied and well integrated in terms of oak and power, it has a lovely note of preserved lemon on the finish.",90,Kirkland Signature 2013 Signature Series Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Tropical in scent, almost to the point of air freshener, this also has an oily, bitter hint to the bouquet. It feels choppy and citric, with a nuttiness to the core of tangerine, lemon and melon flavors. Good but fading.",84,Solsticio 2011 Verano Torrontés (Mendoza)
"Crafted in an oxidative style, this wine is light brown to the eye, with aromas of toasted nuts and caramelized pineapple. Flavors of hazelnut, toasted almond and lemon sorbet continue through the smooth finish that ends on a zesty note.",89,Erzetič 2009 Amfora Sivi Pinot Pinot Gris (Goriska Brda)
"This offers subtle black-skinned fruit, leafy underbrush and cooking spice aromas. The dense, forward palate shows dried cherry, blackberry jam and licorice notes, with assertive tannins that leave a firm finish. Drink through 2022.",89,Il Bosco di Grazia 2012  Brunello di Montalcino
"Delicate aromas of spring flower, nut and yellow fruit guide the nose on this linear white. Delineated flavors of Golden Delicious apple and citrus fruit, accented with a light vein of mineral, are balanced by bracing acidity.",87,La Lastra 2013  Vernaccia di San Gimignano
"Baked plum, underbrush, toast and whiffs of exotic spice come together on this blend of 65% Corvina and 35% Cabernet Sauvignon. The full-bodied palate offers ripe black cherry, redcurrant, cocoa and anise alongside firm, fine-grained tannins.",90,Bolla 2012 Creso Red (Veronese)
"Art gallery openings, backyard barbecues and other occasions when you want a nice, dry, affordable red are suited to this boxed wine, the equivalent of four regular bottles. It has pleasant blackberry, currant and cherry jam flavors.",84,Bota Box 2005 Shiraz (California)
"Textured and medium bodied, this wine has a simplicity of citrus and peachy stone fruit buoyed by bright acidity. Fermented entirely in stainless steel, it was aged in concrete, stainless steel and French oak. It displays the concentration of the vintage.",88,Flora Springs 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Smells and tastes just great, with all the hallmarks of an important Napa Cabernet. It's rich in blackberries, black currants, cassis and minerals. Near- perfect tannins and a tasteful overlay of sweet oak add textural complexity. For all that, the wine feels young and brusque. It wants 6–7 years of age to begin to strut its stuff. Open after 2012.",93,Azalea Springs 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Laser-like cassis and black cherry aromas come with an accent of toasted oak. A pure, well-balanced palate isn't at all pushy or heavy, while snappy, fresh flavors of raspberry and spiced plum finish racy, toasty and the slightest bit herbal. Drink through 2022.",93,Bodega Catena Zapata 2010 Nicasia Vineyard Malbec (Mendoza)
"Equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot figure into this wine, along with 20% Malbec, all from the producer's estate. A mix of coconut and cherry-berry cobbler entice aromatically, seasoned in dried herb and black peppercorn. Dry, dusty tannins make their presence felt, the wine all in all tart, generous and lively, finishing in a slow drag of tobacco.",94,Von Strasser 2012 Reserve Red (Diamond Mountain District)
Black currant and dark cherry sensations are accented with notes of espresso and roasted coffee bean. The subdued palate is already evolved and has an abrupt finish.,86,Astorre Noti 2012  Rosso di Montepulciano
"Relatively soft for a St.-Estèphe, this nevertheless has plenty of firm tannins to project the powerful fruit forward. It has structure and weight, piled with plum juice and acidity. Great aging potential.",92,Château Tour de Pez 2008  Saint-Estèphe
"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (60%) and Merlot. Cocoa, baking chocolate and dark-fruit aromas lead to ripe generous black-fruit flavors, backed by well-integrated tannins. The finish lingers.",91,JM Cellars 2013 Longevity Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Very sweet, this has honeyed-apricot, orange and vanilla flavors. It's an opulent wine, but as rich as it is, you find yourself wishing it were even sweeter.",87,Ojai 2011 Kick On Ranch Riesling (Santa Barbara County)
"Dusty, minerally, stony aromas come with a floral note and accents of peach and melon. This blend of Merseguera, Malvasia and Viognier is lightly spritzy, with citrus and green apple flavors that turn mildly bitter and pithy. Drink now with anything from the sea.",88,Mustiguillo 2014 Mestizaje White (Spain)
"Dark in color, this wine packs deep blackberry and boysenberry aromas together with violet, allspice and sandalwood. The palate is redolent of licorice and nutmeg, wrapped in an unrelenting texture that lets the black plum and lilac flavors just peek out. Time will allow this to blossom. Drink 2019–2034.",94,Calera 2014 Ryan Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan)
"This wine is much more easy-drinking than its pedigree might suggest. Made in Israel from an indigenous grape that is grown in a Palestine, it has aromas of apricot, jasmine and strawberry. It is very soft in the mouth, with flavors of guava, honeydew melon and lemon. The finish offers a light dose of bright citrus.",87,Recanati 2014 Marawi (Galilee)
"There's a tinge of caramelized sugar amid ripe yellow peach and apricots in this ripe, yet deftly balanced Riesling. Off dry in style, it has a strike of lemon-lime acidity that jolts the palate from its juicy, fruity ease. It's quaffable but equally penetrating.",89,Schloss Johannisberger 2012 Rotlack Kabinett Feinherb Riesling (Rheingau)
"Take the bubbles out of Cava and this is pretty much what's left. The nose is light, with peach and banana aromas. Tangy flavors of orange and pineapple are lively but lacking, and the finish is ripe but simple. For flush flavors and just enough zap, this is good.",84,Huguet de Can Feixes 2006 Can Feixes Blanc Selecció White (Penedès)
"Rich and intense but also round and soft. A horsey note adds complexity and rusticity to the dark chocolate, leather and black cherry aromas and flavors. —J.C.",88,Kurtz Family 2000 Boundary Row Grenache (Barossa Valley)
"Fresh fruit flavors of red apple and raspberry carry the wine into a light, fairly brief finish. The tannins are thin, almost stripped feeling, and there isn't enough weight to make a strong varietal statement.",87,Quady North 2012 Cabernet Franc (Applegate Valley)
"Intense granite tones lend elegance and complexity to this plump, cherried blend of Merlot, Dornfelder and Lemberger. Supple and round on the palate, it's framed delicately with soft tannins and a fringe of smoke and dried herbs.",88,Pflüger 2012 Cuvée Noir Red (Pfalz)
"This wine has bold aromas of wood smoke and vanilla, a very firm, fine-grained and tannic texture, and lots of black cherry and dark plum flavors. It's a big, robust wine—pour alongside hefty proteins and settle back for the evening.",91,Hawk and Horse Vineyards 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills Lake County)
"Amber to the eye, this wine features an enticing bouquet of almond blossom and toffee. It is slightly chalky on the palate, with a sophisticated mélange of baked apple, peach, smoked meat and pencil-lead flavors. A touch of brightness marks the soft finish.",88,Gotsa Family Wines 2015 Dry Unfiltered Rkatsiteli Mtsvane White
"Billowing with scents of marmalade, wildflower honey and raspberry preserves, this is an intoxicatingly perfumed TBA, but the palate doesn't disappoint either. Rich and creamy with undulating streaks of peach preserve and tangerine, it lingers on and on, with its tea and honey-kissed finish.",94,Dr. Nägler 2011 Rüdesheimer Berg Schlossberg Trockenbeerenauslese Riesling (Rheingau)
"Batailley 2006 has been mainly about tannin from its earliest stages, and this has not yet changed. What has changed is that the tannin isn't by itself any more: black plum fruit is now giving some richness. It does need to age, but the elegance and the balance are coming.",90,Château Batailley 2006  Pauillac
This is a pale-colored wine with a soft texture and gentle strawberry fruits. The texture comes through slowly to give a firmer edge to what is a wine for medium-term aging. This is stylish and smooth. It should be drunk from 2018.,88,Philippe Jeannot 2015 Quentin Jeannot La Fussière Premier Cru  (Maranges)
"Pleasantly fruity and almost sweet, this medium-bodied wine offers a fruit bowl of flavor and freshness on the palate.",86,"AVA Grace Vineyards 2014 Peach, Bright, Lovely Chardonnay (California)"
"A little one-dimensional, but offers enough cherry, red currant and smoky oak flavors to get by for everyday eating. A good example of the art of blending, with 115,000 cases produced.",84,Beaulieu Vineyard 2011 Coastal Estates Merlot (California)
"Another in a string of fine Pinots from this producer. Shows real cool coastal influence in the brisk acidity, delicate structure and deep flavors of cherries and cola, which seem to have a long hangtime complexity. Very good, and should develop over the next 5–6 years.",92,Freeman 2008 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Sicily makes some of the absolutely best dessert wines you will ever taste, and Feudo Disisa's late-harvest Krysos is an excellent example. The wine opens with intense aromas of apricot, chestnut honey, almond marzipan and dried apricot. It feels soft, thick and enduring on the long, sweet finish.",93,Feudo Disisa 2006 Krysos Grillo (Sicilia)
"A little roasted and leafy smelling, which is typical for base-level Chilean Merlot. The palate is sweet almost to the brink of being candied, with plum and chocolate flavors running the show. Not much structure or tannic bite here, but as a whole it's tasty and gets better as it opens up.",85,Montes 2007 Classic Series Merlot (Colchagua Valley)
The Schoenheitz predilection for sweet wines is strongly in evidence in this wine. It's all spice and sweet fruits flavored with bergamot. It's a drink-me-now wine.,85,Henri Schoenheitz 2013 Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Bombastic and burly, this wine holds a depth of black raspberry and cherry at its edge, surrounded in swathes of smoky oak. Rich and full bodied, it is a testament to the intrigue of baking spices and black tea, but more significantly to dark chocolate and espresso.",89,Sonoma-Loeb 2013 Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Marked by excessive oak, with toasty-sweet caramel flavors dominating the ripe blackberry and cherry pie flavors. Nice tannins, though. Drink now.",84,Cosentino 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa County)
"Blended with 25% Cabernet Franc, this engaging wine has aromas of herbs and blackberries. The fruit shows a real sense of vibrancy and purity, laden with tart, cranberry-like acidity and firm, lightly chalky tannins. Just a baby now, it should be at its peak in 2025.",90,Carden 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Black cherry, dark plum and charred rubber give this a masculine opening. Generous and layered across the palate, this tastes of blackberry, chocolaty oak and spice. A lasting, tannic finish is loaded with oak and baking-spice flavors. Drink this ripe, delicious bruiser through 2021.",91,Lamadrid 2013 Single Vineyard Reserva Cabernet Franc (Agrelo)
"Hugely rich and in a seriously heavy bottle, this is a statement wine. Its texture is there, surrounded by superripe fruit and touches of pepper from the alcohol. This almost tropical-fruit wine needs to age a little longer, so drink from 2018.",90,Domaine Laporte 2015 La Comtesse  (Sancerre)
"A mix of plum and vanilla, this is an easygoing Merlot that's good for most group occasions and palates, muted in aroma but developed in flavor.",85,Benziger 2011 Merlot (Sonoma County)
"Aged 22 months in 35% new French oak, this semisweet wine is so rich and luscious it could be poured at the end of a meal to pair with chocolate or chunks of salty pecorino. It smells like strawberries and black cherries, tastes ripe and jammy and has a soft, mouth-filling texture and low acidity.",90,Miraflores 2014 Estate Zinfandel (El Dorado)
"Hazy aromatics of sautéed apple and baking spice mark the nose, with notes of toasted nut and dill that surface on the palate. It feels full, round and supple, gaining some lift toward the close.",85,Tarara 2010 Charval White (Virginia)
"This is a compelling example of Oregon Pinot Gris. Apple, pear and lemon curd carry the bulk of the flavors, with a lightly peppery lift to the midpalate. The spicy character extends through a pleasing, long finish.",91,King Estate 2014 Backbone Pinot Gris (Oregon)
"This is the biggest and ripest of Talley's Pinots, the kind some criticize as Rhône-like. Yes, it's full-bodied, and you might mistake it for Grenache, with its cherry flavors and voluminous tannins. Yet it's beautifully balanced and complex, and should develop bottle complexity for a decade. If you drink it now, pair with big dishes, like duck or game.",93,Talley 2005 Rincon Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"This wine has an elegant edge, with its hints of tea, spice and mint on the nose and its pleasant, harmonious plum and red berry flavors on the palate. Easy to drink and food-pairing friendly.",84,Casa Rondeña Winery 2005 Meritage (New Mexico)
"At 12g/L residual sugar, this just barely qualifies as dry. Fruit flavors suggest lemon curd and green pineapple, and there's an interesting savory note. But flatness across the palate keeps the score from going higher.",87,Anam Cara 2012 Nicholas Estate Dry Riesling (Chehalem Mountains)
"Aromatic notes of orange peel and flesh charm on the nose of this wine. The palate is gentle, dry and fresh, with a super-clean finish offering apple and grapefruit.",89,François Baur 2015 Turckheim Riesling (Alsace)
"Mulchy, leafy aromas lead to a pinchy palate with salty, hard berry flavors that lack cushion. This is a rough wine with saltiness and bitterness on the finish.",82,Hacienda del Plata 2010 Zagal Malbec (Mendoza)
"In keeping with the winery's commitment to exploring some less-traveled wine roads, this is a coferment of 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay. Soft, delicate and aromatic, with a pale rose color, it is definitely not in the mainstream of Oregon Pinots. Nonetheless, it's very well crafted, aromatic and delivers plenty of flavor and depth.",89,ENSO 2011 Bieze Vineyard The Prince Pinot-Chardonnay (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Soft and friendly, this has instantly likeable cherry, cola, anise and sandalwood flavors. Perfect for drinking now.",86,Courtney Benham 2011 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Impressively silky for the price, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (53%), Shiraz (35%), Petit Verdot (7%) and Malbec (5%) is a bargain that should be easy enough to find, with 10,000 cases imported. Toasty oak and vanilla notes frame mixed berries and olives, marrying sweet and savory elements into a pleasing, medium-bodied red for early consumption.",87,Bleasdale 2008 Langhorne Crossing Red (Langhorne Creek)
"This is a firm wine, full of tannins as well as plenty of ripe berries. It is concentrated, juicy and perfumed, an attractive wine already. The dry core gives structure to this panoply of fruitiness. The name comes from French king Louis XI who acquired the vineyard in the 15th century.",93,Chanson Père et Fils 2013 Clos du Roi Premier Cru  (Beaune)
"Dancing on the nose and palate, this Pinot Noir rosé fills the glass with whiffs of cherry blossoms and sugar cookies. Tart red-cherry and berry flavors are delicate and spry on the palate, lingering nervously in a luscious mousse of soft, rolling bubbles. Finishes elegantly with a bristle of stony minerals.",92,Peter Jakob Kühn 2012 Spätburgunder Rosé Sekt Brut Pinot Noir (Rheingau)
"Here's an unoaked wine that will be great as a cocktail sipper, or with a wide range of foods, from veggies with a garlicky dip to roasted chicken or broiled halibut. It's bone dry and very crisp in acidity, with interesting flavors of citrus fruits, figs, green melons, wildflowers, vanilla and dusty spices.",87,Bianchi 2006 Signature Selection Pinot Grigio (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"A very rounded, wood-aged wine, this is rich and admittedly delicious, although the wood smothers the fruit. It has hints of ripe yellow fruits, a touch of quince and a fine line of citrus to finish it off. Give it until 2015 for the wood to balance out.",89,Herdade do Rocim 2012 Olho de Mocho Reserva Branco White (Alentejano)
"Berry aromas are jammy and sweet smelling. This feels chunky and bit out of shape. Herbal boysenberry flavors come with a green core, while mint, spice, heat and herbal flavors carry the finish.",85,Oveja Negra 2014 Reserva Malbec-Petit Verdot Red (Maule Valley)
"Squeezed lime, wet concrete and green apple rind scents show on the nose of this basic bottling. Kaffir lime tang meets with ripe red apple and pear notes on the palate, framed by a stony texture.",86,Firestone 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley)
"A touch green and vegetal on the nose, with hints of canned peas and bell pepper. Fortunately there's enough lime and minerality to keep it fresh. Feels crisp, tight and wet, with green notes pervading core citrus flavors. Finishes pithy and zesty, with mild bitterness.",85,Botalcura 2011 El Delirio Sauvignon Blanc (Maule Valley)
"The oak, a mixture of French, American and eastern European, provides aromas of baking spices, pencil lead and cocoa on this blend of Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The plum, dark fruit and cranberry flavors play along beautifully, with the silky feel adding to the appeal.",91,Goose Ridge 2010 Vireo Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This aged blend of 50% Sangiovese and 50% Montelpulciano opens with black fruit and oak aromas. The dense palate delivers dense raspberry and wild cherry, layered with clove and chocolate alongside dusty tannins.",87,Le Caniette 2005 Nero di Vite  (Rosso Piceno)
"Made of 50% Sangiovese, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot, this opens with delicate black-skinned fruit and tilled earth aromas. The straightforward palate delivers ripe black plum and exotic spice flavors, smoothed out by ripe tannins. Enjoy soon.",87,Renieri 2013 Invetro Red (Toscana)
"Concentrated boysenberry, licorice and asphalt scents carry mild green accents of alfalfa and mint. This feels ripe and lush but not too heavy. Flavors of baked blackberry, licorice and loamy earth finish warm and cushioned, with notes of anise and pepper accompanied by some heat and burn. Drink through 2020.",90,Durigutti 2012 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza)
"There's just not much here. The strawberry fruit is wispy thin, the acids tart, the tannins light, and the whole shebang shows only modest depth and grip.",87,Lemelson 2014 Chestnut Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"Smells like a briar patch under summer sun, with accents of leather and tomato. The pungent aromatics fade into a weighty mouthfeel. It’s all red berries, and it’s tight and young. Shows fine structure and a pure quality. A very likable wine.",88,Elk Cove 1998 Windhill Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This aromatic, herbal wine is crisp and lively, with bright acidity and green fruits. Citrus and gooseberry flavors bring out an even fresher side. It finishes light and fruity. Drink now.",87,Domaine de Villalin 2014  Quincy
"A superb Sauvignon Blanc. The cool vintage gives it brilliant acidity, modest alcohol and dryness, yet it's wonderfully rich in long hangtime citrus, wet stone, green apple, apricot and mineral flavors. Better than the excellent 2008, a white Bordeaux-style wine to drink now.",92,Alpha Omega 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Aromas recalling woodland berry, underbrush and a whiff of toasted nut lead the nose on this easy-drinking red. The light-bodied, straightforward palate offers tart sour cherry, strawberry and a touch of clove alongside firm acidity and fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2017.",87,Donatella Cinelli Colombini 2014  Rosso di Montalcino
"Deep berry aromas combine seamlessly with sweet notes of marzipan and complex accents of balsam wood on what is an inviting, rich nose. This is rewardingly bright and structured on the palate, where blackberry, boysenberry and plum flavors carry onto a full, long finish. This is high-end, ripe Malbec. Drink through 2018.",92,TintoNegro 2011 Finca La Escuela Altamira Estate Grown Malbec (Mendoza)
"Here's a sound, everyday-style Cabernet for drinking now. It's dry and tannic, with rich flavors of blackberries, black currants and plums, enhanced with sweet, smoky oak.",85,Bigvine 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Half Cabernet with the rest Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Mourvèdre and Petit Verdot, this wine opens with aromas of sweet barrel spices followed by dried red and black fruit. The palate is fruit-forward and flavorful, bringing you back for another sip.",89,Genoa 2012 Flying Colors Super Tuscan-Style Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Dark in color and dense on the nose, this has aromas of pastry, blackberry, jammy plum and even an exotic note. It feels chewy and solid, with a full-bodied texture and deep flavors of black cherry and prune. It comes up a bit short and clipped on the finish.",89,Federico Paternina 2006 Clisos Reserva  (Rioja)
"This waxy, petrol-infused wine underwent both barrel and stainless-steel fermentation. It's dark in color, exhibiting a majority of barrel-induced flavors like caramel and toast with any hint of fruit remaining elusive.",83,Educated Guess 2013 Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Bright pink in color, this 100% Touriga Nacional rosé is ripe with caramel and red berry flavors. It misses out on acidity, leaving the wine flat at the end.",83,Quinta da Alorna 2014 Rosé (Tejo)
"This is firmly tannic, with dark berry and black cherry fruits. Minerally and textured, it shows the full effect of Beaujolais's granite soil. It also has a rich feel that will evolve over the next several months.",88,Domaine Chasselay 2011 La Carrière  (Chénas)
"Mild vinegar and full-fledged herbal aromas are typical of traditional Chilean Merlot, and while the palate is solid, it's also scratchy, with tart raspberry and semiweedy flavors. Finishes with burnt brown sugar, herbal flavors and grating acidity.",83,Viña La Rosa 2008 La Palma Reserva Merlot (Cachapoal Valley)
"Made with Vermentino, this opens with aromas of apricot, tropical fruit, pressed yellow flower and dry hay. The palate offers juicy yellow peach, banana, nectarine, crunchy celery and savory herb. Fresh acidity brightens the rich flavors.",90,Terre del Marchesato 2013 Papeo Vermentino (Toscana)
"This wine from a historic vineyard is hard to put down. It combines flint, pencil lead, smoked wood, chopped chives, sweet onion, crushed limestone and a touch of white pepper on the stonefruit-based nose. A strong toast and brioche character carries the sip, touching on white sesame, graphite and even shaved parmesan. It's savory, tangy and addictive.",94,Testarossa 2014 Sierra Madre Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"This wine is rich in aromas and flavors of blackberry preserves, ripe cherries, raspberry sauce and vanilla bean. It's low in acid, leaving a round and soft impression on the palate. Drink now.",84,Roos Family 2016 The Coco Merlot-Cabernet Franc (Western Cape)
"This bright wine offers delicate fruit notes of wild berry and white cherry, backed by hints of black pepper and cola. Easy on the palate, it shows a fresh point of acidity on the finish.",86,Tommasi 2010 Vigneto Rafaèl  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore)
"From a single vineyard on flinty silex soil, this is a taut and concentrated wine. Its intensity is enhanced by the tense texture and powerful youthful acidity. At this stage, it is still young, still with its exuberant fruit. So wait to drink this wine until 2018.",93,Alphonse Mellot 2014 Les Herses  (Sancerre)
"Heady floral scents of wisteria, jasmine and hawthorn lead the way. The bright, frothy palate doles out crisp green apple, Bartlett pear and a hint of lime alongside a foaming mousse.",87,Masottina NV Brut  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Aromas of passion fruit, grapefruit, lime and bell pepper are textbook for the region. This feels fresh as a whistle, with pyrazine-led bell pepper, green bean and lime flavors. Additional notes of bell pepper, with hints of white pepper drive the finish on this crisp, refreshing Sauvignon Blanc.",87,Santa Carolina 2015 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley)
"Sort of sweet and gaseous to start, with rubbery, medicinal aromas. The palate is tight and closed, with warm, crusty dark-fruit flavors, an herbal influence and heat. Thus the finish is a little fiery and peppery, and there's chop and bite to the overall feel. A kitchen-sink blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Syrah.",85,La Posta 2007 Cocina Blend Red (Mendoza)
"Dave Corey co-fermented 83% Grenache with 17% Syrah to produce this rich wine, which offers nose-tingling aromas of blackberry brandy. It's soft once sipped, but also a bit brutal, with blood and barrel-age prominent alongside flavors of blackberry-peppercorn cake. Serve as dessert.",91,Core Winery 2010 Elevation Sensation Grenache-Syrah (Paso Robles)
"This Bordeaux-style blend remains a fair value, showing some sweet barrel spices along with opening fruit flavors of red and black berry. It thins out in the middle and finishes with a simple, fruity flourish.",86,O•S Winery 2009 Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is an austere, brooding wine with tones of smoke, cured ham, toasted oak and mature black fruit. The delivery is broad and immediate and the wine ends with a drying, almost gritty texture.",87,Castello Vicchiomaggio 2005 Agostino Petri Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"Rich in pineapple custard, pear and mineral flavors, this Chard offers lots of direct pleasure. Drink now with crab cakes, roast salmon, or squash risotto.",86,Artevino 2006 Reserve Chardonnay (Mendocino County)
"Complex from start to finish, beginning with aromas of smoke, kumquats and grilled pears and ending cleanly, with tart pineapple notes. The texture is a compelling mix of gravel and custard, yet the wine never seems heavy.",89,Stonecroft 2000 Chardonnay (Hawke's Bay)
"Earthy and filled with baking spice, this wine offers floral aromas, bright acidity and flavors of baked strawberry compote steeped in cinnamon. Lush on the palate, as so many of the producer's wines are, it is quite mouthfilling and will take on more nuance with time, through 2022.",92,Merry Edwards 2012 Georganne Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Structured, smoky and full of black cherry fruits, this is a wine whose appellation of Villages brings out just that extra bit of weight and richness. It's still fruity, ready to drink and fresh on the finish.",86,Henry Fessy 2014 Nouveau  (Beaujolais-Villages)
"Castello Banfi in Tuscany does a great job with Chardonnay, as evidenced by this wine. It's rich and soft, with bright aromas of peach, citrus, vanilla and savory herb. A pinch of acidity on the finish works beautifully as well.",90,Castello Banfi 2011 Fontanelle Chardonnay (Toscana)
"A streak of savory flavors, like sage and soy, runs through this otherwise grapy, plummy, medium-bodied wine, giving it a unique profile. Firmly tannic in texture, and showing a bit of the typical spiciness, it's ready to drink.",85,Lyeth 2012 Malbec (California)
"Perfumed berry, pressed violet, leather and a balsamic note lead the nose of this 100% Sangiovese. The sleek, savory palate doles out fleshy black cherry, licorice, clove and tobacco interwoven with lithe tannins and fresh acidity.",90,San Leonino 2012 Al Limite  (Chianti Classico)
"Aromas of ripe—almost overripe—berry, leather and tobacco lead the nose of this wine. The palate shows more restraint, with succulent sour cherry, clove and vanilla flavors accented by hints of white chocolate and orange zest. Very smooth and richly textured.",90,Le Salette 2010 I Progni  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
"Good price for a rich, spicy Zinfandel. It's as ripe as anything out there, with flavors of cherries and blackberries, while oak barrel aging shows up in the form of sweetly buttered cinnamon toast. Drink this exuberant wine with steaks and chops.",87,Sebastiani 2009 Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
Bortolotti makes a well-priced Non-DOC Prosecco Extra Dry with fragrant aromas of white flowers and peach. The luminous sparkler has just enough sweetness to underscore those fresh peach flavors and offers tingly bubbling.,86,Bortolotti NV Single Extra Dry  (Prosecco del Veneto)
"This is cloudy to the eye, with a mix of vinegar, briny plum and milk chocolate on the nose. The mouthfeel is blowsy, while the flavors are briny and pickled.",82,Caligiore 2011 Pianissimo Made with Organically Grown Grapes Malbec Rosé (Mendoza)
"This is a rich, heavy wine, a Chardonnay on steroids. It's packed with ripe and lush tree fruits, and those flavors are matched with generous barrel toast. Though it feels a bit thick on the palate, it has enough acidity to avoid being flabby and is terrifically delicious. Drink now through 2021.",92,Domaine Serene 2015 Evenstad Reserve Chardonnay (Dundee Hills)
"Aged 22 months in French and American oak, this wine hails from a rolling hillside in the appellation and is 100% varietal. Subdued aromas give way to an expansive and full-bodied array of red currant, cranberry and black pepper, with a vibrant underpinning of minerality as well as tobacco and baking chocolate.",91,Flambeaux 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley)
"Here's a delicate-smelling Prosecco Cartizze with subdued tones of stone fruit and white mineral over a sweet, creamy filling. Soda-like intensity in terms of its effervescence crackles and fizzes in the mouth and keeps the palate refreshed.",90,Adami NV  Prosecco Superiore di Cartizze
"With a sniff of noble reduction, this is a well-made robust wine, indicative of its historic estate and small-production values. A juicy core of broad plum, dark cherry and pomegranate wrap seamlessly around a fresh streak of minerality and rich texture.",92,Pellegrini 2014 Olivet Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Smells decidedly burnt and stalky, with rubbery berry and black plum aromas. Shows grip on the palate, along with the same flavors hinted at on the nose: leather, burnt coffee, herbs and roasted berries. Feels pretty good, but the stalky, burnt core dominates.",84,Viña Bujanda 2008 Crianza  (Rioja)
"A majority of Grenache plays lead here, with an accompaniment of 35% Syrah and 12% Mourvedre. Concentrated in a grip of leather, there's further integration of earth and black fruit that stays bright and vibrant on the palate, a medium-bodied coming-together of savory with ripe.",90,Davis Family 2013 Throne Red (Russian River Valley)
"A blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Canaiolo and 5% Colorino, this offers delicate ripe black-skinned fruit and cooking spice aromas. On the palate, ripe black cherry, espresso and clove flavors are framed by firm tannins. Drink through 2019.",89,Mangiacane 2011 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"Ripe cherry and luscious watermelon aromas waft from this summery, fresh wine. It's dry on the palate but concentrated, with bright cherry and berry flavors. Round and lush yet briskly balanced, it's a great summer quaffer at a fantastic price.",90,Dr. Konstantin Frank 2013 Dry Rosé Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes)
"Raw, fresh, almost scratchy aromas of cranberry and plum are direct. This feels fruity and bright on the palate, with lightly medicinal cherry and plum flavors that finish with a sprinkle of spice and a note of saline.",85,Mureda 2013 Organic Syrah (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"This is a rich, intense wine, its spice and pepper characters mingling with ripe tangerine and peach notes. It is full, round and concentrated. The pure fruit character is delicious, though it could age a year.",89,Domaine Fernand Engel 2010 Réserve Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Sweet rosé, soft crushed strawberries with crisp, clean balanced acidity. The wine is fruity, fresh and great as an aperitif or with a fruit dessert.",85,Château la Varière 2010 Rosé (Anjou)
"An evenly dispersed nose of sage bark, cherry compote and lightly toasted cedar introduces this bottling by Fred Brander, a Santa Ynez Valley winemaking pioneer now actively trying to create a new Los Olivos District appellation. The flavors are balanced between cherry fruit and oak, with smooth tannins throughout.",91,Brander 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley)
"This Rhône-style blend—two-thirds Roussanne, the rest divided between Marsanne and Viognier—was made using grapes sourced from the estate Destiny Ridge Vineyard. Intriguing aromas suggest clover, sweet grass and honeysuckle, while the flavors run from stone fruits into hints of light tropical fruits. It's lovely and evocative.",91,Alexandria Nicole 2011 Shepherds Mark Destiny Ridge Vineyards Estate Grown White White (Horse Heaven Hills)
"This is a tasty, juicy, easy-drinking wine with good fruit flavors. Well balanced and medium bodied, it offers some of the density and texture expected, but without going over the top in tannins.",88,City Winery Chicago 2014 Big Shoulders Cabernet Cabernet Sauvignon (North Coast)
"Aromas of ripe red apple skin, dried rose petal and roasted almond lead the nose and follow through to the palate. It has vibrant acidity and a brisk, persistent perlage but it lacks fruit richness. It closes on a note of bitter walnut.",86,Cà di Frara NV Oltre Cruasé Sparkling (Oltrepò Pavese)
"The nose does not want to give a lot away. The palate, however, shows spicy hints of nettle and a fresh bouncy zesty backbone of lemon and grapefruit, which makes it all the more appetizing.",90,Steininger 2015 Kittmannsberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"From the estate vineyard, this crisp white opens with ripe, slightly tropical aromas of cantaloupe, guava and papaya, with a darker, riper undertone of honey on the palate. Although fleshy and full on the palate, it's also bright in acidity and offers attractive floral aromas throughout.",90,St. Supéry 2012 Dollarhide Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
This 50-50 Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon is a rich wine that is full of lightly peppered ripe apple and pear flavors. It feels generous while being full in the mouth with good concentration and crisp acidity. Drink now.,90,Vignobles Carreau Selection 2015 Château l'Escadre  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"For a wine that can often be found for less than its $15 asking price, this is a very solid sipper. Ripe raspberry, red cherry and crushed slate show on the nose, while the light palate offers easy flavors of fruit punch and an herbal depth.",87,Hahn 2016 Pinot Noir (Monterey County)
"Lots of red flowers, from roses to hibiscus, show alongside plump candied red cherries, exotic Asian spice, black tea and hearty chaparral herbs on the nose of this bottling. The palate is heavy with bay leaf, thyme and eucalyptus served atop a strawberry-cherry base. It's earthy and herbal, yet redolent with ripeness.",94,Melville 2014 Block M Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Perfumed and floral, crisp and modulated in acidity, this is an exuberant expression of the variety. Ample acidiy and cherry and orange flavors unfold on the palate, followed by a brisk finish that's laced in spicy nuance.",91,Lawer 2016 Estate Vineyard Rosé of Syrah (Knights Valley)
"This directly appealing wine brings notes of the underside of a pineapple, chamomile, talc, wet stone and apricot, mixing delicacy and nuance. It's creamy in feel with rich, concentrated fruit flavors and a long, detailed finish.",93,Sixto 2012 Moxee Chardonnay (Washington)
"Dark black fruits and a dense, almost black color are signs of the concentration of this concentrated wine. Nine months in wood have added to the richness of the wine while preserving the blackberry and black-plum flavors. It is just ready to drink, although it will be much better from 2017.",91,Global Wines 2012 Cabriz Reserva Red (Dão)
"Most of Saint Clair's Pioneer Block offerings are excellent, but the 2011 Block 16 from the Awatere comes across as a simple, fruit-driven Pinot Noir. A punched-up cherry note dominates, leaving little room for complexity or structure. Drink now.",84,Saint Clair 2011 Pioneer Block 16 Awatere Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
"This blend of Merlot, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc opens with jammy, almost impenetrable aromas of blackberry, maraschino cherry, pipe tobacco and dark chocolate. “Huge” is the operative word.",90,Il Pollenza 2007 Red (Marche)
"V. Sattui has been making some pretty good Cabernets, and here's another one. It's classic Napa, with smooth, polished tannins, fine acidity and ripe, full-bodied flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar. Might even develop additional bottle complexity over the next 6–8 years.",90,V. Sattui 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This Pinot Blanc is creamy smooth and soft, with a delicious line in peach acidity and lively green fruits. Crisp, ready to drink, and very fresh.",87,Stift Klosterneuburg 2009 Jungherrn Weissburgunder (Vienna)
"Creamy and herbal on the nose, with mild vegetal aromas and big but bland black-fruit scents. The palate is big and chunky, with heavy berry flavors tempered by herbal notes. Same goes for the finish, which is thick and hefty but a little sticky.",86,Viña Bisquertt 2007 Ecos de Rulo Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"Tempranillo could be an interesting variety in South Australia going forward. This rosé features hints of sous bois and cherries on the nose, then adds melon and spice notes on the palate. It's plump in the mouth, then finishes on a dry, silky note.",88,Gemtree 2016 Luna de Fresca Biodynamic Tempranillo Rosé (McLaren Vale)
"If forced to drink too much of this clumsy, grassy, horsey smelling blend, you might be a dissident, too. This is sticky and cloying on the palate, with sweet, candied, herbal black-fruit flavors that finish under a covering of residual sugar.",83,Dissident 2014 Reserve Red (Curicó Valley)
This wine has a geranium aroma and a strangely perfumed character. It is light and fruity although not likely to develop much.,83,Quinta do Romeu 2011 Red (Douro)
"This 100% varietal wine sourced primarily from Oakville Ranch Vineyard is exuberant with rich, round red fruit and earthy sage notes. Bright and lively, with underlying grip, it offers further full-bodied flavors of vanilla, dark chocolate and tobacco as it opens.",92,Sojourn 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"Here's a big, fruity, jammy Cabernet. It shows ripe, candied flavors of cherries, raspberries and chocolate, with polished tannins and a dry, spicy finish.",85,Lyeth 2007 L de Lyeth Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"Aged more than two years in air-dried French oak, this is classic Oakville Cabernet Sauvignon, velvety and plush. It boasts juicy blackberry and black cherry fruit aromas and flavors, with weighty oak and a mix of coconut flake and chocolate that linger on the finish.",93,Venge 2011 Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"Young and tight, this wine is scented with fresh raspberries and cocoa. The fruit flavors include red currant and spicy cherry as well, and it feels sleek and elegant, though confined. The way the wine spreads out across the palate is encouraging, as are the hints of pepper, herb and stone. Decant before drinking.",89,Brian Carter Cellars 2005 Byzance Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Baked black-plum aromas meet with star anise on the nose of this bottling. The texture is easy and light on the sip, where somewhat muddled flavors of mulberry and dried earth ride a decent acidity that rises toward the finish.",86,Bridlewood 2014 Pinot Noir (Monterey County)
"Shows rich, firm mountain tannins and well-ripened, concentrated flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and cocoa, and is thoroughly dry. But the wine loses a few points for hot caramelization, which may be partly over-charred oak and partly shriveled, overripe berries, if not both.",85,Meeker 2004 Kiss Ridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)
"This three-grape white blend starts with oily aromas and weight before finding some minerality and white-fruit notes. The palate has citrusy kick and zing to bolster green apple and orange flavors. The finish is wide, a touch clumsy and citrusy in flavor, with tang and lasting freshness.",85,Dinastía Vivanco 2012 Vivanco Viura-Malvasia-Tempranillo Blanco White (Rioja)
"It displays a very pretty pink color, but that's the showiest side of a rather reserved wine. The nose smells slightly of rosebush and the palate is a bit watery, with some stone fruit and noticeable tension.",83,Vino Vargas 2013 Costa Rosa Rosé (Paso Robles)
"This is an herbal, cool wine. Concentrated citrus flavors percolate through the wine to give freshness and bright acidity. It's light, very crisp and ready to drink.",85,Domaine de Villargeau 2014 Les Genêts Gris Sauvignon Blanc (Coteaux du Giennois)
"Dusty berry and cherry aromas include candied notes of cherry cough drop and marshmallow. Simple and choppy in feel, with some resiny oak character, this tastes like red plum and vanilla, while the aftertaste turns salty.",85,Viña Albali 2011 Crianza Tempranillo (Valdepeñas)
"The Gamache brothers call this blend, which is half Cabernet Franc, one quarter Merlot, and the rest split between Malbec and Syrah, a happy accident—the result of having a shortage of Cabernet Sauvignon for blending. The Franc is a great base wine, a little rough and green, but packed with firm, cool-site red grape flavors. Aromatic and tasting of mixed fruits, it's blended just ahead of bottling, so the juice gets the same care as the pricier varietal wines.",87,Gamache 2005 Boulder Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a bit rustic, with superripe blackberry flavors that veer into raisins. As a consequence, there's a fruity sweetness at its core. It's also extremely tannic. While it's flashy and impressive, it won't benefit from age due to its inherent instabilities.",87,Black Ridge 2008 San Andreas Red (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this opens with aromas of ripe plum, black-skinned berry and a whiff of cedar. The palate delivers spiced blueberries, dried blackberries, mocha, clove and crushed herbs alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2019.",90,Castello di Meleto 2010 Rainero Red (Toscana)
"Dense, smoky aromas of well-toasted oak are lactic on impact, with blackberry and cassis scents in support. This is woody, resiny and tannic on the palate, which makes it rough now but bodes well for down the line. Charred, toasty oak and herbal blackberry flavors finish minty, with a speck of creosote. Drink through 2020.",90,Lagar de Bezana 2013 Edición Limitada Syrah (Cachapoal Valley)
"Hard-driving aromas of nettle, jalapeño, sea brine, wet stones and grapefruit set up a chunky palate with a ton of weight. Passion fruit, orange and controlled vegetal flavors are in harmony. Drink now.",88,Arboleda 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Aconcagua Costa)
"Crisp, textured and with great acidity, this wine is still developing. It is packed with fresh citrus and apple fruits cut with strong minerality. Drink this structured wine from 2017.",90,Domaine de la Croix Senaillet 2014  Saint-Véran
"Thickly textured and sweet, with simple fruity flavors of cherries, strawberries and watermelon.",81,Altoona Hills 2008 Rosé Kosher Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)
"The result of a joint venture between the Chapoutier and Laughton families, this is a full-bodied, superripe wine. Aromas and flavors of chocolate and raisined cassis are almost Amarone-like, while the tannins are softly dusty in texture and the finish long.",91,Cluster M45 2008 Shiraz (Heathcote)
"This is a smooth, rich Cabernet whose fruity flavors are upfront, yet it has the complex, upscale structure of a great wine. With classic blackberry and crème de cassis flavors, it's almost as good as its more expensive vineyard-designated brethren from Janzen, at half the price.",92,Janzen 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Powerful and dense, this shows structured, ripe and concentrated black plum and dark cherry flavors. It has dense, firm tannins, which look likely to dominate the wine for many years, leaving a strong, dry aftertaste.",92,Domaine François Lamarche 2005 Clos de Vougeot  (Clos de Vougeot)
"Made with organically farmed fruit, this blend of Grillo and Viognier shows zesty freshness and floral richness. The palate shows creamy heft and cleansing acidity.",87,Feudo di Santa Tresa 2011 Rina Ianca White (Sicilia)
"You could get lost in the enticing fragrance of this wine thanks to wild berry, blue flower, baking spice, chopped herb and saddle leather aromas. The smooth, elegantly structured palate is just as inviting, doling out juicy black cherry, raspberry, cinnamon and white pepper flavors. Polished tannins and fresh acidity lend balance and support. An impressive effort from this winery—one of Montalcino's little known gems.",95,Armilla 2012  Brunello di Montalcino
"It's rare in Burgundy that a producer can add his name to a vineyard, but Faiveley's tradition goes back at least a century. This is huge and dense; the notes of spice, sweet black plum and acidity are all comfortably balanced with the powerful tannic structure. This needs at least seven years of aging.",94,Domaine Faiveley 2010 Clos des Cortons Faiveley  (Corton)
"Toasted nut and bread crust aromas carry over to the bright palate along with mature apple, strawberry, citrus and a note of dried herb. Soft small bubbles lend elegance while fresh acidity lifts the finish.",88,De Filippi 2010 Mariacristina Pas Dosé Metodo Classico Pinot Nero (Oltrepò Pavese)
"Spicy and lightly peppery, this fresh rosé brings concentrated strawberry fruit into focus. Made from organically grown grapes, it expands into a full-bodied finish with a lick of milk chocolate.",90,Upper Five 2015 Rosé of Grenache (Rogue Valley)
"Flavors roll from cranberry to sweet red cherry in a red-fruit riot. It was aged in 52% new and 24% one-year-old oak, but it's unobtrusive and not especially toasty. The barrel time has begun to smooth out any bumps and rough edges, though a touch of phenolic bite remains. Drink from 2018 to 2022.",90,Chehalem 2014 Ridgecrest Vineyards Reserve Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge)
"This is a solid wine with its dark tannins and structure from a vineyard close to some of the greatest Grands Crus. It is concentrated, showing the density of the appellation. There is a basic richness to this wine with its ripe black fruits. It is developing slowly and has a fine future. Drink from 2022.",93,Louis Latour 2014 Les Suchots Premier Cru  (Vosne-Romanée)
"This blend of 70% Sangiovese, 20% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon from a vineyard at the 33rd degree north latitude shows blackberry jam with vanilla bean, shaved cinnamon and plump purple flowers on the nose. Red currant and red cherries pop on the palate alongside lots of earthy flavors of wet clay. The tannins need a bit of mellowing still.",89,Fallbrook 2012 Dalla Collina Gracie Hill Vineyard Red (South Coast)
"Ripe and full in the mouth, this is a yellow fruit and citrus flavored wine. Tangy, salty and textured, it also has a rich feel with its peach and kiwi accents. It's a wine for aging, so drink from 2017.",90,Domaine Loew 2012 Bruderbach Clos des Frères Riesling (Alsace)
"Smooth and supple, this wine has structure and tannin so well cushioned by the ripe fruits and fine acidity. The structure and tannins are integrated into the rich red fruits and dark plum juiciness. The aftertaste, with an elegant freshness, brings the balance together. Drink from 2018.",93,Domaine Jean Grivot 2013 Roncières Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges)
"Expressive notes of white pepper, watercress and citrus make this a quintessential and zippy Weinviertel Grüner, where the variety is known in the local dialect as “Pfefferl”, i.e. little pepper.",90,Ebner-Ebenauer 2013 Hermanschachern Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel)
"This is a bold and powerful yet layered and nuanced wine, with hints of green peppercorn, tobacco leaf, cigar box and leather that add depth and interest to the cassis and brambly blackberry core. The gripping palate offers structured, mouthcoating tannins that are framed by ample acidity and ripe black berry tones. Notes of spicy black licorice and espresso unfold on the long finish. It's delicious now, but this will age beautifully through 2020.",93,Glenelly 2011 Lady May Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch)
"Firm and structured, this dense and dark wine offers ripe black fruits and a concentrated texture. It also shows good acidity and the fruitiness of 2011, giving a wine that is both rich and fresh. Age and drink from 2017.",93,Domaine Chanson 2011 Clos des Mouches Premier Cru  (Beaune)
"Tasted from a half bottle, the rich and complex flavors of Brut La Française show just that extra touch of maturity. The wine has peach and almond flavors that contrast well with the taut, nervy edge. It's full in the mouth and ripe, and works well both as an apéritif and a food Champagne.",90,Taittinger NV La Française Brut  (Champagne)
"This pleasant Merlot is a little tough and gritty, but it's rich and candied in blackberry and cherry, roasted almond and vanilla flavors. Give it some time to breathe in the glass.",86,Robert Mondavi 2010 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Nectarine, apricot and botrytis aromas are sound but familiar. Round, full but not quite sticky, this tastes like toffee, honey and pear, with baking spice flavors, nutmeg in particular, on the finish.",88,Viña Requingua 2013 Toro de Piedra Grand Reserve Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Curicó Valley)
"Vanilla, baking spice, cranberry and cherry aromas lead to soft, medium-bodied fruit flavors with an elegant styling. It's a very pretty representation of the vintage with good balance.",89,Market Vineyards 2011 Arbitrage Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Dry herb and spice aromas precede a solid, drawn-down palate, with lively acidity and flavors of medium-dark berry, toast and herb. Modest in intensity, this is composed.",85,Zinio 2008  Rioja
"A tongue-scraping, bone-dry style reminiscent of an Australian Riesling, this aromatic, juicy and lightly effervescent wine tastes of citrus fruits and skins, along with hints of grapefruit and cucumber. There's plenty of acidity to cut through rich sauces.",88,Penner-Ash 2008 Riesling (Willamette Valley)
"Subdued aromas of French oak, toast and acacia waft out of the glass. The rather lean palate offers oak-driven spice, chopped herb and a hint of citrus set against racy acidity. It's rather shy on fruit richness.",86,Poggio Alloro 2014 Le Mandorle Riserva  (Vernaccia di San Gimignano)
"Continues Martin Ray's track record with this bottling, an elegant, likable Pinot Noir that appeals for its silky texture and forward fruit. Cherry, currant, toasty oak, vanilla and white chocolate flavors end with a spicy, clean finish.",88,Martin Ray 2006 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Made with dried Garganega grapes, this has delicate aromas suggesting dried white flowers, ripe fig and a whiff of cake spice. The rounded palate offers mature apricot, acacia honey and light touch of cinnamon.",88,Ca' Rugate 2014 La Perlara  (Recioto di Soave)
"90-92 Barrel sample. The juicy blackcurrant flavors of the year show through here, the wine a firm balance between juicy fruit and the driest of tannins.",91,Château les Ormes de Pez 2009 Barrel sample  (Saint-Estèphe)
"A dark core of black plum, blueberry and violet marks the nose of this single-vineyard bottling. The palate showcases purple fruit and floral notes, with concentrated black plum skin and more violet leading the way.",88,Epiphany 2014 Hampton Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"This is a dark, intensely astringent wine with so much grape and oak tannin that it's challenging to enjoy now. Since PV is known as a grape that provides color and tannin in Bordeaux wines, it's no wonder that it's so stiff today. It will drink best after 2020.",87,Parducci 2013 Reserve Petit Verdot (Mendocino)
"With a pretty pink-salmon color, this Pinot Noir-based blush is rich and full-bodied. It has considerable weight for a bubbly, but the acidity and freshness and yeasty tang lift it up to Champagne elegance. Impossible not to fall in love with this raspberry-scented beauty, but why wouldn't you want to?",94,Schramsberg 2007 Brut Rosé Sparkling (North Coast)
"Fruity, crisp, this is a classic Provence rosé. It is packed with fragrant raspberry fruits, bright acidity and a bright, warm, sun-drenched aftertaste. Drink now.",85,Barton & Guestier 2011 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Split pea and earthy mushroom give way to sparkling acidity and a bright, flush taste of lemon and grapefruit in this succulent white, low in oak imprint. This is a food-friendly wine that can stand on its own, complex and layered with a citrus-squeezed finish.",90,Kunde 2015 Block 4SB20 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Valley)
"Lightly smoky, this is an attractive, simple and fruity Chablis. It has apple and pear flavors balanced with soft acidity. Smooth and round, it's a wine for medium-term aging, so drink now–2018.",85,Domaine L. Chatelain 2012  Chablis
"A layered, somewhat delicate nose of rose petals, purple flowers, cola spice and raspberry-laced chocolate serves as the introduction to this bottling. Cherry, cranberry and raspberry emerge subtly on the sip, lifted by potpourri and sagebrush that fit into a chalky and tight structure. This will age very well.",92,Stephen Ross 2015 Bien Nacido Vineyards Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"This wine by winemaker and owner Dan Kessler offers a zesty nose of crushed boysenberry, black raspberry, scarlet rose petal, wild sage and a touch of violet. There is lots of fresh zip to the sip, where woody elderberries and black plum are lifted by mint and more lively violet character. The finish is laced with juniper.",93,Kessler-Haak 2012 Ohana Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Made from Pinot Noir, this blush is dry and low in alcohol, with a great burst of acidity. It's a fun wine, but the strawberry and watermelon flavors, unfortunately, are thin.",84,Tedeschi 2012 Rosé (Sonoma Coast)
"This is just the second time that this winery has released a Dolcetto, both sourced from the Dwelley vineyard. It's a very pretty wine, the color of Pinot Noir, and captures some of the feminine elegance of that grape as well. Scents of fresh crushed raspberries rise from the glass, lightly dusted with cocoa. Complex details of fresh herb add further interest.",90,Walla Walla Vintners 2011 Dolcetto (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Fans of Moscato will like this bubbly, semidry version. With a syrupy profile and aromas of artificial vanilla, it offers plenty of juicy fruit.",84,Allure NV Bubbly Moscato (California)
"A light salmon color, aromas like sliced peaches and watermelon, flavors like canteloupe and a smooth texture combine for a substantive rosé that's not just a light thirst quencher. It is more rich and less tart than many others.",86,Sanglier Cellars 2014 Sun Tusque Dry Rosé (Sonoma County)
"Butterscotch, vanilla, spiced apple and wood-grain aromas make up an intriguing bouquet. This has lemony acidity and weight to go with leesy lime and apple flavors that turn cidery on the finish.",88,Bodegas Muriel 2010 Viña Muriel Reserva Chardonnay (Rioja)
"Dark berry, rose petal, tilled soil, aromatic herb, leather and a whiff of game are just some of the aromas you'll find on this intense, full-bodied wine. The palate is still tight, showing wild cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, baking spice and tobacco alongside firm tannins that need time to unwind. It already has depth but will develop even more complexity over the next decade and more. Drink 2018–2027.",93,Cascina delle Rose 2012 Rio Sordo  (Barbaresco)
"A signature wine created by Domingos Soares Franco of J.M. da Fonseca to celebrate Portuguese blends, this is superb, a powerhouse of complex flavors, fresh, dark and elegant all at the same time. It is firm but not overpowering, finished by smooth toast, dark and powerful.",94,José Maria da Fonseca 2003 Hexagon Red (Terras do Sado)
"This shows wonderfully layered, complex flavors, in addition to great structure. Thoroughly dry, with rich, fine tannins, it flatters with red and black currant, red cherry, milk chocolate, licorice, root beer, vanilla, dusty spice and smoky oak flavors. Luscious now and through 2010.",93,Beringer 2004 Alluvium Red Table Wine Red (Knights Valley)
"Aromas of wild berry, violet, rose and Mediterranean herb lead the nose of this easy drinking, polished red. The juicy palate doles out blackberry, black cherry, white pepper and star anise while bright acidity and supple tannins offer support. Drink through 2017.",90,Poggio Scalette 2013  Chianti Classico
"Long Island Malbec occupies an unusual place in the spectrum of global wine, showing little resemblance to its cousins in Argentina or France. This one is deeply concentrated, with forward blackberry and cherry flavors—clearly showing its New World identity—yet grounded in acidity and a dark, savory mineral tone. It's a promising wine with light footed elegance.",89,Bedell 2013 Malbec (North Fork of Long Island)
"Floral, spicy plum aromas come with notes of lemon and chili pepper. This Tempranillo is rudimentary, with a creamy, pasty palate. Baked cherry and berry flavors end with almost syrupy thickness and a touch of chocolate flavor.",84,Montalvo Wilmot 2013 MW Quintos de la Tejera Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"With its zingy acidity and ripe raspberry and cherry flavors, this Pinot Noir has a sweet-and-sour quality that's reminiscent of Chinese sauce for pork or chicken. Drink now.",85,Shadowbox 2009 Anne Katherina Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"Aromas of tomato, spiced cherry, leather and fresh herbs are clean and appealing. A standard, balanced mouthfeel is medium in body, with dry, woody flavors of peppery plum and berry fruits. Minty and darker on the finish.",86,Bodegas Navarro López 2011 Pergolas Old Vines Crianza Tempranillo (Valdepeñas)
"Orange-marmalade aromas set the stage for a rather full-bodied, dry and flavorful wine. Floral and fruity elements are counter-balanced by a tangy texture and subtle mineral accents. A classic of the type, it has a lot of personality, a great presence on the palate and a lingering finish.",91,Dry Creek Vineyard 2016 Dry Chenin Blanc (Clarksburg)
"Juicy black and red cherry flavors enwrap classic cedar, graphite and peppercorn notes in this brawny, full-bodied wine. Accessible despite its bulk of tannin, its texture leans leathery, with clove scents lingering long on the finish.",92,Castello di Amorosa 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"The Reserva version of the popular Borba brand in Portugal is a dense, powerfully tannic wine. Its juicy black currant and blackberry fruits are suffused with tannins—its dry core surrounded by richness. Hints of dark chocolate and pepper come from the alcohol but certainly don't take away from the great fruitiness of the wine. Drink from 2019.",93,J. Portugal Ramos 2014 Marquês de Borba Reserva Red (Alentejo)
"A blend of several vineyards, this was aged for 17 months in French oak. The barrel influence is subtle, but the time in wood has helped to round out the tannins. The strawberry and raspberry fruit still has sharp edges and an herbal streak, bumping up against a smooth, chocolaty finish.",88,Torii Mor 2012 Deux Verres Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This inky, thick and well- extracted wine (made from Casavecchia grapes) offers very pretty aromas of dark chocolate, prune, exotic spice and black jammy fruit. The tannins are soft and polished and the wine performs even better after a few minutes in the glass.",90,Terre del Principe 2007 Centomoggia Casavecchia (Terre del Volturno)
"This fresh, young and fruity wine is made to be drunk young. It has soft tannins and intense acidity, mitigated by the ripe, red fruits and smoky aftertaste.",86,Domaine Rotier 2013 Esquisse Red (Gaillac)
"Aromas of pressed Spanish broom, oak, marzipan and citrus blend in the glass. The rich, medium-bodied palate offers candied nectarine zest, vanilla and toasted almond alongside bright acidity. Drink now or hold for a few more years.",88,Casalfarneto 2012 Crisio Riserva  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico)
"Blackberry and cherry notes are fresh and primary in this Merlot-based Bordeaux blend, but shaded with interesting notes of coffee and smoke. The palate is juicy and supple with soft, furry tannins that accentuate a velvety mouthfeel. It's a boldly structured wine, but elegantly framed and long on the finish.",87,Baiting Hollow Farm Vineyard 2010 Horse Rescue Mirage Red (North Fork of Long Island)
"Compost, rubber and stalky berry aromas come through the nose to the mouth. The palate is tight and tannic. The finish is narrow, hinting at stalky berry aromoas.",84,Pinuaga 2013 Nature Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"The aromas are bright and generous, with notes of honeysuckle and canned peach. The fruit is so sweet on the palate, it drinks almost off dry, with abundant stone-fruit and floral flavors that linger.",87,Martinez & Martinez 2015 Tudor Hills Vineyard Viognier (Yakima Valley)
"Lightly fruity and fresh, a wine that has some crisp acidity although without much definition. The aftertaste is clean, bringing out attractive citrus and red currant fruits. Screwcap.",84,Château d'Haurets 2012 Red (Bordeaux Rosé)
"While it has sufficient tannin, the wine also has a feeling of generous black currant and berry fruits. It's dry with considerable concentration, but it's future looks good, so keep for 5–6 years.",88,Château la Croix Saint-Pierre 2010 Grande Réserve  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"What a powerfully lovely, lilting and blockbuster of a wine this is. Seamless in baked rhubarb and a velvety texture it never stops impressing, allowing for nuanced explosions of black cherry and Asian spice to coat the palate and become more complex the longer each sip lingers. Deliciously drinkable now, the wine will take on additional wow factor over time.",95,Dehlinger 2013 Champ de Mars Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Well on the dry side of brut, this wine pushes acidity and the freshest citrus along with an apple-skin texture. It shows some bottle age toastiness, while offering a delicious bright finish.",90,J. Dumangin Fils NV Extra Brut Premier Cru  (Champagne)
"Made from 56% Pinot Noir and 44% Chardonnay and given multiple extra years in bottle, this wine offers a substantial body weight within crisp well-defined acidity. Apple skin, bread dough and a note of hazelnut combine to afford warm welcoming flavor. Zero sugar is added.",91,Longboard NV Late Disgorged Brut Zero Sparkling (Russian River Valley)
"An old vine field blend from the family-owned estate, this wine is dense with both tannin and ripe black fruit. Plum and blackberry flavors are balanced by acidity and chalky texture. Drink now.",92,Quinta Dona Matilde 2011 Red (Douro)
"Floral currant and plum aromas fall squarely into the red-fruit spectrum. While not overly deep or dense, this has some weight to go with flavors of cassis, berry and chocolaty oak. It finishes mildly, with soft oak and a light herbal note.",88,TintoNegro 2014 Malbec (Uco Valley)
"Quite an interesting Chardonnay, in an era when so many are too sweet and extracted. There's plenty of orange and apricot fruit flavor, but also a brilliant streak of minerality, like a lick of cold steel, and the overall taste is dry. Really easy to like, with lots of complexity to warrant repeated sipping.",92,Corvalle 2010 Weka Ranch Vineyard Chardonnay (Oak Knoll District)
"A Cabernet of strong olive, oak and cassis aromas, medium in weight with smoky overtones that tastes a bit hotter than it is.",84,Pavilion Crossing 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi)
"Big, bold, brawny yet strangely elegant, this Zin holds plenty of appeal. The vineyard is 96 years old, giving the wine unusual concentration and complexity. It's one of the winery's riper 2011 Zins, massive in wild raspberries, cherries and prunes, with spicy notes of black pepper and a nice touch of smoky oak.",92,Hartford Court 2011 Old Vine Dina's Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"The best Still Waters release right now, this presents a sophisticated nose of cherry chutney, black pepper, blueberry and burning sagebrush. On the palate, blueberry fruit gets dashed with more black sage and tobacco, and the acidity and tannins are just right.",93,Still Waters 2009 Reflections of Still Waters Estate Grown Red (Paso Robles)
"Now definitely mature, even drying up, this wine needs to be drunk now. It has developed a dry, tannic character, woody and stalky, although its balance is still there and the aftertaste has some juiciness.",84,Château Roullet 2007  Canon-Fronsac
"A perfumed wine with wood aging flavors over citrus. From the Vinho Verde region, it's a curious hybrid of a wine, neither crisp enough nor rich enough.",82,Casca Wines 2009 Monte Cascas Reserva Branco White (Minho)
"Bright, generous and intense, this offers shadings of spice and leather around dried berry and cola aromas. The overall effect is that of power, complexity and balance.",92,Negretti 2006  Barolo
"Very rich and oaky, with bigtime flavors of grilled pineapples and peaches, pears, buttered toast and oak spices. Only 250 cases produced.",87,Sunstone 2007 Reserve Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County)
"Rich, fruity and soft, this wine has a tang of orange peel along with ripe citrus and red fruits. Fresh and crisp at the end, it is ready to drink.",88,Yves Leccia 2015 Domaine D'E Croce Rosé (Patrimonio)
"A strong, insistent Chardonnay, brimming with oak, acidity and very ripe tangerine, pineapple, Asian pear, lime and honey flavors. It's dry and tart, with a mineral edge. Should develop for a few years.",90,Patz & Hall 2009 Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Feels hot and Porty in the mouth, although it's very dry, with bitter raisinskin and shriveled cherry flavors. The alcohol approaches 16%.",81,Gia Domella 2007 Reserve Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"This wine is crisp, taut and with a strong mineral texture. Spice and green-fruit flavors are shot through with acidity and have a steely edge. Hold the wine until late 2017 for it to soften.",85,Château la Verrière 2016  Bordeaux Blanc
"Dark for a rosé, and heavy in texture, with berry and cocoa flavors. Lacks charm, but at least it's dry.",82,Vinum 2009 Rosé of Cabernet Sauvignon Rosé (California)
"This blend of Syrah and Grenache bears ripe, forward flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, dried currant, anise and cedar. The tannins are massive, but ripe and sweet, and there is a green note that gives the wine some bitterness.",87,Epiphany 2010 Revelation Red (Santa Barbara County)
"Black as a cave and thick as jam, this wine offers a decadence of black licorice and chocolate truffle, aged entirely in new French oak for 30 months. Fruit plays a supporting part to the richness, making for a wine that's a dessert in itself.",92,On Q 2012 Appassionata Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville)
"A classic Napa Valley Bordeaux blend, dry, smooth, complex and elegant. Based on Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, it's an instant pleaser, from the dryness and mellow texture to the delicious blackberry, cassis, plum, dark chocolate and smoky oak flavors. It will provide wonderful drinking over many years.",95,Chimney Rock 2009 Elevage Red (Stags Leap District)
"The valley is in a remote, warm part of Napa County. The wine is quite good. Rich and softly opulent, it offers waves of red cherry, raspberry, chocolate, orange tea, anise and Asian spice flavors that go on and on. Not an ager, but delicious now and through 2011 or so.",91,Harrington 2006 Wild Horse Valley Pinot Noir (Napa County)
"Made with 90% Sangiovese and 10% Ciliegiolo, this opens with blackberry and Mediterranean brush aromas. The easygoing palate delivers red cherry and clove alongside chewy tannins. Enjoy soon.",87,Perazzeta 2014 Sara Red (Toscana)
"Delicate, subdued and feminine, here is a luminous sparkler with pretty floral tones and light shadings of stone fruit and melon. You'll love its delicate, creamy texture and long peachy finish.",86,Malibràn NV Gorio Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
"Grown on granite soil that is shot through with quartz, this is the epitome of a mineral, structured wine. On top of that texture, the wine has ripe lemon and green plum fruits that are full of juicy flavor. The wine is so fresh it could do with a few months aging. Drink from late 2016.",87,Rui Roboredo Madeira 2014 Beyra Reserva Quartz White (Beira Interior)
"This is Rochioli's basic Pinot Noir. It's a beautiful wine, marked by great structure and accessible fruit. Near-perfect acids and tannins lend it elegance, while the cherry and cola flavors have a rich touch of smoky oak. Drink now.",91,Rochioli 2009 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
Layers of new wood dominate the aromas and flavor of this wine. They smother the fruit leaving a question mark over its future.,84,Château Lavillotte 2011  Saint-Estèphe
"Aromas of plum, blackberry, violet and exotic spice jump out of the glass. The bright, polished palate offers black cherry, raspberry jam and black pepper alongside fresh acidity. It's made for immediate drinking pleasure so enjoy soon.",88,Conterno Fantino 2014 Vignota  (Barbera d'Alba)
"A lemon flavored wine that is soft and fruity. With its zesty, tight texture and really crisp acidity, the wine is lively and crisp. Drinkable now, it will be better from early 2017.",86,J. Portugal Ramos 2015 Vila Santa Lois White (Alentejano)
"There's a slight, lithe line of butterscotch on the nose of this bottling, with lots of lemon blossoms and Meyer lemon juice overshadowing the buttery aspect. The palate is tart in green apple and Anjou pear flavors, followed by honeydew and white peach.",90,Point & Line 2015 Sierra Madre Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"Stalky, gritty aromas of olive, eucalyptus and berry fruits are 100% Chilean. This feels big, wide and tannic. Flavors of roasted berry fruits are stalky and herbal, while this finishes with peppery, herbal overtones and gritty, chewy tannins. Drink through 2021.",90,Viña Tarapacá 2013 Gran Reserva Etiqueta Negra Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"This wine is a blend of Sangiovese (69%), Cabernet Sauvignon (17%) and Syrah. Dried raspberry, herb and cocoa aromas lead to reserved cranberry and cherry flavors that linger.",88,Brian Carter Cellars 2011 Tuttorosso Red (Yakima Valley)
"Produced from Henry Fessy's own cru vineyards, the wine is fruity and very accessible to drink young. Generous berry fruits and soft tannins make this an attractive wine. The aftertaste brings in light acidity. Drink now.",86,Henry Fessy 2015  Brouilly
"From 130-year-old vines, this is a densely layered, bigtime Zin. The flavor concentration is just tremendous, a critical mass of briary, wild blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate, licorice and fabulous Asian spice. True, the alcohol is on the high side, but the wine finishes balanced and dry. Will take up to 10 years of cellaring.",92,Sausal 2005 Century Vines Zinfandel (Alexander Valley)
"Delicate scents of blue flower, red berry and pressed powder float out of the glass. The palate shows good structure for the vintage, offering juicy wild cherry, anise and a hint of chopped herb accompanied by lithe tannins and bright acidity. Drink through 2017.",88,I Sodi 2014  Chianti Classico
"This bottling from a vineyard northwest of the Sta. Rita Hills opens with buttercream, lemon peel, lime spritz and toasted almond scents. The buttery quality extends to the full but energetic palate, where it's cut by lemon marmalade, savory smoke and toast notes. The finish is nutty.",91,Cebada 2013 Chardonnay (Santa Ynez Valley)
"This isn't a big, powerful, long-aging Pinot Noir. It doesn't have the flash and pizazz of more famous and expensive bottlings. What it is, is an awfully good wine that shows Pinot's silky, spicy fruit qualities in a modest way. Like a great supporting actor, it will be happy to let the food take center stage.",87,Clos du Bois 2006 Sonoma Reserve Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Lovely, dense aromas of dried flowers, herbs, cherries and chocolate immediately capture attention. This is a superbly elegant wine, with both precision and power. Orange-peel flavors highlight deep cherry compote, with tension, balance and length in abundance.",93,CedarCreek 2012 Block 2 Platinum Pinot Noir (Okanagan Valley)
"With no oak influence, this Cabernet Franc is chock full of pristine raspberry and cherry notes. It's quite concentrated on the palate with deep, ripe red-fruit flavor, but marked by tart cranberry acidity and a long, lingering finish and just a hint of leafy green notes.",89,Lamoreaux Landing 2010 Estate Bottled T23 Unoaked Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes)
"Pretty decent for a 10-spot, with slightly floral aromas, a hint of ginger and underripe pear fruit. It's medium bodied, with a dry, lightly textured, bitter finish. Drink now.",85,Oxford Landing 2016 Pinot Grigio (South Australia)
"Still tight and closed up, this wine has potential, offering ripe citrus and white fruits and nervy, tangy texture. Concentrated and dense, it's a wine for the long term; drink from 2020. Olivier is a large medieval hunting estate that, since the 19th century, has belonged to the Bethmann family. The 148 acres of vines and forests are managed environmentally.",93,Château Olivier 2013  Pessac-Léognan
"This rich wine has both open, ripe black fruits and the freshness of the vintage. On top, there is an extra layer of color and exuberance. It includes some Petit Verdot, rare in Saint-Émilion.",88,Château de Fonbel 2011  Saint-Émilion
"Medium-bodied, spicy and peppery, this offers dark plum and earthy leather, the fruit tasting quite ripe.",86,Taj 2008 Syrah (Los Carneros)
"This is a barrel selection, and as such, may be expected to show extra layers of concentration—more stuffing overall. It's a rich, smoky, lush wine, with a complex mix of red fruits ranging from rhubarb to raspberry to Bing cherries. Spicy highlights and a frame of orange peel also enter the picture. You might wish to give this another couple of years of bottle age before popping the cork. Drink 2018–2025.",92,Elk Cove 2014 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Impressively rich and ripe in fruit, offering waves of black cherries and chocolate. Feels soft and lush and luxurious in the mouth, with a sweet oak finish. Certainly dazzles with opulence, but the softness and sweetness makes you wonder about its ageability. So drink between now and 2013 for freshness.",91,Monticello Vineyards 2008 Tietjen Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"Dusty and still fairly fresh, but with that said this wine was certainly more in its prime six or eight months ago. Now it is slick but softening, with peach and citrus flavors doing their thing without much edge or kick.",86,Bodegas Faustino 2006 Faustino V Rosado Tempranillo (Rioja)
"Flower petal, mineral and blackberry aromas solidify the bouquet on this excellent Tempranillo. The palate is big and chewy, with fine balance and driving flavors of cherry, plum, vanilla and oak resin. With a finish that's bone dry and focused, this Ribera wine is ready to drink but can last another 5–8 years in a good cellar.",91,Protos 2006 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)
"This wine is lively and spicy, with cranberry and cherry flavors, juicy acidity and a strong impression of citrus. The tannins are firm and balanced, with a hint of stem showing through the finish.",89,Samuel Robert 2015 Vintner's Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Fruity and herbal in flavor and generous in texture, this is medium to full bodied and quite smooth in mouth feel. It smells like currants, black olives and dried herbs, and tastes a bit savory and complex along with the plummy fruit flavors.",86,HandCraft 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"This blend of 60% Pinot Noir and 40% Chardonnay from the Fess Parker team offers lemon blossom, baking soda and lime zest aromas on the light and flowery nose. Broad flavors of yellow apple and pear meet with a citrus twist on the finish.",90,Fesstivity 2014 Brut Cuvée Sparkling (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Here's a strongly flavored Merlot, made with ultraripe fruit. If it didn't have a good structure, the blackberry, currant, mocha and anise flavors alone would make it a fruit bomb. Fortunately, fine acidity and gorgeously thick tannins give it structure and backbone. Best for a year or two.",90,Crane Brothers 2005 Crane Ranch Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Ripe dark-skinned berry, French oak, espresso and coconut aromas emerge in the glass. Youthful and taut, the palate doles out Marasca cherry, crushed raspberry, truffle and vanilla flavors, set against a frame of tightly knit, refined tannins.",88,Talosa 2015  Rosso di Montepulciano
"Nothing like an Argentine Malbec, but not a bad wine. It's marked by high acidity that gives it a real bite, and exceptional dryness. Yet there's a good core of blackberry fruit. A rich steak will tease out the sweetness.",86,McManis 2010 Malbec (California)
"The 2015 version of this wine has scored big in New Zealand wine competitions, but this vintage is best consumed soon. It still retains a lovely, slightly creamy texture, but the aromas and flavors are trending toward sweet peas and green tomatoes. Drink up.",85,Starborough 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Made with organically farmed grapes, this opens with alluring scents of honeysuckle, hawthorn and white stone fruit. The silky palate delivers white peach, nectarine and green apple framed in bright acidity and a delicately foaming mousse.",90,Perlage 2016 Col di Manza Extra Dry  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Soft, smooth and forward, this tasty wine shows light and clean flavors of strawberry and raspberry, finishing with a lovely lick of caramel. It's immediately enjoyable, and should be consumed over the next two or three years.",88,Torii Mor 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Crunchy and somewhat bitter, this has tight citrus rind flavors and a whiff of vanilla. A small percentage of the blend spent a bit of time in neutral oak.",85,Yamhill Valley 2012 Pinot Blanc (McMinnville)
"A project of Master Sommelier Geoff Kruth with the assistance of winemaker Megan Glaab of Ryme Cellars, this is a light beguiling take on the famous appellation's most famous variety—one wrapped in crisp crunchy red fruit and floral aromatics of rose. Dried cherry highlights tight focused acidity and soft delicate layers of silky texture for a satisfying combination of elegance and quiet oak.",93,Lost and Found Winery 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Solid and powerful, it has a great mix of very ripe fruit with dense tannins. Blackberry fruits, laced with licorice and dark chocolate, contrast with a juicy, lightly herbal element. This mainly Merlot wine is destined for a fine future. Drink from 2017.",91,Château de Roquebrune 2010 Cuvée Reine  (Lalande de Pomerol)
"A stunning effort from Beckstoffer's famously gravelly site, this is a 100% varietal wine from one clone, made in a tiny amount. Exquisite aromas of blackberry and leather surround a velvety texture and spiky acidity, the tannins integrated and lengthy, with room to grow over time. Powerfully full bodied, this is a classic representation of the valley in expansive celebration of a ridiculously good vintage. Drink now through 2023.",94,Guarachi Family 2013 Beckstoffer Las Piedras Heritage Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
"Named after a parcel of vines, this youthful, fruity wine is on its way to being delicious. It has a proper steely character, shot through with acidity and minerality while the citrus character is strong and firm. Drink from 2015.",90,Michel Vattan 2012 Les L-O  (Sancerre)
"The spicy, evocative scent of Seville orange peel entices from the first sniff. The palate is dry, restrained and sylph-like but with time reveals tangerine and lemon zest. This is a feast, a celebration of citrus flavors, unfolding and shimmering at every moment. This is dry but faceted, taut but playful. Irresistible now but with a brilliant, aromatic and totally seductive future ahead. Drink 2016–2030.",95,Domaine Schoffit 2014 Rangen Grand Cru Clos Saint Théobald Riesling (Alsace)
"It's a shame more producers don't hold their Pinot Noirs back longer, for this bottling from Joe Davis reveals so much depth compared to current releases. Raspberry, rose petal, cola and cinnamon stick show on the nose, while the palate offers rounded flavors of dried strawberry, thyme and game. It's all intricately woven by time into something wonderful.",95,Arcadian 2009 Sierra Madre Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"This is a sweet, soft Port, with plenty of fruit. Sultana and orange jelly flavors are cut with some spirit. The wine leans much more towards fruit than wood, unusual for a 20-year old. The wine, like all aged tawnies, is ready to drink.",87,Messias NV 20 Anos Tawny  (Port)
"A return to pure, single vineyard Sauvignon Blanc. With alcohol at 12.5% this dry wine is quite European in style. Elegant, lively and fresh, with a cool mix of cucumber, melon and green apple fruit flavors.",88,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2010 Horse Heaven Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Horse Heaven Hills)
"There's a very likable umami character to the nose of this wine, its soy and black pepper touches playing well with the lilac and dark fruit aromas. A blend of 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Petit Verdot, 17% Malbec, 6% Cabernet Franc and 1% Merlot, it offers bright blackberry and black cherry flavors on the palate, which transition to soy and sarsaparilla notes on the finish.",88,Proximity Twenty Six 2013 Red (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Light, bright and with lively acidity, this is already a juicy, delicious wine. It offers good fruitiness, with pink grapefruit flavors and a tangy, zesty aftertaste. Drink now.",88,Château Merlet 2016  Bordeaux Blanc
"This wine shows an intriguing touch of flinty, fumé character as well as ample melon and fig fruit. It's reasonably full bodied and textured for a wine of its ilk.",89,Cape Mentelle 2012 Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Margaret River)
"A very juicy, fruity, light wine that shows spice and fresh black currant fruits. The acidity is a major element in this cool year wine.",87,Zull 2007 Zweigelt (Niederösterreich)
"There's a lot of individuality to this wine, just not all good. The nose has cigar box and over-the-top sweet and baked aromas, yet the palate has a grating, acidic feel but also spice and raisiny flavors. All of it makes you more confused than confident; it has its good traits but seems out of whack.",84,Indomita 2008 Duette Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère (Maipo Valley)
"The gold luster is eye grabbing, and the nose doesn't back off as it yields cream, vanilla and toast atop tropical fruit. The mouth is full, with creamy pear and apple fruit and lots of oak. It's on the plus side in terms of power and weight, but it's largely balanced and clean.",86,Porta 2000 Chardonnay (Cachapoal Valley)
"Cavallotto didn't make any Barolo in the 2014 vintage due to the cold rainy weather so the firm's best grapes went into this vibrant polished Nebbiolo. It opens with enticing scents of rose, perfumed berry, chopped herb and a whiff of tilled soil that follow through to the racy medium-bodied palate along with crushed raspberry, cherry, star anise and mineral. It's nicely balanced, with firm acidity and taut refined tannins. Drink through 2020.",90,Cavallotto 2014 Nebbiolo (Langhe)
"Apple and other white-fruit aromas are appealing. The palate on this well-priced wine is nice and juicy, with a typical blend of green apple, peach and citrus flavors. This is fresh, minerally and linear on the finish. Drink now.",88,Con un Par 2011 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Brooding notes of black, crunchy cherry along with wood smoke and fir rise from the glass. On the palate there is a vein of tart, lively freshness that draws earthy smoke and full fruit notes towards the core, leaving shadows of smoke and fir, cherry, blueberry and white pepper around the fringes. Freshness is far more of a defining factor than silky tannins. This is authentic, unforced and very fresh.",94,Gernot and Heike Heinrich 2013 Alter Berg Blaufränkisch (Burgenland)
"Cured meat, game and mentholated herbal aromas lead on the nose of this Shiraz-Grenache-Mourvèdre blend, backed by fruity notes of red currant, plum and cherry. Those fruit-based aromas carry through to the round, approachable palate, with soft tannins and a peppered-mocha flavor that lingers on the finish. Drink now.",88,Ken Forrester 2007 Renegade G-S-M (Stellenbosch)
"Old-style Carmenère with green bean, mocha and muddy berry aromas. Tight and more acidic than expected, with generic red berry, chocolate and mocha flavors along with a palpable wave of green. Finishes quick and crisp.",84,San Elias 2010 Carmenère (Central Valley)
"Grillo Parlante (“talking cricket”) is a pure expression of Grillo with slightly oxidized aromas of butterscotch and caramel. Fresh fruit comes through as melon, apricot and candied lemon.",83,Fondo Antico 2009 Grillo Parlante Grillo (Sicilia)
"Coming from five different Syrah vineyards across the Columbia Valley, this wine offers high quality and value. It conveys black olives, iron, an earthy funk, chocolate and floral accents. The coffee and earth flavors are rich while still showing exquisite restraint.",91,Two Vintners 2012 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A pretty, expressive nose of fresh flowers, citrus and kiwi gives this Assyrtico added appeal. On the palate, slightly sweet tropical fruit and flowers will appeal to fans of a less bracing style of white. Pair with poultry, fruit.",85,Greek Wine Cellars 2010 Assyrtico (Santorini)
"This wine is reduced and somewhat flat in tone, with simple, light-bodied ripeness and plum and raspberry flavors.",84,Rutherford Ranch 2014 Two Range Red (Napa Valley)
"A generous helping of spicy new oak aromas and flavors dominates the taste of this full-bodied, broadly textured wine. Beyond the baking spices, more subtle meaty flavors come out with a second sip.",87,Terra d'Oro 2012 Red (Amador County)
"A rather closed nose gives way to a very light-bodied, lime-zest scented and pure palate that boasts the slightest shimmer of pepperiness and enhances its light-footed, barely-there credentials with the tiniest hint of fizz. If you like it light, clean and yet flavorful, this is for you.",90,Weszeli 2015 Langenlois Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"This small-quantity selection from within the Charles Vineyard was fermented by native yeast, and neither fined nor filtered. It is quite aromatic, full bodied and moderately fruity, and has a nice rounded mouthfeel, generous red-cherry and spice flavors and good structure from acidity and mild tannins. Tart cherry lingers on the finish.",91,Foursight 2013 Charles Vineyard Clone 05 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Named after the cherry trees that edge this vineyard, the wine is rich and structured. It has concentrated butts and ripe black-cherry flavors. Full bodied and with an aging potential, this fine wine should be drunk from 2018.",92,Pascal Aufranc 2015 Les Cerisiers Vieilles Vignes  (Juliénas)
"Almost tropical overtones on the nose announce ample pure fruit. Russet pear has both a touch of fresh Amalfi lemon and luscious honey. Yet the palate is slender, taut and dry. A lovely evocation of the varietal richness of Pinot Gris, framed on very light feet with elegance and poise. Totally appetizing, dry and moreish.",92,Domaine Pfister 2015 Tradition Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Simple and jammy, with sharp flavors of raspberries, cherries, gingersnap cookies and spices. Tasty and sweet, but lacking the structure to contain all that richness.",84,Lava Cap 2007 Merlot (El Dorado)
"While initially subdued on the nose, this zesty citrus-kissed Riesling offers loads of lemon and lime vitality. It's crisp and light bodied with a finish that's dry and mineral.",89,Silver Thread 2015 STV Estate Vineyard Riesling (Seneca Lake)
"Finely balanced wine, showing the warmth of 2009 as well as keeping bright peach, pink grapefruit and red berry fruit flavors. The wine shows lively final acidity for a delicious aftertaste.",91,Château les Valentines 2009 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This cuvée is a barrel selection, fermented with whole berries and aged in 35% new oak. Simple strawberry and raspberry fruit seems almost weightless, and the quick finish carries a strong streak of bouillon.",86,Maison L'Envoyé 2015 The Attaché Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"A subtle note of caramel adds richness to the baked apple aromas on the nose. On the palate, hints of chamomile tisane add to the baked apple flavors. The body is taut and linear. Rounded hints of baked apple persist even on the dry, clean and fresh finish.",92,Jean-Baptiste Adam 2014 Kaefferkopf Grand Cru Vieilles Vignes Riesling (Alsace)
"What's so wonderful about this Pinot is the way it reconciles all sorts of opposites. It's dry but sweet in fruit, and delicate yet potent at the same time. It's totally accessible now, but enormously complex. Flavors of raspberries and cherries meld with pomegranates and persimmons, as well as mushrooms, tea and licorice. It's a joy to drink now, and should develop in the cellar for at least 10 years.",96,Merry Edwards 2011 Coopersmith Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Aromas seem advanced, with notes of cherry liqueur, leather, barrel spices and raisinated dark fruit. The dried-fruit flavors are full with chalky tannins. Drink now.",86,Dubindil 2012 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"Made with native grapes Ripoli, Fenile and Ginestra, this concentrated, lumbering wine opens with aromas of oak, citrus and dried apricot. The dense palate offers oak extract, candied lemon, toast, and dried stone fruit. It finishes on a sugary sweet note of rock candy and butterscotch.",87,Marisa Cuomo 2011 Fiorduva Furore Bianco White (Costa d'Amalfi)
"This 100% Lagrein opens with aromas of blackberry and exotic spice. The straightforward, juicy palate delivers black cherry and a hint of cocoa framed in smooth tannins. Enjoy soon.",89,Kössler 2015 Lagrein (Alto Adige)
"Cranberry, pomegranate and a touch of bramble are found in the nose. The palate reveals fresh fruit flavors of sour red cherry, cranberry and red plum with a pleasant acidic backbone. Drink now or hold through 2016.",90,Miloš 2006 Stagnum Plavac Mali (Peljesac)
"The variety is unmistakable on this wine, with its aromas of black currant, black cherry, dried herb and spice. The palate is fruit filled but well structured, with tart acids and a firm squeeze of tannin. Dark chocolate notes linger on the finish.",88,Disruption 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington)
"Perfectly good and pedestrian, which means it's solid but common and regular, with rubbery, sturdy berry aromas followed by medium-intensity plum flavors. With good texture and proper weight, this passes every inspection criteria but stirs little curiosity. Good wine; nothing more.",86,CVNE 2005 Cune Crianza  (Rioja)
"Sauvignon Blanc can vary in style from merely crisp and almost neutral to more herbaceous examples like this. It conveys an assertive, slightly heavy personality with plenty of herb and eucalyptus flavors, a rather soft texture for this variety and dry finish.",82,Brutocao 2013 Feliz Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino County)
"You can find aromas of purple flower, red berry and a hint of chopped herb on the nose. But the palate is thin and diluted, offering suggestions of sour cherry and a green note of powdered sage alongside fleeting tannins. It finishes on a bitter, acidic note.",84,Albatreti 2014  Rosso di Montalcino
"Outstanding concentration rides an impressive structure in this huge but well-balanced wine. Freshly picked blackberries and raspberries meet hints of chocolate, baking spices and black pepper while vivid tannins and firm acidity lift up all those flavors and carry them to a lingering finish. Compelling to drink now, it's also built to age well. Best after 2020.",93,Ruby Hill Winery 2013 Jewel Collection Series Estate Reserve Zinfandel (Livermore Valley)
"Not bad but fading. This Trebbiano-Chardonnay blend features apple aromas and flavors, and then some quince and orange around the edges. Soft, with some banana on the finish. Drink right away because it won't last much longer.",83,Los Cielos 2006 Trebbiano (Mendoza)
"Everything about this wine is singing in harmony. The nose is fresh and pure, with raspberry, plum, spice and youthful rubbery aromas. The palate is elegant and impeccably balanced, while flavors of vanilla and coconut announce ample oak, with toasty, peppery plum and raspberry flavors waiting in the wings. Power, precision and elegance are draped all over the finish. Best from 2017 through 2025.",94,Telmo Rodríguez 2010 M2 de Matallana  (Ribera del Duero)
"Taking its name from the Chevaliers d'Arce who guarded this land in the 12th and 13th centuries, the small property is now under the watchful eye of Sylviane Garcin-Cathiard. This wine is still young and just balancing out. Firm tannins are shot through with ripe berry fruits and with crisp acidity. It is a wine that is will mature well, so drink from 2019 and consider this property a rising star.",88,Château d'Arce 2014  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux
"A rich, earthy Syrah from a new Terre Rouge vineyard designate, this exhibits well-integrated dark red and blue fruit amidst tobacco and herb highlights.",89,Terre Rouge 2009 Jay Wilderotter Vineyard Syrah (Shenandoah Valley (CA))
"Bay Area biotech scientist-turned-vintner Kristie Tacey offers a solid wine with sandalwood, pomegranate and a slight bitterness on the nose. The palate also shows pomegranate along with rhubarb, backed up by graphite minerality and brown spice throughout.",92,Tessier Winery 2013 Saveria Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"With 100 g/L residual sugar, this is a pleasantly sweet Moscato, with opening aromas of rose water and jasmine that delve into sweet peach and apple on the palate. Light and soft, it will satisfy as an accompaniment to strong cheeses or salumi.",86,Enotria 2012 Moscato (Mendocino County)
"With a dash of Petite Sirah, this wine, made from century-old vineyards, is extraordinarily rich. It explodes with blackberry, cherry, raspberry, chocolate, anise, vanilla fudge, pepper and clove flavors. The wine is a little on the sweet side, but not too much.",86,Ironstone 2006 Old Vine Reserve Zinfandel (Lodi)
"Named after the matriarch of the Riboli wine family, who founded what may be the first tasting room in California, this shows light yellow fruits on the nose. The palate combines lemon and apple with a slight hue of brown spice, offering plump fruit with a tang.",87,Maddalena 2013 Chardonnay (Monterey)
"This gorgeous blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot offers beautiful intensity and impressive complexity. Aromas here include black cherry, exotic spice, leather, fine tobacco and loads of plush, ripe fruit. It's a smooth velvety wine but the tannic backbone gives it lift and staying power.",94,I Giusti e Zanza 2007 Dulcamara Red (Toscana)
"Milk chocolate, cherry and raspberry aromas lead to sweet, supple luscious fruit flavors. It keeps you coming back for more.",90,Novelty Hill 2012 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a very Douro blend for this wine from Lisboa region. It brings structure and minerality to fill out the dark-black fruits. With ripe tannins and bright acidity balancing the fruit, it is ready to drink.",88,DFJ Vinhos 2014 DFJ Touriga Nacional-Touriga Franca Red (Lisboa)
"A showy, exuberant wine, from the hot pink color to the fresh, jammy aromas to the just-sweet finish. However, it feels soft in texture and body, with mild cherry-candy and peach flavors.",86,Bliss 2013 Estate Bottled Rosé (Mendocino)
"Passion fruit, lime and feline aromas give the bouquet crispness and varietal snap. The palate is tangy, lean and somewhat dilute, with pithy grapefruit, lime and tarragon flavors. The finish shows modest cut but regular, weakly defined flavors.",85,Echeverria 2012 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"Citric on the nose, with cherry and bland earthy notes. The palate has an inoffensive feel and sweet flavors of black cherry and vanilla. That sweetness carries onto the finish, which is also candied. Generally decent but highly regular.",84,Viña el Aromo 2007 Winemaker's Selection Pinot Noir (Bío Bío Valley)
"A great example of Lodi Zin, at a great price. Shows real complexity in the blackberry, cherry, mulberry, molasses, cocoa and cola flavors, accented with exotic dusty spices. For all the richness, it's totally dry, and the alcohol level is refreshingly low.",88,Spellbound 2005 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi)
"Once again this designate amazes with a surfeit of beautifully integrated flavors. Mushrooms and baking spices adorn an explosion of strawberry pastries. There's plenty of ripe cherry fruit also, and a long, polished, lip-licking finish.",94,Adelsheim 2013 Winderlea Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"You'll love the brightness and liveliness of this wonderfully drinkable Cabernet. Sometimes these rich wines can be heavy, but this one combines tartness with its elaborate blackberry jam, anise and cedar wood flavors, which makes it sing. Perfect now with a great steak, and should age well for up to eight years.",93,Long Meadow Ranch 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Half Malbec and half Petit Verdot, the barrel notes of vanilla and pencil lead play off cherry and purple flowers with citrusy acidity and firm, dry tannins providing the frame.",88,Bunnell 2009 Petit Bec BDX Northridge Vineyard Red (Wahluke Slope)
"Stalky, slightly green aromas blend with generic berry scents to form a marginal bouquet. This is tannic and rough on the palate, with buttery oak flavors along with candied berry fruit notes.",82,Bodegas Navarro López 2011 Rojo Granrojo Tempranillo-Garnacha (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"A 60-30-10 blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Syrah, Carato is a vibrant, cheerful wine elegant aromas that recall the small berry fruit and blue flowers usually associated with Sangiovese. The wine has a clean and balanced delivery and ends with crisp acidity.",87,Erik Banti 2004 Carato Red (Toscana)
"A light fragrant blend of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Cão, the wine is soft with plenty of strawberry fruitiness and acidity. The aftertaste has a great lift of perfumed crispness.",86,Wines & Winemakers 2016 Companhia das Lezirias Tyto Alba Rosé (Tejo)
"Fresh, apple-flavored wine, full of white fruits and a tangy, bright acidity. The wine is deliciously fresh, with stone fruit acidity on the finish.",86,Adega Cooperativa do Cartaxo 2010 Xairel Branco White (Tejo)
"This is a classy bottle of bubbly from the light copper color to the lightly fruity, yeasty aromas to the crisp mouthfeel and satisfying spice and raspberry flavors. A sense of layered richness is balanced by good acidity for balance.",91,Scharffenberger NV Brut Rosé Excellence Sparkling (Mendocino)
"From several blocks planted to a mix of clones, this wine is defined almost entirely by its earthy, stemmy core of compost and tobacco, with a slight reductive quality on the palate. Smoky, toasted oak rounds out the richness.",86,Schug 2013 Schug Estate Pinot Noir (Carneros)
The mouthfeel of this wine is full and round despite lean flavors of tart tropical fruit and melon rind. The nose offers aromas of fresh herbs and green fruit that reappear on the finish. Drink now.,87,Warwick 2010 Professor Black Sauvignon Blanc (Stellenbosch)
"Aromas of raw oak, eucalyptus and gritty berry fruits are hot and leafy. This Tempranillo-based blend feels choppy with aggressive grating tannins. Flavors of baked roasted berry fruits are also herbal, green and leafy, while this finishes crisp, raw and tomatoey in flavor.",85,Marqués de Vargas 2007 Reserva Privada  (Rioja)
The wine is earthy and somewhat rustic. There is fruit but it is spoiled by a spicy pepper edge. Chill this drastically.,82,Mémoires 2015 Rosé (Coteaux Varois en Provence)
"Pure Cabernet sourced from a trio of Walla Walla vineyards, and finished at 14.9% alcohol. Supple and spicy, this displays a firm core of tart fruit, annotated with lead pencil, graphite and charcoal. Though it seems almost deceptively light alongside the Tulpen Merlot, this compact and layered wine is built to age over a decade or more.",92,Tulpen 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"As always, the historic winery produces a nuanced, restrained style, with a subdued nose of berries and balsamic reduction. It's light and bright on the palate, with chicory and woody tones and medium-ripe cherry fruit, a perfect partner to varied foods.",90,Tablas Creek 2012 Côtes de Tablas Estate Grown & Bottled Red (Paso Robles)
"Elegantly floral and classic in dried herb, cedar, black pepper and pencil lead, this wine offers complex components of flavor and intrigue around velvety black fruit and a long, grippy finish. It impresses in its ability to be both approachable and timeless.",93,Levendi 2012 Sweetwater Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak)
"Cherry and raspberry aromas are a little scratchy, with accents of toast, leather and roasted meat. The palate, on the other hand, is more lean, driving and citric than in riper years; it's crisp and fresh, with red plum, pie cherry and toasty oak flavors. Clean, lean and ready to drink.",88,Sierra Cantabria 2007 Crianza  (Rioja)
"Tight and spicy, it carries an underlying ripeness of apples and pears. A subtle Riesling, it shows breezy freshness and an acidity-spiked texture that makes it invigorating. The slighest suggestion of pineapple lingers on the finish.",89,Fritsch 2012 Kapuzinerberg Riesling (Niederösterreich)
"Red berry, rose and clove are some of the aromas you'll find on this bright, supple red. The smooth palate offers juicy black cherry, crushed strawberry and white pepper alongside fresh acidity.

"Bright and delicious, this starts with aromas of blue flower, red berries, mint and thyme together with a whiff of leather.

"Swathes of ripe fruit over a broad layer of wood, a generous, opulent character, ripe, the spice from wood giving a good, rich final character.",89,Jean Rijckaert 2008 Cray vers Vaux  (Mâcon-Lugny)
"You have to love the '07 vintage. This is drinking beautifully right now, though official release (September) is still a ways off. Rich and delicious, full-bodied and aromatic, with exotic barrel scents and a lovely mélange of chocolate, mocha, caramel and spice. But the fruit is the main story, and it's full, ripe and substantial—cherry and cassis, licorice and just a hint of leaf.",93,Quilceda Creek 2007 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"So sweet and rich in cherry, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors, what's not to like? It's dry, gentle in tannins and complex. Seems designed for easy pairing with a great steak.",90,Madrigal 2008 Cabernet Franc (Calistoga)
"A faint hint of pink shines on this sparkler named after the winery owners' dog. Aromas of fresh melon and slight peach lead to a faint cherry note upon sipping and creamy mouthfeel, followed by plum skin tartness and a yeasty, sour bitterness.",86,Clos La Chance 2010 Amber's Cuvee Sparkling (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Earth, leather and tomato are accents to the dry, lean bouquet. The wine is expectedly juicy and tight, with snappy raspberry and cherry flavors. It shows clean lines and an unbreakable personality; elegant, juicy and firm. Drink now–2009.",87,Bodegas Faustino 2002 Faustino V Reserva  (Rioja)
"The archetypal pear flavors of Grüner Veltliner come to the fore: fresh, flavorsome and crunchy green Conference pear in this case, with zesty acidity in a linear, refreshing and zesty frame. This is concentrated and totally refreshing.",91,Jäger 2013 Selection Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"Crisp in apricot, apple and mango, this is a lovely, easy-drinking white made from a vineyard and producer well-known for Pinot Noir. Refreshing and light, yet with complexity and aromatics to spare, it offers ample body, an attractive texture and sharp acidity, finishing with a note of spicy vanilla.",90,Keller Estate 2013 La Cruz Vineyard Pinot Gris (Sonoma Coast)
"A big, earthy type of wine with a ton of ripeness and heft. Smells like pure black olive, earth and smoked meat. The palate is tight but friendly as it delivers big doses of herb, tea, chocolate and black fruit flavors. About as deep and long in the mouth as this variety gets; proof that Maipo can produce the occasional excellent Carmenère.",90,De Martino 2009 Alto de Piedras Single Vineyard Carmenère (Maipo Valley)
"Jon Martinez, who arrived in Washington barely six years ago, is knocking the ball out of the park. Improving with each new release, he has locked in a stellar collection of vineyards, and made Rhône-style wines his focus. This is a revelation. Pure berries, cassis, rock, earth, licorice, and a hint of baking spices. Gorgeous.",95,Maison Bleue 2009 Upland Vineyard Gravière G.S.M. Red (Snipes Mountain)
"A youthful and appealing wine with notes of orange peel, citrus and crushed flowers. The palate brings abundant stone fruit flavors that taper off toward the finish.",88,Henry of Pelham 2012 Icewine Riesling (Short Hills Bench)
"Lovely notions of both ripe and green pear rise from the glass. There also is a more savory edge reminiscent of moss and yeast. This comes out even more on the fresh concentrated palate with a lovely salty peppery nuance that makes this very moreish and thrilling. The flavors, amply supported by zesty citrus, just last.",93,Jäger 2015 Achleiten Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"Held back and re-released in the spring of 2014, this is smooth and still fruity, the fruit rounding into secondary flavors. Not a big wine, it smoothes out quickly and seems to have a hint of leather, with the finish tailing into a vague fade.",87,Lenné Estate 2008 Pinot Noir
"This Sangiovese-based wine is redolent of smoked bacon, sweet barbecue sauce and campfire. Yet it goes down easy and smoothly thanks to the dense fruit flavors that enliven the palate.",86,Mocali 2005 I Piaggioni Sangiovese (Toscana)
"In keeping with the winery's other red wine releases, the Cedarosa matches tart berry fruits to lush barrel flavors of butter and toast. It's approachable and somewhat monolithic.",86,Lost River 2005 Cedarosa Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Winemaker Jesse Katz combines 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Franc in this blockbuster of a deal, a flavorful, well-crafted wine that impresses in its voluptuous body and spicy seasonings. Raspberry syrup, tar and a mix of cedar and sage accent a grip of tannin that softens in the glass.",91,Aperture 2013 Red (Alexander Valley)
"With some richness, this is a drink-now rosé. The initial fresh fruit has diminished, leaving a rounded, caramel-flavored wine without acidity.",83,Barton & Guestier 2009 Rosé Red (Côtes de Provence)
"Rough around the edges, this is a dry and tannic wine. It has mint, red currant fruit and a dry center. It needs a year or two, but is likely to remain rustic.",86,Vieux Château Gaubert 2011 Benjamin de Vieux Château Gaubert  (Graves)
Richly textured wine that oozes jammy red fruits and ripe tannins. It has a good dry core followed by sweet acidity and a juicy berry character. The wine has some power and aging potential.,89,Château de la Crée 2008 Clos du Château  (Santenay)
"A solid, chunky wine whose tannins are still dominant. It has ripe black fruit flavors and a hint ofspice from wood aging. This is a wine that will develop well over the next 3–5 years.",89,Quinta de Sant'Ana 2010 Tinto Red (Lisboa)
"This wine is crisp, floral and pretty in every way. It's classically structured and graceful, with tart apple notes and stony acidity. It allows the fruit to speak softly and subtly, its lower ripeness detracting from niether flavor nor complexity.",94,Small Vines 2014 TBH Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"Ripe notes of black cherry rise from the glass. The richness of the fruit is also apparent on the fleshy palate, where cherry notes fill out into red and black juiciness, with just a touch of the variety's telltale pepper. This wine is almost bouncy and reveals its firm grip and freshness only on the finish that echoes long.",91,Umathum 2015 Blaufränkisch (Burgenland)
"Aromas of blackberry, violet and a whiff of dark spice lead the nose while the juicy palate serves up raspberry, black cherry, clove and white pepper. It's fresh and lively, with firm but approachable tannins.",89,Castelfeder 2013 Rieder Lagrein (Alto Adige)
"They say the grapes come from Lake, Napa, Sonoma, and Mendocino counties. There are some pretty good black-currant and oak aromas, but the flavors are thin and sharp. It’s well made, as you’d expect. Still, the overall impression is lean and austere.",83,Robert Mondavi 1998 Coastal Cabernet Sauvignon (North Coast)
"Woodsy spice, clove and chocolate announce the oak that is the lead factor throughout the wine. The nose is creamy and resiny green, with vanilla yogurt, plum and berry flavors coming next. Solid in terms of acidity and feel, but a little bit lactic due to the wood treatment.",86,Dolce Stefania 2005 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza)
"This is a ripe, succulent white, dark golden in color, that's lush and expansive on the palate in fleshy tropical and stone fruit. Toasted oak comes forward on the finish, accentuating the wine's nearly full-bodied nature, never getting in the way of the minerality.",91,Black Kite 2014 Gap's Crown Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"Despite its age, this has the depth, concentration and structure to continue to age well through 2022. A blend of 74% Shiraz, 18% Grenache, 6% Cinsault and 2% Tinta Barocca, there's a pure character to the wine—herbal notes of minty fynbos, bark and freshly tilled soil are supported by vibrant plum, raspberry and cherry. There's a minerally graphite seam to the full-bodied palate, ending on lush notes of black pepper, bittersweet cocoa and espresso.",94,A.A. Badenhorst Family Wines 2010 Red (Swartland)
"Brisk acidity brightens the ripe raspberry and cherry fruit, giving it a clean, lively mouthfeel. There's a jacket of tannins, but it's fine and easy, and oak brings just the right touch of sweet toast flavor. Lovely to drink now, and it should develop bottle complexities over the next 8–10 years.",93,Williams Selyem 2010 Coastlands Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This intensely sweet and delicious wine has a bright gold color, aromas of buttered popcorn and ripe pear, and flavors like peach, yellow plum and honey. The texture is luscious and thick, but a good sub-current of acidity keeps it balanced.",92,Peju Province Winery 2013 Liana Orange Muscat (North Coast)
"There's lots of youthful, jammy fruit and rich tannins in this Syrah. But then it turns hot with alcohol, and the finish is overripe and raisiny. Your best bet is to drink it soon with stews and barbecue.",85,Bianchi 2010 Syrah (Paso Robles)
"L'Erpico is a dense and meaty expression of Sangiovese from Montecucco (coastal Tuscany) that opens with ripe cherry, blackberry and meaty tones of bacon and moist earth. There's an interesting juxtaposition in the mouth of sweet versus sour fruit flavors.",88,Piandibugnano 2006 L'Erpico  (Montecucco)
"Zesty aromas of tart pineapple and tangerine, slate and chalk contrast the luscious peach and red apple fruitiness of this off-dry Riesling. It's a refreshingly crisp and thirst-quenching wine for youthful consumption.",88,Dr. Nägler 2014 Rüdesheimer Feinherb Riesling (Rheingau)
"This soft, almost tasteless wine just hints at caramel and red fruits. It lacks character.",81,Wine with Spirit 2012 Bastardô! Rosé (Lisboa)
"A rich, spicy wine, this shows flavors of new wood and ripe yellow fruit. The concentrated palate reveals juicy pear and peach juice flavors and a tight, minerally structure. Dense vineyard planting and 35-year-old vines bring out extra intensity and complexity.",92,Roche de Bellene 2010 Les Chenevottes Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet)
"The Selezione Vigna La Casa is equally sweet and ripe as the estate's base Brunello from the same vintage. What distinguishes this wine, however, is the firmness of its structure and the grainy texture of its tannins.",87,Tenuta Caparzo 2003 Vigna La Casa  (Brunello di Montalcino)
The nose is not forthcoming and the palate only hints very subtly at white pepper and green pear. There is ample freshness on the light palate and the finish is one of pure lemon zest. It is weightlesseness and poise rather than power that convinces here.,91,Schloss Gobelsburg 2014 Ried Lamm Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"Vibrant and spicy, this savory red delivers aromas and flavors of ripe blackberry, black cherry, ground pepper and chopped Mediterranean herb. Firm, fine-grained tannins support the juicy flavors. An anise note backs up the finish.",90,Argiolas 2013 Costera  (Cannonau di Sardegna)
"This is a heavy-duty Cabernet, big in every way, with rich black cherry and cassis fruit, and dense, dark tannins. The long, slightly grainy finish reinforces the impression of raw power, yet the wine retains perfect proportion and is nicely differentiated from the other 2010s crafted by winemaker Chris Figgins.",95,Doubleback 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Opens with aromas of mustard and rye seed. The palate is soft, clunky and a bit cloying, with sweet, gummy, muddled apple and candied mango flavors. Finishes confected, with a tropical leaning. Not the best style for Cava.",83,Marques de Monistrol NV Selección Especial Semi Seco Sparkling (Cava)
"This proprietary blend of Zinfandel, Syrah, Grenache, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon delivers a deep and layered nose. Wild blackberry jam, pine pitch and white sage converge, like a walk through the California chaparral. The acidity is amazingly vibrant, with flavors of bright purple fruit, pepper and crushed herbs on the finish.",94,Lorenzi Estate 2009 The Catalyst Red (Temecula Valley)
"Ripe fruit meets butter and spice in this medium-bodied, smooth and integrated wine. It opens with Bosc pear and golden apple aromas, melding with vanilla and marzipan notes, its richness of flavor nicely buoyed up by acidity.",90,Bonterra 2015 Made With Organic Grapes Chardonnay (Mendocino County)
"Lemony oak sits atop a heady bouquet supported by woody, baked-berry aromas. This is fresh and fast-moving across the palate, with rooty, toasty flavors of baked black fruits. A peppery, toasty, chocolaty finish is solid, dense and layered. Drink through 2021.",92,Bodega Catena Zapata 2011 Nicolas Catena Zapata Red (Mendoza)
"A rich, creamy, sumptuous wine, with an impressive, decisive shaft of minerality and a stony, dense character. The name of the wine, referring to the granite and schist soil, is one of an extraordinary series reflecting different soil types made by Muscadet's top producer, Guy Bossard.",92,Domaine de l'Ecu 2006 Expression de Gneiss  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"Rounded and soft, this rich rosé is fruity while also perfumed. The blending of Syrah in the mix gives the wine a sense of power and concentration, making it an adquate partner at the dinner table.",91,Domaine du Grand Cros 2014 L'Esprit de Provence Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This lively, muscular, full-bodied wine ripples with smoky, meaty, peppery aromas. A thick, almost chewy texture partners with rowdy blackberry flavors and vivid tannins that will tame the rarest steak or wildest game.",91,Saxon Brown 2010 Parmelee-Hill Vineyard Owl Ridge Block Syrah (Sonoma Coast)
"Rustic earth gives way to bright, crisp red fruit and a hit of citrus providing freshness and life. Soft and full bodied, this wine has years to go in the cellar—through 2022—to let the tannins soften and integrate further with the fruit.",92,Merryvale 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
"This wine has an almost sweet aroma of ripe plums and cherries, followed by a vivid fruity flavor that's fresh, dry and accented with black pepper and clove. Showing great balance from fine tannins and good acidity and vibrant but not heavy flavor, it will be a versatile and crowd-pleasing pour.",90,La Follette 2013 Pinot Noir (North Coast)
"A bit sweet and rugged, with jammy blackberry, currant and pepper spice flavors wrapped into firm tannins. Shows Zin's briary, brambly character.",85,Peachy Canyon 2006 BFD Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"Very concentrated notes of zesty grapefruit peel mingle with punchy, peppery watercress on a rather concentrated palate. Freshly ground pepper intriguingly pops up here and there. This is a weighty wine that definitely belongs on the table.",92,Schloss Gobelsburg 2013 Renner Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"A touch of mushroomy unripeness undermines this Pinot Noir. That is a limiting factor, but the wine does show beautiful Pinot silkiness, and good enough raspberry and cola fruit.",84,Sonoma Hills 2011 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Dark strawberry fruit meets with rustic earthy aromas and light allspice notes on the nose of this wine from the late actor's family-owned winery. The palate shows boisterous and tart cranberry and black raspberry fruit, with pencil lead minerality and great energy, if not a ton of complexity.",90,Fess Parker 2013 Older Barrels Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Tropical and a bit briney on the nose. The palate is healthy in feel, with sweet white fruit flavors, a pinch of lemon and creamy oak. Finishes quick, with a nice feel and adequate acidity; will do best if well chilled.",85,Bodega Elena de Mendoza 2010 Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"This opens with classic Sangiovese aromas of blue flower, ripe berry, tilled earth and a whiff of leather. The palate delivers black cherry, savory herb, espresso and a hint of tobacco alongside bracing tannins. Drink 2016–2021.",90,Salcheto 2011  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano
"Rubbery black-fruit aromas are a bit fiery. This Malbec is tightly wound, with rubbery tannins and more than enough acidity. Spiced plum and berry flavors give way to a bold, forward finish with herbal, savory notes.",87,Nieto Senetiner 2016 Malbec (Luján de Cuyo)
"A promising start for Empire Estate's first bottling, this perfumed dry Riesling is marked by lifted aromas of orange blossom and citrus peel. Concentrated tangerine and honey flavors have an electric vibe, balancing a nervous edge of lemon-lime acidity against a honed, steely polish.",91,Empire Estate 2014 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"While the wine has plenty of the tannins typical of 2011 at this stage, it also has ripe fruit, full of blackberry and currant flavors. The balance is already there, giving a potentially rich, juicy and generous wine. Drink from 2017.",87,Château de Bensse 2011  Médoc
"This wine made from an aromatic indigenous Turkish grape offers a pleasing aroma of honeydew melon and freesia. It is soft on entry and remains smooth on the palate, with flavors of guava, pineapple and rose petal that meld into a soft floral finish.",87,Vinkara 2015 Narince (Ankara)
"Creamy yellow plum fruit and a flinty edge lead onto a full-fruited, brightly lit palate where all the fruit is pulled into zesty orange and lemon focus. Concentration and friendliness prove great assets here.",90,Netzl 2013 Chardonnay (Carnuntum)
"This is a remarkably affordable find, so good in its red-fruited, tangy acidity and spiciness on the palate. Dried herb and pencil lie beneath bigger, bolder swathes of blackberry and cherry. This wine has a large presence but shows structure and balance.",93,Stack House 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Despite initial yeasty, bready aromas, this benchmark mass-market fino has popping acidity that adds spine and zest to an otherwise oily feeling palate. Lightly buttery white-fruit flavors are mildly salty on the finish, sort of like saltines.",89,Tio Pepe NV Fino Muy Seco Palomino (Jerez)
"This fleshy, tropical wine offers a wealth of rich peach, pineapple and golden honey flavor in a medium-bodied frame. It finishes light and bright, with an undercurrent of toasted oak.",90,Frostwatch 2014 Chardonnay (Bennett Valley)
"There's a good array of purple-flower aromas, including lavender and potpourri, on the nose of this bottling, as well as light cola and plum skins. The sip is quite bitter and tarry though, with just a touch of riper black fruit.",86,Left Bend 2014 Cabernet Franc (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"The addition of 20% Roussanne to the blend seems to thicken the palate—which is not a bad thing at all. A scent of honeysuckle piles on top of the flavors of honey, chamomile tea, lemon, orange and pink grapefruit, creating a luscious wine with impressive length.",90,Novelty Hill 2011 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Heady aromas of honeysuckle, white peach and green apple carry through to the vibrant palate along with lemon zest. It boasts crisp acidity and a lively perlage that lead to a dry refreshing close.",88,Le Contesse NV Single Frementation  (Prosecco)
"This fresh, fragrant wine is buoyed by citrus acidity and green apples. It's all fruit—light and bright—finishing with a tangy lemon-zest character. Screwcap.",85,Strauss 2012 Strauss White White (Steiermark)
"With its sugary flavors of oranges, guavas and vanilla, this will appeal to those who favor sweet white wines. Brisk, clean acidity fortunately provides balance.",84,Bianchi 2011 Signature Selection Los Alamos Vineyard Pinot Grigio (Santa Barbara County)
"This comes down on the sweet side, with orange, apricot and peach jam flavors. But the acidity is bright and clean. If you don't like sweet California wines, this isn't for you.",86,Handley 2010 Pinot Gris (Anderson Valley)
"Wood aging does not help the richness of this wine. It brings out toast and covers the glorious sweet fruits. With acidity thrown in the balance is not there. Maybe several years will help, so don't drink before 2017.",89,Domaine Pichot 2009 Les Larmes de Bacchus  (Vouvray)
"This opens with aromas of prune, perfumed berry, baking spice, leather, a whiff of coconut and a balsamic note. The fresh palate offers wild cherry, crushed raspberry, lightly toasted oak, anise and espresso. It's still tightly tannic and astringent, but it should improve with a few more years in the bottle. Drink 2018–2028.",89,Cascina Luisin 2012 Rabajà  (Barbaresco)
"This wine presents itself initially as having a bold, big body, yet is actually light on its feet as it opens, revealing aromas of cherry liqueur, rhubarb joined with a funk of black licorice and sassafras.",88,Moshin 2012 Calliope Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Aromas of orange peel, flowers, blue fruit and smoked meat are followed by light, spritely fruit flavors. The tannins bring some grip.",89,Apex 2013 The Catalyst Red (Washington)
"This is a blush wine made primarily from the Spanish variety, Tempranillo. It's fairly dark for a rosé and quite full-bodied in cherry jam, pepper and vanilla flavors, while a splash of Albariño adds needed acidity and the bright taste of citrus.",86,Stevenot 2007 Rosado Rosé (Sierra Foothills)
"Lovely aromas of Spanish Broom, white cherry, peach and light spice emerge on this radiant, elegant wine. The crisp palate offers Kaiser pear, apple, nectarine zest, white pepper and a hint of ginger. Vibrant acidity carries the flavors while a pronounced mineral note energizes the finish.",90,Raccaro 2014 Malvasia (Collio)
"Earthy, beefy, almost metallic aromas, then beefy, tamarind-like flavors make an exotic but rustic profile for this fascinating medium-bodied wine. The texture is rather lean and a tasty sour-cherry character develops on the finish.",89,McCay Cellars 2013 Bechthold Vineyard Cinsault (Lodi)
"A fresh delicate style, the sweetness fleeting over the fruit, giving an orange marmalade character, but retaining lightness, lifted by a final acidity.",89,Schloss Gobelsburg 2007 Auslese Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"Sweet and oaky, with butterscotch, vanilla cream, pineapple crème brûlée and cinnamon spice flavors.",84,Clos La Chance 2007 Biagini Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Baked red plum, black cherry, sagebrush, graphite and budding hibiscus aromas show on the rich and minerally nose of this bottling. The palate is very inviting and lavish, with pungent dark red fruits of cherry and black plum enhanced by allspice, ginger and black pepper.",92,Talbott 2013 Diamond T Vineyard Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Monterey)
"From an emerging Mendocino appellation, an engaging, dry wine. Its mouth-cleansing acidity is fresh and clean, highlighting pretty flavors of lime and honeydew, and leads to a tart finish.",87,Lolonis 2001 Fumé Blanc (Redwood Valley)
"This wine is a unique blend of Malbec (60%), Syrah (20%), Merlot (15%) and Petit Verdot. It opens with brooding but alluring aromas of dark plum, asphalt, and a kiss of baking spice. The flavors are full bodied and palate coating, showing weight but also a sense of suppleness that charms the senses.",91,Reininger 2012 Mr. Owl's Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Named for the vineyard's address on Live Oak Road, this tasty blend holds 39% Syrah, 28% Grenache, 19% Counoise and 14% Mourvèdre. It delivers aromas of scarlet red rose petals, crushed clove and cherry pie. The fruit flavors are so deep they border on blueberry, set against a tannic backbone, yet proving quite light and drinkable.",91,Derby 2010 Fifteen 10 Red (Paso Robles)
"91-93. Barrel sample. Initially this is just a seductive effort; but then its intensity and structure emerge, creating a wine of great complexity. Its botrytis character adds considerable weight.",92,Château Suau 2011 Barrel Sample  (Barsac)
"There is certainly some of the Dão minerality in the texture of this wine. It's main thrust is berry fruit, which is filled out with some attractive tannins, spice from wood and final acidity.",89,Dão Sul 2008 Casa de Santar Red (Dão)
"From vineyards owned by the producer just across the river from its home base in Sancerre, this wine has the rich intensity that is proper to a Pouilly Fumé. It has bold ripe fruits and a toasty edge along with a strong minerality from the flinty soil. Drink this wine from 2018.",91,Henri Bourgeois 2014 La Demoiselle des Bourgeois  (Pouilly-Fumé)
"This outstanding Walla Walla boutique has established a track record for consistent improvement, and the white wines are best of show. Once again this 2006 blend is smooth, round and richly endowed with mixed stone fruits. Lovely aromas build a dense cloud of complex fruit, toast and caramel scents around the glass; once in the mouth the full-bodied fruit takes hold with lychee, peach and stone fruits. Immaculate and persistent, this stunning wine just keeps on coming.",92,Buty 2006 Sémillon-Sauvignon Blanc White (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The hot climate of the Cold Creek Vineyard sharpens up the contours of this Chardonnay, which shows more of a classic Washington character. Bright fruit, a mix of apples and peaches and pears, is shot through with streaks of butterscotch from fermentation in new French oak. It's been through 100% malolactic, yet retains some crispness. Polished and full-bodied.",89,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2005 Cold Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Smells and tastes a bit weedy or stalky, with slightly green blackberry and cherry flavors. The absence of fruit accentuates the tannins, making them feel harder than they really are. Drink now.",86,Robert Mondavi 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Substantial and muscular, still quite tight and unyielding, this grudgingly displays purple fruits in a mix of roasted coffee beans, clove and black olive. If past releases are any indication, this will continue to evolve and expand as it gets a bit more bottle time.",90,Dusted Valley 2009 Stained Tooth Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"There is a high-toned aspect to the otherwise neutral nose that just gives away lemony hints. The palate is sprightly and fresh and reveals a very creamy, fruity, almost tropical core which is cut very pleasantly by fresh, aromatic lemon—this is Chardonnay but not as you know it. A very fruity, rich but fresh number.",89,Hannes Reeh 2014 Rohstoff Chardonnay (Burgenland)
"It's bit harsh in texture and is minty, with wintergreen and pepper flavors that nudge into cherries and mocha. Good for barbecue and cheese plates.",84,Amador Foothill Winery 2006 Esola Vineyad Zinfandel (Shenandoah Valley (CA))
"Produced from Gamay in a small enclave of vines south of Sancerre, this is a cherry-blossom-perfumed wine, bright and crisp with red-cherry flavors. It is ready now.",86,Henri Bourgeois 2016 Les Amphores Rosé (Châteaumeillant)
"Dusted Valley is really rockin' it in 2010, with outstanding varietal releases of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and this yummy Malbec. A big entry brings blackberry and cassis into the palate, with peppery highlights. Nice details of herb and tobacco are found, as the wine seems to get more powerful the longer it lingers in the mouth.",92,Dusted Valley 2010 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This wine has flavors of wild blackberry, blueberry and mocha, with a rich vein of herb, tobacco and spice. However, it's hot in alcohol, and finishes with glyceriney sweetness—almost like a minor Port. Drink up.",86,Kuleto Estate 2009 Zinfandel (Napa Valley)
"Grapy and perfumed on the nose, this quaffable Garnacha is sound and fresh, albeit a bit acidic. Black-fruit flavors are common and show notes of earth and chocolate, while a grabby finish displays no glaring faults.",85,Beso de Vino 2014 Old Vine Garnacha (Cariñena)
"This wine is massively fruity and grandly structured without being heavy or overpowering, but it will need time for the firm tannins to mellow. It smells and tastes like pure, concentrated black cherry and feels full of fine-grained tannins and sour-cherry crispness. It will be best after 2020.",93,Spell 2013 Alder Springs Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino County)
"Funky and intriguing on the nose, this proffers scents of narcissus and farmyard, with touches of char and dark fruit. Medium bodied, this has an open texture, with integrated acids and malleable tannins. Flavors of tart blackberry candy, leather and Dr. Pepper surface on the palate.",85,Veramar 2008 Estate Bottled Norton (Shenandoah Valley)
"This wine is soft, simple, fruity and ready to drink. It has apple and apricot tones and light acidity to keep it fresh, with a bright and refreshing aftertaste.",85,Louis Chevallier 2014  Mâcon-Villages
"Instead of brawn and muscle, this ruby Ripasso offers elegance and finesse. The nose is redolent of polished black stone, Indian spice and loads of dried cassis and wild berry. There's a playful hint of sweet almond and cinnamon at the end.",88,Gamba 2007 Le Quare  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
"Leather, underbrush, moist soil and dark spice aromas carry over to the elegant palate along with dried plum, mature blackberry and licorice. Firm, velvety tannins and fresh acidity provide structure and a polished texture. Drink through 2023.",93,Basilisco 2013 Fontanelle  (Aglianico del Vulture)
"Plum, black cherry and anise lead the nose of this rich red. Flavor of vanilla, mint and cherry give it a somewhat medicinal; edge but the wine is overall balanced and offers an exotic edge.",87,Tsililis 2012 Theopetra Estate Red
"Here's a Rosso with aromas of blue flower, ripe berry and whiffs of balsamic herbs. The palate offers bright but rich cherry- raspberry flavors with hints of spice and licorice. Pair this with hearty pastas and Tuscan soups.",86,Renieri 2011  Rosso di Montalcino
"The wine starts lively, almost fresh. Only after a while in the mouth do you taste the intense richness underneath. The structure is of pear skins, with white fig and sweet dried apricot syrup. The botrytis, dry at the heart of the wine, gives the whole ensemble great balance.",92,Château Lafaurie-Peyraguey 2006  Sauternes
"A rich hint of apple crumble precedes tart notes of lemon freshness. The palate fizzes with frothy bubbles and gives the impression of lightness and ease. A very clean-cut, sprightly and refreshing finish almost hides the more serious autolytic backdrop of this elegant, fine-fruited Crémant.",89,Boeckel 2014 Blanc de Blancs Brut Auxerrois (Alsace)
"Yet another fruit-powered, lip-smacking Riesling from Trisaetum, this brings a basket of yellow apples, tart limes, pears and a slice of pink grapefruit into perfect harmony. Leesy, textural, long and utterly refreshing, it finishes with a nice kick of bracing acidity.",92,Trisaetum 2012 Coast Range Estate Dry Riesling
"Aromas of snap peas and freshly cut grass lead to tangy lemon and grapefruit flavors in this medium-bodied, crisply balanced wine. It's certainly lively and will cut through the thickest fettuccine Alfredo.",87,Geyser Peak 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (California)
"There is something floral and tender, even creamy on the nose. The palate on the one side has a creamy apricot and peach aspect, on the other a totally taut and brisk lemon-lime streak. This makes for tension and interest. This is concentrated and exciting, dry and very, very enjoyable. Drink now through 2025.",93,Domaine Jean Sipp 2013 Kirchberg de Ribeauvillé Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"Fairly full-bodied and lush, with berry fruit flavors balanced by darker notes of chocolate and coffee. The tannins are soft, making this wine immediately accessible.",87,Kangarilla Road 2008 Black St. Peters Zinfandel (McLaren Vale)
"Ultradry and tart in acidity, this is not a Chardonnay for those looking for richness. With citrus and mineral flavors, it's suggestive of a young, minor Chablis. Clean and vibrant. Drink now.",87,Trione 2007 River Road Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Made entirely from Chardonnay, this opens with yellow apple, Williams pear and white peach aromas that follow through to the palate. It's elegant and steeped in vanilla and hazelnut flavors, with fresh acidity that lifts its creamy texture.",90,Marchesi de' Frescobaldi 2015 Bianco Benefizio Riserva Chardonnay (Pomino)
"Tastes like a Chardonnay, with tropical fruit, peach and green apple flavors wrapped into buttercream and vanilla. Ripe and sweet, but balanced by crisp acidity. A nice, rich white wine for drinking now.",86,Valley of the Moon 2010 Pinot Blanc (Sonoma County)
"Red currant and fresh strawberry make for an enticing, inviting nose and carry on to the frothy, dry, slender palate. This is an easy, refreshing but wonderfully clean and fruity pink fizz.",89,Willm NV Rosé Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"With sugary blackberry and prune flavors, this tannic Zinfandel is pretty simple. It will pair well with burgers, tacos and barbecue.",82,Masterpiece 2012 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"Underbrush, menthol, dark berry and allspice aromas take shape in the glass. The simple palate, which has a slightly fizzy character, offers fleshy black cherry, overripe plum and soft acidity alongside buffed tannins.",85,Cantine Bellini 2011 Riserva  (Chianti)
"Martha Clara's Riesling is dry in style yet soft on the palate with sweet tones of honeyed apples and white peach. Fresh and juicy with a mouthwatering acidity, it finishes on a puckery lemonade note.",86,Martha Clara 2009 Riesling (North Fork of Long Island)
"This Brunello opens with a sweet nose of vanilla and cherry. The bouquet is straightforward, giving the wine a frank, no-nonsense personality. Flavors of spice, leather and tobacco appear later, rendering more depth. It feels youthful, soft and chewy on the close.",90,Villa I Cipressi 2007  Brunello di Montalcino
"Made from 100% Chardonnay, this shows lemon, apple and nectarine on the nose with hints of croisant. Spritely bubbles quickly fade, leaving honeydew, green apple, nectarine and a hint of pastry. The finish is fresh with lemon juice and tart apple.",87,Gruet 2011 Sauvage Sparkling (America)
"Better known for its table wines, Quinta do Crasto still retains an important Port program. This big, dry and smoky effort fully justifies that. It is firmly structured and tannic, with a strong black-pepper character that is balanced by the solid structure and concentration.  Age over many years.",91,Quinta do Crasto 2010 Vintage  (Port)
"Almost half of this wine's production of 1,800 cases came to the U.S., which should make this broad, mouthfilling white relatively easy to find. The largely neutral palate suggests pineapple, honey and cinnamon, with citrus and spice lingering on the finish. Drink now.",89,Alain Jaume et Fils 2006 Domaine Grand Veneur La Fontaine White (Châteauneuf-du-Pape)
"The aromas seem a bit disjointed on first pour, with notes of custard, citrus, mineral and spice. The palate is medium bodied, bringing some interest but not entirely pulling it all together.",87,Lauren Ashton Cellars 2015 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Aged only in stainless steel, this youthful Barbera d'Asti shows cheerful aromas of ripe fruit and sweet berries. The wine does a very nice job of balancing its naturally fresh acidity with the bright, pristine nature of its fruit.",86,CarlindePaolo 2009 Cursus Vitae  (Barbera d'Asti)
"A savory blend of 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc, this opens with aromas of scorched earth, meat juices, leather, black fruit and spices. The dense, low-acid palate delivers black currants and fleshy black cherry accented with black pepper and mocha alongside soft, round tannins. Drink now through 2017.",90,Tenuta Argentiera 2010 Argentiera  (Bolgheri Superiore)
"The acidity and fruit are the stars of this well-made Riesling. The wine is rich in citrus, honeysuckle, apricot and honey flavors that finish dry and clean.",87,Wente 2012 Riverbank Riesling (Arroyo Seco)
"This Cabernet from one of Spain's best-known producers is mature and structured. An attractive, complex nose offers berry, tobacco and leather aromas, while the wine is darkly fruited and a touch brown at the edge. Finishes long and dry, with some drying tannins. Drink now through 2006. Despite the tannins, sooner is preferable, as the fruit seems fully mature. —M.M.",87,Torres 1997 Gran Coronas Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Penedès)
"Delicious aromas of dark raspberries, Bing cherries, black pepper, pipe smoke, smoked meats, thyme and just enough dank mushroom greet the nose. This wine is very full on the ripe and juicy palate, showing more raspberry, rhubarb, dried strawberry and warm black licorice, all balanced by plum-skin bitterness and just enough tannic structure.",94,Boekenoogen 2012 Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"This blend of native grapes boasts an aromatic nose of fragrant white flower and yellow stone fruit. The crisp palate offers apricot, lemon zest and hint of nut alongside bright acidity.",87,Cantine Europa 2015 Eughenes Grillo-Zibibbo White (Terre Siciliane)
"This Petite Sirah is soft and very dry, a wine to drink now and for the next few years. With its easy tannins, it shows baked fruit tart flavors of blackberries and currants, with an edge of crushed peppercorn.",87,Everett Ridge 2006 Estate Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley)
"This producer, based in the western Loire, has been able to take advantage of the cool ocean climate to produce a crisp, fruity Chardonnay. It is all fruit, citrus and white-plum flavored, with a soft, fresh aftertaste. Drink now.",86,Vignoble Malidain 2015 Le Demi-Boeuf Chardonnay (Val de Loire)
"This wine has that warm, spicy, friendly feel of new oak that is well integrated with the fruit flavors, and a velvety texture to match. It smells like toasted baguette, nutmeg and vanilla and tastes almost as rich as blackberry jam, but stays dry and full-bodied. It's so easy to enjoy.",91,Fiddletown Cellars 2013 Reserve Barbera (Amador County)
"Sparkling Vouvray, full of rich fruit, with layers of almonds, toasted bread and intense acidity. It is a tangy wine, with an apple skin texture over a light creamy mousse.",89,Domaine Vincent Carême 2008 Cuvée T Brut  (Vouvray)
"This light-bodied wine has aromas like strawberries and maple syrup, and flavors that taste almost sweet. It makes a tempting, light and airy drink that's good for casual occasions.",84,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi 2013 Zinfandel (California)
"Marion produces some of the best Amarone available today, but this expression from the 2007 shows a touch of green fruit on the nose. Notes of dried sage and olive segue to a sweeter, plusher sensation in the mouth. In fact, the finish is extremely chewy and long.",88,Marion 2007  Amarone della Valpolicella
"Stalky, gritty, earthy plum aromas are minimally ripe. This feels firm, grabby, chunky and rough all in one. Gritty, unusually-bready berry flavors finish herbal and dry.",85,Bodegas Paniza 2012 Viñas Viejas de Paniza Garnacha (Cariñena)
"Exotic fruit and herbaceous aromas lift out of the glass. On the bright, simple palate, zesty acidity underscores juicy pineapple and grapefruit notes.",85,Andrero 2016 Grillo (Terre Siciliane)

"This opens with funky aromas of game, cured meat and wet animal fur. Rustic and lean, the astringent palate offers a suggestion of powdered sage and a balsamic note but lacks fruit.",83,Tenuta L'Illuminata 2012 Tebavio  (Barolo)
"Ripe plum and berry aromas with a note of vanilla are highly encouraging. Hailing from a warm vintage, this 10-year-old Bierzo beauty offers a blend of pulpy ripeness with bracing acidity. Loamy plum, oak and vanilla flavors end with length and elegance. Drink through 2020.",93,Estefania 2006 Tilenus Pagos de Posada Mencía (Bierzo)
"The assertive barrel flavors are still being integrated into the wine, but there is so much else to taste that it seems certain to knit itself together in the near term. Pretty blueberry and ripe cherry flavors are set in firm, toasty tannins.",91,Kontos 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Plump but sour cranberry fruit aromas meet with sweet sandalwood, clove and forest floor on the nose of this San Francisco-made bottling from the historic property. Sanguine touches on the palate lead to raspberry, cherry, cinnamon and juniper flavors, ending in a menthol finish.",93,Sandler 2015 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"With partial aging in wood, this is a spicy, smoky wine that is also full of ripe red fruits. Its well-integrated tannins give shape to this wine. A crisp finish and the wine is ready to drink.",86,Casa Santos Lima 2014 Credencial Red (Lisboa)
"This tasty, well-built wine is light in color, moderate in fruit flavor and has interesting spicy accents. The mouthfeel is broad and generous but also nicely supported by a light lacing of tannin.",89,Lava Cap 2014 Estate Bottled Grenache (El Dorado)
"Savory whiffs of pressed apple and pear open to brighter, juicier flavors of yellow peach, watermelon and berry in this unusually rose-tinted Viognier. It's quite fruity on the palate with sunny acidity and a brisk citrusy finish.",87,Sannino 2016 Viognier (North Fork of Long Island)
"Portugal's popular brand is a lively, fresh, spice- and dried fruit-flavored wine. There are flavors of pound cake and nutmeg surrounding a core of solid, firm tannins. Great with food, this is not for aging.",87,J. Portugal Ramos 2007 Marquês de Borba Red (Alentejo)
"In Cahors Tradition means a wine that doesn't go into barrels for aging. That keeps the fruit vibrant and crisp, as it is here. The wine is ripe, full in the mouth with fruit tannins and black-currant acidity. It is a year away from maturity, so drink from 2017.",88,Château Eugénie 2014 Tradition Malbec-Merlot (Cahors)
"A wine that starts out all tannins. The fruit takes a while to show through and then produces juicy red cherry flavors and considerable acidity, the wood aging rounding the corners. This is for medium-term aging.",89,Rozes 2008 Quinta do Grifo Grande Reserva Red (Douro)
"A ripe and structured wine, this has bold black fruits and balanced tannins that still need to soften. It has good potential with rich fruits and a tight mineral texture. Drink from 2018.",90,Sobredos 2012 Aneto Tinto Red (Douro)
"Full-bodied, tannic, juicy-fruity and dry, this red blend has flavors of blackberries, plums, dark chocolate and anise, with spicy, earthy notes of tobacco. Made from Primitivo, Zinfandel and Teroldego.",86,Viansa 2006 Prindelo Red (Sonoma County)
"Fresh tangerine skins scent this zesty dry Riesling. Restrained on the palate with flavors of pressed apple and pear, it's not a deeply concentrated wine but refreshing and brisk.",86,Fulkerson 2012 Reserve Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Heady with aromas of rose petals, this wine has a thin, light-bodied texture and tastes of black licorice and black cherry. With a surprising ripeness of fruit, it ends without tension or nuance.",88,Sonoma Collection 2013 District 3 Growers Reserve Pinot Noir (Sonoma County)
"Very dry, very tannic and austere, this southern Rhône-style blend isn't offering much now beyond the astringency. Airing coaxes out some modest cherry, Dr. Pepper cola and leather flavors, but it will always remain a tough, harsh wine.",84,Sunstone 2006 Rapsodie Du Soleil Red (Santa Barbara County)
"Rich, dry and pretty full-bodied for a Pinot Noir, this is stuffed with flavors of cherry pie and cola, made brisk by acidity. A little heavy, but sound and complex.",88,Babcock 2010 Microcosm Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Light, fruity, packed with strawberries, this is an attractive Pinot Noir. The only spoiler is the over-excited use of wood which is masking the fruit and will always be an important factor.",86,René Muré 2011 Clos Saint Landelain Pinot Noir (Alsace)
"There is plenty of wood here, quite a dominant feature. The fruit comes behind, showing bright ripe white fruits and a hint of apricot. The wood spice, though, has the last word.",88,Morey-Blanc 2007  Auxey-Duresses
"Full-bodied and refined, this opens with aromas of mature, spiced plum, violet, tilled soil and truffle. The firm palate offers up crushed black cherry, raspberry, ground black pepper and anise alongside a backbone of fresh acidity and firm tannins. A note of Mediterranean herb signals the close. It already has nice depth but hold for more complexity. Drink 2017–2025.",93,Fattoria di Corsignano 2010 L'Imperatrice Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico)
"The blend is 50-50 Viognier and Roussanne, sourced from Gamache Vineyards. Scents and flavors suggest orange candy, with a slightly grainy, baby aspirin quality. Lemony and forward; a good quaffer.",87,Market Vineyards 2010 Liquidity White White (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A rush of zippy, fresh fruit and spice aromas recommends this white from New York, offering the kind of clean fruit flavors and minerality that makes this region unique. The wine lacks real complexity and tends toward the austere but the beguiling spice saves the day.",84,Heron Hill 2004 Ingle Vineyard Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"The Grisant Pinot Gris is more full and fleshy than the winery's LEHM bottling, but still a bit one dimensional. Pleasant flavors of pear fruit, skin phenolics and light suggestions of cinnamon.",86,Vin du Lac 2008 Grisant! Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This wine shows finesse, driven by its seamless mix of citrus, melon, peach and pear fruits. Immediately delicious, it actually improves by the second day, showing its perfect acid-to-fruit balance. Give it a light chill—not too much—and it's a perfect autumnal sipper.",91,Owen Roe 2014 Crawford-Beck Vineyard Pinot Gris (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Sunny berry aromas give way to focused black cherry and dark-chocolate flavors that ride a richly tannic texture in this full-bodied wine. Made from a blend based on Zinfandel and Carignane grapes, it delivers ample complexity and depth.",91,Trinitas 2014 Mysteriama Red (California)
"Peach and pear fruit come together in this simple, fruity, but satisfying Chardonnay from Western Australia. It's moderately rich and full in body, but nicely silky in texture.",88,Mad Fish 2015 Chardonnay (Western Australia)
Some wood aging gives the fruitiness of the wine an added spice. Tannins support the bitter cherry flavors and add firmness to the juicy acidity. Drink from the end of 2015.,86,Domaine du Haut-Poncié 2013 Roche Grès  (Moulin-à-Vent)
"Soft and middle-aged, it offers a serious bite on the finish that veers slightly into sour cherry and mushroom territory, the end result a bit dull.",84,Hansen/Grunner 2009 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County)
"Here's a thin, almost transparent Grillo with forward tones of almond skin and mature pear. It has a clean, zesty delivery on the palate and ends with spicy, fresh accents.",84,Principi di Spadafora 2007 Schietto Grillo (Sicilia)
"Although Cullen's latest red wines haven't always impressed, the quality of the Chardonnay seems to go from great to even greater. This is plump enough to be appealing now, yet with a strong frame of acidity to hold it together for the next 10 or more years. Toasted nuts and fresh pineapple aromas and flavors are exotic upfront, while the lemony finish is long and mouthwatering.",94,Cullen 2012 Kevin John Chardonnay (Margaret River)
"Jammy blueberry aromas come with overt oakiness. This feels dense but on the flat side. Baked berry flavors and herbal plum notes sprinkle in a mild sweet and green accent, while this feels full and a bit syrupy on the finish.",86,Don Miguel Gascón 2015 Malbec (Mendoza)
"A ripe yeasty wine in a variation of a classic Provencal skittle bottle, with red fruits and a nutty character. It is fat, full with plenty of citrus fruitiness. With a crisp aftertaste, it is bright at the end.",86,Château Sainte Roseline 2016 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Sweet and fragrant, floral and fruity, this Prosecco Extra Dry (with 10% Pinot Bianco) has a feminine, creamy disposition and excellent harmony of aromas and effervescence. It's very filling in the mouth with generous accents of stone fruit and honey; “47” marks the year the winery was founded.",88,Bortolotti NV Extra Dry 47  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
"A rich, round and silky texture provide pure pleasure in this exotically perfumed vineyard-designate that's full bodied and exuberant in baked plum, black pepper and anise. Well integrated and complex, it traffics in deeper, darker plumes of smoke and tobacco toward the lengthy finish.",93,Trinchero 2012 Haystack Vineyard Malbec (Atlas Peak)
"Good price for a sophisticated Cab you can substitute for more expensive bottlings without apologizing. The wine is rich in black currants, blackberry jam and spicy oak, accented by savory herbs and spices.",87,Christine Andrew 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi)
"Aromas of white peach and honeysuckle yield to flavors of grapefruit, peach, jasmine and orange blossom. This wine is smooth in the mouth and the zesty finish is characterized by lingering floral flavors.",88,Ouled Thaleb 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Zenata)
"Hay, tomato leaf and stone fruit aromas waft out of the glass. The elegant palate is a bit more reserved than the nose, offering yellow peach and chopped herb. Crisp acidity brightens the flavors while a graphite note closes the finish.",90,Mario Schiopetto 2013 Sauvignon (Collio)
"Pisca vineyard is a recent purchase by Niepoort, although the company has bought fruit there for many years. This is a first as a single quinta wine, softer than the Niepoort vintage, immediately attractive, finely balanced. It has structure and sweet fruit.",92,Niepoort 2007 Pisca Vintage  (Port)
"Black cherry fruit gets serious with elements of slate, eucalyptus, tar and wild mint on this wine from the Corralitos area at the southern coastal edge of the appellation. It's soft at first on the palate, then reveals a wash of acidity, with sour cherry fruit and black tea tannins.",90,Big Basin 2012 Alfaro Family Vineyards Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Dark in color, deep in aroma, quietly intense in flavor and so mouthcoating in texture—this Cabernet demands to be noticed. Yet all of those bold elements are wrapped in a tightly woven and softly finished texture. The flavors are like dark chocolate and ripe blackberries, the mouthfeel is fine and it's not overly tannic or too full-bodied.",90,Carnivor 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Bricco Barone is a smokey, meaty expression of Nebbiolo with bold aromas of black fruit, prune, dried tobacco leaf and finely milled white pepper. This pretty wine ends with a masculine blast of earthy, dusty tones.",89,Marziano Abbona 2008 Bricco Barone  (Nebbiolo d'Alba)
"Given time to settle in both used French oak and stainless steel, this is a nice effort from a well-respected vineyard that's big and juicy in grapefruit and melon. Made in a lighter style, it offers a bite of oak on the finish, leaving a substantial impression.",87,Apsara 2015 Kick Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County)
"This is a deliciously ripe, full-bodied wine with all the red berry fruits, orange zest and acidity that you could want. It's finely made with a creamy mousse and a fresh and fruity aftertaste.",90,Willm NV Blanc de Noirs Brut Pinot Noir (Crémant d'Alsace)
"94–96. Barrel sample. This is a beautifully crafted wine with red fruits, a touch of black currant, great acidity and dense structure. A blend of half-and-half Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, it shows both weight and a great lift.",95,Château Palmer 2012 Barrel Sample  (Margaux)
"The perfumes are slightly unbalanced, tasting confected. The fruit seems to be missing.",82,Domaine Bott-Geyl 2010 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"This outstanding effort offers a vanilla wrap around solid fruit flavors of white peach, yellow plum and nectarine. The texture and detail are delightful, as the wine generously fills in the finish with a hint of marzipan.",92,Ponzi 2014 Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley)
"This is a successful Pinot Noir in terms of its lighter style, silkiness and generosity, showing real finesse and delicacy. It's a tartly acidic wine with delicious flavors of cola and sour cherry candy. Try pairing it with mushroom risotto speckled with crumbled bacon.",88,Wine Spots 2010 Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"A good, solid California Chardonnay at a fair price. It's creamy and crisp, with palate-satisfying flavors of pineapples, pears and green apples.",84,Greg Norman California Estates 2007 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County)
"Excessive tartness is the chief fault of this wine. The tannins are faultlessly beautiful, and the flavors, of crushed summer blackberries, teriaki beef, green tea and black pepper, are complex. But that cut of acidity is severe.",85,Rancho Sisquoc 2011 Flood Family Vineyards Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"Full in the mouth, this ripe, spicy wine offers a fruit salad of flavors that are topped with some wood-aging flavors. Drink from 2016 for the wood to be fully integrated into the fruit. After the Jonck family's 350 years in South Africa's Western Cape, vineyard owner Johan Jonck and family decamped to Bordeaux in 2011. Consulting enologist is Eric Bardon.",90,Château Espérance 2014 Instinct  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"This stylish wine is tight, crisp and with fine intense acidity. Its apple fruitiness is bright, delicious and refreshing. With its lively aftertaste, this is ready to drink now.",87,Château Gaudrelle NV Vigneau Brut  (Vouvray)
"Starts with some odd aromas of burnt rubber, charred plum and scorched marshmallow, then delivers slightly sweet, caramelly flavors. It's thick and viscous in texture yet without much in the way of tannin.",81,Patritti 2007 Shiraz (South Australia)
"A bright, fruity style that shows red berry fruits along with attractive perfumed tannins. This is already an approachable wine, just structured enough to give the juicy fruit a backbone.",88,Domaine de la Noblaie 2010 Les Chiens-Chiens  (Chinon)
"At 70% Garnacha and 30% Tempranillo, this hold-over from the sketchy 2002 harvest starts with an odd blend of clove and shaved wood notes, while the palate pushes basic cherry and tangy raspberry flavors.",83,Valle Rojo 2002 Crianza Grenache-Tempranillo Red (Cariñena)
"Poised and poetic, this wine starts with a lovely floral nose of violet and unfolds in the mouth with smooth but structured elegance. Overall spiced wood and pepper flavors are meaty but soft.",88,The Williamsburg Winery 2005 Gabriel Archer Reserve Red (Virginia)
"Darkly tannic, this wine has a dense structure that needs time. It is firm, dry and concentrated. The fruit potential is still developing so keep this wine until 2017. Enologist Sebastien and vineyard manager Nicolas are the latest generation managing the Carreau family estates.",86,Château Clairac 2012 Grande Réserve  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"This is a Tuscan blend with character. The nose is full of cinnamon, mint, cloves and spice, while on the palate, an enticing blend of cherry, raspberry, mocha, mint and spice makes it a great solo sip. A solid wine with an overall likeable personality.",85,Chaddsford 2006 25th Vintage Rubino Super-Tuscan Style Blend Red (Pennsylvania)
"Leathery and earthy, with hints of cranberries and chocolate. It's medium bodied and supple enough to drink now, turning a bit tart on the finish.",84,Lucas Carton 2005 Red (Côtes du Rhône)
"Spiced meats, cherry and pepper give this plucky red a food-friendly edge. On the palate, it's spicy and slightly tart, with cranberry, blueberry and crushed herbs. Earthy and dry, the wine will pair well with spiced meat and pastas.",83,Vivác Winery 2006 Divino Red (New Mexico)
"Lemony and sort of chemical smelling, with green herbs, graphite and berry aromas. Feels compact, without much layering or body. Tastes herbal, with red currant and berry fruit in the background. Minty and resiny on the finish.",83,Ventisquero 2010 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"Mild apple, pear and almond aromas give way to a plump but bland palate. Melon and papaya flavors are fair, while the finish is clean but light. This Verdejo-SB blend is a straightforward quaffer.",85,Yuntero 2013 Mundo de Yuntero Bio Verdejo-Sauvignon Blanc White (La Mancha)
"Rose petal perfume accents sweet peach and apricots in this luscious, varietally classic Gewürztraminer. It's rich and round on the palate, plump with stone fruit and lychee flavors and finishes elegantly on an astringent black-tea note. Off dry in style, it's balanced and composed in alcohol and acidity.",89,Keuka Spring 2014 Gewurztraminer (Finger Lakes)
"As its name suggests this is a selection of barrels of Syrah and Touriga Nacional. It is rich, smooth and full of ripe fruit. The dusty tannins are in suspension, backing up the black plum and blueberry fruit flavors. Along with the juicy acidity, this is a wine to age. Drink from 2017.",92,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2013 Lagoalva Barrel Selection Tinto Red (Tejo)
"This full-bodied red opens with aromas of mature plum, hay, underbrush and scorched earth. The ripe, juicy palate doles out layers of black cherry, strawberry, tobacco and cinnamon alongside chewy tannins. It's already enjoyable but will also age well for several years. Enjoy through 2019.",90,Lunadoro 2011 Tradizionale  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano)
"Crafted from 12 different clones planted throughout the estate vineyard, farmed to perfection, this is a delicious and exuberant expression of blueberry crumble that's succulent and inviting in every way. Full bodied, it retains enough acidity to remain mouthwatering and yet complex, a subtlety of white pepper and cardamom biting at the its heels. Drink now through 2024.",95,Wayfarer 2014 Wayfarer Vineyard Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview)
"Hot saucy plum and berry aromas set up an abrasive tannic palate that's choppy and short. Dark plum and berry aromas finish with jagged, hard tannins and bright acidity.",86,Lidio Carraro 2014 Agnus Tannat (Serra Gaúcha)
"One of the winery's upper-end bottlings, this shows strawberries, dried fennel stalks and an earthy minerality on the nose. The flavors prove a bit cooked, with stewed berries, char, dark tobacco, dark chocolate and black pepper.",88,Peachy Canyon 2012 Vortex Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"McCay's Westside Zin, Trulux, opens with a strong bouquet of red and black fruit along with a suggestion of anise. Inviting, it's structured and smooth in tannins, with a bite of oak on the finish. Earthy and with great acidity throughout, it makes for a great food wine.",90,McCay Cellars 2010 Trulux Zinfandel (Lodi)
"Structured, complex wine that is only just beginning to hint at considerable depth of powerful, rich flavors. The structure is dry, a little lean, but with dense tannins. The fruit, rich plums and stone fruits is just coming through. Age for 10 years.",91,Fonseca 2005 Quinta do Panascal  (Port)
"This medium-bodied blend of 70% Sangiovese, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot offers mature berry and baking spice aromas. On the palate, round tannins temper the ripe black cherry, vanilla and coffee flavors. Drink through 2018.",88,Il Sassolo 2011 Santa Cristina a Mezzana  (Carmignano)
"Richly soft, round and concentrated, this wine is exuberant in apple flavor, with a touch of stone fruit and papaya. It has a pleasing succulence that should broadly appeal.",90,Landmark 2015 Overlook Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"Sashi Moorman and Rajat Parr love to pick early, and it shows with aromas of stewed tomatoes, green olives, green cardamom and Eastern European spices. It's very savory and wakes up the palate with vinegar-laden flavors reminiscent of North African tagines, and would make an excellent extra-spice accompaniment to a wide variety of foods. Expect this wine to grow in complexity and approachability 2018–2024.",92,Domaine de la Cote 2012 la Cote Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Flat aromas of coconut and toasted oak give way to smoky chocolate mocha, red currant and black pepper. A touch soft on the finish, it otherwise drinks full-bodied and powerful.",88,Corner 103 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley)
"Mont-Redon's Lirac is a medium-bodied, supple blend of 70% Grenache, 20% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre. Cherry, cinnamon and leather notes all make appearances, backed by nearly creamy-textured tannins. It's a smooth, easy-drinking red for drinking now–2017.",88,Château Mont-Redon 2011 Red (Lirac)
"Berry, menthol and a hint of espresso aromas lead the way while the straightforward palate shows mature black-skinned berry, coffee and a hint of licorice. It's already approachable. Drink through 2020.",87,Borgogno F.lli Serio e Battista 2012  Barolo
"Vines around 25 years old on this family domaine yield this soft and creamy wine. It has attractive, crisp acidity and a bright texture that brings in apples and lemon flavors. The wine is ready to drink.",88,Domaine Fourrey 2014  Chablis
"This classic vineyard delivers the goodies—ripe, round and quite pretty flavors of raspberry and cherry fruit, with orange peel highlights. The tangy acidity keeps it lively and the length suggests that it will drink well through the mid-2020s.",92,Roco 2014 Knudsen Vineyards Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Blackberry candies, purple flowers, black tea and hints of shaved dark chocolate show on the nose of this blend of 65% Syrah, 25% Mourvèdre and 10% Grenache. A zesty acidity kicks off the sip, then a tannic structure emerges, with thoroughly integrated flavors of pressed violet, dense blueberry jelly, tart olallieberry and a burned-caramel edge.",90,Chronic Cellars 2013 Ricardo Grande Red (Paso Robles)
"Certified organic by Ecocert, this estate straddles the communes of Sablet, Plan de Dieu and Gigondas. This entry-level blend of 75% Grenache and 25% Syrah is beautifully floral and herbal, yet backed by appealing red and purple fruit. Medium to full in body, it's firm but ripe, framed by dusty tannins. Drink now–2020.",90,Domaine des Pasquiers 2013 Red (Côtes du Rhône)
"Gritty, uric, green aromas come in front of a round palate with little cut. Vegetal, bitter flavors of bell pepper and grapefruit finish with another wave of bitterness.",82,François Lurton 2015 Hacienda Araucano Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Lolol Valley)
"John Kinney is doing great things with Livermore Valley fruit, most especially with many of his whites, including this classically oaked Fumé Blanc, the grapes barrel-fermented in 100% French oak (Seguin Moreau and Taransaud) and left sur lie for six months, Montrachet style. Creamy but bright with aromatics of caramel and vanilla, but only 50 cases were made.",90,Occasio 2010 Del Arroyo Vineyard Fumé Blanc (Livermore Valley)
"From an 850-foot-elevation site four miles from the ocean, this offers a depth of dark cherry and Asian spice, lightly bodied and textured. It delivers a hit of bittersweet chocolate on the tangy finish, with an intriguing streak of charcuterie that's hard to shake.",91,Whistler 2013 Corvus Whistler Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This is from a fantastic vineyard site in the Laguna Hills neighborhood of the appellation, and the second vintage of this particular selection from this producer. Generous lemony oak meets toast within a robust body of complex layers and salty caramel.",92,MacPhail 2014 Pratt Vineyard Vine Hill Road Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Peppery iron-oxide notes dance alongside notions of blueberry and cherry. The colour is dark but the fruit is crunchy and fresh. There is drive and vividness at the core of this rustic, appetizing red. Tannins are present and give a pleasant but light grip. Fresh acidity provides even more focus. With food this will shine. Drink soon to enjoy its vividness.",89,Gunter Triebaumer 2014 Trie Rot Red (Burgenland)
"Yellow in color, with a peachy, baked set of aromas. The palate hits with a blast of acidity but not much else, while the flavors are brash and lean toward green apple and green plum. Rounder and softer on the finish, but also short.",86,Huguet de Can Feixes 2009 Blanc Selecció White (Penedès)
"Just barely drinkable. It's not dirty or anything, but watery and very fruity.",80,Inkling 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"It was fascinating to compare this to Two Paddocks' regular bottling. The Last Chance is slightly richer, but otherwise features many of the same elements: smoke, tart cherries and delicate herbal notes. Despite the extra concentration, it's still supple and approachable now.",90,Two Paddocks 2012 The Last Chance Earnscleugh Vineyard Pinot Noir (Central Otago)
"Clean and fresh, with light citrus and apple flavors. A pleasant, somewhat beery flavor.",84,Stonecap 2009 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Citrus blossom and tropical aromas are light and easy. The palate is melony and not too acidic, with standard Asian pear, lychee and citrus flavors. Lively on the finish, and solid overall for under $10.",85,Acordeón 2010 Torrontés (Cafayate)
"Longoria has worked with this finicky Spanish grape variety for years, with mixed results. This 2010 is lower in alcohol than the wine has been in a long time, which gives it a delicate mouthfeel. It's dense in cherries, currants, bacon and licorice, but finishes dry. Easy to like for its soft deliciousness.",88,Longoria 2010 Tempranillo (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Pure, focused fruit flavors like raspberry and red cherry light up this medium-bodied wine. A lively texture of crisp acidity and light tannins adds great balance to the effusive fruitiness. For such a friendly price, what else could one ask for?",87,Twisted 2013 Old Vine Zinfandel (California)
"Pretty basic, a dryly tannic red wine with cherry and herb flavors. Feels hard and sharp in the mouth, with astringent tannins and acids. Could age out.",84,Viansa 2007 Athena Dolcetto (Sonoma County)
"Recently implemented winemaker and cellar changes make this one of the best Sassicaias ever. This Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc blend delivers thick concentration and sun-kissed aromas of black fruit, prune, dried bay leaf, black olive and tobacco. The thick, fertile soils that characterize the magical strip of coastal Tuscany at Bol-gheri help shape amazing richness and intensity.",97,Tenuta San Guido 2008 Sassicaia  (Bolgheri Sassicaia)
"This is a woody, oak-dominated Malbec, but it's also ripe and well made. Aromas of sawdust, vanilla and toast support raw berry essence. In the mouth, tartaric notes stick out amid the richness, while flavors of oak, toast, vanilla and berry fruits finish woody but with wayward acidity.",90,Finca la Celia 2011 Heritage Single Vineyard Malbec (Uco Valley)
"Tin House has been producing good Pinot Noirs that have been pushing the possibilities for Edna Valley, although the prices are going up every year. This bottling shows pure, ripe cherry, currant and cocoa flavors and rich, sweet oak, with the acidity that characterizes everything from this cool part of the Central Coast. Drink now through 2010.",88,Tin House 2005 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)
"Easy to drink, this has enough sophistication to pair with rich scallop, tuna and lobster dishes. It's dry, although there's a lot of sweetly ripe orange, apricot and buttercream flavors, as well as caramelized oak. Brisk acidity fortunately brings a crisp, balanced edge.",90,Jordan 2010 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"A good effort in a cool vintage, the winery's top cuvée brings tart cranberry and cherry fruit, racy and fresh, along with flavors of stem and herb. The wine spent 11 months in barrel, but shows no significant oak flavors.",90,The Four Graces 2011 Black Family Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Fleshy blueberries are met with soft vanilla notes on this full-fruited yet light-footed red. On the palate the bursting blueberry notes are even more appetizing and joined by pleasant pepper with just a hint of tobacco. There is something rather seductive about these fruit-driven reds that deliver more than simple fruit. Utterly delicious, very elegant and dangerously drinkable.",92,Nittnaus Anita und Hans 2013 Heideboden Red (Burgenland)
"Made from certified organically grown grapes, this wisp of a wine is made in a quiet style from a cool year and a relatively cool area of the Napa Valley. Pencil lead, peppercorn and cedar come to mind first and foremost, followed by light, juicy notes of classic cassis. Not overly oaked, the finish suggests chocolate.",88,Ackerman 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville)
"This aromatic wine brings a potpourri of freshly rubbed sage, Dimetapp, bay leaf and sweet tobacco. It's broad yet light in feel with a pretty sense of elegance and restraint.",88,Robert Ramsay 2012 Upland Vineyards Grenache (Snipes Mountain)
"This very fruity wine oozes fresh apricot and elegant peach flavors. It's crisp and fragrant, a fine, ready-to-drink blend of Antão Vaz, Roupeiro and Arinto.",86,Quinta do Quetzal 2011 Guadalupe Branco White (Alentejano)
"This appellation blend is rich and lush with baked black-cherry aromas, touches of black cardamom and clove spice, and earthy rhubarb and beet notes. The palate packs a lot of forest-floor flavors, from loam to pine needles, into dark cranberry and tight raspberry fruit, leveled by pepper and pencil lead.",89,Ken Brown 2013 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"This is solidly anchored in its ripe cherry fruit, a rich mouthful that represents the best of the winery's 2012 lineup of reserve bottlings. Highlights of citrus fruits elevate the acids, and there is a pleasing hint of toast across the full midpalate.",90,Walnut City WineWorks 2012 Carlton Hill Vineyard Reserve Pinot Noir
"Nero d'Avola and Merlot are blended to produce a ripe, chewy wine with mature fruit flavors. The nose is a bit muddled and dense but the wine offers good succulence and depth.",86,Abbazia Santa Anastasia 2005 Passomaggio Red (Sicilia)
"Beginning with a velvety texture and inviting bouquet of strawberry and rose, this classic blend of 82% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Cabernet Franc, 8% Petit Verdot and 2% Merlot is grown on the winery's 845-acre estate atop Spring Mountain. Kirsch, black pepper and chocolate combine atop a smooth, integrated palate that's elegant from start to finish, the oak tempered to good effect. Drink now through 2027.",94,Spring Mountain Vineyard 2012 Elivette Red (Napa Valley)
"The perfumed character of this pure Vermentino is right up front. It gives the wine its ripe character and fine orange blossom aromas. The wine is crisp, juicy and with a refreshing aftertaste.",87,Clos Teddi 2015 Vermentino (Patrimonio)
"Marked by powerful oak influences and sur-lie aging, this Kunde offering features strong, forward aromas of the ripest pears and apples, but maintains a light quality on the palate.",88,Kunde 1998 Wildwood Vineyard Chardonnay (California)
"Bright raspberry, cherry and rose petal aromas meet cola spice on the pretty, delicate nose of this bottling—a solid example of the surge in quality of Central Coast Grenache. There is a tense tannic structure to the palate despite its light nature, with great acidity presenting tangy red and purple fruit flavors, with more rose petal accents.",93,Margerum 2014 Grenache (Santa Barbara County)
"Vigna del Mandorlo Dolcetto d'Alba opens with bright freshness and loads of cherry, blueberry, raspberry and toasted almond. The wine shows freshness that is balanced by smooth, velvety tannins.",87,Azienda Agricola Cogno 2009 Vigna del Mandorlo  (Dolcetto d'Alba)
"Rounded and soft, with gentle tannins. Packed with black cherry fruits, a herbal edge and sweetness, this is already an approachable wine, fruity and generous.",88,Joseph Drouhin 2009  Santenay
"There's a soft, candied appeal to the cherry, strawberry and blackberry flavors in this dry, young wine. With a sweet oak jacket, it's clean and pleasant to drink now.",86,Alexander Valley Vineyards 2009 Wetzel Family Estate Syrah (Alexander Valley)
"To call this wine huge is an understatement. Blended from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Petit Verdot, Syrah and Carmenère, its most notable feature is tannins. It's hard, dry and astringent, making it difficult to appreciate now. But there's a gigantic core of blackberries and black currants. With richness like this, it should age and improve through 2020 at least.",91,Chalk Hill 2010 Estate Red (Chalk Hill)
"A soft, creamy texture houses buttery flavors of blackberry jam and mocha in this Cab, which has a drop of Merlot. It's flashy and opulent, in the modern Napa style, with relatively high alcohol that gives a bite of heat. Drink it over the next six years.",89,Robinson Family Vineyards 2010 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District)
"Although this is a soft wine without great definition, it conveys a pleasant, refreshing mix of melon and lime flavors. It's a young wine that is ready to drink.",85,Quinta de Sant'Ana 2012 Verdelho (Lisboa)
"Part of the select group of impressive wines from this year, this wine is ripe, rich and firmly structured. Black-currant fruitiness forms the base for solid tannins and a concentrated texture. The hints of wood-aging need to soften. Drink from 2022.",93,Château Léoville Barton 2013  Saint-Julien
"A mix of strawberry-rhubarb compote, mocha-chocolate and chalky tannins are featured in this 80% Cabernet with smaller amounts of other Bordeaux varieties blended in. Dense and meaty, a powerful jolt of cassis rears its head on the finish.",89,Terra Valentine 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Bright and supple, this wine is vibrantly awash in red cherry, raspberry and whisps of vanilla, finishing lean and with plenty of versatility.",88,Borrellie 2014 Reserve Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"With almost zero dosage, this is dry but it doesn't feel at all unbalanced because of the ripe, fragrant fruitiness. The wine is full in the mouth, with lively acidity. It is ready to drink, particularly with food.",90,Vincent Couche NV Brut Nature  (Champagne)
"Creamy, almost mellow notes of ripe yellow apple constitute the nose. The palate intensifies that creaminess with hints of vanilla and burnt sugar as well as with a finely fizzing, creamy mousse. All this is countered and balanced by sprightly freshness. Overall it conveys an opulent, hedonistic style, with an expressive and long finish reminiscent of salted caramel.",93,Arndorfer 2012 die Leidenschaft Sparkling (Niederösterreich)
"With a name like this, it should come as no surprise that this is 85% Carmenère (with 15% Malbec and Syrah). This smells like pencil lead, plastic and blueberry. In the mouth, it's chunky but flat, with flavors of plastic, lactic oak and herbal berry fruits. A minty, green finish is oaky and adequate.",85,Car Men Air 2011 Red (Maule Valley)
"Soft and relatively open in style, with captivating aromas of wet mossy stones and ripe melon and hints of pear and lychee on the palate. Very approachable now for a young Prüm.",91,Joh. Jos. Prüm 2009 Graacher Himmelreich Auslese Riesling (Mosel)
"Aromas of oak, toast, espresso, peppermint and a whiff of blue flower lead the nose. The firm palate offers dark cherry, cake spice, grilled herb and anise alongside tightly wound, assertive tannins and bright acidity.",91,Alberto Voerzio 2011 La Serra  (Barolo)
"This 100% Sangiovese Chianti opens with iris, new leather and vanilla aromas. Structured and savory, the palate delivers black cherry, tobacco and licorice flavors, while chewy tannins lend structure. Enjoy through 2021.",90,Castello di Radda 2012 Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico)
"The lightest of the dessert wines made by Claude Loustalot, this is fruity, fragrant and medium sweet, with refreshing acidity. The crisp texture combines hints of honey and apricot jam. Drink now.",88,Domaine Bru-Baché 2010  Jurançon
"There's a layered complexity to this interesting blend of 47% Viognier, 32% Chenin Blanc, 18% Roussanne and 3% Grenache Blanc, with a beautiful interplay between the fruity notes of citrus peel, tart melon, green apple and plum and the earthy tones of fynbos, almond skin and sweet baking spice. The plush texture is countered by ample acidity, leading into a clean finish that's laced with toasty accents. Drink now–2018.",89,Fairview 2013 Nurok White (Paarl)
"Delicious flavors of cola, cherries, raspberries, rose tea, orange peel, vanilla and smoky sandalwood merge in this single-vineyard Pinot Noir, and it's nicely dry, with a silky-smooth texture. Give it a good decant before serving, as it gets better as it breathes.",90,Peters Family 2006 Sonoma Stage Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This wine is appealing for its smooth mouth-feel, mildly spicy aromas and dried-fruit flavors. Medium to full bodied, it also tastes mellow and mature, with no rough edges poking out.",85,Red 7 2010 Proprietary Red (North Coast)
"Aromas of berry, coffee, herbs and smoke lead to dark fruit flavors with a layered, supple feel. It's a good find at this price.",90,Purple Star 2012 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A strong pineapple and mango imprint persists throughout this Chardonnay, along with bright acidity and a floral finish.",84,un4seen 2011 Chardonnay (Lodi)
"A simple, everyday Chardonnay that's refreshingly crisp, with sweet lime, orange, pear and vanilla flavors.",83,Pepi 2011 Chardonnay (California)
This is vinified in cement vats to retain the purity of fruit and easy crispness. You will also notice slight dusty tones of crushed mineral and vitamin on the finish.,84,Piazzano 2011  Chianti
"There's a meaty, smoked element to the nose of this Brunello that recalls beef jerky or sizzling bacon. Those hearty aromas are followed by delicate layers of blackberry, cherry and spice. The wine is bright and acidic in the mouth, which makes for an excellent balance.",89,La Colombina 2005  Brunello di Montalcino
"Tight, dark and oaky on the nose, this has woody power, cedary complexity and lots of staunch berry character. It is full, grabby and tannic, showing a firm spine to support toasty, oaky, clove-influenced flavors. Dark, tight and toasty on the finish; drink now–2019.",92,Matarromera 2006 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)
"A rustic Chardonnay, with a sweet-and-sour orange sauce flavor and a creamy texture.",82,Lucas & Lewellen 2007 Goodchild Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County)
"A wine that delivers great freshness, a bright lemon and grapefruit character, tautly mineral in character, almost steely, with a pure line of green fruits. Age for 2–3 years.",92,Joseph Drouhin 2008 Domaine Drouhin-Vaudon Montmains Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"This is a very mineral-driven pink wine, with aromas of wet rocks, chalk and even steel giving way to the slightest hints of orange and strawberry. The flavors are very delicate and refreshing on the palate, with melon and red pear, rounded out by a key lime acidity.",89,Robert Renzoni 2016 Lyric Rose of Syrah (Temecula Valley)
"This Columbia Valley Syrah boasts strong varietal aromatics. It seems to have a spine of iron and a streak of garrigue-like dried herb, with lovely flavors of pomegranate and wild berry.",91,Novelty Hill 2009 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Aromas of smoke, char and spice entice the nose of this zippy, medium-bodied Lemberger. The palate is crisp, offering tart black cherry and blackberry flavors fringed delicately with tannins. Finishes long, with a delicate floral note.",88,Hosmer 2010 Lemberger (Cayuga Lake)
"This first wine of the vintage, a blend of Pinot Noir, Grenache, and Valdigue, is largely the result of carbonic maceration, a winemaking technique that creates the freshest, sharpest, zingiest aromas and flavors imaginable. ItÕs vibrant and juicy, like Beaujolais. The gorgeous ripeness of the fruit bodes well for the 2001 vintage. Great value.",86,Beringer 2001 Nouveau Red (California)
"The Ulysses red has been the main calling card for this winery, and it is a distinctive wine that expresses the complexity—with no herbs barred—of Yakima Valley grapes. Woven into the heart of the wine are threads of herb, olive, pea vine and other green notes, but there are also black cherry and cassis flavors. It's balanced and proportionate, closer to a true Bordeaux-style blend than most Washington efforts.",91,O•S Winery 2008 Sheridan Vineyard Ulysses Red Red (Yakima Valley)
This edition of Pian di Nova from the Ferragamo-owned Il Borro estate in Tuscany shows ripe notes of raspberry and black cherry with slight shadings of bitter chocolate and spice.,88,Il Borro 2006 Pian di Nova Red (Toscana)
"Tastes young and jammy now, with perky, tartly sweet flavors of blackberries, cherries and currants. Oak adds smoky complexities that bring to mind mocha, vanilla and buttered toast, with a sprinkle of cinnamon. Somewhat lacking in nuance, with plenty of flash, this Cab should develop over the next 6–8 years.",91,Martin Estate 2006 Collector's Reserve Puerta Dorada Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"Aromas of toast, espresso and meat juices lead the nose. The palate offers oak, cured meat, grilled herb and dried red fruit alongside firm but fine-grained tannins. Drink 2016–2022.",88,Podere La Vigna 2010  Brunello di Montalcino
"Surprisingly smoky and toasty upfront, but balanced by ample apricot fruit and hints of honey, pineapple and citrus zest. Despite its ripe, oaky nature, there's plenty of crisp acidity to provide structure and prolong the finish. Drink now–2016.",92,Gilles Flacher 2011 Les Rouelles  (Condrieu)
"From a vintage not known for its supersweet selections, this wine is a revelation. Honey and bergamot notes mingle easily on the nose, while the palate unfolds to reveal layers of honey, dried apricots and orange marmalade. It's rich, viscous and concentrated without any heaviness, with a finish that's sweet and lingering. This should age through 2040 easily.",96,St. Urbans-Hof 2008 Leiwener Laurentiuslay Beerenauslese Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer)
"This wine is a blend of fruit from Summit View, Klipsun and Doval vineyards. Aromas of wood spice, purple fruit, vanilla and exotic spice are followed by tart cranberry and cherry flavors, with the midpalate dipping in concentration. The tannins bring quite a bit of grip.",87,Browne Family Vineyards 2013 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Castle Rock does a fine job with this value Cabernet Sauvignon. Smooth and supple, the very pretty fruit flavors range from cranberry to black cherry. Delicate suggestions of mushroom, cocoa and dusty earth add welcome complexity.",89,Castle Rock 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The nose is fruity, with hints of vanilla bean. In the mouth, peach and lemon flavors carry a note of cinnamon spice, although the finish veers toward asparagus and green beans. Acidity and balance; are both on the money. Best Buy.",86,Concha y Toro 2001 Casillero del Diablo Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)
"Named after the Pontac family which in the 18th century owned large swathes of Bordeaux and its vineyards, this estate is based around a former hunting lodge. The wine is ripe and full, finely structured and with tight still-young acidity. Drink from 2022.",92,Château Pontac Monplaisir 2014  Pessac-Léognan
"Darkly charred wood mingles with scents of coconut, dill and sweet spice on this heavily-oaked Chardonnay. Hints of smoke and hazelnuts seep into the palate as well, but serve to highlight fresh, fruity flavors of pear, lemon and orange rind. This finishes on a slightly-bitter wood note.",85,Truro 2010 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (America)
"Coming in at 47g/L residual sugar, this is quite ripe and aromatic with notes of peach and flowers but doesn't have the acid to hold it together.",85,Hyatt 2012 Riesling (Rattlesnake Hills)
"Earthy notes of white mushroom, shaved truffle or oak barrel open the nose of this Riserva Barbaresco and are soon followed by toasted hazelnuts and dark chocolate. The fruit element is minimal but the wine shows nice tightness and firmness on the finish.",88,Fratelli Casetta 2006 Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"Fresh, superripe as well as candied pineapple combine to give utter opulence to this rich and viscous wine. The longer you taste, the more intense—almost heady—these tropical flavors become. What is more, as an ice wine untainted by any botrytis, this shines with purity and drive, and has astonishing acidity that keeps this just on the right side of paradise.",94,Stift Klosterneuburg 2011 Eiswein Jungherrn Chardonnay (Vienna)
"This winery has shown a knack with Malbec and it continues on its young estate project. Aromas of herbs, tobacco, red plum and clove are fresh and appealing. The palate is lush, textured, concentrated and flavorful with a spice-filled finish that keeps you coming back for more. Expect this wine to drink well through 2030.",92,àMaurice 2010 Amparo Estate Malbec (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Produced from old vines on schist soils, this is an intensely structured wine. While it has power, it is the texture and the firm fruit that give it character. Black fruits combine with dark tannins to create a dry, solid aftertaste.",90,Adega Cooperativa de Borba 2007 Montes Claros Garrafeira Red (Alentejo)
"Smooth to the edge of silky, this barrel-fermented wine spent 14 months in French oak. Green apple and butter flavors are foremost, with a light suggestion of fresh herb.",87,Soléna 2013 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
"Lightly herbaceous, this is a fresh, obviously youthful wine. It is only lightly textured, the main character coming from yellow fruits and pear juice flavors. Drink now, although it will age and improve until 2016.",84,Château Moulin de Vignolle 2014  Bordeaux Blanc
"Dark in color, this is a powerful, classic wine, with dense tannins. It has rich black-fruit flavors, and notes of wood and herb that are packed into its concentrated, dry structure. This is a great Douro for aging.",95,Niepoort 2009 Batuta Red (Douro)
"Roasted hazelnut with grilled pineapple and peach carry the aromas and palate of this vineyard-designate Chardonnay. Having spent 11 months in French oak (33% new), the wine shows barrel tones, however a bright acidity helps keep things alive and fresh.",88,Michael Shaps 2013 Wild Meadow Vineyard Chardonnay (Virginia)
"Much lighter in weight than many Pinot Gris on the market, this is a pretty, fruit-driven rendering of the variety, blending tropical fruit with ripe apples and hints of pink grapefruit. It's crisp and clean on the finish.",85,Dr. Wehrheim 2005 Grauer Burgunder Kabinett Trocken Pinot Gris (Pfalz)
"Fairly aromatic, it conveys notes of red and black fruit, savory herbs, toffee and barrel spices. Lighter in style, it shows abundant vanilla flavors while still bringing a lovely sense of texture and overall balance.",89,Silvan Ridge 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rogue Valley)
"There's a lot to like in this affordable Syrah. It's rich and smoky, with blackberry and bacon flavors wrapped in a smooth texture. With 17,000 cases produced, this should be relatively easy to find.",87,Sterling 2009 Vintner's Collection Syrah (Central Coast)
"Although this is the winery's reserve-level blend, it doesn't work well in this vintage. Vague and muted, the mix of grapes lacks focus, offering just a thin, generic red wine with a chalky aftertaste.",83,Weisinger 2011 Petit Pompadour Red (Rogue Valley)
"Coming from a new vineyard near the town of Los Olivos, this bottling starts with steely aromas of dried lime rind, baking soda, gunmetal and quince on the nose. It's very tightly wound on the palate, where an intriguing texture reveals lemongrass, kaffir-lime leaf, aromatic cider apple and metallic minerality.",91,Solminer 2015 Delanda Vineyard Grüner Veltliner (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Ah, Tignanello, the father of all super Tuscans. A tried and true favorite, it is a Sangiovese-based wine cut with a small component of Cabernet for rich aromas of red fruit and spice. It is elegant, harmonious and long-lasting on the finish; drink after 2012.",95,Marchesi Antinori 2004 Tignanello Red (Toscana)
"An interesting note of sweet smoke graces the nose of this Merlot, adding another layer to the otherwise traditional characteristics of rich black berry and dark plum guts. Round and satisfying in the mouth with approachable tannins and a medium finish.",85,Indaba 2010 Merlot (Western Cape)
"Pali's multi-vineyard Summit blend has come from various appellations over the years. The 2010 shows the ripe cherry-berry flavors and fine acidity of the Santa Rita Hills. It's good, but a bit warm, sweet and simple.",86,Pali 2010 Summit Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"An oily bouquet lacks freshness while smelling a bit oxidized and like mushrooms. This has a chunky palate with oxidized, somewhat bitter flavors of papaya and citrus fruits. A pithy mildly bitter finish struggles to show its virtues.",84,Vieira de Plata 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Fully mature, oxidized aromas include a heavy note of popcorn and oak along with aged pear and apple. This wine is ripping with acidity, while flavors lean towards salty, lightly baked apple. A finish based mostly on acid means this should stay vital for years to come.",87,Portal del Montsant 2011 Santbru White (Montsant)
"A blend of 45% Carignan, 30% Grenache, 20% Mourvèdre and 5% Syrah, this is a beautifully expressive, well-balanced Corbières-Boutenac red. Initial aromas of dense red plum, raspberry, and strawberry give way to secondary scents of rose, lavender and thyme. The medium-weight palate shows more fresh fruit character, with fine yet structured tannins lending grip through the close.",90,Château Ollieux Romanis 2013 Atal Sia Red (Corbières-Boutenac)
"Young vines, the first release from estate-grown fruit. The vanilla flavors of the barrels are front and center at the moment, though there are darker fruits in the background, along with smoke, licorice and a hint of tar. Good long-term potential.",86,Folin Cellars 2008 Petite Sirah (Rogue Valley)
"This fresh, pure value red cranks out raspberry and boysenberry aromas in front of a crisp, tight palate. Ripe, quick-hitting flavors of red-berry fruits and toasty smoke finish zesty, with a lasting note of pie cherry.",90,Encanto 2011 Roble Mencía (Bierzo)
"Fleshy, unfocused aromas of apple and peach are a touch oxidized. This Chardonnay feels bland. Flavors of melon and peach lack tension and character, while there's not much flavor to the finish other than mild apple and some bitterness.",84,Bodegas San Valero 2014 Particular Chardonnay (Cariñena)
"There's a nice intensity of pineapple, guava and hoppy, floral aromas on the nose of this estate-grown Riesling. Racy and linear on the light-bodied palate, tart tropical fruits meet a chalky midpalate and carry to a brisk citrus finish.",87,Brengman Brothers 2013 Estate Grown Crain Hill Vineyards Trocken Riesling (Leelanau Peninsula)
"Ripasso Le Quare shows very nice integration of bright fruit tones such as cherry and cassis set against smoky notes of spice and chocolate derived from careful oak aging. The wine also shows freshness with a pleasant, medium mouthfeel that is never over the top.",88,Gamba 2008 Le Quare  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
"Tormaresca delivers a beautiful expression of Negroamaro. Quality aromas of blackberry and cherry liqueur emerge on the bouquet, and oak-driven tones of almond and chocolate follow through on the finish. It's soft, plush and bold.",91,Tormaresca 2007 Masseria Maìme Negroamaro (Salento)
"A spicy, fruity wine, the structure relatively light but firmly dry, with a strong seasoning of black currant fruits. It is fresh, the fruit juicy and vibrant, with an edge of firm wood.",88,Château Lafon-Rochet 2007  Saint-Estèphe
"There is not a lot by way of scent, the palate, however, delivers the freshness of sliced lemon and yellow grapefruit. The body is light but wonderfully clean and refreshing.",89,Tegernseerhof 2014 Ried Kellerberg Smaragd Riesling (Wachau)
"Mint aromas speak of new wood as part of the aging process in this wine from Bordeaux Vineam. It has plenty of spice, while also having fine red-fruit flavors and acidity. Drink from 2018.",87,Château Rocher Bellevue 2014 Les Cerisiers  (Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux)
"A disappointing wine, not one of Adelaida's best. The problem isn't just excessive softness, sweetness and heat from high alcohol, it's a vegetative note that mars the blackberries and cherries.",84,Adelaida 2010 Viking Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Here's an easygoing blend of 70% Sangiovese and 30% Merlot that offers blue flowers and red berry aromas that carry over to the palate along with a hint of white pepper. Supple tannins support the bright, juicy flavors. Drink through 2016.",87,Castello di Meleto 2012 Borgaio Red (Toscana)
"Morgan's Hat Trick Chardonnay, from his own vineyard, was a hit right out of the block. Now, so is his Pinot Noir. It's elaborately flavored, a fairly soft, full-bodied wine that's stuffed with pastry-filling cherries, blackberries, currants and raspberries, with exotic additions of kumquats, cola, red licorice and vanilla. This extraordinarily complex wine should change in interesting ways over at least the next six years.",94,Morgan 2006 Hat Trick Double L Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"From a selected parcel of vines at Brumont's Château Montus, this wine is obviously dense and powerful. Its alcohol does give it too much weight and a peppery character, although the wine is also impressively fresh. It has concentrated black-plum and damson fruits, strong tannins and a dry chocolaty aftertaste. Drink from 2020.",90,Vignobles Brumont 2011 Segondine Haut Lieu Tannat-Cabernet Franc (Madiran)
"With its firmness and juicy red-fruit flavor, this wine is delicious to drink now, but it will also age for at least six years. This bottling demonstrates the structure and generosity of one of Beaune's most famous premier crus.",92,Joseph Drouhin 2010 Beaune Grèves Premier Cru  (Beaune)
"This single-vineyard 100% Cabernet Franc is firm, juicy and focused. It has a phenolic bite at the back end, along with lemony acids. The concentration of fruit and herb flavors is excellent, which makes it a fine steak wine and also a bottle to stow away for a few more years.",90,Arbor Crest 2010 Conner Lee Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Young and unintegrated, this Cab is nowhere near ready to drink. The sweet oak sticks out, overpowering the ripe blackberry, currant and herb flavors. Needs time. Give it until after 2009, at the earliest.",89,Corley 2005 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A blend of 90% Sangiovese, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot, this opens with earthy aromas of truffle, scorched earth, violet and a touch of dark spice. The palate offers dried black cherry and ground pepper alongside fine-grained tannins. It also shows the heat of the vintage, so drink soon.",88,La Castellina 2011 Squarcialupi Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"This affordable wine impresses in smoky, charred oak and a full, robust profile that it embraces completely. Leather, blackberry and black pepper combine on the palate for power and a lengthy, lasting impression on the finish.",91,Once and It's Gone 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Ripe, rich and velvety, this wine shows no lack of restraint. The black cherry, herb and mushroom shadings aren't shy at all, and this full-bodied wine finishes long and warm. Drink now–2018.",91,Neudorf 2010 Moutere Pinot Noir (Nelson)
"Cherry cough drops in a pleasant way on the nose, and then a medium-berry mouth, spice, light cedar and raspberries—there's a whole lot going on here. Not heavy on the complexity; rather it delivers clean fruit and simple spice.",91,Jessup Cellars 1997 Lauer Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"From a fine vineyard site, this wine impresses in voluptuous texture and its lovely layers of lemon and apple. Floral on the nose in apple blossom and jasmine, it offers a slight twist of more spiced citrus, like an orange dotted in clove. It spent nine months in French oak, 40% of it new, which adds complexity and notes of toasted oak.",90,Francis Coppola 2014 Dutton Ranch Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Notes of hay, pollen and beeswax add a savory, honeyed tone to this exquisitely dainty Riesling. The palate is intensely packed with sweet citrus fruit, but it's balanced with striking acidity and a shower of minerality on the finish.",91,Maximin Grünhäuser 2010 Herrenberg Auslese 21 Riesling (Mosel)
"This is undeniably an oaky wine with a prominent layer of buttered toast and butterscotch, but the underlying orange, guava and lime flavors are pristine.",86,Frank Family 2011 Lewis Vineyard Reserve Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Ripe, opulent black currants and violets, melted into liquid and bathed in toasty oak, are the flavors of this 100% Cabernet. Alcohol brings subtle heat and sweet glycerine, but the finish is dry and long. It's a beautiful evocation of St. Helena terroir, but needs aging. Give it a try in 2018, and it should have no trouble gliding well into the 2020s.",94,Corley 2010 Yewell Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
"The nose is secretive but the palate shows structure and poise. There is freshness and brisk, tart redcurrant fruit with some concentration, plesantly unexpected grip and lovely firmness. It's a light but impressive Pinot.",89,Domaine Charles Frey 2013 Quintessence Pinot Noir (Alsace)
"Elegant and finely structured, this creamy fragrant white opens with heady scents of jasmine, honeysuckle and white stone fruit. The smooth delicious palate delivers green melon, white peach, cantaloupe, grapefruit and orange zest while a saline note lifts the lingering finish.",93,Villa Russiz 2015 De La Tour Sauvignon (Collio)
"A blackened wine, with piercing, dense aromas of shoe polish, charred oak, dark spice and black fruit. It feels solid and juicy, with black-tasting flavors that focus on espresso and dark spice. The finish is a bit short on fruit.",86,Verum 2010 Malbec (Alto Valle del Río Negro)
"Fresh earth and gloriously ripe stone fruit make for a convincing opening on the nose. The palate swings with this sonorous, earthy edge and frames rich, ripe and rounded pear and yellow plum fruit. Overall, there is zesty fresh citrus that gathers everything together and presents a concentrated wine with drive and personality. The finish is long, clean and convincing. Drink 2020–2040.",94,Pichler-Krutzler 2015 Loibenberg Riesling (Wachau)
"Fleshy cherry and a broad palate characterize this wine. There is palpable warmth and easy fruit, but they're underneath a tight and sound structure. Understated, but true Pinot-pleasure is in the glass.",87,Markowitsch 2011 Pinot Noir (Carnuntum)
"Struck flint, fig and melon aromas lead the way, followed by similar flavors, plus a strong backbone of mixed citrus. It's pleasantly light in weight, with a long, crisp, citrusy finish.",90,Lake Chalice 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Hints of dusty mineral and hazelnut lend a slightly earthy tone to this otherwise bright, lemony Gewürztraminer. Delicately sweet, it offers easygoing citrus refreshment with a brisk finish. Drink now.",87,St. Christopher 2015 Gewürztraminer (Nahe)
"This opens with aromas of oak, toast, licorice, coconut and sugared plum. The taut palate offers dried cherry, star anise and a green note of powdered sage but not a lot of fruit richness. Raspy tannins leave a tongue-drying finish.",87,Argiano 2010 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Smells like fresh berries and perfume, which is good. In the mouth, it's weighty and sticky, with just enough acidity to keep it pumping. Tastes cranked up and wild, with plum and nectarine flavors leading the charge. Sugary on the finish, with a slightly cloying feel.",84,Tapiz 2011 Malbec Rosé (Mendoza)
"Pure strawberry and red cherry fruits with a twist of acidity make this a wine that is already delicious. Just under the surface is a firm wood-and-tannin character and a dense, if juicy, structure. Age for 4–5 years.",93,Louis Jadot 2009 Beaune Bressandes Premier Cru  (Beaune)
"The bouquet starts off with moderately intense scents of plum, cherry and blackberry, with a cured-meat accent in the background. Glimmers of black pepper and bark add depth to the palate, while the medium-full mouthfeel boasts moderate tannins followed by a clean finish.",88,Carmel 2009 Kayoumi Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Galilee)
"The nose and palate are smoky and waxy, with a shimmer of petrol. The palate is brisk and lemony, with hints of citrus peel, nut oil and nut skin that linger on the long finish. This dry, savory Riesling is already showing signs of bottle age. Drink now.",87,Heron Hill 2010 Ingle Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Classic aromas of cinnamon, raisin, prune and spice rise from the glass, while flavors of pure caramel, baked apple, chocolate and cinnamon take over. This is thick stuff, but with game acidity it stops short of being syrupy. And it's forever long on the finish. Sweet, rich and balanced. What P.X. ought to be.",91,Alvear 2005 Anada Pedro Ximénez (Montilla-Moriles)
"This is wonderfully rich and dense, with dry and dusty tannins that float in the depths of the powerful black fruits, well integrated with the wood. This is impressive Malbec, showing its juicy qualities allied with its huge tannins. It could do with 3–4 years' aging.",91,Clos Troteligotte 2005 K Lys Malbec (Cahors)
"A very rich, ripe, opulent Cabernet, fulsome in blackberries, blueberries, currants and licorice, nicely framed in sweet, smoky oak. Easy to drink now for its soft tannins.",89,Kirkland Signature 2008 Mountain Cuvée Cabernet (Napa Valley)
"Strong scents of cola and chocolate come up quickly from the glass, and those flavors notes override the light strawberry and cherry fruit. With a bit of breathing time they all combine gracefully, crafting a full forward wine with a pleasing creamy texture.",88,Gersing 2015 Madrona Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"Schist, cola, cassis, berry and tobacco aroma cover all the bases in this wine. It's grippy and chewy but complete. Dark, earthy mulled berry flavors precede a tannic, pulpy finish with lasting plum and cassis notes. Drink through 2021.",90,Vall Llach 2014 Embruix Red (Priorat)
"Made from the native Pecorino grape that is being revived in central Italy, this wine offers aromas of white and yellow flowers accompanied by citrus notes. The palate delivers flavors of pineapple, tangerine peel, lemon zest and a hint of butterscotch.",86,Cantina Novelli 2012 Pecorino (Umbria)
"From vines planted to the west of Chablis, this is a soft, ripe and fruity wine. It has some tension from the minerality while keeping the white fruit flavors to the fore. Drink now or, better, from late 2016.",88,Domaine Céline et Frédéric Gueguen 2014  Bourgogne Côtes d’Auxerre
"Not yielding much now beyond hard tannins and primary fruit flavors of black currants that verge on raisins. But then, it's Petite Sirah, a known ager, and the acid-tannin balance suggests just that. Give it until 2012, at least.",88,Twisted Oak 2006 Petite Sirah (Calaveras County)
"The Brunate cru, with denser soils, is known for meatier, more structured wines. This Barolo offers elegance, power and complexity with lingering aromas of exotic spice, black fruit and root beer. It's also exceptionally bright and lively in the mouth and would pair with a hearty wintery dish such as beef Bourguignon.",91,Francesco Rinaldi 2006 Le Brunate  (Barolo)
"Made from Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc grown in the warm Happy Canyon region of the valley, this shows the greatness of the 2007 vintage. It's ready to drink, bearing soft, gentle tannins that frame flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, chocolate, vanilla and sweet, smoky oak.",92,Happy Canyon Vineyard 2007 Barrack Brand Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Aromas of leafy underbrush, toast and menthol lead the nose. On the palate, notes of licorice and grilled herb accent the core of dried red berry. Assertive tannins provide the backbone but still need to unwind. Drink after 2018.",88,Marchesato degli Aleramici 2010  Brunello di Montalcino
"With its strong initial impression of dryness, this is obviously a structured wine. It is dense, rich and concentrated with fine tannins, spice and a strong orange-zest character. Refreshing acidity gives a lift to this ripe, full wine. Drink from 2019.",93,Clos Haut-Peyraguey 2011  Sauternes
"Here's an easy-drinking, inexpensive rosé that's perfect for summer occasions. Made from an unusual blend of Sangiovese, Zinfandel, Carignan and Grenache, it's dryish, crisp and clean, with berry and spice flavors.",85,Bonterra 2009 Rosé (Mendocino County)
"Very rich, one of the more exotic Pinot Grigios on the market. Shows the variety's crispness and citrus, pear, floral, and spice flavors, with the honeyed creaminess of a barrel-fermented Chardonnay.",88,Terlato 2008 Pinot Grigio (Russian River Valley)
"Savory aromas of cumin, leather and oak mix well with floral berry scents. Tannic and firm in the mouth, this delivers earthy blackberry, leather and baked flavors. This is calm and dense on the finish, with integrated but grabby tannins. Drink through 2022.",91,Pingón 2011 Altamimbre  (Ribera del Duero)
"Spicy saffron and pollen notes add a savory warmth to sweet honey and lemon aromas on this gorgeously complex auslese. It's gingerly and bright on the palate, with tangerine acidity that highlights flavors of sweet peach preserves and jasmine tea. The finish lingers on and on and on.",94,August Kesseler 2011 Lorcher Schlossberg Auslese Goldkapsel Riesling (Rheingau)
"A simple but easy-to-drink Chardonnay with soft aromas and flavors of ripe red apple and pear. Medium weight with a solid, clean finish.",84,Barton & Guestier 2007 Bistro Chardonnay (Vin de Pays d'Oc)
"Rich, tannic and full bodied, with black cherry jam, red currant, raisin and spice flavors that are penetrating and long. It's a heady wine that's high in alcohol—drink now with grilled beef or chicken slathered in barbecue sauce.",88,De Loach 2010 OFS Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"Another new Rosenblum release and as usual, there is a sweet, sugary edge to the cherries, blackberries and chocolate, although very high acidity helps keep the mouthfeel lively. The official alcohol is 14.8%, but there is something ruby Porty going on.",86,Rosenblum 2005 Maggie's Reserve Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley)
"Ripe in color and aromas, this chunky wine delivers heavy baked-berry and raisin aromas in front of a jammy, extracted palate. Raisin and cooked berry flavors finish plump, with earthy notes.",85,Balduzzi 2012 Reserva Merlot (Maule Valley)
"The notes of orange peel, white pepper and seaweed come off as disjointed, though the flavors are light and tart.",83,Spangler 2010 Syrah (Southern Oregon)
"This wine opens with a lovely fragrance of violet, iris, wild berry, licorice and a whiff of leather. The smooth palate doles out ripe wild cherry, cinnamon, clove, white pepper, tobacco and anise. It's impeccably balanced, with glossy tannins and fresh acidity. Already drinking beautifully, it will also age well for several years.",93,Albino Rocca 2012 Ovello Vigna Loreto  (Barbaresco)
"Red fruit, sucking candy and milk chocolate cover the bouquet, but the palate is sharp and raw, with spiky, semisour raspberry and cherry flavors. There isn't much to this wine. It's sharp, edgy, elastic and lean. On the plus side, it's clean.",82,Tempra Tantrum 2006 See Red Tempranillo-Shiraz (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"Thin for Cabernet fruit, yet forceful as far as its tannins are concerned, this stiff and chalky wine will show better with hearty food, such as a beef stew. You'll find flavors of cherry candy and espresso grounds, along with a light touch of chocolate-covered orange peel, but a green edge to the tannins is the final impression.",86,Silvan Ridge 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rogue Valley)
"Fresh, tangy and medium bodied, this wine has crisp apple and peach flavors and a mouthcleansing texture.",86,Fount NV Batch No 01 Rosé (California)
"Smoky, dark, bold and full of black fruit aromas along with barrel notes and a lemony accent. For Prieto Picudo, this is clean, decidedly not funky and lush, with blackberry, spice and barrel resin. Finishes bacony and rich, but not fat or heavy; drink this year and next.",89,Dominio Dostares 2008 Estay Prieto Picudo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)
"While this foamy rosé is not elevated, it should appeal to those who like sweet Moscato bubblies. Candied flavors of raspberry, lychee and dried mango finish with a note of pineapple syrup.",85,Tussock Jumper 2013 Moscato Rosé (Valencia)
"Concentrated fruit aromas, deep fruit flavors and a supportive, nicely astringent mouthfeel give this wine a great sense of structure and depth. It balances generosity with a bit of reserve in a traditional way that's very appealing. Best through 2020.",91,Borjón 2013 Complejo Barbera (Amador County)
"The private wine label of consulting enologist Stefano Chioccioli, Altadonna is a relatively new line. This expression is redolent of lemon, lime, green apple and honeydew.",87,Altadonna 2011 Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie)
"Textured and mineral, this crisp wine has some lively acidity as well as raspberry fruitiness. It's totally ready for the summer.",85,Quinta do Casal Branco 2013 Terra de Lobos Rosé (Tejo)
"Sourced from vines planted 45 years ago, this ripe and floral wine offers classically varietal scents of flowers, while flavors recall pear and peach. The length and detail are excellent.",90,Pacific Rim 2013 Hahn Hill Vineyard Chenin Blanc (Yakima Valley)
"Heavy aromas of raisin, oak and chocolate are copied on the palate that tastes of oak, vanilla and raisiny fruit. It has a woody finish.",85,Bodegas Riojanas 2014 Viña Albina Crianza  (Rioja)
"This begins with earthy, meaty, slightly smoky aromas. Moderate plum and pepper flavors convey a savory character rather than a fruity one, and the wine has a smooth texture. It starts out interesting and complex, and then closes down on the palate and finish.",83,Matchbook 2011 Syrah (Dunnigan Hills)
"This is a delicate, aromatic wine that's light as a feather. It has crisp citrus flavors along with notes of apricot and berries, along with a pure line in acidity. The aftertaste is pure refreshment.",86,Domaine François Schmitt 2012 Riesling (Alsace)
"The cool Sonoma Coast appellation is not known for Bordeaux blends, especially in cool vintages like 2010. This blend of Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon is ripe with raspberries and oak, but there's a tart bit of acidity. Its taut and elegant in style, but lacks generosity. Drink now.",87,Kastania 2010 Proprietor's Blend Red (Sonoma Coast)
"Accented with lime notes, this tart, young Pinot is dry and complex. Flavors of sour-cherry candy, pomegranate and persimmon are deliciously ripe, yet marked with acidity. Astringent tannins suggest two or three years in the cellar.",88,Kastania 2010 Proprietor's Reserve Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This has restrained aromas of char, cassis, spice and asparagus. It's light to medium in body, and it bears fine, polished tannins. A note of cherry marks the warm finish.",83,Vivác Winery 2008 Diavolo Red (New Mexico)
"A pretty good wine, with blackberry, cherry and currant flavors, and some smoky oak. Nice and dry, with smooth tannins, it's a decent sipper.",84,Arrow Creek 2008 Coastal Series Meritage (California)
"Classic aromas of rose, red berry and a balsamic note lead the way. The structured, savory palate offers up sour cherry, chopped herb, white pepper and clove framed in youthfully assertive but refined tannins that need to unwind. Drink 2017–2027.",90,Carlo Giacosa 2012 Montefico  (Barbaresco)
"Petit Manseng, found in the deep southwest, lends itself so beautifully to sweet botrytized wines. With its beautiful apricot and mango flavors, filled with honey and spice, this is a wine that is both light and rich. The acidity gives the wine a lift at the end.",91,Vignobles Brumont 2009 Château Bouscassé Vendemiaire  (Pacherenc du Vic Bilh)
"Here's an easygoing red wine from Puglia with sharp tones of forest berry and bramble backed by red apple, raisins and a touch of cinnamon. The wine is nervous and slightly bitter in the mouth with flavors that recall sour cherries.",85,L'Astore Masseria 2008 Filimei Negroamaro (Salento)
"A pure citrus-flavored wine, this is refreshing and light. Its crispness will soften over the next few months, but drink now for the forward fruitiness.",84,Vignerons de Tutiac 2016 Carrelet d'Estuaire  (Bordeaux Blanc)
"Fruity in blackberry and dark cherry with a meaty undercurrent, Heritage blends 47% Barbera with 22% Petite Sirah, 18% Alicante Bouschet and 13% Carignane. Meaty and brisk in acidity, it has a brightness to it traditionally inspired field blends don't often have, amidst a core of power and follow-through. This is a great Lodi wine.",89,Borra 2010 Heritage Field Blend Red (Lodi)
"Richness and ripeness combine with a multilayered and tannic texture that frames the flavors, massages the palate and carries the expressive fruit character through a lingering finish. Ripe blackberries and raspberries accompany a subtle vein of spice and mineral flavors that add complexity.",90,Borjón 2012 Reposado Barbera (Amador County)
"Tight blueberry, hot blacktop and a flash of purple flowers combine for an earth-driven nose on this wine from a hot region in southern Monterey County. The flavors are quite distinctive, with barely ripe mulberries, cedar-edged blackberries, sandalwood shavings and a touch of graphite.",92,Quinta Cruz 2012 Pierce Ranch Tempranillo (San Antonio Valley)
"Although light, this well-balanced wine has good depth. A dry core of tannins backs up the bright red berry and black currant fruits. Acidity and the tannins promise some aging, although the wine is drinkable now.",87,Producta Vignobles 2011 Mission St Vincent Réserve  (Bordeaux)
"Winemaker Sabrine Rodems lays on exciting aromas of light pomegranate juice decorated by toasted sagebrush, charred fennel, pan-toasted peppercorns, graphite and pine ash. The herb-driven, very fragrant chaparral-like flavors show pine needles, rosemary, chemise and bay leaf against a cranberry juice background.",93,Wrath 2012 Tondre Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Ruby red in the glass, this bottling shows bright cranberry and boysenberry on the nose with a hint of rose petals. There is decent tension to the sip, where tart plum skins meet with graphite flavors.",87,Kessler-Haak 2016 Rose of Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills)
"With some sweetness, this is a fruity, juicy wine that's tasting very young at this stage. It's fragrant with a light touch of white currants and spice and a dominant presence of acidity.",88,Anton Bauer 2011 Alte Reben Riesling (Wagram-Donauland)
"Delicate and pretty hints of lemongrass, light cement and lime rinds show on the nose of this bottling. There is a distinct racy quality to the sip, where grassy flavors meet with strong lime and tart pear skins, all hinged to a very grippy texture.",89,Bernardus 2015 Griva Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Arroyo Seco)
"A blend of Cabernet Franc (35%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (18%) with the rest equal parts Merlot and Petit Verdot, this wine offers brooding notes of herbs, black currant, mineral and flowers. The lighter color belies its rich structure of firm tannins and tart, lively acids that merit time in the cellar to be fully appreciated. Best after 2018 but will be well worth the wait.",93,Cadence 2011 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red (Red Mountain)
"Dry and succulent, this brings tangy flavors of rhubarb and raspberry into focus. It's made for picnic foods—could anything be better with fried chicken? This is widely available and scores a bullseye if your target is a summer sipper.",89,Acrobat 2016 Rosé of Rosé (Oregon)
"This fragrant, foaming dessert wine opens with aromas of yellow stone fruit, chopped herb and a floral note of jasmine. The rich, bright palate doles out apricot, yellow peach, grilled sage and candied nectarine zest alongside a delicate mousse and fresh acidity.",89,Michele Chiarlo 2015  Moscato d'Asti
"Dry and elegant, this Pinot has a Central Coast feeling, with a pale color and brisk acidity. The cherry, cola, spice and oak flavors seem a little simple now, but that could be deceiving, as years in the cellar might benefit.",87,Williams Selyem 2005 Vista Verde Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Benito County)
"Plummy and chocolaty in profile, this medium- to full-bodied sparkling Shiraz remains surprisingly refreshing on the long, dusty finish. It makes for a crowd-pleasing introduction to the style.",89,The Black Chook NV The Chook Sparkling Shiraz (South Australia)
"The new oak on this Pinot Noir dominates now with aromas and flavors of buttered toast and caramel. But underneath all that is a wine rich with raspberries, cherries, red licorice and mocha, and balanced with vital acidity. Give it a few years to let everything integrate.",91,Black Kite 2011 Soberanes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"There's an almost effervescent feel to this Sangiovese-based wine, which has small percentages of Merlot and Colorino in the blend. It is redolent of cherry cola, almond paste, raspberry and toasted nut.",86,L'Oca Ciuca 2009  Chianti
"The nose is rather closed but reveals whiffs of dark-skinned fruit. The diluted palate offers raw, red cherry alongside fleeting tannins.",83,Feudi del Pisciotto 2012 Giambattista Valli  (Cerasuolo di Vittoria)
"Screams Carneros. Fleshy, jammy fruit flavors of cherries, strawberries and raspberries are highlighted by good acidity and drink very dry, with soft but complex tannins. It's not a simple wine, and has enough stuffing to cellar for a few years.",89,Signorello 2000 Las Amigas Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"The term Vintner's Select, which is unregulated, can be abused. Here it really means something, as this is the winery's top cuvée—an excellent effort that spent 18 months in oak. There's extra depth in the cherry and cassis fruit, packing a powerful, compact punch all the way through a long, polished finish.",94,Arbor Brook 2014 Vintner's Select Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"The top range of wines from this highly rated cooperative is called Sanet Valentin, after the patron saint of lovers. This Sauvignon is crisp, herbaceous and very fresh, with light layers of mouth-watering acidity.",87,San Michele Eppan 2002 Sanct Valentin Sauvignon Blanc (Alto Adige)
"This Syrah is just too high in alcohol. Nearing 16% abv, it's as hot as a chili pepper. Some wines can handle that. As it's slender in flavor, it can't handle the heat. The addition of some Monterey County fruit adds acidity and freshness.",82,Hug 2010 el Chico Syrah (Central Coast)
"Aromas of blackberry jam, stewed plum, raisin, roasted coffee bean and fig carry over to the palate along with a note of clove and orange zest. Fine-grained tannins and zesty acidity provide a firm elegant structure. Drink 2018–2024.",90,Dirupi 2014  Sforzato di Valtellina
"An impressive and concentrated wine that brings out tannins as well as the fine perfumes that lie at the heart of a Touriga Nacional. It is certainly dense with blackberry and black plum fruits giving a juicy side to the young tannins. As it develops, the wine will show elegance while remaining super-rich and opulent. Drink from 2018.",90,Adega Mãe 2013 Touriga Nacional (Lisboa)
"Fruity and simple, this easy wine has flavors of cassis, cherries, blackberries, cola, licorice and pepper. It has the weight and dryness of a nice Merlot.",84,Praxis 2005 Lagrein (Central Coast)
"Firmly smoky, strong wood-aged texture gives a solid structure. However, the wine has some juicy acidity that allows a fresher side to show through. At the end, though, the firm tannins dominate. Give this wine time and drink from 2020.",89,Château le Pape 2012  Pessac-Léognan
"Delicious notions of ripe greengages haunt the nose, alongside fragrant orange peel. The palate is still taut and tight, sprightly and streamlined, as if powered and propelled forward by invisible citrus force. There is such drive and precision here, you almost feel movement and speed. The finish is clean but clearly this is for the longer run. It will take bottle age for this to reveal its scented, fruit-laden core. Drink 2022–2040.",95,Bründlmayer 2015 Steinmassel Reserve Riesling (Kamptal)
"This is a robust, full-bodied and sultry wine, one within the producer's single-vineyard series, from a well-known and respected site.

"Woody, creamy aromas of black fruits precede a sketchy palate with acidity akin to vinegar. Medicinal flavors of oak, mint and generic berry fruits finish with a pasty feel and herbal, oaky flavors.",84,G7 2013 The 7th Generation Reserva Carmenère (Loncomilla Valley)
"Hints of fresh mint leaves highlight the brooding black currant and dark fruit aromas. The balance of Cabernet and Merlot has been successfully achieved, as the wine is beautifully structured with a firm backbone of ample tannins and a rich, supple mouthfeel.",86,Barons Edmund Benjamin de Rothschild 2003 Kosher  (Haut-Médoc)
"A very creamy nose hovers over a herb-spiced apple palate, the nutty oak flavors are still obvious and will take a little time to become subdued, but the fruity, savory core of this wine is built to last and presents an unusual but dependable, friendly and durable counterpoint to all manner of foods. Don't miss this individualistic treat which was fermented on its skins.",93,Ingrid Groiss 2013 Gemischter Satz Herr Bernhardt White (Niederösterreich)
"The tartness in this wine veers slightly sour, with the acidity dialed perhaps a notch too high. Herb and salt intermix to give a more savory character, with a freshness to the finish.",84,Uptick Vineyards 2011 Estate Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Deemed “The Imaginary One,” this bottling shows a combination of spice and fruit on the nose, with gingersnap, red berry and strawberry aromas. There's woody complexity on the crisp and clean palate, with cedar, incense, sandalwood, star anise and clove set against a red berry and fruit-punch frame.",90,Vie Winery 2012 L'Imaginaire Grenache (Santa Barbara County)

"Not showing well now due to tough, gritty tannins and unintegrated fruit and oak flavors that taste jammy sweet in raspberries, cherries and mocha, like a little fruit pastry. All the parts seem to be there to age. Try towards 2011.",87,Stolpman 2007 Estate Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)
"A bit sharp and green in tannins, this nevertheless provides plenty of cherry, blackberry, black pepper and baking spice flavors to pair with barbecue. The blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Zinfandel.",85,Kendall-Jackson 2009 Summation Red (California)
"Earthy aromas of dried plum, baking spices, chocolate and cassis are impressive. A crisp, snappy, almost tomatoey palate with lightly herbal flavors of tomato sauce, vanilla and spicy red plum make sense for a Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah blend. A steady finish offers no drastic detours. Drink through 2019.",90,Finca La Estacada 2011 Secua Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"This expresses the greatness of its vintage and vineyard, offering wave after wave of raspberry and cherry pie flavors, plus notes of red currant, sweet licorice, spicy Dr. Pepper and smoky sandalwood. There's also something exotically briary and wild that intrigues. Even more remarkable is the texture, an amalgam of acids and tannins that rivals any Pinot Noir ever produced in California. It should age for up to 20 years.",99,Williams Selyem 2010 Hirsch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This is an easy-drinking style, attractive in aromas of peach, pineapple, pressed yellow flowers, and butter that flow right into a light- to medium-weighted palate. A slightly chalky texture with more tropical fruit flavors carry to a spicy, vegetal finish. Drink now.",89,Shoofly 2015 Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)

"Aromas of apricot and nectarine carry over to the palate along with lemon drop, yellow peach and pineapple. It's round and ripe with a slightly sweet midpalate, but fresh acidity gives a clean, fresh finish.",86,Tommasi 2013 Poggio al Tufo Vermentino (Toscana)
"If you know San Pedro's Elqui Syrahs, then this should seem familiar. Particular aromas of tea, herbs, grilled meat, stewed plum and horse are what we've come to expect from this wine. Flavors of herbal stewy plum and cured meat finish heavy, creamy and warm.",87,San Pedro 2012 1865 Limited Edition Syrah (Elqui Valley)

Gravenstein apple and pear dominate in flavor, adding to the overall succulence and success of this wine.",91,Foppiano 2015 Della's Block Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)

"This is an attractively fruity wine, crisp, full of red currant flavors and with a tight, tannic edge. Still young, it is dominated by acidity that needs to calm down. Give the wine until mid- or late 2015.",84,Louis Tête 2013  Coteaux Bourguignons
"There's a strong fruit component to this Brunello that adds to the general softness and plushness of its cheerful personality. Blueberry, raspberry and fresh cherry are backed by subtle touches of smoke and moist pipe tobacco. Espresso and chocolate appear on the close and the acidity is not too sharp.",90,Villa I Cipressi 2008  Brunello di Montalcino
"This opens with aromas of leather, black fruit, spice and balsamic herbs along with earthy notes. The palate delivers black cherry flavors accented with notes of vanilla, cinnamon. espresso and a hint of grilled herbs. However, it's evolved with a short finish, so enjoy soon.",87,Renieri 2009  Brunello di Montalcino

"From older vines on the producer's estate, this wine has a depth of richness to the nose and is intensely powerful in gingerbread and Meyer lemon on the medium-bodied palate. Lemony acidity rounds out the finish, flecked in butter.",90,Kunde 2014 Reserve Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley)
"Inky black in hue, this dry, full-bodied wine has hard tannins and a sweet black-currant flavor, which makes it a great selection to pair with steak. If you drink it now, give it a few hours of decanting.",88,Kokomo 2010 Malbec (Chalk Hill)
"A bit on the green, feline side, but with enough lemon and lime and sweet oak influences to give it richness. The acidity is wonderful, like biting into a fresh Granny Smith apple.",85,Frei Brothers 2007 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley)
"After many years of singing the praises of Muga's rosé, this vintage seems lacking and sour. The nose is short and quiet, while the palate delivers lean, citric flavors and a sharp, scouring finish. Whets the whistle, but doesn't put a smile on your face.",83,Muga 2008 Rosé (Rioja)
"This wine comes from three vineyards that sit atop a dry, ancient riverbed. The nose mixes sour cherry and toasted vanilla bean with scents of ginger and turned earth, while a soft mouthfeel frames flavors of cherry cola and beet juice.",92,Mercy 2012 Riverbed Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco)

It comes together seamlessly in a twist of structured blackberry, leathery tannin and tomato leaf, priced to be enjoyed by many.",90,Jax 2014 Y3 Taureau Red (Napa Valley)

"Made from 98% Cabernet Sauvignon, with no Merlot or Cabernet Franc for the first time, the '05 Rubicon tastes bigger and more impenetrable than any previous vintage. It's thick and heavy at this time, with furry tannins and undeniably ripe flavors of blackberries, black currants, cherries, violets, chocolate and cedar, and a tang of melted minerals. Desperately needs time in the cellar. Nowhere near ready for at least four years, and that may be conservative. Tasted three times, and better each time, a seriously good sign, and potentially a perfect wine.",96,Rubicon Estate 2005 Rubicon Red (Rutherford)
"Consulting winemaker Michel Rolland oversees this bottling in the Long Shadows series. Fans of his forward, sometimes voluptuous style may find this vintage a bit thin. The fruit is peppery and the tannins chewy, while the barrel flavors of chocolaty oak have not quite assimilated. Further bottle age might improve the wine.",89,Pedestal 2011 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Sweet and mildly candied on the bouquet, and then it clamps down firmly in the mouth with hard Cabernet tannins and lightly herbal, candied flavors of medicinal black cherry. Decent but not special; finishes sticky and candied.",84,Bodegas Navarro López 2009 Rojo Granrojo Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"A blend of fruit from Weinbau, Ciel du Cheval, Lady Hawk, Champoux and Obelisco vineyards, this is clearly Cabernet with its aromas of milk chocolate, herbs, vanilla, dark coffee and cherry. Flavors are rich yet supple, with a finish that lingers.",90,Januik 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Seems like its best days are behind it. That said, there's still some fire in the hole and kick to this South American PG. Pineapple is the lead aroma and flavor, with pink grapefruit and passion fruit sitting in reserve. Has flow but is starting to fall apart.",83,Tango Sur 2006 Pinot Grigio (Mendoza)
"You can taste the chilliness of the vintage in two ways in this elegant, dry wine. It's very acidic, and it's also a little green, with a minty edge to the strawberries and raspberries. Drink up.",86,Dunstan 2010 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Soft, dainty scents of pressed sweet pea, white raspberry and cherry dance in the bouquet, while pithy citrus and cherry-skin flavors unfold on the palate. The midpalate shows a touch of roundness, but brisk acidity and a slight bitterness lifts the close. Drink now.",86,Villa des Anges 2014 Old Vines Rosé (Pays d'Oc)
"Distant aromas of melon, lemon and apricot are subtle and fail to stir the pot. This feels weighty, with pithy flavors of peach, papaya and melon. On the finish, flavors of white pepper and bitterness take over.",84,Bodegas Fariña 2011 Third Generation Dama de Toro Malvasia (Toro)
"This stunning wine opens with classic Nebbiolo aromas of underbrush, new leather, blue flower and dark berry along with a whiff of menthol. The radiant savory palate delivers juicy Marasca cherry, crushed raspberry, clove and star anise framed in noble tannins and bright acidity. It's tempting now but will continue to unwind and develop complexity for years to come. Drink 2023–2043.",95,Pio Cesare 2013  Barolo
"This dry, spicy, solidly tannic wine is still young. Its fruit, still hidden behind the structure, promises ripe plums and berries. For now, it's impressively powerful, with layer upon layer of chocolate and coffee marked with bright acidity on the finish. Drink from 2016.",92,Fiuza 2011 Premium Touriga Nacional-Cabernet Sauvignon (Tejo)
"Structured and sophisticated, it offers creamy green apple, pear, citrus and white peach sensations. The juicy fruit palate is restrained by subtle notes of white pepper and mineral alongside fresh acidity that leaves a focused, lingering finish.",90,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano 2012 Anger Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige)
"Soupy, gritty aromas of herbal blackberry and olive show a touch of brandied cherry. The palate on this warm-vintage Syrah feels chunky and a touch stewed, while ripe, jammy dark-berry flavors hold onto an herbal, stewy note of tomato and oregano. Other than showing heat, the finish is in tune.",86,Viña Casablanca 2012 Nimbus Single Vineyard Syrah (Casablanca Valley)
Spun sugar scents lead into a wine with modest fruit flavors. The mouthfeel and finish are a touch dilute.,82,Valley View 2006 Anna Maria Cabernet Sauvignon (Applegate Valley)
"Made entirely with the native grape Bombino Nero, this informal light-bodied wine has subdued aromas of wild cherry and a hint of crushed herb. The aromas carry over to the über-simple palate along with a hint of pink grapefruit.",84,Rivera 2016 Rosé (Castel del Monte)
"Coffee, purple fruit and barrel-spice aromas lead to full-feeling blueberry and huckleberry-pie flavors. This wine offers a lot of immediate appeal.",88,Murray 2013 Syrah (Red Mountain)
"Very powerful, very strong, almost overwhelming in the sheer wealth of fruit and oak, but balanced with acidity. Winemaker Bob Cabral himself calls it “concentrated.” It detonates on the palate with an almost dessert wine quality of lemons, pineapples, honey, vanilla and minerals, but it's totally dry. Will hold for perhaps six years.",95,Williams Selyem 2007 Hawk Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"An appealing ripe strawberry nose leads on this flirty, easy-drinking sparkling wine from South Africa. Freshness and a touch of delicate minerality in the aromas, followed by light, elegant flavors of strawberry and yeast, make it a lovely wine for a summer day or to pair with myriad dishes. Creamy but fresh on the tongue, the wine has good body for a rosé. Imported by GBW, LLC.",87,Graham Beck 2005 Brut Rosé  (Western Cape)
"Sharp in raisin skin bitterness, this dry, dull wine has overripe cherry flavors, and is quite tannic. Lacks opulence and interest.",81,Fenestra 2007 Estate Mourvèdre (Livermore Valley)
"A delicious Sauvignon Blanc, really fine. It showcases how well this cool little corner of Monterey County, with its stony soils, ripens white wines. Brisk in acidity and laden with minerals, it offers rich flavors of citrus fruits, white flowers, white currants and spices.",90,Deep Sea 2009 Coquina Sauvignon Blanc (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"Give this young Pinot 3–4 years to begin to develop, and possibly far longer before the fruit fades away. Right now, it's tannic and closed, despite sweet, ripe cherry, raspberry and cola flavors. It shows firm acidity and a fine jacket of oak that has not yet been integrated with the fruit. So intense and powerful, it's hard to believe the alcohol is a low 13.2% by volume.",92,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2010 Great Oak Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Los Gatos-based Testarossa is building a powerful reputation as a single-vineyard specialist, but this more accessibly priced cuvée from Monterey County rivals their best efforts. There is nuttiness, brioche and slightly sour orange on the nose, followed by a very soft mouthfeel, with flavors of pound cake, vanilla cookie, peach cobbler and candied grapefruit.",92,Testarossa 2012 Cuvée Los Gatos Chardonnay (Monterey County)
"This is tasty in a ripe, extravagantly fruity way. Raspberry and strawberry aromas seem as sweet as syrup. The full body and alcoholic strength give it a strong texture, but without too much tannic grip. Barbecued ribs or a cheese plate could be great matches.",90,Four Vines 2012 Maverick Zinfandel (Amador County)
"This ripe, deliciously fruity wine has red plum and black currant fruits along with fragrant acidity and a gently tannic structure. It will be ready to drink from 2017. Canadian David Curl purchased Moya in 2008; Damien Landouar is the winery director. The vineyard was certified organic in 2013.",87,Château Moya 2012  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux
"Dark red in color, there's an intense—for lack of a better word—grapy quality to this rustic wine. Kirsch and orange highlight the experience, before a faint structure falls short on the finish.",84,Corkscrew 2013 Rosé of Syrah (Sonoma Coast)
"A pleasing shade of pale pink, this is a very austere bottling, with just faint touches of raspberry and tangerine on the nose. There is more light-red fruit and a hint of bubblegum on the palate, which offers decent tannic tension.",86,Ponte 2016 Pas Doux Rosé (Temecula)
"Tart lemon and green apple make this a refreshing quaff, followed by creamy, weightier overtones of papaya and pear. Well-integrated and enjoyable, it has tannin presence and structure, finishing with a backbeat of fennel.",88,Rutherford Hill 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Toasted oak, roasted coffee bean, dill and espresso aromas lead the nose on this Tuscan red. On the palate, notes of exotic spice accent the core of dried black cherry alongside drying but fleeting tannins. It lacks fruit richness and is shy on freshness so drink sooner rather than later.",86,Baldetti Alfonso 2011 Crano Syrah (Cortona)
"A superbly rich wine, with its acidity well integrated into the concentrated and rounded fruit. It has great texture and fruit that bursts from the glass. It is generous, warm and toasty, while also preserving the steeliness that is hallmark of the Les Clos vineyard. Age for at least five years.",95,Domaine Christian Moreau Père et Fils 2009 Clos des Hospices Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis)
The wine is concentrated with tannins that come from both the firm fruit and the wood aging. It is packed with blackberry flavors that come through the structure strongly. The velvet texture (that is just a hint at the moment) is going to bring out the richness of this wine produced with consultation from Michel Rolland. Drink from 2024.,94,Château Léoville Poyferré 2014  Saint-Julien
"Vines planted between 900 and 1,200 feet above sea level give this cool interpretation of Pinot Noir. The wine is crisp, lightly structured with some tannins and with a delicate cherry and red-berry fruitiness. It will be ready to drink from 2017.",87,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2014  Hautes Côtes de Nuits
"While the wine is fresh, it also has a bitter, cheesy character that is more funky than fruity. The acidity is very present, giving a crisp edge. Drink now.",83,Domaine Pral 2014 Les Pays de Pierres Dorées  (Beaujolais Blanc)
"A fascinating blend of five varieties, this solid, black wine shows structure, dense tannins, an enticing perfume and big, ripe fruits. The finish has acidity, but also those powerful tannins. Age for 4–5 years.",92,Campolargo 2008 Rol de Coisas Antigas Red (Bairrada)
"This Sauvignon Blanc is neutral on the nose except for a smack of lime. Mild on the palate, this tastes of briny, salty citrus fruits and peels. A fresh finish confirms that this is straightforward but enjoyable.",85,Santa Rita 2016 120 Reserva Especial Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley)
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot is soft, with berry, cocoa and spice flavors. Drink it with summer barbecue and enjoy.",85,Tower 15 2009 The Swell Red (Paso Robles)
"Pretty aromas suggest violet, rose, strawberry and mint. The vibrant palate offers red cherry, crushed raspberry and cinnamon alongside supple tannins and bright acidity. Enjoy through 2017.",89,Ca' del Baio 2012 Nebbiolo (Langhe)
"Pieropan's basic Soave Classico offers refreshing aromas of stone fruit, honeysuckle, grapefruit and lime. The wine is light and crisp with tonic acidity on the close and an easy, direct approach.",87,Pieropan 2007  Soave Classico
"This offers a surprisingly savory look at this sun-drenched appellation, with aromas of smoke, mineral and Kalamata olives. The cherry flavors are full bodied with a palate-coating, slightly tacky feel that smooths out over time.",91,Efeste 2012 Ceidleigh Syrah (Red Mountain)
"This is a tight and compact expression of Barolo with some meaty, earthy aromas at the back of berry fruit, cola and dried herbs. There is a lighter, more feminine side to the bouquet that is successfully contrasted against the bolder, thicker feel this wine imparts in the mouth.",91,Ciabot Berton 2007 Roggeri  (Barolo)
"This stands out for its overall richness and generosity. It reveals layers of jammy fruit, blackberry, spice, teriyaki sauce, ginger and dried herb. There's a cheerful touch of sweetness that is buffered by the wine's natural thickness and intensity.",92,Castellani Michele & Figli 2008 Colle Christi Collezione Ca' del Pipa  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"From Familia Bressia, this Brut Nature smells like a cross between a frosted doughnut and dried tropical fruits. In the mouth, this is citric in feel, with tart, almost sour flavors of orange along with the peel. A tangy citric finish ends with lingering grapefruit and orange notes.",87,Sylvestra 2015 Brut Nature Rosé  (Mendoza)
"This wine is spicy, ripe and ready to drink. Ripe white stone fruits are laced with citrus acidity to give a lively wine with good fruit intensity. Drink this wine now for instant pleasure.",88,Château Pilet 2016  Bordeaux Blanc
"There's a ripe and opulent quality that gives the wine loads of intensity and consistency. The purity of the fruit is excellent, and the finish reveals nicely integrated acidity.",89,Feudo Montoni 2010 Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"Sugary sweet and simple, like an apricot, orange and mango fruit juice drink. The alcohol lends body and warmth.",85,Francis Coppola 2011 Diamond Collection Pinot Grigio (California)
"Floral aromas lead into a rich, not quite dry wine that is beautifully ripe and perfumed. It is rounded and opulent while preserving the steely, mineral texture. Still young, it demands aging. Drink from 2017.",92,Domaine Zinck 2011 Pfersigberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"Heavy and seemingly sweet, this has the taste of black raspberry syrup and melted red licorice.",85,Testarossa 2010 Cuvée 107 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
"Made entirely from Grenache, this wine is a pretty pale-salmon color. It drinks off dry, with strawberry flavors and well-balanced acidity, showing some warmth on the finish.",87,Mercer 2014 Spice Cabinet Vineyard Rosé (Horse Heaven Hills)
"This opulent wine opens with a blast of buttered toast and tropical fruit aromas. The flavors are complex, with swirls of pineapple, pear, yeast, toast and cinnamon. Drink now–2015.",92,Martinelli 2009 Charles Ranch Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"This blend of 42% Syrah, 31% Petite Sirah, 20% Zinfandel and 7% Grenache from the Templeton Gap area shows aromas of grape soda, pencil lead, sweet violets and effervescent cola, all fun yet elegantly restrained. Blueberry, black pepper and fresh purple fruit combine for a very lively wine, with strong acidity on the palate.",91,Guyomar 2011 Laity Red (Paso Robles)
"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this stunning elegant wine is initially closed but then blooms in the glass to reveal red berry, iron, blue flower, underbrush and dark spice. The focused, radiant palate delivers bright cherry, star anise, white pepper and mineral alongside vibrant acidity and polished tannins. A hint of orange zest graces the lingering finish. Hold for more complexity. Drink 2018–2028.",95,Fontodi 2013 Dino Sangiovese (Colli della Toscana Centrale)
"This is a 50-50 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah from Coombsville. It's dense with tannins, but they're very finely woven, and the wine has a gentle grace. The flavors of blackberries are pristine and ripe, and accompanied by a new oak smokiness. Good as it is now, it will develop bottle complexity after 2016.",92,Black Cat 2010 Family Cuvée Red (Napa Valley)
"Rum-raisin cake comes to mind when smelling this robust, ripe wine that wears its intensity well. Fruit-forward with cherry and berry flavors, its texture is soft and luxuriously simple.",88,De Loach 2014 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"Earthy, loamy cherry and berry aromas are slightly oxidized. This has a regular, soda-like mouthfeel and not a lot of body. Dry, briny flavors of plum and cherry finish juicy and long.",87,Canals Canals NV Rosat Reserva Sparkling (Cava)
"Very ripe, dense and concentrated. Although it's totally dry, the wine shows massive, sweet flavors of blackberry and cherry fruit. Impresses for sheer power, as well as the length of finish. Cellar this youthful beauty for 6–7 years and see what it does.",94,Bennett Lane 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Smoky and crusty on the nose, but not that deep or dark in the mouth. The emphasis is on red fruits, freshness and pop, while the flavors are zesty and lean toward red cherry and red plum, with a spicy accent. Pepper and more spice work the finish.",88,Undurraga 2007 Sibaris Reserva Especial Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"Joe Dobbes was the winemaker for this Riesling, fashioning an intense and focused wine, with a bit of sweetness but ample acidity to balance it out. It's a deft combination of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon oil and a hint of mint, with impressive length and penetration.",93,South Stage 2013 Riesling (Rogue Valley)
"Everything about this stately Ribera heavyweight impresses. The nose is outright oaky, so expect derivative aromas of toast, clove, cinnamon and spice to go with black-fruit scents. This remains firm, tannic and tightly wrapped, with massive blackberry, chocolate and toast flavors. Peppery spice, brooding mixed-berry flavors and mouth-coating tannins endow a finish that signals that this has many good years ahead of it. Drink from 2018–2032.",96,García Figuero 2011 Tinus  (Ribera del Duero)
A young firmly tannic wine still influenced by its wood aging. The berry fruits are ripe and chunky with a licorice and nutmeg character. It needs aging over several years.,89,Borges 2009 Quinta da Soalheira Red (Douro)
"Lightly smoked stone fruit and apple blossoms greet the nose on this bottling of 50% Marsanne and 50% Grenache Blanc. The palate is much more interesting, with lemon sorbet and ripe apples clinging to a steely centerline that shows flashes of flint and gunmetal.",89,Two Moons 2013 Aporia White (Paso Robles)
"This smooth, creamy textured wine combines bright acidity with ripe apricot and pear flavors. It is already attractive in its freshness while also having a rounder character. Drink now.",86,Domaine Uby 2014 No. 3 Colombard-Ugni Blanc Colombard-Ugni Blanc (Côtes de Gascogne)
"Colorful and pretty to look at, but a little sweet. The nose has a sweet, maple syrup element along with dry berry fruit aromas. It's healthy and fresh in the mouth, with citrus, cranberry and raspberry flavors. Simple and nice for easy drinking.",86,Codorníu NV Anna de Codorniu Brut Rosé Sparkling (Cava)
"Textbook Russian River Pinot Noir, this is bone dry, elegant and lightly silky, with complex flavors of sour cherry candy, cola and sandalwood. Drink now–2015.",91,Windsor Oaks 2008 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This blend of 60% Petite Sirah, 21% Syrah, 7% Grenache, 6% Petit Verdot, 5% Tannat and 1% Viognier is tightly wound but likely to improve with time. Opened now, it offers elderberry, black currant, pencil lead and loam on the nose, with lava rock, crème de cassis and kirsch flavors slowing emerging on the palate.",90,MCV 2014 1105 Red (Paso Robles)
"This widely available Oregon Pinot Noir has lovely aromas of berry, cherry and rose petals. Ripe but not sweet, its tart, juicy fruit is wrapped in plenty of acid and punctuated with fresh herb, resin and peppery spice. Nicely blended and balanced, it's a quintessential food wine.",88,King Estate 2006 Signature Collection Pinot Noir (Oregon)
"For a lower-priced bottling, this is a fantastic wine, showing elderberry, black peppercorns and incense on a classic nose. Touches of asphalt, lavender, thyme and sagebrush show on the palate, spicing a core of elderberry and black cassis. Hints of white pepper complete the experience.",91,Larner 2014 Transverse Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"This is great fruit, sappy and loaded with bright, concise flavors of raspberry and pomegranate. Intense and juicy, this spicy and crisply defined wine shows great balance and detail, with just a hint of chocolate adorning the finish.",90,Saviah 2006 Syrah (Red Mountain)
"A very mineral, textured wine that has a dark fruit character. Acidity, spice, black plum skins and a solid structure all point to a wine that needs to age a few more months. Drink from 2014.",90,Campolargo 2010 Red (Dão)
"Slightly reduced, this wine offers a chalky, tannic backbone to an otherwise juicy explosion of rich black cherry, the whole accented throughout by firm oak and cigar box.",87,Louis M. Martini 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Very light in the glass, this bottling shows peach, melon, apple and key lime pith, which cuts through the riper elements. A simmering acidity is ever present on the sip, hewing the tropical guava flavors and providing a refreshing tension.",89,Rideau 2016 Viognier (Santa Ynez Valley)
"White blossoms and wet stone softly caress on the nose. The flavors are layered and compelling, starting on crisp green apple, honeydew melon and peach, folding into complexities of crushed stone, fennel and pollen. Well-balanced, fresh acidity and ample body lend to a long, evolving finish.",88,Barboursville Vineyards 2015 Reserve Viognier (Virginia)
"This easy wine will pair nicely with slightly sweet fare, such as sausage risotto, Chinese pork and chicken dishes, or a ham sandwich with Dijon mustard. It's crisp in acidity, with flavors of honey, apricots, lemons and limes.",86,Pech Merle 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley)
"This wine conveys a powerful sense of extraction and nuttiness, with aromas of caramelized nuts, marzipan, honey, toasted oak and even some marshmallow. It's quite quaffable on the palate—rich, nutty and honey-like, but with zesty acidity that wraps it all together.",90,Pali 2014 Huber Vineyard Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"An interesting, even eccentric Syrah that's really quite different from anything else out there. No mere fruit bomb, it's a meaty wine, in the sense of being chewy, but also in the aromas and flavors of both roasted and raw beef. That's not to mention the extraordinary blackberries and currants, dusted with a blast of freshly ground black pepper. First-class and unique.",94,Zepaltas 2006 Rosella's Vineyard Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"This is a fine, juicy and fruity wine. It has some firm, smoky tannins that are in the background. With its fruitiness, it is likely to be a wine that is ready to drink soon, certainly by 2017.",87,Château Donjon de Bruignac 2014  Bordeaux
"Too oaky, with dominating tastes of buttered toast that swamp the pineapple and orange fruit. The oak follows through in a sweet, caramelized finish.",83,Ca' Momi 2010 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"A wine that is hard right through, missing out on the fruit. It has a bitter extracted taste that brings out dark chocolate flavors. It's unlikely to soften much.",83,Château L'Argilus du Roi 2011  Saint-Estèphe
"Hot in high alcohol, with Port-like flavors of superripe currants and dark chocolate, finished with a raisinskin bitterness.",83,Wilson 2007 Carl's Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"This is rich, soft and vibrant in blackberry, blueberry jam and mocha flavors, which are wrapped into complex tannins, finishing dry and spicy. This shows superior pedigree.",92,Spring Mountain Vineyard 2009 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Light strawberry fruit carries an undertone of dried grass. It turns a little sour in the mouth, but it's fine for the price.",85,Rascal 2014 Pinot Noir (Oregon)
The wine is very fresh and fruity with lively red-berry flavors balanced delicately with light tannins and acidity. It's refreshing with a red currant aftertaste.,85,Domaine de Sulauze 2012 Liane Red (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence)
"Crisp lemon, apple and pear abound in this richly textured yet pertly balanced Pinot Blanc. It's an easy quaffing, elegant wine with hints of nut and toast that extend elegantly on the finish. Drink now through 2020.",88,Heron Hill 2015 Reserve Morris Vineyard Pinot Blanc (Finger Lakes)
"Ripe plum, coconut, vanilla and French oak aromas lead the nose. Youthfully assertive and austere, the palate offers toasted oak, licorice and espresso notes, set against a backdrop of bracing tannins that grip the finish. That structure should mellow and integrate with a few more years of bottle age.",90,Avignonesi 2012 Grandi Annate  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano)
"This is a dark, concentrated blend with minty oak, lactic aromas, boysenberry and blackberry on the bouquet. The palate is muscular and clampy, with resiny, oak-based grab to go with full tannins. Flavors of boyseberry, chocolate, toast and oak end in a warm, oaky finish. Drink now through 2016.",89,Ninquén 2011 Antu Mountain Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"Rose petal, violet, red berry, white pepper and eucalyptus scents meld together on this bright, structured expression of Nebbiolo. The linear, elegant palate doles out juicy red cherry, mint, aromatic herb and star anise while firm, polished tannins and fresh acidity provide the framework. It's already accessible but will also age gracefully over the next several years. Drink through 2024.",91,Cornarea 2012  Roero
"Here's a useful Syrah to generate some interest around a grilled steak or chop. It's rich in tannins and forwardly sweet in black cherry, blackberry, tobacco, leather, cinnamon and pepper flavors, and should develop for a few years.",87,Olson Ogden 2006 Unti Vineyard Syrah (Dry Creek Valley)
"A pale-pink color, this Syrah rosé brings aromas that start out a bit reduced. This is followed by notes of strawberry, apple, melon and herb. It drinks a hair off dry, with plentiful strawberry and cherry flavors. What it lacks in complexity it makes up for with easy-drinking appeal.",88,14 Hands 2016 Rosé (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Subdued aromas of red apple and melon are followed by a dry, medium-bodied palate with a tart, drawn-out finish.",86,Hogue 2014 Pinot Grigio (Columbia Valley (WA))
Light aromas of plum and spice are followed by cherry flavors that show pleasing purity. This is a delightful example of the variety.,90,William Grassie 2012 Petit Colline Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Black pepper dominates the aroma of this wine, along with black currants, grilled meat and something sweetly spicy and exotic, like a teriyaki dressing. In the mouth, it turns softly sweet and candied. Drink now.",85,Ortman Family 2005 Syrah (Paso Robles)
"Coming from one of the state's most esteemed Syrah vineyards, this wine opens with nuanced aromas of bacon fat, smoke and berry. The palate is rich and sumptuous, with fruit and savory flavors lingering on the finish.",89,Damsel 2014 Boushey Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This deliciously full-bodied and rich Chardonnay is unabashedly New World in style. From its caramel and tropical fruit aromas through its flavors of Golden Delicious apples, mango, vanilla and baking spices, it screams “Australia.” Best Buy.",90,Rothbury Estate 2001 Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia)
"Light in color and body, this is a silky Pinot Noir for everyday fare. It shows cola, cherry jam, persimmon and Asian spice flavors, with a coating of toasty oak.",86,Judd's Hill 2006 Estate Pinot Noir (Napa Valley)
"Clean and zesty, this is a nice cocktail sipper, with rich flavors of green apples, pineapples, peaches, apricots, vanilla and spice. The honeyed finish is brightened with crisp acidity.",85,Fetzer 2006 Pinot Grigio (California)
"As per usual, Purple Angel is a full-force experience. Hailing from a warm year, this is dense and purple in color, as it should be. Aromas of graphite, oak, tobacco and black fruit set up a jammy, full palate with saturated flavors of spice-laden blueberry and boysenberry. Finishing notes of tobacco, herb and oak cement this big-boned wine's ripe, beefy status. Drink through 2018.",92,Montes 2012 Purple Angel Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"This is a fleshy, voluptuous white, offering smooth, creamy texture around well-defined characteristics of melon, honeysuckle and peach.",88,Markham 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"While dry in style, this wine is chock full of ripe, rich yellow peach flavor accented with hints of dusty, floral potpourri and mineral tones. Its bold, expansive mouthfeel is penetrating on the palate, but cut with a line of lime acidity that lingers long on the finish. Delicious now, but its sharp edges and dark mineral tones should meld beautifully from 2019–2021.",91,Hermann J. Wiemer 2012 Reserve Dry Estate Bottled and Grown Riesling (Seneca Lake)
"Even grapier than the Cabernet Sauvignon, this forward, light, candied, confected wine has a hole in the middle. The tannins turn quite astringent, a marked contrast to the sweetness of the fruit.",84,Gilbert Cellars 2007 Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope)
"This Barbaresco opens with aromas of French oak, coconut, dark fruit and a dash of exotic spices. The firm palate offers cranberry, roasted coffee bean and oak-driven spice alongside bracing tannins that tightly grip the finish.",88,Ceretto 2013  Barbaresco
"A blast of rubber is the aromatic greeting, followed by herbal notes and leather. A sharp, tight, acidic palate proves difficult to penetrate, while crisp, herbal red-plum flavors finish green.",83,Emiliana 2011 Natura Merlot (Rapel Valley)
"Beautiful aromas of ripe red cherry and cherry blossoms mix with rose-laced potpourri, dust, cola and vanilla on the nose of this best-barrel bottling by Jim Clendenen, named after his daughter. Bright and zesty acidity grabs the palate's immediate attention, making the mouth water as flavors of tart cherry, rust, marinated olive and fig come forth, finishing in a very earthy way.",95,Au Bon Climat 2013 Isabelle Pinot Noir (California)
"A fine trio of vineyards—Boushey, Cold Creek and Sagemoor—comprise the blend here. The fruit runs the table from cherry to blackberry to cassis, threaded throughout with fresh herbs and clean earth. Good balance with no heat from the 14.7% alcohol; the tannins are polished and drying, and the finish has a soft, leathery smoothness.",91,Lachini 2007 Spur Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Here's a full and generous Barbaresco with tones of bold fruit, cola, leather, tobacco and cured meat. The alcohol adds to the overall muscle of this wine.",90,Vigin 2009 NonnOrlando  (Barbaresco)
"This is an upright, firm wine that's solidly based around dense tannins as well as ripe red fruits. It has a very dry core giving a concentrated texture that means the wine needs to age. Give it 4–5 years.",88,Manuel Olivier 2010  Pommard
"The third vintage of Mith is the best yet, composed of fruit from three top-notch Walla Walla vineyards. It's two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon and one third Syrah. The wine opens seductively with luscious blueberry, blackberry and black cherry fruit, wrapped in sexy layers of earth and herb. Whiffs of smoke lead into a silky smooth, chocolaty finish.",91,Balboa 2005 Mith Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Sweet cherry and baking vanilla aromas are followed by layers of plum, raspberry and spice in this kosher Bordeaux blend from Israel. The wine offers firm tannins and a lingering finish.",84,Agur 2007 Kessem Red (Judean Hills)
"This wine comes from the Guedes family's Carvalhais estate in the heart of the Dão. Only made in better vintages, this latest release is almost at its peak. It has smooth, ripe tannins with leather, spice and acidity rather than the primary fruits. That makes for a sophisticated, complex wine that will be ready to drink from late 2016.",94,Sogrape 2010 Quinta dos Carvalhais Reserva Red (Dão)
"Hints of black coffee, dried lavender and herb add punch to the lean plum and cherry flavors of this medium-bodied Cabernet Franc blend. Brisk on the palate, with an herbaceous, green note that persists, it finishes firm, with a chalky coating of tannins.",85,McGregor 2007 Rob Roy Red Red (Finger Lakes)
"Yellow flower, tropical fruit and an herbal note are delicate but still take center stage. Racy acidity supports the crisp apple, grapefruit and bitter almond flavors while the finish is crisp and clean.",87,Palagetto 2014  Vernaccia di San Gimignano
"A lovely wine whose most memorable and distinctive attributes are its dryness and high acidity, not to mention relatively low alcohol. These make it extremely food-friendly, and the citrus, wildflower and vanilla flavors will pair nicely with everything from pâté to a pear, and bitter green salad to pizza.",87,Greenwood Ridge 2007 Pinot Gris (Anderson Valley)
"Offers varietally correct flavors of black currants and hints of tobacco, but where's the structure and depth? A simple, fruity red for early drinking that would make a decent picnic wine or bar pour.",83,Concha y Toro 1999 Xplorador Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"This wine is somewhat flat and sweetly tropical, aged for six months in both neutral French oak and stainless steel. With 5% Viognier added to the blend, it lacks precision.",83,Zoetic Wines 2014 Grazioso Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley)
"A still closed note holds everything back; just a little earthiness shines through with the promise of ripe fruit. This is not about simple fruit, but texture and personality. Lemon zestiness plays on the lees-cushioned palate—and something tells me that this will not show its true but fascinating colors until at least 2017. Light-footed echoes of flavor are very promising.",93,Nikolaihof 2014 Im Weingebirge Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"There are edges of cocoa, pepper and curing spice to the dense red plum and cherry core of this attractive Syrah. Just a touch of gamy character throughout adds depth and intrigue. The rich fruit flavors continue on to the palate, with a texture like crushed satin and lingering notes of coffee, bittersweet chocolate and sweet spice.",88,Maison Nicolas Perrin 2014 Syrah (Vin de France)
"Rich wine, a blend dominated by the rare Rotgipfler and Zierfandler, with great ripe layers of tropical fruits, peach and spice, perfectly balanced with full acidity. Fred Loimer of the Kamptal also produces this Schellmann brand in the Thermenregion, with concentrated dense and deliciously ripe wines. Screw cap.",92,Loimer 2008 Schelllmann Gumpoldskirchen Cuvée White (Thermenregion)
"This robust, richly layered wine shows lemon chiffon and vanilla characteristics balanced by golden apple and pear undertones.",90,Materra Cunat Family Vineyards 2015 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Oak Knoll District)
"Full bodied and ripe, this Chardonnay is packed with yellow fruit and pear flavors, and it shows the steely, minerally character typical of Chablis. It has a youthful brightness on the finish, and it will fill out over the next few months.",89,Domaine Vrignaud 2011 Vieilles Vignes Fourchaume Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"This is stunningly rich in mouthfeel, texture and overall weight. Buttered, toasted nuts and creamy fruits coat the mouth. Oranges, apples and pears roll smoothly and seamlessly along the palate, with a juicy kick to the finish.",92,Roco 2014 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
"Oak, yellow apple and butterscotch aromas open on the nose. The structured palate offers toast, mineral, oak-driven spice and a confectionary note but it's shy on fruit richness. You'll also detect the warmth of alcohol on the close.",87,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano 2013 Sanct Valentin Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige)
"A unique dessert wine made from botrytized Sémillon that's then fortified and aged for an average of eight years in barrel, this is a dark, coffee-brown wine, with a hint of green to its rim. Aromas are slightly nutty and molasses-like, with raisiny, almost Muscat-like flavors. Full-bodied and rich, it finishes long and sticky.",90,De Bortoli NV Black Noble White (Australia)
"Currant, cola, spice and cherry lead this layered Cab from Delfosse. It's an approachable style but with added character: cinnamon spice, tobacco and black cherry on the palate is integrated and smooth. An elegant wine with ageable chops.",86,Delfosse 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Monticello)
"Light and chocolaty, this carries a strong and distinctive scent and flavor of cinnamon spice. On the palate, the flavors suggest strawberries, with a quick-to-fade finish.",85,Valley View 2008 Anna Maria Tempranillo (Applegate Valley)
"Named after the wife of the previous owner, this top cuvée from Château de Cénac is powered by its structure and dark tannins. The rich black berries and plums are still working through the dense texture. It's a complex wine, still showing its wood aging. Drink from 2017.",93,Château de Cénac 2012 Eulalie Malbec (Cahors)
"This has quite a bite with acidity and a strong cut of spirit. Flavors of dried raisins and sultana put it on the dry side of aged tawny. At the end, spice and the wood aging dominate this austere wine.",88,Ramos-Pinto NV RP 10 Quinta da Ervamoira 10-Years-Old Tawny  (Port)
"This is loaded with succulent black cherry, almond, tobacco and black pepper flavors. The dense fruit and round structure are balanced by vibrant acidity, making this perfect to pair with everything from cured meats to risotto.",89,Corteforte 2010 Podere Bertarole  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
"A ripe, golden selection, glowing with a just-ready-to-drink feeling. From a fine vintage, this is structured and complex, layering acidity with sweet, juicy fruits and an attractive touch of toast.",92,Gaston Chiquet 2004 Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne)
"A waft of smoky char and toasty oak provide a rich foundation and compelling entry into this one-acre vineyard-designate from the historic grower, before unleashing, slowly, a torrent of melon and fresh-cut apple with a length of intriguing nutmeg and cardamom. Medium-bodied and lush, it will remain on your palate memory a long time.",96,Rochioli 2014 Sweetwater Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Produced from Cabernet Sauvignon, this aromatic, crisp rosé has refreshing red-currant acidity and a light, lively character. Screwcap.",85,Château Suau 2011 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
"It's high in alcohol, but without it, this Zin just wouldn't be as good as it is. It's bone dry and full bodied, and the crushed black peppercorn, blackberry and licorice flavors have a roasty, toasty edge that makes the wine particularly savory.",90,Triumph Cellars 2011 Zinfandel (Napa Valley)
"Named for the Servite convent in the town of Borba, this fresh, crisp and tangy wine is citric, with almond and apple overtones. It's young, fruity and made for immediate consumption.",85,Adega Cooperativa de Borba 2015 Convento da Vila Branco White (Alentejano)
"Zesty on the nose and pulsing with white-fruit aromas, and that opening is backed by a spritzy, lively body that brings lemon-lime and soda-like flavors. Melony and green on the finish, and good overall in a simple, tropical sort of way.",85,Bodegas Fontana 2009 Mesta Macabeo-Moscatel (Uclés)
"Sumptuous notes of fresh, aromatic red cherries are central to this wine. They are joined by a sonorous, soft and mellow oak spice and texture and sprays of fresh white pepper. There are hints of iron oxide and an intensely brooding flavor of pure, black cherry at the very core. This draws you in and just makes you want to savor. Lovely now, this will come out of its shell with some bottle age. Drink 2016–2020.",93,Johanneshof Reinisch 2013 Frauenfeld St. Laurent (Thermenregion)
"Sourced largely from the Martin Stelling Vineyard, this is a supple, soft wine, with refined tannins. A zippy nose of rose and spice scents paves the way for more powerful leather saddle, cedar and black tea elements. Its fruit is wild and brambly, recalling blackberry and dark cherry with enviable succulence.",94,Far Niente 2014 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"The Cowgirl Cab, a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is DaMa's most popular offering. Loaded with bright, brambly berry fruits, licorice and loam, it's notable also for smooth, silky tannins.",90,DaMa 2007 Cowgirl Cab Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This opens with aromas of toasted oak, coffee, ripe berry, sage and a whiff of citrus zest. On the palate, white pepper and coconut back up the core of dried cherry alongside astringent tannins, but it lacks fruit richness.",86,Dante Rivetti 2010 Bricco di Neive Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"A wonderfully balanced wine, rich, rounded but showing off the crispness, the tightness of great Muscadet. There is a yeasty, creamy element here, from its 30 month's aging on the lees before bottling, but this just makes the crispness even more exciting.",93,Domaine Luneau-Papin 2001 Clos des Noëlles Excelsior  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"What a disappointment. This isn't the Artist Series it used to be. It's okay for an everyday Cab, but is simple, with watered-down blackberry and cherry jam flavors. Not ageable, so drink up.",85,Kenwood 2007 Artist Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"Auxerrois, a grape variety rarely seen in the United States, shows it's fresh white grapefruit and pear flavors well in this brisk, revitalizing wine. Dry in style, it's a zesty, straightforward wine intended for early consumption.",87,Frieden-Berg 2013 Nitteler Rochusfels Trocken Auxerrois (Mosel)
"On the nose, this smells a touch yeasty and bready, similar to Saltine crackers. The mouthfeel on this sparkling wine is crisp and right on. Slightly bitter white-fruit flavors come with a dusting of white pepper and a lingering lime note on the dry finish.",90,Castellroig 2011 Gran Reserva Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava)
"Raisin, kirsch and leather aromas define the nose on this crianza. The palate is properly dry, with good acidity and clampy tannins. Flavors of dry oak, herbal notes, raspberry and raisin end in a solid but slightly rough finish. This will go better with food than on its own.",88,Bodegas Valdemar 2007 Finca del Marquesado Crianza  (Rioja)
"Structure defines this wine. It has a great architecture of tannins, acids and oak, with a firm, dry finish. That stands it in stark relief to today's modern cult style of fruity softness, and to the wine's credit. It's Bordeaux-like, with cherry, currant, herb and cedar flavors, and should develop over the next decade. A winery to watch.",92,Alpha Omega 2005 Proprietary Red Wine Red (Napa Valley)
"Bland peach and melon aromas come in front of a flabby, creamy palate. Basic melon and papaya flavors are limited, with a slight bitterness lingering on a soft, fleshy finish.",83,Santa Alba 2013 Reserve Chardonnay (Maule Valley)
The floral aromas in this animated wine give way to fragrant fruit salad flavors that range from orange to pineapple to apple. It has a nicely tart texture and lingering fruity finish.,86,Enotria 2014 Uvaggio Isabella Arneis (Mendocino County)
"A shallot-skin-colored wine, this has ripe red berry fruits and a soft texture. It is attractively on the way to maturity, with hints of toast coming through the acidity and rounded character at the end. The wine is ready to drink.",89,Joseph Perrier 2005 Brut Rosé Vintage  (Champagne)
"Drinkable with just about anything that calls for red wine, it has currant, licorice and oak flavors.",83,Fog Head 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Four-plus years haven't helped to soften or sweeten this tough, herbal Cab. It's bone dry and lean, even austere in flavor, leaving the alcohol and powerful tannins to dominate.",83,Wellington 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"Rounded and ripe, this has yellow fruits along with a fresher, sliced apple character. The wine is fruity, perfumed and just touched by a more mineral texture, with crisp acidity that gives a ripe fruitiness. Drink from 2017.",88,Louis Latour 2013  Meursault
"Rich, spicy and deliciously fruity, it has tannins well cushioned by the ample blackberry flavors. Acidity preserves the wine's easy freshness, while it also has a dense texture. Drink now, but the wine will be richer in late 2014.",90,DFJ Vinhos 2012 Paxis Red (Lisboa)
"This barrel-fermented wine is a most pleasant quaffer. A mix of yellow apple and pink grapefruit flavors, along with some skin phenolics, power on through. It was fermented in 10% new oak, and a hint of that pops up in the finish, an impression of candied orange peel. Drink now through 2022.",88,Raptor Ridge 2015 Gran Moraine Vineyard Chardonnay
"This Barbera shows elegance and harmony with ripe berry notes that are offset by wood spice and mineral notes. The extraction is thick and dense and the wine yields a plush, smooth texture in the mouth with bitter berry nuances on the close.",91,Araldica 2007 Rive  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore)
"Minty, creamy and as oaky as can be. Coconut, sawdust, carob and other barrel-based aromas steal the nose, with secondary black fruit and thick tannins composing the palate. This is a ripped, high-alcohol, almost soupy Syrah that in some people's eye may seem overdone and too woody. But the fruit is of unquestionable high quality, and if you give it time to air out you'll get the best results.",90,Montes 2005 Folly Syrah (Apalta)
"Starts out with proprietary aromas of clove, spice and cinnamon, and in the mouth it's a tannic grabber with forcefulness as well as ripe, sweet, menthol-infused berry flavors. Falls off somewhat on the finish, where butter and candy come in. Heavy and dark but still good for a New World Syrah.",87,Viña La Rosa 2008 La Capitana Barrel Reserve Shiraz (Cachapoal Valley)
"Bright grapefruit and citric flavors give the wine a bright, floral character, punctuated by tight acidity. The wine has extreme mouthwatering freshness and a crisp aftertaste.",86,Quinta de Chocapalha 2008 Arinto (Estremadura)
"Structured and dark-hued, this powerful wine is dense with tannins as well as black cherry fruits. It is initially tough, but behind the solid exterior lies a warmer wine, full of delicious fruit waiting to come out. Drink from 2018.",90,Domaine de Bellene 2012 Vieilles Vignes  (Nuits-St.-Georges)
"Soft and ripe, this is an easy, fruity wine. It has red berries, gentle tannins and attractive acidity. It is just as enjoyable as an apéritif as with food and ready to drink now.",85,Château Cru de Verdun 2009  Médoc
"A mix of small lot-fermented, Horse Heaven Hills Cabernet Sauvignon, some from Champoux, it's fine-tuned, varietal, loaded with cassis and plum, light toast, and ground coffee. Elegant, proportionate, and a fine expression of a great vintage.",93,Reasons 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Here's a simple, brambly expression of Sangiovese Grosso, with bright acidity and lively notes of forest berry and moist earth. This wine has a smoky touch of toasted almond on the close.",85,Podere La Vigna 2009  Rosso di Montalcino
Sweet peach nectar and fragrant white flower open the nose of this lush Gewürztraminer. The wine feels slightly sweet and sticky on the palate with rich density and a waxy finish.,88,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano 2011 Sanct Valentin Gewürztraminer (Alto Adige)
"A dry, soft wine that depends on richness to get by, at the expense of structure. Raspberries, cherries, mocha, cinnamon and pepper are the flavors of this blend of Grenache, Syrah, Counoise and Mourvèdre.",86,Tablas Creek 2009 Cotes de Tablas Rouge Red (Paso Robles)
"Made from Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah, with slightly more of the former. It hinges on large swathes of barbecue smokiness and heaping grilled meat, with a baseline of licorice and vanilla-laced tannin that can sometimes overwhelm.",85,Ninety+ 2013 Super Cuvee Lot 95 Red (Napa Valley)
"A bit harsh in the mouth and soft, which emphasizes the extracted fruit and makes the wine taste syrupy in blackberries and licorice.",82,Clif Family 2006 The Climber Red (California)
"Lemony and strange at first, with gamy notes, leather and incense. The palate feels chunky and medicinal, with herbal, sweet, jumbled flavors of candied blackberry. Finishes flat and quick, leaving medicinal sweetness.",86,La Posta 2009 Angel Paulucci Vineyard Malbec (Mendoza)
"This pitch-dark, fully extracted Malbec from La Consulta in Mendoza's Uco Valley delivers blackberry, black pepper and brushy herbal aromas on what amounts to a massive, spot-on bouquet. Big, chewy and tannic on the palate, with earthy, roasted flavors of blackberry, prune, savory spices and raw oak, this finishes meaty, slightly salty and strong, with wild herb and black-fruit flavors. Drink through 2022.",94,Zuccardi 2012 Aluvional Malbec (La Consulta)
"Aube-based Jean Josselin specializes in Pinot Noir. This bottling has juicy raspberry flavor, bright acidity and a candied fruit aftertaste. Drink now.",84,Jean Josselin NV Audace Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Champagne)
"Riper notions of yellow plum and melon mingle with Grüner's attractive freshness, here expressed by lemon and lime zest flavors. The palate adds extra verve with a pleasantly bitter phenolic edge. This is a taut, clean, super-fruited textbook example of freshness with tons of verve.",92,Stift Göttweig 2015 Goettweiger Berg Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"A blend of 50% Malbec with Cabernet, Syrah and Merlot that's lightly minty and full of tobacco, pepper and spicy aromas. Feels a bit clampy and tannic, with oaky, herbal flavors of plum and sweet berry. Shows a hint of green and drying tannins on the finish.",89,Algodon 2008 Estate Blend Gran Reserva Red
"Produced from 52 acres of vines close to Cadillac, the wine is ripe, just hinting at a herbal character. Fresh lemon and apple fruit is crisp and light. It is a fruity wine that is ready to drink.",85,Château Haut Maurin 2015  Bordeaux Blanc
"The blend of this rich wine is dominated by Alvarinho, some of it from old vines. With its wonderful ripe fruit and layers of apricot and pear flavors, this is like no other Vinho Verde. That is except for that zingy acidity that gives the wine is refreshing fruitiness at the end. Drink now.",92,Casa do Valle 2015 Reserva Special Edition White (Vinho Verde)
"Made with Nero d'Avola and other grapes, all bush-trained, this opens with subdued aromas of dark berry and toast. The dense palate offers dried blackberry, oak-driven spice and a chocolate note alongside firm tannins. Drink sooner rather than later to capture the fruit flavors.",88,Zisola 2011 Doppiozeta Red (Noto)
"This 100% varietal wine is sourced from a certified sustainable and Biodynamic vineyard. It shines in its simplicity of bright strawberry, red licorice and farm dirt scents, imparting crisp acidity throughout.",90,Ampelos 2012 Ampelos Vineyard Delta Grenache (Sta. Rita Hills)
"A rounded wine, this has an attractive red-jelly flavor and light acidity. It is full and rich, with fine acids on the finish. Keep for six months.",86,Trenel Fils 2011  Côte de Brouilly
"Vigorous bubbles present a Pinot Noir-like nose of crushed rocks, Indian spice and sour earth on one of the best Central Coast sparklers of the vintage. The intriguing flavors center on pluot and nectarine flesh, with fringes of salinity, lemon juice, cardamom and even dashes of curry.",93,Goat Bubbles 2011 Sierra Madre Vineyard Crémant Sparkling (Santa Maria Valley)
"Tight and stalky wine, the black currant, spice and tobacco characters all pushed to the front. It has a severe, more mineral style that shows acidity as well as lean fruit.",85,Château Roubine 2011 Red (Côtes de Provence)
"An easy, gentle wine, soft and velvety in texture, offering jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries and oak. Earns extra points for dryness and a richly tannic structure.",88,Lyeth 2010 Meritage (Sonoma County)
"This is the most intractable of the winery's 2008 Pinot Noirs, holding back in the glass and showing plenty of grip and tannin. Tight and compact, with a distinctive black pepper scent, this wine needs more bottle age. With time, the score could certainly improve.",89,David Hill 2008 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Corbaia is a super Tuscan blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon that opens with intensity and bright fruit flavors. It boasts a soft, silky feel with a firm tannic bite followed by cassis, earth and wild mushroom. Very nice.",93,Castello di Bossi 2007 Corbaia Red (Toscana)
"Petite Sirah remains a curiosity in Oregon, and at such a low level of ripeness, this turns generic. Tart cranberry fruit remains herbal and thin as it hits a quick finish. The wine is well made, but lacks varietal punch and authenticity.",86,Folin Cellars 2011 Petite Sirah (Rogue Valley)
"This offers aromas of oak, coconut and roasted coffee bean that carry over to the palate along with a hint of dried black cherry and a confectionary note. It lacks the fruit richness needed to stand up to the oak while raspy tannins give it an astringent finish.",87,Alessandro Veglio 2011 Gattera  (Barolo)
"This wine is structured with red fruits. It has a thin texture, a metallic character that is less pleasant. It needs more weight and richness.",85,Domaine Pierre Guillemot 2014 Aux Gravains Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune)
"Under the same ownership as Château la Dominique in Saint-Émilion, Clément-Pichon has produced a richly juicy 2012. Firm structure underlies the generous fruits, while the acidity and the dry core of tannins promise good aging. Drink from 2017.",89,Château Clément-Pichon 2012  Haut-Médoc
"This new project by a former White House videographer recently enlisted Paul Hobbs as a consultant. The promise is already apparent in this wine, with aromas of cedar, cherry extract and pleasant green-pepper elements. Spicy black pepper leads the palate, which finds ripeness in black cherry and balance with leather and coffee.",91,Brave & Maiden 2011 Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Packaged in a very heavy glass bottle, this bright Ripasso opens with mature aromas of prune, raspberry, cherry and cassis. Tones of leather and tobacco fill in the rear and the wine is compact on the close with a touch of bitter almond.",87,Tinazzi 2008 Monterè Cà de' Rocchi  (Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso)
"Pinot Noir from Canada can often be quite delicate, but this is a full-bodied, even muscular effort. Toasty and tasty, it puts a pleasant roasted character upon ripe strawberry and cherry fruit. Tannins are substantial, along with some barrel flavors from nine months in French oak.",88,Mission Hill 2014 Reserve Pinot Noir (Okanagan Valley)
"This is a rich wine that is full of spicy aromatic fruit. It is classy and elegant while having some weight. Red fruits and orange zest are given a perfumed herbal edge from the Mourvèdre in the blend. This is real food wine, ready to drink.",91,Ravoire et Fils 2016 Domaine Mas Thérèse Rosé (Bandol)
"The aromas pop with notes of wet gravel, mineral, funk, olive tapenade and high-toned flowers. The flavors are palate coating yet light and restrained, with generous savory and umami flavors that draw out on the finish. It has a very pretty sense of texture and precision—all about elegance.",92,Reynvaan Family Vineyards 2013 In the Rocks Vineyard Estate Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"The scents of humus, spiced blackberry and char are deep, delineated and balanced. Fine-grained tannins and lifting acids unfurl across the poised palate, and the long finish concludes with black raspberry and vanilla notes.",88,North Gate 2011 Merlot (Virginia)
"Impressive for a $12 Old Vine Zin, this wine is spicy and full of pepper, much more savory than sweet with plenty of texture midpalate and decent length. Definitely full-bodied, it'll stand up to a plethora of rich foods and even age another couple of years.",88,Sobon Estate 2009 Old Vines Zinfandel (Amador County)
"A full wine with smoked meat, licorice and black-fruit jam aromas. The palate is healthy, snappy and tannic, with earthy, full-blast berry flavors that veer toward sweet raisin and syrup but then pull back before falling off the cliff. Saturated, dense and raisiny, but still very rich, real and rewarding.",89,Argie 2007 Andes Bonarda (Mendoza)
"Here's a good, sound Merlot that's fancy enough to serve with special fare. It's dry and rich in tannins, with oak-inspired black cherry, currant and pepper flavors. Easy to find, with 29,000 cases produced. The alcohol measures 16%.",87,Robert Mondavi 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"This blend of Garnacha, Marsellan and Syrah opens with a dark, inky, smoky nose that's full of lemony oak along with black-fruit aromas. It's hard as nails on the palate, with drilling tannins. Rubbery, herbal blackberry flavors end with burnt toast, rubbery accents and a briny aftertaste. Best from 2017–2022.",89,Angosto 2013 Almendros Red (Valencia)
"The wonderfully earthy touch of russet pear peel and the freshness of lemon and green apple all appear on the nose. On the beautifully dry incisive palate, the lemon shines through and takes over. This is bright, vivid and fresh but comes with a lovely earthy texture that grounds the soaring lemon freshness. The long finish once again features ripe but tart apple and green pear, but ends in lip-smacking pure lemon zest. Drink 2017–2030 at least.",94,Boeckel 2014 Wiebelsberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"Aromas of cherry, baking spices, cocoa and herbs are followed by dark fruit and vanilla flavors with a creamy feel. It's a bit oak-driven but overall it works.",88,Lone Birch 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley)
"Concentrated olallieberry and black plum meld with leather and lilac scents on the nose of this blend of 50% Mourvèdre, 33% Grenache and 17% Syrah. Round and ripe blueberry, black currant and kirsch-like fruits show on the palate, but floral aspects, grippy texture, peppery spice and vibrant acidity take it to the next level.",93,Jaffurs 2013 High Tide Red (Santa Barbara County)
"The nose is rather shy but eventually reveals aromas suggesting wet underbrush, wild herb, new leather and a hint of woodland berry. The slender palate is rather raw and diluted, offering hints of tart sour cherry and star anise alongside brisk acidity and angular tannins.",86,Fattoria dei Barbi 2014  Rosso di Montalcino
"Baked strawberries and red cherries pair deliciously with shaved nutmeg, vanilla and black tea leaves on the nose of this bottling. There is a strong black plum tang to the sip, which is decorated lavishly with thyme, bay leaf, rust and gravel—a very elegant expression overall.",93,Black Ridge 2013 Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Dominated by Touriga Nacional (70%), this is a dark-hued, beautifully perfumed wine. Still young and dense with tannins and very fresh black currant fruits, it is a wine that will develop slowly. The oak aging has smoothed the corners of the fruit, bringing out spice and enhancing the firm texture. Drink from 2018.",91,Rui Roboredo Madeira 2013 Quinta do Côa Reserva Red (Douro)
"Briny notes of oyster shell blend with spicy barrel notes and core apple aromas on the bouquet of this crisp, pure, minerally Chardonnay. Flavors of apple, quince, orange marmalade and minerals finish sturdy and secure.",89,Valentin Bianchi 2015 Famiglia Bianchi Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"Tart and snappy, the flavors of lime flesh and rind dominate. Some green pineapple pokes through, with crisp acidity underscoring the flavors. The wine was all stainless-steel fermented.",87,Rainstorm 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"Juicy white grapefruit and lime flavors penetrate throughout this juicy, off-dry Riesling. It's refreshing and quaffable yet elegantly structured, finishing moderately long on a lingering lime-pith note.",89,Louis Guntrum 2012 Nierstein Bergkirche Kabinett Riesling (Rheinhessen)
"A solid example of Coonawarra Cabernet, the 2008 Terra Rossa features a charming combination of cherry-cassis fruit and eucalypt with cigar box and vanilla. It's medium to full in body, with fine balance and a long finish. Drink now–2016.",88,Parker 2008 Coonawarra Estate Terra Rossa Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra)
"This is an immediately attractive and fruity wine. Bright acidity is rounded out by warm peach and pear flavors, with a mineral texture that will allow the wine to age. Drink now for the fruit, but it will be at its best from 2016.",90,Domaine du Haut Bourg 2013 Sur Lie  (Muscadet Côtes de Grandlieu)
"The nose already promises pleasure. Layers of grapefruit and mirabelle, lemon and tangerine, apple and honey present a series of contradictions—not to mention delicious flavors—creating immense and irresistible tension. This is only going to get better if you can refrain from drinking it all. Pure thrill and lots of concentrated, zesty promise.",95,Eichinger 2014 Heiligenstein Reserve Riesling (Kamptal)
"Alluring, inviting aromas of white flowers, melon and peach are pure as stream water. This feels round and juicy, with flavors of green herbs, lettuce, lime and orange. Tangerine notes carry the finish, which is linear and racy in feel before turning slightly pithy in flavor.",90,Pazo Pondal 2013 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Pronounced Kay-lee, this Red Mountain Syrah remains a bit tight and tannic, with hints of green tea in the finish. The fruit is tart and compact, with a nose of blueberry and brown sugar. Tannins are quite hard and slightly bitter; this will require some further cellaring.",90,Efeste 2007 Ceidleigh Syrah (Red Mountain)
"Initially rustic, this is likely to develop into a dry, firmly tannic wine. The acidity and red berry notes come together in balance, but it does need serious aging to develop fully. Drink from 2018.",88,João Teodosio Matos Barbosa 2009 Ninfa Escolha Red (Tejo)
"This wine captures the popular grapefruity, grassy style of the variety in a crisp, refreshing and flavorful way. Light to medium bodied and full of bracing acidity, it will be great with seafood or as a pre-dinner drink.",88,Guenoc 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County)
"Thick in decadent tannin accents and integrated oak, this wine also offers high-toned cassis and cranberry, with a touch of cedar lurking in the shadows. It finishes in a wash of leather and black pepper.",90,Pope Valley Winery 2012 Estate Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Textbook RRV Pinot Noir, a red wine for Cab and Merlot lovers who want to graduate to this great grape. Dry and full-bodied, it actually has some pronounced tannins, with currant and bitter cherry skin flavors and darker, complex notes of pine sap, balsamic and black pepper.",87,Russian Hill 2006 Estate Vineyards Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"A little watery, but it still conveys tropical fruit, lemon, pineapple and buttered toast flavors. The texture is creamy, and there's a lively spine of acidity.",84,Irony 2012 Chardonnay (California)
"There's a distinct floral streak to this lightly aromatic Chardonnay, which also has notes of apple and spice. Though it has 61 g/L residual sugar, it drinks dry with bitter notes on the finish.",84,Pine & Post 2010 Chardonnay (Washington)
"Light lemon and vanilla flavors and a creamy texture make this wine easy to drink. The body is on the light side, too, with soft acidity and a mouthfeel that's not too thick.",87,Michael Sullberg 2015 Reserve Lot 92 Chardonnay (California)
"Heavy handed in ripe fruit and oak, with a soft, sweet mouthfeel. Will appeal to fans of the tropical fruit and buttered toast style of Chardonnay.",84,Bargetto 2008 Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"This offers a distinctive take on Boushey fruit, with a lot of green tea in the tannins. The berry flavors take a back seat to the vineyard's distinctive highlights of earth, cured meat, and Rhône-like bacon fat.",91,JM Cellars 2007 Boushey Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"The texture is off, with hard and bitter tannins. The fruit also is quite ripe, with the black cherries veering into raisins. Oak sticks out in the form of sweet vanilla and toast. The result lacks harmony.",83,Burrell School Vineyards 2010 Estate Reserve Honor Roll Merlot (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"There's an inky, raw feel to this riserva (Sangiovese blended with tiny percentages of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot), followed by candied cherry and rum cake. It finishes sour and bitter.",85,La Castellina 2007 Squarcialupi Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"La Bambina is a fresh and easy-drinking Sicilian rosé (made from Nero d'Avola) that opens with a pretty peach-pink color and bright aromas of raspberry, white cherry and cassis. Try it with swordfish carpaccio.",86,Cantine Barbera 2010 La Bambina Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"This delicious wine from old Sémillon vines offers a hint of nuts and spice as well as crisp, clean fruit. It is lively with acidity as well as having a richer side. The wine will be just right from the end of 2017.",88,Château Haut Mouleyre 2016  Bordeaux Blanc
"This is nominally a step up from De Bortoli's dB Selection Petite Sirah, but this fresh, directly fruity wine doesn't seem to offer much beyond jammy fruit. It's medium-bodied, with a crisp finish and just a hint of tannic structure. Drink now–2012.",84,De Bortoli 2006 Deen de Bortoli Vat 1 Petite Sirah (South Eastern Australia)
"Aromas of wet stone, smoke and petrol seep evocatively into the sweet pineapple bouquet. The palate is dry but deeply concentrated with a ripe stone fruit character. Finishes briskly with a bracing lime juice acidity.",89,Keuka Lake Vineyards 2009 Falling Man Vineyard Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Dark chocolate and cedar merge easily on the nose of this medium- to full-bodied wine. Those dark, oaky elements are balanced by tart berries on the palate, enhanced by barrel char and oodles of soft tannins on the long finish. Drink now–2025.",91,Howard Park 2013 Scotsdale Cabernet Sauvignon (Great Southern)
"Ripe, brandied aromas of baked cherry and blackberry are heady and leathery upon airing. This shows raw tannins and scratchy acidity in front of traditional flavors: vanilla, oak, currant and raspberry. An oaky finish comes with vanilla, toast and chocolaty accents.",87,Viña Mayor 2010 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"A blend of wines from different vineyards in Pouilly, this powerful wine is concentrated, with tight minerality that demands further aging. Rich and packed with apples and green plums, it is a beautiful wine that will age well. Drink from 2018 at the earliest.",94,Pascal Jolivet 2014 Indigène  (Pouilly-Fumé)
"A tiny-production wine that is exuberantly brambly and wild, this has a bouquet of juicy black and red berries at its core. Balanced and elegant despite the generous palate, it has softened tannins and a thickness toward the finish. offering accents of black pepper and brown sugar.",93,Sequum 2012 Riverwash Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"Yeasty, briney and strange on the nose, this feels clunky, with oily citrus and nut-driven flavors. It's bitter on the finish, and it doesn't show much in the way of mouthfeel. A blend of Chardonnay and Macabeo.",82,Dominio de la Vega NV Artemayor Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava)
"This pure Cabernet Franc is perfumed and crisply fruity. It has balanced acidity as well as a soft, creamy character. Red-berry fruits go well with a citrus aftertaste. Drink now.",86,Gratien et Meyer NV Brut Rosé Cabernet Franc (Crémant de Loire)
"This wine is structured and concentrated, showing a tight character that is closed and firm. It has enough fruit for the future to show its potential richness. Concentrated, very mineral, the wine should not be drunk until 2017.",92,Henry Fessy 2013  Pouilly-Fuissé
"Scents of ripe dark-skinned berry, rose, iris and a balsamic note take shape in the glass. The juicy palate offers ripe black cherry, star anise, orange peel and grilled herb framed in tightly knit but refined tannins. A clove note backs up the finish.",93,Comm. G. B. Burlotto 2012  Barolo
"Nice and familiar for the variety, with common herbal, beefy, black fruit aromas followed by a chunky palate of blackberry, black cherry, mocha and herbs. Clean and solid on the finish, with 15% Cabernet in the blend.",86,Asunto de Vino 2008 Carmenère (Central Valley)
"Fontanafredda's Moscato d'Asti is a cut above its competitors, with intense orange, grape and pear aromas that lead into a palate of white grapes and ground cherries. The medium finish is intensely sweet but an underlying freshness saves it from being cloying. Drink with a plate of mixed fruit.",86,Fontanafredda 2007 Moncucco  (Moscato d'Asti)
"This Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend is from Jess Jackson-owned vineyards high above Alexander Valley. Made solidly in the modern style, it's very ripe, very soft, and extraordinarily rich in chocolate-infused cassis, cherry, date and violet flavors that are liberally treated with new oak. It's a delicious, seductive wine that should ride out the next 8 years with ease.",90,Legacy 2004 Red Wine Red (Alexander Valley)
"Waxy in mouthfeel and dark gold in color, this wine offers simple fresh lemon and green apple flavors, its finish expansive and full.",88,C R Graybehl 2015 Mounts Family Vineyard Grenache Blanc (Dry Creek Valley)
"The nose of this powerfully fruity yet dry Riesling packs a punch, with aromas of ripe pineapple, apricot and floral potpourri. The palate is dense with stone fruit, and a hint of red berry flavor, but finishes elegantly with sleek mineral tones.",92,Dr. Loosen 2011 Ürziger Würzgarten Alte Reben GG Trocken Riesling (Mosel)
"This could be Chardonnay, or any light white wine. Fruit flavors are apple and pear; there's lots of acidity. A simple, pleasant, everyday style.",85,Vin du Lac 2008 LEHM Pinot Gris (Chelan County)
"Minty plum and berry aromas are herbal but ripe, with a note of chocolate and black tea. This is lush and layered, with top-end mouthfeel and herbal, floral flavors of berry fruits and plum. A smooth, herbal tasting finish is the finale to a well-made, flavorful wine.",90,Siegel 2012 Single Vineyard Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"Rich and round, this attractive wine has generous tannins and equally generous fruit. Black currants shine with their acidity while the texture is firm and solid. This is a wine with a future; drink from 2016.",88,Château Roquefort 2012  Bordeaux
This lively fresh wine brings out the fruitiness of the blend rather than the tannins of the Syrah and Merlot. Citrus and red berry flavors are well integrated with the crisp acidity. Drink now.,86,Domaine Uby 2014 No. 8 Merlot-Syrah Syrah-Merlot (Côtes de Gascogne)
"Temecula Valley-based Brookside Winery makes this nonvintage blend, a combination of Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel and Petite Sirah. Moderately light in alcohol, it nonetheless imparts deep, dark fruit and a leathery juiciness, with Zin taking over on the finish.",84,Generation 7 NV Road to Morocco Red (Lodi)
"This wine puts jammy aromas, very ripe flavors, full body and deep, dark fruit flavors on a broad, soft texture.",87,Cuda Ridge Wines 2013 Melange d'Amis Reserve Red (Livermore Valley)
"Subtle notes of bramble, smoke and raspberry entice on the nose of this dry rosé. While delicate in concentration, its supple silken mouthfeel and yielding acidity are approachable and comforting. The finish is bright and clean. Drink now.",86,240 Days 2015 Rosé (Finger Lakes)
"The balance between wood aging and fruit is at its best in this wine. It shows plenty of red fruits filled out with raisins and nutmeg. As a contrast the wood aging has brought out a spicy, almond character. It is fresh, on the dry side for an aged tawny and, of course, ready to drink.",88,Quinta dos Murças NV 10 Anos Old Tawny  (Port)
"This lightweight wine combines herbal notes reminiscent of tomato and celery leaves with hints of white grapefruit. Finishes just a bit short, with vaguely peppery notes.",85,Lobster Reef 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Made to be approachable, this full-bodied red is juicy with black fruit and tart cherry flavors, with a savory side of gunpowder and tobacco. Firm, integrated tannins behave well in the background.",88,Starmont 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A good wine, comprised of fruit from vineyards scattered across Santa Barbara County. It's bone dry and crisp in acidity, and also pretty oaky. The underlying fruit flavors are of apricots and pears, with perhaps a touch of botrytis. Ready to drink now.",86,Gainey 2008 Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Full-bodied, lush and velvety, the 2006 Ben Schild Reserve is ready to drink now and over the next 8 years. Hints of espresso and black olive impart complexity to the plum and blueberry fruit, and a licorice note chimes in on the softly textured finish.",92,Schild Estate 2006 Ben Schild Reserve Shiraz (Barossa)
"This wine lives and breathes terroir, with the rock and wild herb character of the AVA and the vivid cherry fruit of the vineyard. It's beautifully proportioned, with a vein of cola, a toasty bouquet and a focused finish.",93,Owen Roe 2013 Sojourner Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Softened by 20% Merlot, this wine tastes of chocolate-covered clove and spicy dried herb, the robust layers of flavor cradled in toasted oak. Fresh and brooding, it offers forest pine, black currant and tobacco in a refined package of integrated tannin.",93,Somerston 2013 Deerhound Estate Grown Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley)
"The fruit is on the tart side, cranberries and raspberries, but the wine is fleshed out with plenty of vanilla oak, and fills the mouth with soft, seductive flavors. Well made and approachable, with some added interest from Carignane, Petite Sirah and Mourvèdre in the blend.",87,Sebastiani 1998 Old Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
"Minerally white-fruit aromas are clean but generic. In every way, this is a modest but solid Verdejo with proper acidity and overall balance. Briny citrus is the key flavor, while the finish holds form and tastes citrusy and a touch salty.",87,4R4U 2015 Verdejo (Rueda)
Whiffs of smoke and dark toast lend savoriness to this otherwise plush plummy Cabernet Sauvignon. Unctuous black plum and berry flavors are rich and yielding on the palate but finish with bold penetrating tannins.,87,Thirsty Owl Wine Company 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes)
"Tight in acidity and tannins now, but very complex, offering a range of cherry, tangerine zest, mushroom, cola and Indian spice flavors that swirl to a long finish. The mouthfeel is delicate, but the power is impressive. Drink now–2015.",93,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2007 Saralee's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Ripe berry aromas blend nicely with earthy leathery scents. With a full and easy palate, this generous Crianza delivers blackberry and chocolate flavors that veer toward raisin and prune, especially on the finish, which is lightly toasted and dense in feel. Drink through 2019.",91,Matarromera 2012 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"The oak flavoring overpowers, with smoky char, buttered toast, caramel and sweet vanilla dominating the pineapple and pear fruit.",83,Fetzer 2007 Valley Oaks Chardonnay (California)
"A tight, metallic streak runs vertically through this Cabernet. Deep cassis fruit, juicy acids and the mineral/metal signature of the vineyard combine in a well-structured wine with an extended finish.",93,Januik 2011 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"This is very pretty and enjoyable, with creamy peach, butterscotch and yellow rose notes. The wine has a lean, compact feel and a crisp, citrusy finish.",85,Perusini 2006 Ronchi di Gramogliano Ribolla Gialla (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"The 2006 Chertsey is a blend of 49% Cabernet Sauvignon, 47% Merlot, 4% Cabernet Franc and 100% French oak. The oak's vanilla and cedar notes provide a foundation for the wine's cassis and plum flavors, cosseting them in soft tannins. Drink now–2018.",91,Penley Estate 2006 Chertsey Red (Coonawarra)
"Very ripe and almost sweet in jammy, pie-filling cherries and raspberries, with a rich seasoning of cinnamon, brown sugar and cocoa. But it's technically dry, and has a crispness from fine Arroyo Seco acidity. Drink now.",87,J. Lohr 2007 Fog's Reach Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco)
"Rich and creamy, with fruit-forward flavors of pineapple jam, oranges, ripe peaches, vanilla and buttered toast. Crisp acidity gives balance and clean liveliness.",87,Dominican Oaks 2007 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"The grapes used for this estate-grown Cabernet are sourced from younger vines. Round and full, the wine seems to have spent a fair amount of time in barrel, showing pretty baking spices along with tangy fruit.",88,Crossfork Creek 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley)
"Savory whiffs of dried herbs, pine needles and dusty minerals open to a bright, delicately fruity palate of crisp tangerine and quince. Dry and spry, it offers brisk, cooling refreshment. Drink now–2017.",87,Keuka Lake Vineyards 2014 Estate Grown and Bottled Falling Man Vineyard Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"With its tangy acidity, touches of green peppercorns and edgy tannins, this is a rustic wine. Fortunately, it has a lot of blackberry and dark chocolate flavors, with that distinctive briary character of Dry Creek Zins. Drink now with roasted or grilled meats or a vegetarian lasagna.",87,Miro 2010 Piccetti Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"The point of this semisweet bottling is a little unclear, but it offers a beautifully rich nose of honeysuckle, buttercream, white peach, almond paste and flint. The palate is rich, creamy and quite sweet, with peach, melon and mango flavors. Consider it as a light dessert wine or a pairing for spicy foods.",88,Boekenoogen 2015 Late Harvest Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"A common thread among the 2015 Soléna Pinots is a stiff herbal beet flavor rather than fully ripe berry fruit. This tilts into cranberry and very tart raspberry, but finishes astringent and hard. Give it plenty of decanting (two or three hours) to help it open up.",88,Soléna 2015 Domaine Danielle Laurent Pinot Noir
"Aromas suggesting mature dark-skinned berry, French oak, leather, menthol and parched soil come together on this. The round, dense palate is already accessible, offering fleshy black cherry, licorice, cured meat and espresso alongside ripe, chewy tannins. Drink through 2021.",90,Parusso 2012 Mariondino  (Barolo)
"There's a tinge of herbaceous green stem amidst fresh apple and lemon aromas on this Sauvignon Blanc blended with 10% Albariño. Marked with nervous lime acidity, it's lean on the palate with a hint of lime-skin bitterness on the finish.",85,Billsboro 2012 Sawmill Creek Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Finger Lakes)
"A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 10% Petit Verdot, this opens with aromas of red currant, clove and toast. The structured, elegant palate doles out plum, sage and tobacco alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink 2017–2022.",91,Fattoria Le Pupille 2013 Saffredi  (Maremma Toscana)
"A spritzy wine, with strongly herbal flavors. There isn't much in the way of fruit, just stems and herbs and chalky tannins.",83,StoneCap 2011 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This luminous, golden Pinot Grigio offers loads of intensity in the form of peach, apricot, honeydew melon and white almond. The mouthfeel is smooth and thick, making this wine particularly well suited to sophisticated pasta dishes such as pumpkin-filled ravioli with crushed walnuts.",88,Valter Scarbolo 2008 Pinot Grigio (Friuli Grave)
"Aromas of graphite, subtle oak and ripe woodland berries carry over to the palate, along with notes of vanilla and espresso. It has an almost sugary-sweet finish. It's already extremely accessible so drink now.",86,San Giacomo 2012  Rosso di Montalcino
"Beautiful spice, oak and fruit aromas segue seamlessly into abundant, complex flavors reminiscent of cherries and chocolate in this superbly layered and velvet-textured wine. It has quite firm tannins but instead of biting they blend with the fruit acidity and full body for a sense of soft finesse. The blend is Tempranillo with 26% Petite Sirah and 23% Syrah.",91,Las Positas 2011 Estate Coccineous Red (Livermore Valley)
"Spring flowers, pear, peach and honey shape a luminous and bright Falanghina from the sunny Campania region. The wine has pulp and density and would pair well with Indian and Thai foods.",86,Villa Matilde 2007 Rocca dei Leoni Falanghina (Campania)
"Made from a blend of 80% Nero d'Avola and 20% Merlot, this hearty wine opens with aromas of underbrush, tobacco leaf, mature plum, bell pepper and black berry. The round palate offers notes of juicy blackberry, cocoa, vanilla and expresso.",89,Duca di Salaparuta 2010 Triskelè Red (Sicilia)
"Grapefruit and mint make for an interesting and attractive couple on the nose, while tart citrus and a bit of grass make up the flavor profile. It hails from Western Australia, and overall it gets the job done. On the down side, however, is a slight vinegar note.",87,Alkoomi 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Frankland River)
"Spicy, this full-bodied wine is tart in cherry and piquant in baking spices, able to retain a lively and fresh palate within the weightier proceedings. It has a brooding, brushy underbelly of forest-floor pine.",91,Nicholson Ranch 2014 Cactus Hill Estate Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Damp, rubbery aromas of berry fruits and cured meat amount to a weird ensemble. This is decidedly grabby on the palate, with salty, herbal plum flavors. A leafy, herbal, mildly green finish wraps up this kitchen-sink blend of Mencía and other grapes.",84,Adegas Moure 2013 Tradición Joven Red (Ribeira Sacra)
"Notes of anise and white blossoms perfume this gorgeously sheer Riesling. It's intensely sweet, bursting with honey, grapefruit and tangerine flavors, yet balanced neatly by high-toned acidity and a uniquely herbal flair.",93,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler 2015 Bernkasteler Badstube Beerenauslese Riesling (Mosel)
Lots of sharp acidity in this dry Nebbiolo. The tartness gives it a taste of sour cherry candy. Ready now.,84,Bernat 2008 Essence Nebbiolo (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Fresh and lightly fruity, it's crisp and fragrant. With great acidity and a touch of herbaceousness, it's ready to drink.",86,Château du Cros 2013  Bordeaux Blanc
"A delicious Cabernet loaded with black currant and plum complemented by hints of pepper and mocha. The medium body and appropriately gripping tannins give way to a solid, lingering finish, making this a suitable companion to most meat and game dishes.",86,Katlav 2005 Kosher Cabernet Sauvignon (Judean Hills)
"Lusty, rich and tannic, this rustic-chic Zin trades elegance and subtlety for sheer dynamic power. Its wild blackberry, cola and mulberry flavors tread the fine line between dry and off-dry, exploding in the mouth, then finishing in a scour of astringency.",87,Armida 2009 Tina's Block Maple Vineyards Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"Smoky plum and red-berry aromas come with a hint of latex. This is full in feel and generally well balanced, with dark plum and berry flavors that are earthy but not overly complex. It delivers a steady finish.",87,Rejadorada 2012 Tinto Roble  (Toro)
"The wine comes from a small, seven-acre property. This 2010 is structured with a mineral character and chewy tannins. It is well balanced; the blackberry fruit synchronizes well with the dry texture and fresh acidity. Age for 4–5 years.",90,Château Graves de Pez 2010  Saint-Estèphe
"This bottling, which is bolstered by 9% Malbec, 3% Merlot and 2% Carmenère, shows rounded black currant, blueberry, smoked beef and graphite on the nose. Soft tannins make for an elegant presentation, with heavy black-fruit flavors of crème de cassis and dark chocolate.",91,Niner 2014 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Ripe, juicy peach and pink grapefruit flavors are accented with subtle mineral tones on this easy drinking, yet noteworthy Riesling. Dry and full bodied in style, it's lushly textured, with a bristle of lemon-pith astringency on the finish.",88,Franzen 2011 Von Quarzit-Schiefer Riesling (Mosel)
"A bit of leather and barnyard marks this Cabernet Sauvignon's nose, but it does not mask the plum and black cherry notes. The finish is layered with dark chocolate and espresso flavors.",88,Mercer Canyons 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Lightly aromatic with notes of pear, spice, and a kiss of caramel. The small amounts of Viognier (9%) and Sémillon (2%) contribute to its medium bodied, viscous feel before leading to a tart, somewhat thin finish.",85,Original House Wine 2011 House Wine Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Zesty lemon, tangerine and orange aromas awaken the senses on the nose of this elegant dry Riesling. It's spry and lean on the palate but chock full of juicy tangerine and quince flavors. Zesty lime acidity and pleasantly bitter citrus pith notes linger on the finish. Drink now through 2021.",91,Prinz Salm 2015 Trocken Riesling (Nahe)
"There's nothing not to like about this affordable Spanish bubbly. The nose is a little candied and shy, but it's pleasant overall. The palate foams a bit more than a stately Cava might, but the flavors of pear, apple and grapefruit are honest. Fresh yet soft, simple and easygoing.",86,Freixenet NV Carta Nevada Brut Sparkling (Cava)
"This is a dark, rich, modern Cabernet. The nose oozes sweet aromas of coconut and vanilla along with creamy oak and blackberry. The palate is full and chunky in feel, with dark-fruit flavors accented by molasses and pepper. A chewy finish shows grip and lasting acidity.",91,Tapiz 2011 Alta Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"High alcohol, enormously ripe fruit and soft acidity make this wine taste sweet and syrupy. Not likely to evolve, so drink up.",84,Vina Robles 2008 Signature Estate Cuvée Petit Verdot (Paso Robles)
"This is a soft, smooth and ethereally light red wine, bright and fresh in cassis and a wild element of sage. As it develops in the glass, the rounded approachability adds seasonings of leather and cinnamon.",90,Judd's Hill 2012 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Smooth and spicy, this wine explodes in layers of cinnamon and clove dusted in sugary plum and black cherry, a powerful weight and degree of ripeness at its core. The finish is soft and lengthy in vanilla oak.",88,Terlato 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"The blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot and Malbec. Cab Sauv brings rich black currants, as well as thick tannins. Merlot adds softer notes of cherries and violets. The Malbec increases the tannins, along with notes of grilled meat bone that Syrah, with its peppery, beef-jerky meatiness, enhances. The result is a young, vigorous wine, dry and balanced in acidity. It may or may not age, but there's no reason not to decant it now and enjoy with grilled beefsteak.",91,Laird 2010 Jillian's Blend Red (Napa Valley)
"A both heady and leafy swirl of passion fruit adds a tropical touch to the nose. The palate brims with sweetness and zesty passion fruit and grapefruit spice. The flavors are intense and the palate is medium sweet, aptly countered by lemon and passion fruit. This strikes a lovely balance and gives tons and tons of fruit and flavor.",92,Joseph Fritsch 2016 Furstentum Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"This is a delicious rendition of the annual Claret blend. It includes all five Bordeaux grapes, and displays a generous burst of berries and cherries, followed with a swish of chocolate. The wine delivers the goods, mixing in darker fruits, coffee and licorice streaks, winding into a lightly herbal, tannic finish.",89,Robert Karl 2008 Claret (Horse Heaven Hills)
Ripe orange and plump stone fruits rise from the glass while subtle rose scents hover. The palate is fresh. There is enough acidity and a slightly bitter phenolic edge to frame the peach and orange fruit that is augmented by a little residual sweetness. The finish is off dry. Drink while flavors are fresh.,88,Cave du Roi Dagobert 2016 Découverte Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"You could describe this wine as linear and elongated. Everything about it seems to suggest length and longevity including its well-chiseled aromas of graphite, charcoal mineral, tar, licorice and black currant. It offers ash and smoke in the mouth but is not flat or tired. In fact, it tastes succulent, austere and important.",90,Rivetti Massimo 2005 Froi  (Barbaresco)
"This sparkler shows some distant sweetness and loads of fruity softness that comes forward as peach, nectarine and honeydew melon. It is a textbook example of an off-dry Prosecco Superiore that is perfect as an aperitivo wine.",88,Andreola 2012 Millesimato Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Portfolio is a full-on, five-grape, Bordeaux-style blend—half Merlot. Dark, dense and textural, it's loaded with blackberry and black cherry fruit, swathed in baking spices, cinnamon and mocha. The tannins are beautifully managed, and it should drink magnificently through the mid-2020s.",94,Laughing Stock 2014 Portfolio Red (Okanagan Valley)
"Aromas of hay, baked corn and honey suggest that this wine has lost or is fast losing its vitality. The palate is round and full, with honeyed, soft flavors of apple and grass. Finishes mushy, another indication that it's on its last legs.",83,Maniña 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley)
"Aromas of leather, underbrush, ripe red berry and eucalyptus lead the nose on this structured wine. The delicious palate delivers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, baking spice and savory herb alongside big, chewy tannins. It ends on a succulent note. Drink 2016–2024.",92,Tenimenti Famiglia Cavallero 2009 Bussia  (Barolo)
"Structured and dense, this wine revels in its tension and tight texture. While there are plenty of black fruits, the dry core of tannins and the rich, perfumed character show this wine's best quality. It is well balanced and ripe while guarding all the freshness of the vintage. Drink from 2022.",94,Château Angélus 2013  Saint-Émilion
Fleshy honeydew and berry notes verge on overripe in this medium-sweet Riesling. Its delicate body and easygoing tangerine-inflected palate are pleasant. It finishes on a slightly sour note. Drink now.,86,Dr. Heyden 2015 Oppenheimer Kabinett Riesling (Rheinhessen)
Creamy malty aromas of vanilla and baked berry fruits lead to an astringent palate with hard tannins. This Malbec tastes earthy and like baked berry fruits and coffee grounds. A grabby finish with clamping residual tannins makes for a rugged ending.,84,Viña La Fortuna 2013 Twelvestones Malbec (Lontué Valley)
"Tobacco aromas and tight tannins set the scene for a wine that is light and fresh, with tangy berry fruits.",83,Château de l'Orangerie 2007 Grand Classique  (Premieres Côtes de Bordeaux)
"Smells thin and sweaty-funky, with little flavor, except the heat of alcohol. Maybe there's a drop of cherries.",81,Russian Hill 2005 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This ruby-colored blend of Corvina and Sangiovese doesn't offer huge aromatic intensity, but it does deliver clean notes of cherry, dried fruit, spice and fresh tobacco leaf (it is aged in cherry wood casks). The wine imparts a sour note with nutty, earthy flavors on the finish.",86,Masi 2005 Serego Alighieri Possessioni Red (Rosso del Veronese)
"A spicy wine with plenty of cinnamon and cocoa scents and accents. Wild berry fruit is still firm and hard, overtaken by the inviting barrel flavors. Give it more bottle age or decant it for near-term drinking.",89,DiStefano 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a big, rich, thick young wine, impressive in sheer fruity extraction. Shows massive blackberry, currant, anise, black pepper and sandalwood flavors, with a bit of funk. The tannins are strong and refined. Could age well. Tasted three times, with inconsistent results.",88,World's End 2008 Wavelength Sugarloaf Mountain Vineyard Syrah-Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley)
Fresh apple blossom and pear aromas are pristine on the nose of this delicate Pinot Blanc. The palate is lemony and crisp but softened by hints of honey and a mouthwatering silkiness. Ready to consume now but should drink well through 2020.,90,Maximin Grünhäuser 2014 Pinot Blanc (Mosel)
"This Tuscan Sangiovese opens with flavors of cherry, blackberry and bold modern spice. It delivers bright acidity, balance and crispness, with a food-friendly personality.",88,San Polo 2010 Rubio Sangiovese (Toscana)
"From the aroma, this seems heavily wooded, but on the palate the wood spice is becoming well integrated with the dark berry fruits and mineral texture. It is certainly young. Already, though, the fruit is showing its potential richness. Give it 3–4 years.",91,Aveleda 2008 Follies Touriga Nacional-Cabernet Sauvignon (Beiras)
"Force Majeure and Ciel du Cheval are the sources for this pure, compelling Red Mountain Syrah. The complex aromatics shoot up a smorgasbord of cured meat, truffle and umami notes, leading into a crisp, racy palate with lovely blueberry-dominated fruit flavors. Aging in 500-liter puncheons smoothes it out while contributing just a hint of new toast.",95,Mark Ryan 2011 Wild Eyed Syrah (Red Mountain)
"Dusty mineral and herb tones lend complexity to the plush, sunny peach and apricot in this bristling semidry Riesling. It's juicy and plump yet revitalizing and fresh, marked by tangerine acidity and a lacy fringe of sugar that lingers on the finish. Drink now through 2025.",91,Von Schleinitz 2016 Apollo Feinherb Riesling (Mosel)
"Pale gold colored wine with a soft texture, light wood touches and ripe yellow fruits. The wine is rich, warm, opulent in character, open and fruity. A touch of texture brings out the acidity at the end.",91,Domaines Devillard 2011 Château de Chamirey La Mission Premier Cru  (Mercurey)
"Soft, billowy tannins buoy this wine's dense red fruit, accented with dried herb, cedar and pencil shaving flavors. Ripe and full bodied, its oak is integrated and quiet.",91,Patel 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This blend of Cabernet Franc (46%), Merlot (28%), Cabernet Sauvignon (17%) and Petit Verdot (9%) starts out brooding, with black cherry, herb, black currant, anise, and spice notes. The palate is rich and structured, loaded with dark fruit flavors and firm tannins. Give it some time to open up.",92,Cadence 2015 Coda Red (Red Mountain)
"The nose on this red blend from Hungary is so inviting with its balanced wave of warming spices, red berry and pepper. But on the palate, there's a note of hard cherry candy sweetness and tartness and a lack of overall dimension that keeps a good wine from being great.",83,Áldás 2005 Egri Bikavér Red (Eger)
"Lightly mineral in texture, this wine is perfumed and ripe, with both acidity and refreshing citrus fruits. These contrast with hints of yellow fruits that will show well as this develops into a bright and crisp wine. Drink from 2017.",90,Henri de Villamont 2014  Pouilly-Fuissé
"Green apple and lime aromas are well presented and clean. This has a citrusy feel to go with lime, passion fruit and grapefruit flavors. A mildly pithy and citric finish delivers plenty of youthful kick.",86,Viña Requingua 2014 Puerto Viejo Estate Bottled Single Vineyard Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Maule Valley)
"Pretty standard Chardonnay, with a creamy texture and oaky tropical fruit flavors. Not bad for the price, if you're in a Chard mood.",83,10Span 2012 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County)
"Nice complexity and vertical aromas of cola, licorice and cherry liqueur open the nose of this Riserva Barbaresco. The wine's aromatic characteristics are very much in line with classic Nebbiolo and there's a pungent or immediate quality as well. In the mouth, it shows dense, chewy consistency.",92,Orlando Abrigo 2006 Rongalio Meruzzano Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"This is a well-balanced Petite Sirah, with chewy but proportionate tannins, a broadly fruity, black cherry core and nuanced highlights of apricot. The finish does a quick fade.",86,J. Scott Cellars 2008 Petite Sirah (Rogue Valley)
"Firm in tannins, this Bordeaux blend was grown in the cooler Oak Knoll District of the valley. Along with the astringency, it shows very ripe, sweetly jammy flavors of black cherries, currants and licorice. Could improve with cellaring.",86,O'Brien 2005 Seduction Red (Napa Valley)
"This is an extremely aromatic and floral Sauvignon that delivers an intense bouquet of sage, exotic fruit and tomato leaf. It earns high marks for personality and good cheer and offers zesty lemon flavors on the finish.",86,Banear 2007 Tentazioni d'Aba Sauvignon (Friuli Grave)
"Herbaceous and brisk, this elegant, medium-bodied Cabernet perks up on the palate with its crisp red-fruit and acidity. Straightforward yet pleasantly accented with hints of violet and black coffee, it would pair well with a variety of earthy, fall braises.",85,Fulkerson 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes)
"This top-tier bottling from Steve Martell, which blends 62% Grenache with 29% Syrah, 5% Mourvèdre and 4% Petite Sirah, offers roasted coffee, charred black currant, burnt wood and baked earth aromas. The palate is tight and bright with flashy boysenberry and black raspberry flavors balanced by anise and sagebrush accents.",93,Kaleidos 2015 Praying Mantis Red (Paso Robles)
"At three-plus years, this Chard tastes soft and candied, with pineapple LifeSaver flavors.",83,Eagles Landing 2004 Private Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Structured, mineral and tense, this is a classic Pouilly Fuissé. It has lemon and crisp sliced white fruits, very linear in character with a bright, tight texture. The wine is young and could age until 2016.",86,Jaffelin 2013  Pouilly-Fuissé
"This is a good, sturdy wine with ample fruit flavors, a firm texture and full body. It is mouthfilling, ripe and easy to like.",88,Brutocao 2012 Contento Vineyard Estate Bottled Primitivo (Mendocino)
"Too strong and extracted in blackberry and cherry fruit, almost like pure jam, a sweet, candied impression that the caramel of new oak compounds. Feels like the winemaker tried too hard to make it flashy. Pretty good, but could use restraint and finesse.",87,Blue Rock 2009 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"The Deutz style, with its lilting, dancing mouthfeel, is well illustrated by this non-vintage cuvée. It is bright and fruity, with crisp apple and pear fruits and tight acidity. but showing some signs of good bottle aging as well.",89,Deutz NV Brut Classic  (Champagne)
"A terrific effort, this wine highlights the features that make Condrieu special. First is the incredible perfume, like honeyed stone fruit and mango. Second is the richness and texture of the wine, imparting great palate presence. Third is the vibrance of the finish, providing the counterweight to the wine's ripeness and weight. Drink it over the next few years.",93,Michel & Stéphane Ogier 2011 Les Vieilles Vignes de Jacques Vernay  (Condrieu)
"A Grenache-based Rhône blend, C'est Si Bon is good and very subtle. Like a Beaujolais, an earthy leather note emerges in between soft violet and raspberry tones. With a line of acidity, it's a fine wine for food.",87,Elyse 2008 C'est Si Bon Naggiar Vineyard Red (Sierra Foothills)
"This robust, one-dimensional wine delivers mature fruit sensations of stewed prune, fig and resin, along with oak extract, vanilla and espresso. The palate is sugary sweet but lacks fruit richness. Drying wood tannins leave an astringent finish.",86,Máté 2012  Rosso di Montalcino
"Jammy aromas are accented by hints of mint, animal hide and cinnamon. This feels wide, grabby and low in acidity. Rubbery flavors of baked plum, chocolate and baking spices finish flat.",83,Viña Bisquertt 2014 Petirrojo Reserva Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
Cavit is an important wine cooperative in northern Italy that is largely responsible for Pinot Grigio's immense popularity in the United States. This bottle shows easy tones of peach and citrus.,85,Cavit 2011 Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie)
"Creamy notes of tart red currant and crisp red apple perfume the nose. The palate adds to that a gentle, softening creaminess which mellows but does not seek to tame the exuberant freshness. This is lively and joyful, in a way that is mellow and brisk and the same time. The elegant mousse is enriching, the finish is of crisp red apple.",89,Digby Fine English NV Leander Pink Sparkling (England)
"Notes of baked-berry, herb and savory spice come together well on the bouquet. It feels chunky and round but lively, with plum and cassis flavors that carry an herbal, tomatoey shading. This is fresh and herbal enough so that you know it's Old World.",88,Torres 2008 Gran Coronas Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Penedès)
"Opening with aromas of barbecued meat, this soft Cab is all about ripe, meaty tannins and smoky oak over any suggestion of fruit, which is hidden among its cedar and tobacco-lined walls.",84,Peltier 2011 Peltier Station Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi)
"There's a touch of raisiny overripeness in this dry Syrah, not a lot, but just enough to confuse the palate. Other than that, the wine is as smooth as can be, with a chocolate and bitter cherry finish.",87,Burgess 2004 Syrah (Napa Valley)
"Exceedingly rich and sweet in blackberries, currants and chocolate, this Cab is also high in alcohol, but there's no heat. The glycerine-like sweetness is part of the enjoyable package. 100% new French oak is not out of balance, bringing sweet vanilla and toast to the package. Defines the Paso style of warmth, opulence and soft deliciousness.",93,Jada Vineyard & Winery 2010 Passing By Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Scents of sweet-cream butter, vanilla and stonefruit are enticing on the nose of this richly textured, medium-bodied wine. The palate boasts hints of sweet lemon curd and fresh apple, but the slightly-sour oak notes can be overwhelming.",85,Lucas Vineyards 2010 Dry Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"This has subdued aromas suggesting dark berry, a whiff of exotic spice and a slight balsamic note. It's rather light bodied and quite simple for Barolo, offering red cherry and a hint of star anise alongside bright acidity and palate-drying, somewhat fleeting, tannins. Drink through 2020.",87,CarlindePaolo 2013  Barolo
Fresh and inviting with assertive notes of pineapple and sweet citrus backed by fleshy pear and melon accents on the nose and mouth. The palate offers zippy acidity with a clean lift to the finish. Drink now.,87,Winery of Good Hope 2010 Unoaked Chardonnay (Western Cape)
"A fine vein of graphite extends through this bold yet refined Bordeaux-style red. It's robustly fruity, bursting with cranberry, red cherry and raspberry flavors, but enticingly savory as well, nuanced by hints of leather and balsamic vinegar. Dense tannins should smooth out between 2018 and 2020.",90,Benmarl 2014 Slate Hill Red (New York)
"This luminous Nebbiolo from the mountain vineyards of Valtellina opens with a pretty fragrance of rose petal, red berries, baking spice and a whiff of crushed rock. The understated palate delivers ripe wild cherry, cinnamon-spice, licorice and a mineral note alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2017.",88,Nera 2011 Grumello Tirso  (Valtellina Superiore)
"A blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Bianco, this has a delicate fragrance of white flower and orchard fruit. The vibrant palate offers yellow apple, citrus and a touch of mineral while crisp acidity provides the framework.",87,Marchesi de' Frescobaldi 2013 White (Pomino)
"Hearty black plums, smoked beef and violets meet with rust, crushed rocks and a little dried sage on the nose of Russell From's blend of 45% Grenache, 35% Syrah, 18% Mourvèdre and 2% Tannat. Intense and dark blueberry-blackberry fruit shows on the palate along with elegant herbs and spices, from bay leaf and thyme to powerful black pepper. This wine is an attention-grabber for sure.",95,Herman Story 2013 Casual Encounters Red (California)
"The poised, clean and lifted wild black-cherry fruit mixed with notions of cocoa forms the aromatic theme. A very elegant wine, with medium body and alluring depth, it's currently tight and held firmly by structured, ripe tannins, while the acidity is bright and refreshing. With its youthful primary fruit, this is charming, but even a year or two will make this more pretty than it is right now.",93,Anton Bauer 2011 Reserve Red (Wagram-Donauland)
"Stainless steel fermented and bone-dry, this leesy, creamy wine balances lime, lemon and grapefruit flavors. Those citrus notes roll through richer dried apricot tones and into a balanced, persistent finish. Drink now and over the next two years.",91,Abacela 2016 Viognier (Umpqua Valley)
"Marchesi Fumanelli delivers a spice-forward Amarone with great intensity and a broad, far-reaching approach. There are aromas of cherry, blackberry cardamom, cumin and cinnamon. The wine is slightly raw and very sweet in the mouth.",89,Marchesi Fumanelli 2003  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"Dark-skinned berry, leather, coffee and baking spice are some of the aromas you'll find on this solid red. The chewy palate doles out ripe black cherry, blackberry, cocoa and vanilla framed in robust tannins. Drink through 2018.",90,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano 2010 Sanct Valentin Lagrein (Alto Adige)
"Dark in color, with mineral, leather and balsamic notes. With 20% Garnacha, this wine spent six months in oak and it comes on like a saturated, beefy youngster with ripe, healthy plum and other black-fruit flavors. Lasting on the finish, with body and structure. The fact that it doesn't overreach is a virtue.",87,Heredad Ugarte 2006 Heredad Cosecha  (Rioja)
"Oaky toast and salty, firm acidity give this wine a flavor profile of lemon, apple and dried herb that's lengthy and full of complexity. Medium bodied, it finds balance between fruit flavors and a savory edge, remaining bright and rich on the palate.",91,Pride Mountain 2015 Vintner Select Cuvée Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"A dry, firm wine, with light fruits and a perfumed smoky character. It is developing in a dry, black currant, stalky style.",85,Château Grand-Maison 2008  Côtes de Bourg
"Although this Cab is very dry, it's a bit astringent, with hard, edgy tannins and blackberry fruit flavors that veer into raisins. At its best now, so drink up.",85,Huge Bear 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"A delicate, lacy style of Pinot Noir, with pretty rhubarb-like herbal shadings to the cranberry and strawberry fruit, extremely supple tannins and hints of cocoa and coffee on the abbreviated finish. Drink now.",86,The Crater Rim 2010 Pinot Noir (Canterbury)
"Ripe pear shot through with savory notes of lovage and yeast create an appetizing nose. The palate holds the same savory dimension but is streamlined by welcome, citric freshness reminiscent of grapefruit peel. A phenolic component makes for real mouthfeel and texture—one of the characteristic joys of Grüner. This is a tight little bomb waiting to go off. It will do so in great fashion from about 2018.",94,Eder 2013 Süssenberg Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"This value-priced Syrah is meaty, leathery and spicy smelling, which can be typical for the variety. The palate is a bit shrill and acidic, while narrow flavors of red berries, herbs and minty green settle on a lightly herbal finish.",85,Viña Requingua 2011 Puerto Viejo Reserve Syrah (Curicó Valley)
"This doesn't have the same floral notes on the nose as the other 2014s from Escarpment, but instead offers aromas of baking spices, vanilla and black cherries. In the mouth, it's crisp and medium in weight—not the most generous wine right now—but the tart, lingering finish suggests it should age well. Try after 2018.",90,Escarpment 2014 Te Rehua Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Martinborough)
Here's an everyday wine to drink with burgers and such. Tastes like an inexpensive wine served in a fast-food restaurant.,82,Stefania 2007 Haut Tubee Red (California)
"Blackberries, anise, violets, lilacs, plum skin and vanilla show on the nose of this bottling. The palate shows lots of crushed peppercorns, tart elderberry and boysenberry fruit, and then a complex herbal array of tarragon, dried mint and bay leaf.",92,Falkner 2013 Rock Creek Vineyard Syrah (Temecula Valley)
"Instead of brawn and muscle, this ruby Ripasso offers elegance and finesse. The nose is redolent of polished black stone, Indian spice and loads of dried cassis and wild berry. There's a playful hint of sweet almond and cinnamon at the end.",88,Gamba 2007 Le Quare  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
"While this wine is full, it has an indistinct character. A soft texture and only light fruitiness leave a dull impression.",84,Gerald Talmard 2016  Mâcon-Chardonnay
"Thomas Fogarty's Bordeaux project unleashes aromas of black pepper, Bing cherry and cedar in this wine that proves light, airy and vivacious. Flavors of black and sour cherry dominate the acid-driven palate, which picks up more pepper and is quite easy going down.",88,Lexington 2011 Gist Ranch Estate Cabernet Franc (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Smells superripe and overly extracted, with jammy, fruit-tart aromas underscored by earthy, herbal notes of tobacco and sage. It's a big wine, and a little awkward, but it might knit together in the cellar. —S.H.",86,Seven Lions Winery 2000 Poor Man's Flat Vineyards 100 Year Old  Vines Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"Aromas of French oak, roasted coffee bean, dark berry and menthol lead the nose. The ripe, full-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, licorice and a toasted note alongside assertive, close-grained tannins. You'll also notice the heat of evident alcohol that throws the finish off balance.",88,Bersano 2010 Badarina Riserva  (Barolo)
"This opens with earthy aromas of mature plum, underbrush, scorched soil and a funky whiff of game. On the round straightforward palate, a note of ground pepper adds depth to a core of dried black cherry.",87,Il Feuduccio Di S. Maria D'Orni 2010 Ursonia  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo)
"A touch creamy and milky on the nose, with shy tropical aromas in support. The palate shows warm-climate melon and peach flavors on a round, chunky frame. A mild, innocuous wine if there ever was one. Drink as soon as possible.",84,Finca El Portillo 2007 Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Uco Valley)
"This smells strange, with a mix of herbal blueberry, leather and green tobacco aromas. An awkward, fiercely tannic palate leads to herbal, minty flavors of boysenberry and blackberry that finish with dry, abrasive tannins.",83,Zorzal 2012 Tempranillo (Navarra)
"Exotically floral on the nose, the prettiness of this wine follows through on the palate, salty and high in acidity, with a tang of lemon peel and lemon verbena. Focused and fresh, it has body and weight within that context, ultimately finding a balance that persists on the lengthy finish.",94,Lucie 2015 Dutton Ranch Dutton Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"With its apricot and bitter orange flavors, this wine has great concentration, botrytis character and richness. Acidity lends balance to all its beautiful honey notes and intensity. Drink from 2023.",97,Château de Rayne Vigneau 2014  Sauternes
"Faint red apple and lemon scents show on the nose of this wine. Its soft, easy palate, enlivened with slight spritz, shows the same appetizing, freshly-cut red apple fruit. Light-bodied, charming, easy and fresh.",89,Bründlmayer 2016 Langenloiser Zweigelt Zweigelt (Niederösterreich)
"The aromas of clove, flowers, black olive and spice are bright, followed by penetrating notes of boysenberry and plum. The palate is supple and in feel, showing concentration but still elegance to the fruit flavors.",89,Gård 2013 Lawrence Vineyards Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a very fine from the great Port estate. With dark tannins, a mineral texture and rich fruits it is a real Douro wine. But there is also a great sense of elegance that may come from the property's Bordeaux management team. Put the two together and you have a great wine that will age well. Drink from 2019.",95,Quinta do Noval 2014 Red (Douro)
"With wood and white stone fruit in fine balance, this is a ripe, full wine, the acidity lighting up the ripe flavor. The wine has a broad character, ready for drinking in a year.",91,Morey-Blanc 2007 Charmes Premier Cru  (Meursault)
"There's a cantaloupe-like ripeness on the nose of this blend of 37% Grenache Blanc, 33% Viognier and 30% Roussanne, but not overdone, layered with seared white peach, caramelized pear, poached apple and almond aromas. The palate is more restrained and quite grippy, with flavors of green-apple skins, Bosc pear and a touch of honey.",91,Jada Vineyard & Winery 2014 XCV White (Paso Robles Willow Creek District)
"This blend of 75% Sangiovese, 20% Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Colorino opens with aromas that recall underbrush, woodland berries and tobacco leaf. The bright palate delivers tart sour cherry punctuated with white pepper and clove alongside supple tannins. It's already very drinkable so enjoy soon.",89,Castello di Poppiano 2010 Riserva  (Chianti Colli Fiorentini)
"Feline aromas—nothing unusual for Rueda Verdejo—are coupled with notes of briny apple and citrus. Fresh and easy on the palate, green-leaning citrus flavors finish tangy and slightly salty.",89,Vetus 2015 Flor de Vetus Old Vines from Segovia Verdejo (Rueda)
"Aromas of citrus zest, orchard fruit and a hint of toasted walnut lead the nose. The palate includes mature peach, pear and mineral alongside bright acidity. A hint of hazelnut signals the close.",88,Terredora 2015 Loggia della Serra  (Greco di Tufo)
"Herbal, olive-infused aromas of berry fruits and plum are restrained and typical of Chile. This feels round and nonaggressive, while roasted flavors of cassis and plum come with a hint of minty green. On the finish, bell pepper and black pepper flavors are familiar. This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Carmenère and Cab Franc shows Chilean DNA from nose to finish. Drink through 2017.",90,Leyendas de Familia 2009 Magia Negra Ensamblaje Red (Maule Valley)
"Tightly wound and acidic, with forceful red-berry flavors that are spicy and zesty. Finishes a little on the raw side, with cranberry notes and a hard crescendo. Tempranillo with Garnacha and Cabernet.",83,Bodegas Julián Chivite 2004 Gran Feudo Crianza Red (Navarra)
"Meaty and spicy, this wine is in an early stage of development. It has dark tannins that have an extracted, tough character. However, the weight of ripe fruit is all there, promising a rich and concentrated wine for the future. Drink from 2020.",92,Château Bouscaut 2012  Pessac-Léognan
"Although this wine is listed as a white blend, the producer says the variety is Vernaccia, not found often in California. Light in alcohol and approach, it opens in a bouquet of waxy apple and Meyer lemon, followed by a medium-powered palate of pear. The finish is crisp and lean.",90,Paro 2014 Santo Giordano Vineyard Belle Torrette White (Carneros)
"Ripe and wood aged, this is rich with ginger and tropical fruit flavors. Dense and concentrated, it is a full-in-the-mouth wine—powerful and very ageworthy. Give this five years.",93,Château de Fuissé 2010 Vieilles Vignes  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
"Snappy cool-coast aromas of wet stones and green fruits are pungent but not over-the-top aggressive. This is friendly on the palate, with moderate acidity. Flavors of green apple, lime and scallion finish mild and clean. Drink during 2016.",89,Casa Silva 2015 Cool Coast Sauvignon Blanc (Colchagua Valley)
"Aromas of dark-skinned berry, moist earth and a balsamic note of menthol waft out of the glass. The tart, vibrant palate offers sour cherry and star anise framed in racy acidity and austere tannins.",87,Vignamaggio 2013 Gherardino Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"This is an intense, dense Sauvignon Blanc, full of concentrated lemon zest and green herbs. It has a young, mineral texture, while possessing a nervy acidity.",87,Patient Cottat 2011 Le Grand Caillou Sauvignon Blanc (Val de Loire)
"Alicante is making huge inroads in Tuscany. In the warm climate of central Italy this shows bright berry aromas, with touches of spice, leather, cola and menthol. The palate is bright, fresh and cleansing.",89,Fattoria Mantellassi 2007 Querciolaia  (Maremma)
"Cabernet Sauvignon gives this wine a luscious, elegant mouthfeel, with classic currant and cedar flavors. Syrah brings a gamy, leathery note, with white pepper accents. The result is an interesting, complex young wine of power and authority. Drink now.",92,Treana 2004 Red (Paso Robles)
"This wine displays all of the intensity of expression of Cold Creek. Aromas of toasty spices and pear are light but lead to a full, rich-feeling palate, with the acids providing a perfect counterbalance.",91,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2012 Cold Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Ginger ale and Sprite are the first things that come to mind when you give it a sniff. The palate shows ripe and sweet orange, tangerine and pink grapefruit, while the back end is lean and citrusy but far short of complex. Good in a standard way.",87,Codorníu NV Reserva Raventós Brut Sparkling (Cava)
"Stainless steel fermented, off dry (35 g/L residual sugar) and low alcohol, this is a perfect spring/summer quaffing wine. Crisp apple fruit and a refreshing texture keep it light and interesting.",88,Lujon 2012 White Riesling (Willamette Valley)
This is a very pretty example of Negroamaro that has been shaped by warm oak tones of vanilla and spice. It's elegant and soft and delivers loads of succulent spice notes throughout.,90,Tormaresca 2005 Masseria Maime Negroamaro (Salento)
"Seductively rich and powerful but also refined, this opens with aromas of ripe berry, orange zest, exotic spice and leather. The firm, juicy palate delivers crunchy red cherry, crushed raspberry, anise, mineral and pipe tobacco alongside polished tannins. Drink 2016–2032.",93,Passopisciaro 2012 Contrada G Nerello Mascalese (Terre Siciliane)
"Odd and unusual aromas of murky fruit and clove are matched on the palate, which tastes of fake oak, clove and little else. This Pinot seems more artificial than natural.",81,flipflop NV Left Coast Pinot Noir (Chile)
"Aromas of ripe plum, sunbaked earth and toast lead the way on this structured red. The palate offers dried black cherry, ground pepper and toasted oak while dusty tannins give it a firm, slightly astringent finish.",89,Baglio di Pianetto 2010 Cembali Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"This is dilute to the point of being thin, showing pale flavors of apple and underripe peach. A plastic note runs through it also. Tasted twice with consistent results.",86,Soléna 2013 Domaine Danielle Laurent Chardonnay
"Powerful and rich, this wine tastes of black and red berries. The ripeness of the vintage is evident, with a dense character that lends weight and concentration, while adding fresh black-currant-like acidity.",87,Château La Maroutine 2009  Bordeaux
"Deeply golden in color, this opens with aromas of dried chamomile flower, hay, lightly toasted oak and a butterscotch note. The palate delivers dried apricot, mature apple, candied ginger, mineral and almond alongside racy acidity.",88,Inama 2013 Vigneti di Foscarino  (Soave Classico)
"There's a fair lick of dried wood notes on this straightforward sipper. The fruity strawberry and blueberry core is plush and pleasing, as is the soft grip of tannins at the backend.",86,Hardys 2014 Stamp of Australia Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)
"This relatively small estate in the Awatere Valley continues to impress. The tomato leaf character of the region comes through loud and clear without being overbearing, being balanced by passion fruit and gooseberry flavors. It's reasonably full in body, yet finishes spicy, prickly and refreshing.",91,Eradus 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Awatere Valley)
"Sweet, surprisingly soft for its age, this shows light wood tannins, spice and dried fruits, followed by just an edge of the spirit. It is fresh, elegant, a pleasingly perfumed wine, but not exciting.",87,Burmester 1963 Colheita  (Port)
"The Côte Est Pinot Noir is more structured and less immediately accessible than the winery's Rocheux bottling, but ultimately may prove to be the better bottle. It offers tightly woven, chewy fruit flavors of black cherry, black raspberry and plum, along with darker streaks of clove, leaf, smoke and earth. As always, the wine is structured with elegant precision.",92,Le Cadeau 2006 Côte Est Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"A bouquet of blackberry, violet and subtle rose petal is the precursor to rich flavors of cherry, blackberry, strawberry, clove and mint. A blend of Syrah and Merlot, this offers a chewy texture and refreshing astringency that carries through to the velvety finish.",89,Suvla 2011 Sir Red (Thrace)
"This all-Italian expression of Sylvaner shows beautifully delicate floral and exotic fruit aromas wrapped within a light, fresh bouquet. The wine's smooth, silky, slightly oily texture reinforces its feminine feel.",88,Strasserhof 2010 Sylvaner (Alto Adige)
"The earthy and leafy aromas are akin to Chilean Merlot. The plum flavors are attractive but there's also an indistinct berry/tomato taste that lowers the bar. A smooth, round, carefree wine better geared to casual parties than contemplative sipping.",84,Corbett Canyon 1997 Reserve Merlot (North Coast)
"Candied red and purple fruit meets mocha and cola spice on the nose of this bottling, which is approachable and simple. The palate is tart with cranberry and plum skin flavors, lifted by dried ginger spice.",87,Steele 2013 Goodchild Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
"Dark pink-red in color, this wine has a ripe, sugary nose and a high-octane entry. It grows up to be tangy in citrus peel and fresh grapefruit and cherry, finishing dry.",87,Peter Cellars 2014 Estate Rosé of Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"This blend of Syrah and Malbec was sourced from the estate's Doc Stewart Vineyard. Light, tart rhubarb and watermelon flavors show an accent of mocha. Drink up.",85,Gilbert Cellars 2008 the pilgrim Red (Wahluke Slope)
"This small-production Pinot is ripe and intense. It immediately strikes you with the sheer opulence of its cherry and blueberry flavors. But the structure is immaculate, with pure, refined tannins, plus bright, zesty acids. It has a lot of alcohol, and the wine is a bit warm, but Pinot-friendly foods like steak and lamb will help to balance it. Drink now–2016.",93,Cambria 2010 Barbara's Clone 667 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"Sweet, ripe tannins are embraced by a soft texture and touches of black pepper in this multiple appellation wine. Robust, if not bordering on crazy ripe, it needs food to find itself fully.",86,St. Francis 2013 Three Valleys Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
"A festive, elegant Pinot for drinking  now with fine fare, such as lamb, steak, salmon or tuna. It's crisp, silky and dry, yet there's a core of ripe raspberry and cherry essence enriched with toasty oak.",90,Domaine Chandon 2010 Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"A straightforward, medium-bodied wine that's not fussy, this offers generously expansive flavors of apple skin and pear, veering toward the tropical end of the fruit spectrum on the finish.",86,Roche 2013 Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Fragrant and floral with exotic figueroa, orange and peach scents, this wine is a feast for the senses, playing out on the palate with high-toned acidity, anise flavor and oak.",88,Fog Crest 2014 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Shows Sangiovese's bright cherry and cola flavors and mouthwatering acidity, in a light, silky texture. It's a good, dry, savory wine, but a little one-dimensional. Drink up.",86,Acorn 2010 Alegria Vineyards Sangiovese (Russian River Valley)
"A healthy portion of new oak blends beautifully with the variety's inherent tannins in this full-bodied wine. The two influences meld with each other rather than pile on. It has that sweet-seeming oak perfume, like cedar, vanilla and cinnamon, followed by vivid red cherry and raspberry flavors with new leather accents that linger through the finish.",91,Muscardini 2012 Pauli Ranch Sangiovese (Redwood Valley)
"Off dry and fruity, this simple wine tastes like peach juice, with a bit of citrus. It's pleasant but one-dimensional.",86,Cuckoo's Nest 2014 Aromatique Viognier-Gewürztraminer (Oregon)
"Lightly creamy in the mouth, tasting of wet stone and crushed apple, this young wine seems to gain weight as it runs through the palate. The scent and flavor of peanuts permeates the finish. Showing fine definition and length, it should continue to improve with an additional year or two of bottle age.",90,The Eyrie Vineyards 2015 Pinot Blanc (Dundee Hills)
"Fresh and not too oaky on the bouquet, with apple comprising the fruit element. Feels full and a bit rich, with plump, sweet flavors of apple touched up by spice. Turns stickier and more sweet on the finish, but overall this is a very solid Chard for the money.",88,Finca Vides 2011 Torcidas Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"Aromas of tilled earth, truffle and woodland berry lead the nose. The lively, straightforward palate offers up juicy wild cherry, cinnamon and clove alongside soft, polished tannins. Simple but well made, it's ideal for everyday.",86,Villa Calcinaia 2013 Piegaia  (Chianti Classico)
"Hints of bramble and smoke add savoriness to fresh apple and pear flavors in this almost-dry Riesling. The palate is piercingly high in acidity, but zesty lemon and lime flavors are bright and invigorating.",89,Bischöfliche Weingüter Trier 2013 Feinherb Riesling (Mosel)
"From a 250-acre vineyard on the slopes of the Entre-deux-Mers above the Garonne river, this wine is silky smooth, attractively balanced with wood and soft but dry tannins. Flavors of dark chocolate, black plums and spice from the wood all blend together well. To finish, there is good acidity.",88,Château les Hauts de Palette 2005  Premieres Côtes de Bordeaux
"Scents of leather and turbinado sugar surface on the nose first, which are offset by accents of blackberry, forest floor and pepper. The medium-to-full palate feels supple and expansive, until the finish where the tannic muscle kicks in. Overall, the flavors are intense and juicy but come with an edge of prune.",86,North Gate 2010 Meritage (Virginia)
"Apple and mild spice aromas precede a blocky, wide, almost thick palate that foams up with palate contact. This tastes toasty and baked, with melon and apple notes sitting on top of a full, round, somewhat flat-feeling finish.",85,Codorníu NV Anna de Codorniu Brut Sparkling (Cava)
"Made by the Tari family who used to own Château Giscours in Margaux, Bordeaux, this wine with its 18 months wood aging shows a great understanding of red-wine making. Firm and tannic, almost totally from Mourvèdre, this dark and brooding wine is nowhere near ready to drink. The organically grown grapes give a purity of fruit that cuts through the tannins. Don't drink before 2018.",95,Domaine de la Bégude 2012 La Brûlade Red (Bandol)
"Here's a curious Recioto with aromas of green olive and caper backed by blackberry and some distant spice. Sweetness and succulence push the wine forward over the palate but those green, herbal notes appear once more on the close.",83,Brigaldara 2007 750ml  (Recioto della Valpolicella Classico)
"This is a very ripe, fruity Syrah, rich in raspberry, blueberry and cherry jam flavors, with hints of bacon and pepper. The acid-tannin balance is lovely, making the wine easy to like now.",88,Cimarone 2009 Reserve Three Creek Vineyard Syrah (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
"Made with organic grapes, this rosé is a blend of 30% Grenache Gris, 30% Grenache Noir, 30% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc. It's a dainty and floral selection, with forward scents of sweet pea, lavender, laurel and white tea. The palate offers some tart white cherry and currant fruitiness, with medium acidity and a subtle sweet-spice accent on the close.",86,Vignobles Jeanjean 2015 Domaine le Pive Gris Rosé (Sable de Camargue)
"The aromatic opening includes a forest-like note, plus mineral and earthy berry scents. The palate feels chunky and wide, with solid tannins that don't bite or dominate. Flavors of herb, olive, spice, molasses and cassis are typical for the Alto Maipo, while the finish is defined by racy acids that should allow this wine to age nicely for another five-plus years.",89,Undurraga 2010 T.H. Alto Maipo Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"A fascinating wine, it was processed in a carbonic fashion, in which the juice is allowed to ferment inside the mostly intact grape skins, much like what's done in Beaujolais. The result is a transparent, ruby red wine that offers scents of a dust storm mixed with crushed rock and chile pepper herbaciousness. It's warm and soft on the mouth with a presence that suggests something between peppercorns and bell peppers.",92,Alta Maria 2013 Carbonic Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"Aromas of leather, dried cherry, vanilla and leafy earthiness get this gran reserva moving. In the mouth, it's a touch choppy and wiry, with leafy, roasted flavors of savory plum and spice. This is shy on the finish, with a hint of spice and chocolate. Drink now.",89,El Coto 2004 Coto de Imaz Gran Reserva  (Rioja)
"White flowers, honey and toasted spice lead on this Riesling from New York, and on the palate, a backbone of elegant fruit prevails. Paired with the wine's sweet touch, the flavors offer a simple, appealing quaff that will pair well with spicy cuisine.",83,Anthony Road 2007 Semi-Sweet Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Brooding aromas of huckleberry, braised meat, flower and mineral lead to a full-bodied palate, rich with blue and purple fruit flavors that possess a supple seamless feel and a lengthy finish.",90,Col Solare 2014 Component Collection Estate Vineyard Syrah (Red Mountain)
"This blend of Sciaccarellu and Niellucciu is delicious and light—full of refreshing red currant flavors and crisp acidity. It's bright, fruity and ready to drink.",87,Domaine Poli 2016 Sciaccarellu-Niellucciu Rosé (Ile de Beauté)
"This is a good Pinot Noir. While it's not an ager because it's made for immediate consumption, it does show an elegant structure. Crisp acidity provides balance to the cola, cherry, pomegranate, spice and smoky vanilla flavors.",88,Mossback 2006 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Made from 75% Chardonnay and 25% Pinot Noir, with detectable residual sugar, this wine is moderately complex in its mix of peach, cherry and citrus flavor. The acidity is simple and direct. The palate is thick and creamy.",88,V. Sattui 2012 Prestige Cuvée Brut Sparkling (Napa Valley)
"Lightly scented, this opens with aromas of yellow stone fruit, citrus and a whiff of aromatic herb. The bright, medium-bodied palate offers creamy peach, mature green apple and a hint of nectarine while a mineral note fills in the juicy finish.",90,Villa Raiano 2015  Greco di Tufo
"A fresh wine, all berry flavors and ripe juiciness. It's a wine to be drunk young, just touched by tannins. Delicious and fruity.",85,Domaine Rotier 2008 Initiales Duras (Gaillac)
"Too ripe and too oaky, and both attributes reinforce each other. The blackberry and currant fruit approaches Port in raisiny ripeness, while the oak accentuates the tannic sweetness. Clumsy now, but sometimes these wines improve in the long run. Try holding until after 2013.",86,Janzen 2007 Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"An aromatically pleasing wine with notes of pear, apple and petroleum jelly. It's almost frizzante in feel and drinks dry with just a touch of residual sugar (3.6 g/L) sweetening the finish.",85,Sockeye 2012 Pinot Grigio (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Soft Honeycomb cereal, toasted apple skin and pear lead the nose of this accessible wine, with pleasant hints of fresh herbs. The palate is clean and light on its feet, with vibrant acidity that kicks up the ripe apple, orange and white melon flavors. Drink this balanced beauty now.",89,Eikeboom 2016 Bush Vine Chenin Blanc (Western Cape)
"This is the third separate cuvée of Grüner Veltliner from Reustle, and given the name (which means emerald), it's clearly meant to be modeled after the Austrian style. For those who relish a crisp, mineral-driven wine, with ripe fruit flavors of Meyer lemon, green apple and pink grapefruit, this rings all those bells and more. The length and definition are most impressive.",91,Reustle 2014 Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Umpqua Valley)
"Herbal berry aromas come with oak-based toast and maple notes. This feels pumped up and grabby, with rocky tannins and high acidity. Blackberry and chocolate flavors are forceful, while this Cabernet from a cool vintage shows lasting oak and herbal notes on a wiry yet bulky finish.",89,Viña Maipo 2013 Protegido Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"This wine is 100% varietal, all aged in once-used French oak. It's packed to the brim with black fruit, herbs, licorice, jalapeño pepper and barrel spices, with crystalline clarity to the aromas. There's plenty of depth and richness to the full-bodied flavors, with exquisite balance and a finish that lingers.",92,Gorman 2013 Old Scratch Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"Peach, cantaloupe, pear and a touch of citric zest characterize this expertly made white wine from southern Italy. Beyond the fruit aromas, you'll also pick up notes of white flower and mineral-flint that add dimension and complexity. Drink it well-chilled with seafood or white meat.",88,Feudi di San Gregorio 2005  Fiano di Avellino
"Citrus, yellow apple, orange blossom and saline aromas take center stage. On the palate, notes of savory herb accent creamy apple and pear flavors that are brightened by fresh acidity and a mineral note.",88,Casa di Grazia 2013 Zahara Grillo (Sicilia)
"Waxy and exotic with lychee scents, this is a bone-dry, nutty and meaty version of the variety, which has been grown by this producer since the 1950s. It's refreshing and complex—a perfect companion for the table or picnic basket.",92,Stony Hill 2015 Gewurztraminer (Spring Mountain District)
"A tremendous Cabernet, showing the authority of its vineyard, high up in the Vaca Mountains. Dry and full-bodied, this wine is spectacularly rich in blackberries, cassis and minerals and is well oaked. What's most remarkable is the quality of the tannins. They're firm, yet soft and sweetly refined. A tremendous accomplishment, and should develop in the bottle for a decade. At this price, an outstanding value.",96,Conn Creek 2007 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak)
"Full, juicy and ripe, this is rich with black cherry and red plum fruits that are textured with tannins and spice. The wine, while drinkable now, will be much better from late 2016 as it broadens out.",90,Vignobles Bulliat 2014  Moulin-à-Vent
"An absolutely delicious wine. It's like a fine Pinot Noir in the silky texture, yet deeper and bolder, almost Grenache-like, in the blackberries, cherries and currants, with tangy notes of oranges and vanilla. Dry and richly tannic, this is one of the few Sangioveses that's perfectly ripe and eminently drinkable. Drink now.",91,Cimarone 2007 Gran Premio Three Creek Vineyard Sangiovese (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Ian Brand's fun and wallet-friendly blend of 53% Grenache, 28% Syrah and 19% Mourvèdre offers an interesting nose of charred beef, anise, beets, red rose petals, hints of purple fruit and a judicious touch of asphalt. The dark flavors of black licorice, black pepper, pencil lead and dried violets surround a boysenberry core, but remain light on the palate.",91,L'Ptit Paysan 2012 Le P'tit Pape Red (San Benito County)
"This serious wine is young and still has prominent wood-aging flavors. That toastiness masks the ripe blackberry fruits that are underneath the tannins and wood. The wine will be fine as it matures, giving richness and dense fruits. Wait to drink until 2019.",89,Château l'Espérance 2014 Les Cèdres  (Côtes de Bourg)
"Toast, underbrush, fragrant blue flower and woodland berry aromas lead the way. The firm palate offers tart red cherry, licorice and baking spice alongside fine-grained tannins that lend elegant structure. Drink 2018–2024.",92,Paolo Scavino 2012 Cannubi  (Barolo)
"Light, fruity and sweet, this is classic Rosé d'Anjou. Bright strawberry fruits are softly linked with a crisp texture and acidity to finish.",84,Barton & Guestier 2011  Rosé d'Anjou
"There are lots of ripe, heady flavors of blackberry, dark chocolate, anise and exotic spice in this high alcohol wine. While it's a bit heavy by itself, it needs food to perk it up and coax out the richness. Grilled beef in almost any form is ideal.",86,Rosenblum 2010 Planchon Vineyard Zinfandel (Contra Costa County)
"Tasty and full-bodied, this is a wine you might mistake for a Chateauneuf, with its plummy, blackberry and spice flavors. Heavy for a Pinot, with thick but manageable tannins, but still a good, rich wine.",88,Masút 2001 Pinot Noir (Redwood Valley)
"Top-notch Malbec blended with other varieties gives Corte A a chance at greatness. In its current juvenile state, the wine is fresh, expressive and exotic on the nose, with mineral, licorice and spice in addition to a lot of driving berry character. The core is a touch racy and acidic, so this is no mushy fruit bomb. Instead it is serious wine with a lot of oak, polish and pizzazz.",92,Vistalba 2006 Corte A Malbec (Mendoza)
"This blend of 42% Grenache, 37% Mourvèdre, 16% Syrah and 5% Petite Sirah offers plum and mulberry aromas, with touches of thyme and sage. The palate delivers a similar range of dried fruit and wild herb flavors, showing dark strawberry and plenty of savory garrigue.",90,Cass 2014 Rockin' One Red (Paso Robles)
"Dried herb aromas are at the fore of this Cabernet; exotic spice, smoke, licorice and cherry notes follow. Cherry and chocolate flavors coat the palate, showing vibrancy, while a distinctive espresso note marks the finish.",91,Novelty Hill 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Red berry, crushed stone and herbs aromas open. The vibrant, polished palate delivers tart cherry, strawberry, tangerine and a hint of pastry alongside zesty acidity and small, persistent bubbles.",89,Cascina Chicco 2012 Cuvée Zero Rosé Metodo Classico Sparkling (Vino Spumante)
"With cherry, green herb and mint flavors, this Cab Franc is elegantly structured, but lacks the richness you want in a California Bordeaux-style wine.",85,Trinchero 2010 Central Park West Vineyard Cabernet Franc (St. Helena)
"Earthy, woody aromas of vanilla and dried red fruits filter into a raw, scratchy, acidic palate with plum, raspberry and medicinal flavors. On the finish, this wine is mildly oaky, with lively tartaric acidity driving racy, zesty length.",86,Viña Bisquertt 2013 La Joya Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"Flat aromas of lanolin and oily white fruits lead to a round, full palate that's getting tired. Salty nectarine and flowery flavors finish with a yeasty note of ham and white fruits.",85,Aymara 2015 Estate Torrontés (Maipú)
"This tastes distinctly sweet—like a cherry-and-chocolate confection—and the acidity is high. It's hard to predict where this is going, but it seems awkward now. Tasted twice, with consistent results.",86,Decades5 2009 Stagecoach Vineyard Petit Verdot (Atlas Peak)
"Underbrush, sunbaked earth, cured meat, menthol, toast and mature plum aromas unfold in the glass. The ripe palate is mature and offers dried black, cherry, truffle, licorice, espresso and a funky hint of game alongside firm but somewhat fleeting tannins that leave a drying finish.",87,Collosorbo 2011  Brunello di Montalcino
"A juicy blend of 86% Mourvèdre and 14% Grenache this is a bang-up value for subtle blueberry and crushed blackberry layers amid a sanguine, earthy core. Soft and medium-bodied, it has a distinct suggestion of licorice on the finish.",88,Courtney Benham 2011 Vin D'Eliza Grenache-Mourvèdre (Lake County)
"A wonderful wine, one of the best Petite Verdots in California, although the truth is there aren't all that many. It's sturdy in tannins and richly textured, with delicious blackberry flavors that are a little earthier and drier than Cabernet Sauvignon.",92,Kunde 2009 Limited Selection Petite Verdot (Sonoma Valley)
"Aromas of underbrush, tilled soil, toast and espresso lead the nose. The firmly structured palate offers ripe black cherry, blackberry, coffee, anise and grilled herb alongside assertive tannins that need to unwind. Drink 1016–2020.",90,Castello di Monsanto 2010 Il Poggio Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"A whiff of earth under tangy, young, grapy fruit leads into a tasty, easy-drinking Gamay with flavors of mountain berries. Firm, lemony acidity underscores the bright fruit. Drink this over the next couple of years while the freshness remains.",88,St. Hubertus 2012 Oak Bay Vineyard Gamay Noir (Okanagan Valley)
"A blend of 83% Merlot and 17% Cabernet Sauvignon, this robust red is juicy and smoky, offering tastes of blackberry, cassis and mocha. Dusty tannins give a heaviness, accented by black licorice on the finish.",88,Verse & Chorus 2013 Mat Kearney Red (Napa Valley)
"This wine doesn't appear to have fully come out of its shell, with light aromas of plum, tire rubber, pomegranate, herb and a dusting of spices. The flavors display a pleasing sense of purity, with lightly grainy tannins providing support.",88,Lagana 2014 Minnick Hills Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This is a delicately perfumed wine that packs a punch of refreshing fruitiness. It has intense, crisp acidity and ripe apricot and lemon flavors. It's textured and ready to drink.",86,Union de Vignerons de l'Île de Beauté 2016 Terra Santa White (Ile de Beauté)
"A lovely bottle of Pinot Noir, dry and silky and considerably lighter in body than most. Despite the lightness of texture, the wine is powerful, with succulent raspberry, cherry, Dr. Pepper cola, anise and white pepper flavors that linger long in the finish. Should develop in the bottle for at least six years.",93,W.H. Smith 2009 Marimar Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"From a 24-acre vineyard with vines aged from five to 65 years, this is an attractively fruity wine. Ripe apple flavors gain even greater liveliness from the twist of citrus zest. It is ready to drink with all its freshness.",86,Domaine Siret-Courtaud 2014  Quincy
"Standard all the way, but isn't that what we want from a $9 wine? The nose offers raspberry and strawberry aromas, while the flavors are generic but familiar, with a lean toward cherry and berry. Solid on the finish, and fairly intense as a whole. Imported by Clock Tower Imports.",86,Cruz Alta 2009 Malbec (Mendoza)
"A big improvement from the previous vintage, this pretty, salmon-hued wine is packed with subtle but flavorful fruit. Tart citrus and strawberry notes underscored with crisp, clean acidity make it refreshing and a real winner.",90,Rain Dance 2016 Nicholas Vineyard Estate Rosé (Chehalem Mountains)
"Herb and spice aromas mix with volatile notes. The flavors are light and elegant, but seem a bit faint.",83,Tucannon 2012 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Lightly aromatic with notes of yellow apple, pear and melon. It drinks off dry, with the sugar seeming out of place but followed by an extended finish with clarifying acidity.",88,Tsillan 2013 Estate Pinot Grigio (Lake Chelan)
"Notes of honey and yellow fruit give this wine both sweetness and softness. It has weight and a rich mouthfeel, powered by a warm and rounded texture. There is just a touch of dryness at the heart of what is otherwise a medium-sweet wine.",87,Willm 2011 Réserve Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"A youthful wine that is just packed with fruit. It is a blend of Trincadeira, Aragonez and Syrah. Juicy, ripe and rich with black plum flavors, it is a delicious wine already. Drink now.",88,Terras de Alter 2014 Terra d'Alter Red (Alentejano)
"A richly fruity wine marked by tropical fruit and spice aromas and flavors, and a rich, creamy texture. Has a slight burn in the mouth from alcohol and spice that calls out for food.",87,Fetzer 1998 Barrel Select Chardonnay (California)
"With its slightly sweet, jellied flavors of cherries, black raspberries, anise and vanilla bean, balanced with smooth tannins, this is a fun wine. It's easy to enjoy with almost anything that wants a medium-bodied red.",84,Surf Point 2006 Merlot (California)
"This open and fruity expression of Malbec is helped to softness by its ripe Merlot. The wine is floral, fruity and lightly touched by tannins. Red-fruit flavors and a crisp aftertaste add balance to this ready-to-drink wine.",86,Château de Gaudou 2015 Domaine de Gaudou Exception Malbec-Merlot (Côtes du Lot)
"All whole cluster fermented, this was given 22 months in neutral wood. It remains fresh and clean, with berry and cherry fruit flavors, and a moderately sweet candy impression. There's a touch of wet rock also, and a textural, persistent finish. Drink now through 2023.",91,Maysara 2012 Momtazi Vineyard Rumi Pinot Noir (McMinnville)
"If there is any criticism to be made of this wine, it might be that it is just too fruity. Waves of honey and tropical fruit coat the mouth, wonderfully balanced by zesty acidity, and while it is sweet and lush it never seems cloying or heavy. Delicious now–2015, at least.",92,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler 2009 Bernkasteler Badstube Spätlese Riesling (Mosel)
"A clean, fruity, tart bubbly with a lively mouthfeel and spicy fruit. A nice touch of licorice adds flavor interest, and the balance throughout is impeccable.",87,Pacific Echo NV Brut  (Mendocino County)
"Vanilla, plum, clove and leather wrap around softy layered tannin and oak in this simple blend of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Tempranillo and Carignane.",87,Tom Gore 2013 Field Blend Red (Alexander Valley)
"Crisp and fresh, this is a light wine that is dominated by red-currant fruits. It has considerable acidity as well as tannins. Fruity while lightly perfumed, it will be ready from 2018.",88,Château Tour de Gilet 2014  Bordeaux Supérieur
"An unexpected combination perhaps, but it works to give a fresh, flavorful wine, with soft tannins, juicy fruit and flavors of red cherries and vanilla. Not complex, and ready to drink now.",87,DFJ Vinhos 2004 Tinta Roriz and Merlot Red (Estremadura)
"Pressed white flower, nut and dried apricot lead the nose. The firm, structured palate offers baked yellow peach, candied citrus zest, toasted almond and mineral alongside bright acidity.",89,Lis Neris 2012 La Vila Friulano (Friuli Isonzo)
"This 100% Feteasca Alba has aromas of tropical fruits and lemongrass. It is medium bodied with good minerality and flavors of apple, mango, grapefruit and pear.",88,Vinaria din Vale 2013 Feteasca (Moldova)
"This light-colored, alert wine with melon and nectarine aromas is confident up front. Cleansing acidity is the driver of a juicy, tangy and lean palate. Crisp flavors of pie cherry, currant and rose water finish fresh.",87,Volver 2016 Tarima Rosado (Alicante)
"A touch of flinty smoke hovers above the glass and clouds other varietal aromas of citrus and fern that find ready expression on the dry, fresh palate. The slender body still has some smoky edges, defined freshness and a clean-cut finish.",90,Tement 2015 Steirische Klassik Sauvignon Blanc (Südsteiermark)
"Frothy and robust, this presents aromas of blue flower, ripe plum, fig and cassis that carry over to the palate, along with spicy blueberry. It's balanced with sharp acidity and hearty tannins.",87,Villa di Corlo 2013 Frizzante Secco  (Lambrusco Grasparossa di Castelvetro)
"Harvested at 40.16 Brix and retaining a whopping 255 g/L residual sugar, this wine shows a complex medley of notes ranging from fresh baked apple pie to apricot and cinnamon. It's thick and rich in feel with stone fruit and dried orange rind flavors persisting through the long-drawn-out finish.",92,Inniskillin 2007 Gold Icewine Vidal Blanc (Niagara Peninsula)
"From a high-altitude vineyard in the heart of the Douro, this is a fruity while well textured wine. With a strong mineral character that comes from the lees stirring during fermentation, it has both bright citrus fruits with acidity and a more tropical character. Drink now.",88,Magnum Vinhos 2013 Tom de Baton Branco White (Douro)
"Smooth, rich wine, with spice, red berries, firm tannins and a pure, juicy, ripe fruit character. The wine has structure and intensity. It could still develop.",90,Mas de Gourgonnier 2007 Red (Les Baux de Provence)
"Already drinking nicely, this offers generously ripened peach, candied lemon and pineapple fruits. The lush flavors are balanced against fresh, natural acidity, with little or no time in new oak apparent.",91,Evening Land 2012 Seven Springs Vineyard Chardonnay (Eola-Amity Hills)
"A problematic wine. It starts out with an inert aroma that's mainly caramelized wood. In the mouth it's sweet and simple, with cola, blackberry, Dr. Pepper and cocoa flavors, and some bitterness on the finish.",83,Lolonis 2005 Winegrower Selection Chase Vineyard Zinfandel (Redwood Valley)
Very slight notes of elderflower play around the crisp apple fruit. The palate is more mellow—its tart freshness countered by ample red apple fruit and the rounding effects of autolysis that highlight fruit and refreshment in every one of its prickles.,89,Ridgeview Estate 2013 Fitzrovia Rosé Sparkling (England)
"This wine strikes a nice balance between sweet and savory spice on the nose, with ripe fruit, prune and leather in the background. This is a velvety, warm, earthy wine with a broad aromatic delivery and bold Brunello style. It's smooth and round, without any of the sharp acidic accents you sometimes find in Sangiovese Grosso.",89,La Colombina 2007  Brunello di Montalcino
"Aromas of tomato vine, hay and passion fruit unfold in the glass. The crisp, linear palate offers white grapefruit, mango, a hint of oak-driven spice and mineral alongside bright acidity that leaves a clean finish.",89,Caldaro 2014 Castel Giovanelli Sauvignon (Alto Adige)
"Here's a creamy and sophisticated expression of Pinot Bianco from one of the best-suited territories for this particular grape. The wine offers layered tones of stone fruit, pear and white almond and boasts a very silky feel that rides long on the finish. It's an excellent wine.",91,Volpe Pasini 2006 Zuc di Volpe Pinot Bianco (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"Tart and sweet, like cherry and black raspberry Lifesaver candy, this blend of Italian varieties is distinctly rustic.",83,Brutocao 2006 Quadriga Hopland Ranches Red (Mendocino)
There's a really nice point of mature peach or apricot that emerges from the fragrant bouquet of this luminous and bright Pinot Grigio. That fruity note adds a sweet sensation to the nose followed by aromas of passion fruit and citrus.,86,Tommasi 2010 Le Rosse Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie)
"Warm, lightly baked aromas of plum, cherry and dust set up a layered palate with just enough acidity to keep this wine upright and steady. Flavors of loamy berry, earth and chocolate are rich, while the finish tastes oaky, with more than enough vanilla and toast. Drink now.",89,Luis Cañas 2006 Reserva  (Rioja)
"Nicely rounded in texture without being flabby, this is a lively, crisp white wine, well endowed with flavors reminiscent of melon, pear and lime. Perfect to drink now with most seafood dishes, or as an apéritif.",90,Zonte's Footstep 2010 Doctoressa di Lago Single Site Pinot Grigio (Fleurieu Peninsula)
"This wine is rich garnet colored, with flavors of pomegranate, dark plum and cranberry that excite the palate. Fruit forward, well-structured and thoroughly enjoyable.",89,Piližota 2009 Babić (North Dalmatia)
"This is bright in color and loud on the nose, where it's distinctly medicinal and minty, with a strong green component. The palate doesn't differ; it's gritty and heavy in feel, with forced, jammy flavors of mint, grass and bitter black fruits.",81,O. Fournier 2012 Urban Uco Tempranillo (Uco Valley)
"One of three Chardonnays named after the winemaker's daughters, the aromas draw you into the glass, with notes of lees, almond, melted butter, cream, peach and spice. All Clone 95, the tropical-fruit flavors are sweet, rich and layered. A touch of heat on the finish is the only thing that holds it back.",91,Morell-Peña 2015 Amylla Loren Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The wine is soft, smooth and full of rich berry fruits. The blend of Aragonez, Trincadeira and Alicante Bouschet gives a warm southern feel: ripe wine, sunshine and soft tannins. Wood aging has smoothed the bold fruits and created a full generous aftertaste. Drink now.",89,Herdade da Comporta 2014 Private Selection Red (Península de Setúbal)
"Everything about this Cab is out-sized. The color is black, the black currant and cassis flavors are mind-blowingly huge, the oak presence is strong, the tannins are thick, and the finish is long and spicy. It's nowhere near ready to drink. Give it at least eight more years to let the parts find each other and integrate.",90,Bello Family Vineyards 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Aromas of cellar floor, roasted herb, anise and toast come together on this. The straightforward palate offers cherry marinated in spirits and licorice while a note of powdered sage gives it a bitter finish.",87,Demarie 2012  Barolo
"An easy-drinking Sauvignon Blanc thats fermented in barrel and stainless steel, this has a depth of pear, tangerine and lime flavors. Creamy and rich, it will make a consistent companion to most fish dishes.",86,Murphy-Goode 2011 The Fumé Sauvignon Blanc (North Coast)
"A lively, spicy wine that shows ginger and nutmeg character, followed by ripe white pears. Beneath this vivid character, the texture is smooth, honeyed, deliciously ripe.",92,Château Doisy-Daëne 2006  Barsac
"Rubbery, sweaty, muted aromas lead to a dilute, fizzy palate. Prickly green citrus and melon flavors end on the vegetal side.",84,Bouza de Carril 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Bright fruit flavors of pear and tangerine light up the palate, set against tangy acids. A versatile, fresh and quite tasty young white wine, it's best enjoyed right now.",88,Wildewood 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"Structured and still remarkably young, this vibrant wine delivers aromas and flavors of ripe black cherry, cinnamon and licorice. It's balanced with bright acidity and youthfully austere tannins that need time to mellow out. Drink 2018–2033.",93,Sordo 2008 Ceretta di Perno Riserva  (Barolo)
"This medium-bodied white is made from the Trebbiano grape in a small area between Veneto and Lombardy. It has lovely fragrances of peach blossom and Spanish broom, while the palate delivers white peach and lemon pastry flavors. It finishes crisp and clean.",89,Zenato 2012 San Benedetto  (Lugana)
"With a blend that is half Cabernet Sauvignon, half Merlot, this is as rich as the year. The weight of fruit is borne by sweet tannins and layers of wood toast. There is a very dense dusty texture along with fine acidity and final blackberry fruit. It is for aging over the next 4–5 years.",92,Château Paloumey 2009  Haut-Médoc
"An intensely acidic wine, its tannins and spice acting as a foil to the freshest of black currant fruit flavors. It's definitely a cool-climate red. Screwcap.",86,Bründlmayer 2008 Ladner St. Laurent (Niederösterreich)
"The slightest hint of lemon zest on the nose leads into the light, crisp, dry palate. If it weren't for the friendly lemon notes, this would almost be neutral, but also clean. Slight spritz makes this slimline wine very easy to enjoy. Drink soon.",87,Graf Hardegg 2015 Veltlinsky Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"Light and steely, this wine offers mild flavors that lean tropical, like pineapple and guava. Those succulently ripe layers meet stone fruit and a medium-sized body, making for an enjoyable, food-friendly experience on the palate.",88,Clif Family 2016 Rte Blanc Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Full and rounded, this is a soft wine, more suited to food than as an aperitif. The apple and red currant fruits are textured and spiced with lemon zest and mandarin orange flavors, finishing with some richness.",86,Domaine Sainte-Marie 2012 Vie Vité Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This perfumed wine offers aromas of plum, flowers, orange peel, smoked meat and coffee. The blue fruit flavors are soft, focused and rich, lingering on the finish.",92,Stolen Horse 2012 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This offers aromas suggesting scorched earth, stalky underbrush, leather and steeped prune. The palate shows raisin, cassis and a hint of espresso alongside raspy tannins that leave an astringent finish.",87,Domìni Veneti 2012  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"Vibrant and easy-drinking, this delivers intense aromas and flavors of crushed strawberry, ground white pepper, clove and mineral backed up by a note of orange peel. Thanks to fresh acidity and smooth, supple tannins, it's made to be drunk young.",88,Planeta 2013 Frappato (Vittoria)
"Tropical fruit, passion fruit and lime aromas are a bit sweaty and suggestive of pine resin. This is low on spine and verve, meaning it's a touch flat and flabby. Briny nectarine and tarragon flavors finish with green notes of scallion and lime.",85,Emina 2014 Verdejo (Rueda)
"The nose seems lean and vaguely unripe. You get aromas of chocolate and green olives, and the most distant whiff of meat. Of course there's a great deal of oak, including American, which lends vanillin and smoky notes, but still an impression of leanness carries through in the mouth. It struggles to say the word “fruit.” It's also very tannic. That aside, it may soften and improve in time.",85,Newlan 1998 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"This Syrah-based blend is marked by bone-dry, unsweetened baker's chocolate and blackberry flavors. It's a simple, tannic wine to drink with simple fare, such as burgers.",82,Chocolate Box 2012 Red (California)
"Red fruits dominate a wine that is rich, full-bodied with a firm, tight structure. Round the firm texture there is a richer, ripe fruit character, dense and juicy. The wine can be aged, but it is ready to drink.",89,Real Companhia Velha 2008 Porca de Murça Reserva Red (Douro)
"Fragrant layers of cinnamon, toast and vanilla adorn this intensely ripe, fleshy red wine. Blackberry and plum flavors are ruddy on the palate, but brightened by a zip of acidity and fine, chalky tannins on the finish.",85,Standing Stone 2013 Saperavi (Finger Lakes)
"The nose is jammy and slightly medicinal at first, but then plum and berry aromas settle. This feels firmly tannic and mouthfilling, with baked berry and roasted plum flavors. The finish is hard and strapping, with excess power.",86,Ruca Malen 2010 Yauquen Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"A blend of fruit sources used for the winery's three single-vineyard wines, this bottling saw no new oak and is light golden in color with reserved notes of mineral, almond, pineapple and lees. Full bodied, rich and layered with a creamy feel, it's appealing now but should have a long life ahead.",92,Sixto 2012 Uncovered Chardonnay (Washington)
"This is a surprisingly dry wine that's all spice and lychee flavors without any hint of sweetness (not indicated on the label unfortunately). It has a light texture with notes of pepper and rosewater, along with some acidity on the finish.",86,Domaine Allimant-Laugner 2011 Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"A very firm wine, layering acidity, black currant fruits and dense tannins. It currently is dominated by its acidity and structure, needing several years to open out. But it's all there, a powerful, perfumed and textured wine.",90,Charles Joguet 2010 Les Charmes  (Chinon)
"As comfortable as an old shoe, the Grand Estates Chardonnay from Columbia Crest delivers broad, open flavors of buttered fruit – almost like biting into a slice of apple pie, crust and all. Hard to argue with it, all 160,000 cases strong.",86,Columbia Crest 2007 Grand Estates Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Attractive aromas of pear and coconut set the stage for clean, fruity pear and apple flavors. This wine is balanced, offering length on the palate and finish, but also defined flavors and freshness. By all indications it's well made, and best of all it tastes as it should. Best Buy.",86,Errazuriz 2000 La Escultura Estate - Reserva Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)
"The pungent aromas of grass, waxy lemon and canned corn on the nose are followed by more citrus and overripe melon on a palate. This is zippy and clean but finishes slightly bitter.",85,Smart Cookie 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"This is all about juicy, ripe fruit, tempered by freshness and a velvety tannin structure. Fleshy, ripe red and black cherry is expansive and open on nose and palate. A joy to drink and ready now.",90,Esterházy 2012 Blaufränkisch (Leithaberg)
"It is rare to find Tinta Barroca on its own. Normally it is used for blending in Port. Here, though, it is in all its ripe fruit glory, an attractive, relatively lightweight wine. It's for drinking now, with red berry fruits right to the fore.",87,Muxagat 2010 Tinta Barroca (Douro)
"This wine is herbal and grassy in character, with a strong Sauvignon Blanc element. It has spiciness, tangy with squeezed lemon and very fresh acidity. Drink from 2017. André Lurton has owned the estate since 1965.",87,Château la Louvière 2013  Pessac-Léognan
"Oaky spice aromas are up front on a nose that also shows berry and prune notes. This is fleshy and tannic in feel. Flavors of blackberry, wood grain and chocolate finish dry and firm, with wood-spice flavors.",88,Bracco Bosca 2016 Ombú Reserve Tannat (Atlantida)
"Deliciously varietal in its huge offering of white pepper and robust black and blue fruit, this well-crafted wine boasts a lithe texture that invites sip after sip. It remains light footed throughout the palate, yet with enough complexity and balancing weight before the refined finish gives a final hit of juiciness.",95,Dutton-Goldfield 2013 Dutton Ranch Cherry Ridge Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley)
"This is a dark, concentrated effort that shows its wood strongly. The tannins are firm and almost heavy, producing a wine that is intensely dry and will need many years to age.",87,Château Cissac 2010  Haut-Médoc
"Ripe, fruity and tannic, this shows lusty flavors of cherry and raspberry jam that finish sweet and spicy. The blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Zinfandel.",84,Mad Crush 2010 Red (California)
This was half whole cluster-fermented and neatly incorporates hints of earth and bark into its tart cranberry and pie cherry core. Its verticality and tannic power suggest it will age quite nicely through the late 2020s.,93,Patricia Green Cellars 2015 Freedom Hill Vineyard Dijon 115 Clone Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Gritty, green aromas are not really ripe or friendly. This is high in pyrazines and tastes peppery and largely fruitless. A sour finish with sweaty notes are as expected given the nose and flavors.",83,Salentein 2015 Portillo Estate Bottled Sauvignon Blanc (Valle de Uco)
"Initially shy, this eventually reveals aromas of citrus blossom, orchard fruit and grilled herb. The aromas carry over to the savory enjoyable palate along with citrusy notes.",88,Tenuta Grimani 2015 Farinaldo  (Soave)
Jammy black fruit and inky blackberry preserves open the bouquet of this syrupy red wine. The wine's texture is both dense and gritty.,85,Feudo Disisa 2007 Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"Pretty cherry fruit shows some spicy highlights, along with hints of leather. The funky aromas will be more pleasing to some palates than others. You make the call.",86,Division 2014 Les Petits Fers Gamay Noir (Oregon)
"Maderized and brownish-gold in color, this is oxidized on the nose, palate and finish. Heavy, chunky and dull in feel, it has sherried flavors and a clumsy, weak finish.",82,Arínzano 2010 Gran Vino Chardonnay (Pago de Arínzano)
"A cool coastal Pinot with powerful aromatics and silky tannins. Flavors veer toward sweet ripe cherries, with earthy complexities of tobacco and espresso. Dry and stylish, a youthful wine that's not built for the cellar, but is delicious now. A new label from Caymus.",90,Belle Glos 2001 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"Light in color and light-bodied in the mouth, this Grenache-based Rhône blend offers easy, sweet flavors of cherries, cola, vanilla and oak.",85,Foxen 2009 Cuvée Jeanne Marie Red (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Hot in the mouth and sweet on this finish, this blackberry, coffee and spice-flavored Zin is rustic. The sugary finish might pair well with a rich barbecue sauce.",83,Trinitas 2004 Bigalow Vineyard Zinfandel (Contra Costa County)
"Plenty of fruit aromas and flavors make this wine a pleasure to drink. It smells and tastes like ripe red and black cherries and has a broad, rich texture. Medium bodied, it maintains a good, tense acidity that keeps flavors going on the finish.",92,Phillips Hill 2013 Terroirs Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Gritty, slightly grassy aromas are low on fruit. This is light yet composed on the palate, with mild stone-fruit and melon flavors. Modest acidity and equally modest fruit flavors make for a mild easy finish. Drink immediately.",87,Gimenez Riili 2015 Buenos Hermanos Torrontés (Mendoza)
"Inkblot is Lodi winery Michael David's first Cabernet Franc, a relatively small production wine with MD's signature smoky, toasty coconut aromas, thick and raspberry jammy. Aged 15 months in French oak, it would be a hit with big wine lovers but doesn't exhibit Cab Franc's herbaceousness, which some people will be happy about, others will not. Includes small amounts of Cab Sauvignon and Petite Sirah.",86,Michael David 2009 Inkblot Cabernet Franc (Lodi)
Red cherries and jelly fruits highlight a wine that is ripe and soft. A hint of acidity puts the sweetness into attractive relief.,85,Bouchard Père & Fils 2006  Bourgogne
"Made from the Chambourcin grape and aged in Bourbon barrels from the A. Smith Bowman Distillery, this fortified red wine has bold notes of baguette, blackberry and brown spice, plus a mushroom inflection. Medium to full bodied, an oxidative tone of apple juice surfaces on the palate and predominates with time. The alcohol becomes fiery on the second half of the palate.",83,Philip Carter 2010 1762 Red (Virginia)
"Aromas of fragrant spring blossom, orchard fruit, hazelnut and bread crust lead the nose on this refined white. The elegantly structured palate offers creamy yellow apple, lemon drop and mineral alongside crisp acidity that leaves a tangy finish.",90,Torre Rosazza 2014 Pinot Bianco (Friuli Colli Orientali)
"With very slight oak, but aged on the lees, this Sauvignon Blanc has richness that outshines the underlying fruit, which suggests lemons and limes. The wine was not put through the malolactic fermentation, so acidity is brisk. Good job for a fancy wine at a decent price.",88,Easton 2008 Monarch Mine Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Sierra Foothills)
"A vineyard on the river plain of Saint-Émilion, Haut-Pezat has produced a wine whose full black fruits handle strong wood-aging flavors with ease. The result is a ripe wine packed with blackberry flavors and acidity that is filled out with the wood spice. The wine should age well, drink from 2020.",89,Château Haut-Pezat 2014  Saint-Émilion
"This has aromas of overripe black-skinned fruit, scorched earth and a funky whiff of barnyard. The rustic sensation carries over to the palate along with a bitter note. It lacks fruit richness while grainy tannins leave an abrupt, astringent finish. Tried twice and had the same notes.",85,Revello Fratelli 2011 Gattera  (Barolo)
"A very nice Sauvignon, easy to drink, and showing lots of style and elegance. Bone dry and zesty in acidity, it has citrus, tropical fruit and white pepper flavors, with a stimulating touch of tart gooseberry.",88,Carica 2010 Kick Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County)
"A somewhat unusual expression of Viognier with notes of lime, lime leaf, and white peach that seem more reminiscent of a Sauvignon Blanc. It's full bodied and viscous, ending with a bitter note.",86,Valley View 2011 Anna Maria Viognier (Applegate Valley)
"Made only in the best vintages, Cuvée Annamaria Clementi is Ca' del Bosco's flagship wine. This sparkler offers aromas of white flower, pastry, stone fruit and a hint of oak. The palate delivers apricot, peach and candied lemon layered with subtle oak notes. The wine closes on a dry note of toasted almond.",90,Ca' del Bosco 2004 Cuvée Annamaria Clementi Sparkling (Franciacorta)
"Dry and steely in focus, yet ebulliently fruity and floral on the nose and palate, there's so much dimension to this fantastic Riesling. Intensely ripe stonefruit flavors leave an irresistible glycerine slick on the palate, but it finishes clean with a shower of crushed-stone minerality and steel.",93,Prinz Salm 2010 Wallhausen Felseneck GG Trocken Riesling (Nahe)
"This is pure Viognier, finishing in a moderately sweet, dessert-friendly style. There is a candied sensation to the mouthfeel, and the fruit seems rather thin. Light flavors of orange pekoe carry into a gentle finish.",86,Columbia Crest 2012 Reserve Late Harvest Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This shows rustic sensations of overripe black fruit, animal and hints of barnyard that contrast with harsh and astringent tannins.",82,Fattoria Carpineta Fontalpino 2010  Chianti Classico
"Scents of plum, orange rind, banana and a touch of mentholated herb unfold on the nose, while the palate offers fruit-skin flavors of plum and cherry, lending a slightly tannic structure.",85,Le Cirque 2013 Rosé (Côtes Catalanes)
"Shows some Riesling character in the petrol, honeysuckle and citrus fruit aromas and flavors, and that crisp Central Coast acidity makes it very bright and clean. It's a bit thin, but nice enough as an apéritif sipper.",85,Claiborne & Churchill 2007 Dry Riesling (Central Coast)
"Reserved aromas of lemon zest, shaved butter and wet stone greet the nose on this ready-to-drink bottling from West Paso. The palate shows poached apple and cooked pear tones, with a slightly sour tang keeping it lively.",87,Midnight 2014 Estate Chardonnay (Paso Robles Willow Creek District)
"Oaky and ripe, this Chardonnay shows barrel-inspired vanilla and buttered toast flavors that enrich the pineapples and apples. A touch of Gewurztraminer lifts it into floral and lychee territory.",86,Wente 2008 Riva Ranch Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco)
"Somewhat restrained aromas of dried cranberry and pomegarante mix with light herbs and spices on the nose of this bottling. It's vibrant, fun and easy-to-drink on the palate, where the simple red-fruit flavors make it perfect for the beach or poolside.",87,Francis Ford Coppola 2014 Diamond Collection Silver Label Pinot Noir (Monterey County)
"Smoky and oaky past the point of balance, this tastes of charred wood rather than fruit. The tannins are chewy and smoky. After considerable breathing time, blackberry fruit emerges. Aeration is highly recommended.",85,Kriselle 2013 Malbec (Rogue Valley)
"Pretty notes of Italian espresso, chocolate and spice revolve around a core of solid black fruit. This is an elegant and refined wine that boats a traditional style that is never overdone or too powerful. In fact, it showcases its delicate berry nuances very nicely in the mouth. Drink after 2014.",93,Fattoria dei Barbi 2004 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Officially launched in 2011, this is a fresh and fruity style of the classic fortified wine. Lively notes of strawberry and cream, white cherry and fresh bay leaf dance on the nose, while the palate boasts flavors of small red berry and vanilla spice.",87,Croix Milhas 2011 Grenache (Rivesaltes Rosé)
"A bit heavy handed, with lots of tannins and acidity, and the jammy cherry-berry fruit is in your face. It's made in a big, bold style that will appeal to fruit-forward fans.",87,Ortman Family 2008 Turner Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Earthy plum and stalky berry aromas are bolstered by bold oak aromas. This feels good and healthy, with spicy oaky flavors that are dry lactic and push the wine's fruit to the background. A woody spicy, minty finish ends this. Drink through 2017.",87,Ramón Bilbao 2012 Crianza  (Rioja)
"This wine is a rarity for Washington in a number of ways. It's 100% varietal, comes from Golden Ridge Vineyard, and saw just 20% new French oak. It offers appealing, luscious raspberry compote and herb aromas and flavors backed by lightly grainy tannins.",91,DaMa 2012 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This opens with variety's signature floral fragrance of acacia and jasmine, accented by tropical fruit. The flavors of creamy lemon, pear, tangerine and lime are accented with hints of dried Mediterranean herbs. This is linear and focused.",88,Collevite 2012 Villa Piatti  (Offida Pecorino)
"Merlot and Cabernet Franc make up the majority of this blend. The aromas of dried herbs, pencil lead, cherry and spice are subdued while the palate brings a somewhat elegant style, with the tannins seeming a bit bunched up.",88,Telaya 2013 Sruth Boushey Vineyard Red (Yakima Valley)
"Heaps of crushed black pepper meet with fresh and caramelized boysenberry fruit and beef char on the nose of this wine by Doug Margerum, who co-ferments his most hopeful lots from around the county into this annual blend. The cracked pepper shines on the savory palate too, giving spice to blackberry paste and crushed lavender flavors.",92,Margerum 2013 Über Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"This wine is produced solely with Nerello Mascalese grapes aged in terra cotta vessels and made with no selected yeasts or added sulfites. It offers concentrated black cherry, raspberry and licorice flavors accented with cracked black pepper and smoky mineral alongside big but velvety tannins. The warmth of alcohol marks the close.",89,Frank Cornelissen 2012 Munjebel Rosso 9 Nerello Mascalese (Vino da Tavola)
"Though light in color, this flagrantly floral expression of the variety offers a crème brûlée-like richness on the nose. The palate is a different story—all tart fruit, lifted acidity and gravelly minerality.",90,Sonoma-Cutrer 2014 Les Pierres Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"In the Boissonneau family since 1839, this southern Entre-Deux-Mers vineyard gives a crisp, herbal wine with light fruit and attractive acidity. It has lemon and grapefruit flavors, bright with a crisp aftertaste. Drink now.",85,Château de la Vieille Tour 2016  Bordeaux Blanc
"Earthy, spicy plum and berry aromas are racy and a touch leathery. Grabby tannins make for a drawing mouthfeel, while this tastes of herbal plum and wild berry along with chocolate and mint. A dry, lightly oaked but spicy finish provides for a good ending.",89,Valentin Bianchi 2014 Malbec (Mendoza)
"Slender poise and supercharged lemon are signaled with the first sniff. A pleasantly bitter note—think almond or Castelfranco—plays along the edges of the palate before riper, more generous yellow plum kicks in, always toned by that citrus freshness. Drink now to 2025.",95,F X Pichler 2013 Loibner Loibenberg Smaragd Riesling (Wachau)
"Extraordinarily rich and ripe, just explodes with cherry jam, crushed black raspberries and sweet toasted oak and vanilla flavors. But it's not a simple fruit bomb. Crisp acidity and a deep, fine tannin structure give it complexity and limited ageability. Good now and through 2012.",92,Harrington 2006 Brosseau Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chalone)
"Soft, low-intensity aromas of raisin, marzipan and cedar announce a wine that's not in the best of shape. This feels jammy and lacking in foundation. Flavors of loamy berry, prune and raisin finish with a note of licorice.",85,Señorio de Valdiestro 2008 Reserva  (Rioja)
"This vibrant, savory white opens with alluring scents of pear, tropical fruit and a whiff of fragrant white flower. The round, medium-bodied palate shows white peach, golden apple and mineral. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors while an almond note backs up the finish.",90,Selva Capuzza 2015 San Vigilio  (Lugana)
"This special waxed-top reserve bottling shows deep aromas of cedar and sandalwood along with black plum and allspice on the nose. Black cherry pops on the sip with lots of nutmeg spice, but it's the evenly distributed acidity and firm tannins that ensure a long life. Drink now through 2029.",94,Flying Goat Cellars 2014 Rita's Reserve Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"A well-balanced Chardonnay, this has flavors of tropical fruit, apricot and lemon candy, brightened by that famous Edna Valley acidity. This would make for a great apéritif.",87,Mount Eden Vineyards 2010 Wolff Vineyard Chardonnay (Edna Valley)
"This comes from a single vineyard—Folie Hill—and shows the pinpoint flavors that such wines can deliver. Cherries and milk chocolate, with light notes of dried herbs, sail across the palate. It's drinking well and needs no further cellaring.",88,Lundeen 2012 Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Alluring scents of apple and Alpine wildflower float over to the bright but slender palate along with notes of pear and mineral. Brisk acidity gives it a clean, crisp finish.",86,Franz Haas 2014 Lepus Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
"Bouncy, rubbery berry aromas come with latex and Band-Aid scents. A wiry, crisp mouthfeel sets up limited but spunky red-fruit flavors that are also a bit herbal and stalky. A briny finish shows juicy acidity but mediocre flavors.",84,Señorío de Sotillo 2013 Joven  (Ribera del Duero)
"This lovely blend of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah and Grenache is hearty and robust, with lavender, garrigue, black pepper and cinnamon aromas. Its velvety texture gives way to rich blueberry cobbler flavors peppered with firewood smoke notes, recalling a winter's night.",93,The Tribe 2015 Proprietary Red (Sonoma County)
"This is a robustly built, densely packed and velvety wine with smooth layers of integrated oak. Tannins provide the power and foundation behind its crisp blue fruit and dried herb flavors, seasoned with cola and black pepper spice.",92,FEL 2014 Hirsch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"A blending of one-third Pinot Noir gives body and raspberry-strawberry flavors to this rosé, while the balance of Chardonnay brings elegance, bright acidity and tantalizing notes of oranges and limes. It's a lovely wine to drink now.",90,Mumm Napa NV Brut Reserve Rosé Sparkling (Napa Valley)
"An unusual blend of Tempranillo and Ruby Cabernet, this New Mexico red blend is a touch overripe with soft, cooked prune and cherry compote flavors. Hints of violet and tobacco leaf are pretty, but overall, there's a flatness in the midpalate that could use some fine-tuning.",84,La Chiripada 2009 Vintners' Reserve Red Red (New Mexico)
"This lacks the smooth and sensual mouthfeel that's normal for Merlot. Instead, this is sharp, with a green flavor. While it's properly dry, it lacks richness.",82,Frei Brothers 2010 Reserve Merlot (Dry Creek Valley)
"Match this easy wine with brick oven pizza on sourdough crust or juicy grilled sausage. Made with the Dolcetto grape, the wine is loaded with bright fruit tones of blueberry and black cherry and offers a thick, creamy mouthfeel.",87,Clavesana 2008 Il Clou di Clavesana  (Dolcetto di Dogliani)
"Aromas of rose petals and fresh-hoed earth come to the fore as this wine opens, followed by fine-grained, intense tannins and savory wooded notes. Black pepper, red cherry, sea salt and dried herb pop at different times. It's still tight, so let this wine open in the glass or decant; better yet, cellar through 2023.",92,Siduri 2013 Hirsch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview)
"This barrel-fermented Sémillon deftly mixes smoky toast with rich and deep fruit flavors of melon and grapefruit. Exceptionally concentrated and full-bodied, it carries forward into this new vintage the well-established style of Ardenvoir's unique take on Washington Sémillon.",92,Ardenvoir 2009 Sémillon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Notes of apple, yellow peach and pear are savory in tone in this unoaked Chardonnay. Dry in style, it's delicately concentrated with soft tangerine acidity. The finish is brisk but clean.",86,Harbes Family Vineyard 2014 Steel Fermented Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island)
"This is rich and generously spiced, smelling and tasting like chocolate, vanilla, smoke and blackberries. Aging for 19 months in American and French oak certainly boosted the spices. It tastes full-bodied, very deep and almost sweet in flavor, with moderate tannins to lend some support.",88,Mettler Family Vineyards 2012 Epicenter Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi)
"Muffled, shy aromas are redolent of cherries, dried flowers and pear drops. Soft and rounded, the palate has a sweet quality about its core, with mild acids and a dusting of tannins.",83,Les Bourgeois NV Fleur du Vin Fruity Semi Dry Red (Missouri)
"By the sheer fact that this wine costs $6 and never really goes up in price, it holds onto its tenuous value status via clean tropical aromas and mild flavors of lime, pineapple and citrus. It's a touch hot and burning on the finish, but finish isn't what you're banking on with a wine like this. Imported by Freixenet, USA.",83,René Barbier NV Mediterranean White White (Catalunya)
"Made with 90% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% each Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this wine offers a bouquet of black cherry, green pepper and toast. There is a nice balance of fruit and cooling herb flavors, featuring blackberry, eucalyptus, anisette and espresso bean. Lingering, velvety tannins continue on the palate until a final burst of cranberry on the finish.",90,Tulip Winery 2011 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Galilee)
"Nicely focused, with a core of wild strawberry and black cherry, this bears herb and pepper highlights common to Oregon Pinot. It has a nice mouthfeel and is balanced throughout.",90,Gresser 2009 Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"This medium-bodied wine is fresh and fruity, but also polished and sophisticated. It smells like raspberries and black plums, then adds chocolate and blackberry in the flavors. Rich and flavorful it also has welcome firm tannins and fruit acidity to keep it lively. Grenache is the leading grape ingredient.",89,Fenestra 2010 Estate Infrared Red (Livermore Valley)
"This is a rich wine, with a texture that's comfortably cushioned by ripe cherry and plum flavors. It's a wine to savor now, full and fruity.",87,Georges Duboeuf 2013 Domaine Pignard  (Beaujolais)
"Clarendon Hills is best known for its Syrah and Grenache, but it is no slouch when it comes to McLaren Vale Cabernet. The 2008 Hickinbotham is full bodied and velvety in texture, with ample notes of cocoa and crisp cassis. Hints of mint and other herbal shadings give it varietal character and welcome complexity. Drink it over the next 10–12 years.",92,Clarendon Hills 2008 Hickinbotham Cabernet Sauvignon (Clarendon)
"Aromas of toast, oak, espresso and a whiff of rubber lead the nose and carry over to the firm palate, along with dried black cherry and oak driven spice. It's still tightly wound, with an astringent finish. Give it another year or two for the tannins to unclench then drink sooner rather than later.",88,Camparo 2011 Boiolo  (Barolo)
"A Right Bank Bordeaux-style blend, 45% Cabernet Franc and 55% Merlot. The fruit is marginally ripe but thin, and there is a watery character to the midpalate. Flavors of tart berries are set against lemony acids; tannins are insubstantial and the wine feels a bit weightless in the finish.",84,Lost River 2006 Cedarosa Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A velvety texture makes this varietal wine luxurious. Cassis, tar and clove notes mingle with dried herb and black olive flavors, all integrated and deliciously graceful. Its robust tannins soften as it progresses toward a long finish.",94,Nickel & Nickel 2014 John C. Sullenger Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"Funky aromas of farmyard, tire rubber and fetid flowers waft from the glass of this Nero d'Avola. The muddled palate offers stewed prune, overripe black plum and oaky vanilla alongside bitter, green sensations of old sage. Panebianco, Vinity.",84,Armosa 2008 Curma Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"Trisaetum produces both a dry and an off-dry cuvée from each of its three estate vineyards, as well as two versions of an Estates Reserve. Richer and bigger overall than the individual cuvées, this dry bottling is smooth and round, with a palate-pleasing blend of citrus flesh and peel, notably orange. There's tangerine and spice as well, and the wine continues bright and long through a most engaging finish.",94,Trisaetum 2014 Estates Reserve Dry Riesling (Willamette Valley)
"From one of the villages that lies behind the primary Chardonnay vineyards of the Côte de Beaune, this is already smooth, fruity and perfumed. It has attractive acidity and a rich, baked apple character that is pointed up by the layer of toastiness. Drink now, although the wine will be better from 2017.",88,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2013 Sous le Château  (Saint-Romain)
"Slightly sweet on the nose, but wheaty and grassy too. It tastes like clay and bubble gum, with a touch of peach and citrus. It's acidic on the finish.",80,Vinisterra 2011 Dominó Cinsault (San Antonio de las Minas Valley)
"Soft and ripe, this young wine is already to drink. Light tannins and a touch of spice give it just the right amount of richness from this good vintage. The wine is filled with red berries and is ready to drink.",85,Les Vignerons Réunis de Monségur 2015 Belle Prairie  (Bordeaux)
"Aromas of blackberry extract, leather, prune and a whiff of carob lead the nose and follow through to the dense palate along with a note of bitter chocolate. It's simple but well made, with solid, rounded tannins.",86,Villa Pozzi 2014 Nero d'Avola (Terre Siciliane)
"Aromas include white spring flowers, tropical fruit and a hint of graphite. The juicy palate offers green apples, white peach and melon alongside fresh acidity. Delicate almond marks the close.",87,Montonale 2012 Montunal  (Lugana)
"This is a rich, finely structured wine. It is highly perfumed, packed with black fruits and has a dark, firm texture. At the same time, the acidity is intense and the structure tight, suggesting a wine to age. Beautifully endowed with great fruit, it will take time to develop. Drink from 2026.",97,Vieux Château Certan 2014  Pomerol
"This is a perfumed, fragrant wine. Its acidity is offset by the red berry and currant fruits that add freshness to the dry, crisp character. It's a full wine, with good fruit depth and ripe flavors, and will be better with food. Drink now.",87,Jean Reverdy et Fils 2014 Les Villots Rosé (Sancerre)
"A decent value in New Zealand Pinot Noir, the 2008 Wild Rock displays aromas of bright if somewhat simple cherry fruit. On the palate, this is a medium-bodied, supple wine; the cherry and plum flavors show only modest complexity, perhaps a hint of hickory smoke. Drink now.",86,Wild Rock 2008 Cupids Arrow Pinot Noir (Central Otago)
"Honeyed lemon and white floral notes are bright,brisk and breezy on the nose and palate of this exceptionally refreshing off-dry Riesling. It's nervy with acidity and steely minerality, with a delicate spritz that gives the palate extra effervescence and vibe.",90,Dr. Hermann 2011 H Riesling (Mosel)
"Varietally correct aromas of cured ham, honeysuckle blossom and orange peel are fair and solid. This is a bit flat in feel, without much zest or snap. Flavors of green banana and lightly bitter green fruits fall off quickly on the finish.",86,Siegel 2016 Special Reserve Viognier (Colchagua Valley)
"Exceedingly dry berry aromas register as scratchy and woody. This is intense and grabby in feel, with minty strawberry and raspberry flavors that run heavy with oak. A minty, dry, peppery finish is a touch hot.",86,Telmo Rodríguez 2012 LZ  (Rioja)
"Full bodied and richly tannic, this gives lie to the notion that all Grenache-based blends are easy quaffers. Dried spices and mixed berries include hints of clove and cracked pepper, finishing with some dry, chewy tannins. The assemblage is 49% Grenache, 29% Shiraz and 22% Mourvèdre. Drink 2020–2030.",91,Yangarra Estate Vineyard 2013 G-S-M (McLaren Vale)
"A feminine, almost soft Pinot Noir, this opens nicely with scents of roses, red fruits, and pine forest. Despite its light color, it has plenty of grip and density in the mouth, even bringing some streaks of light milk chocolate into the finish.",89,Chehalem 2008 3 Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"The bouquet of this kabinett is so exuberantly floral and peachy, the delicate palate struggles to keep up. It's firm with minerality, but a bit soft in acidic structure. Finishes moderately long, with a honeyed, floral touch.",86,C.H. Berres 2011 Erdener Treppchen Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"White-fruit aromas and a prickly scent of cactus or nettle opens this tight, citrusy old-vines Verdejo. Matching the aromas, this tastes of pithy citrus, grapefruit and green herbs. A racy finish fades out nicely.",89,Vetus 2016 Flor de Vetus Old Vines From Segovia Verdejo (Rueda)
"Earthy game, truffle, underbrush, used leather and dark-skinned fruit aromas lead the nose. They carry over to the taut, tightly wound palate, where austere, dusty tannins leave a drying finish.",88,Belpoggio 2012  Brunello di Montalcino
"Representing a breathtaking advancement over the '07, Sinatra's 2008 Cab is simply delicious. It's fleshy and fat in texture, with a glyceriney richness that makes it almost oily and that, when combined with caramelized oak, turns into nougat. The blackberry, cherry and cassis fruit flavors rise to the occasion. This is truly a stunningly good Cabernet.",95,Sinatra Family 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Tight and tart, this is packed with concentrated, high-acid flavors of cranberry and raspberry. The wine is young and fresh, with both grip and depth, and should age nicely through 2019–2021.",89,Coelho 2012 Atração Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"While grapefruit and lychee aromas are fresh and clean on the nose, the palate of this full-bodied Gewürztraminer is a bit muted by comparison. It's texturally rich, but flavors suggest pressed apple and pear accented by hints of ginger and spice. Drink now through 2018.",85,Rooster Hill 2015 Estate Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes)
"This wine is ripe, packed with tropical fruit and rich acidity. A hint of vanilla has rounded the wine out, giving a full body to the delicious fruitiness. Opulent and generous, it is kept in order by final, aromatic acidity. Drink from 2016.",91,Terroirs et Talents 2013 Cuvée Claude Brosse  (Saint-Véran)
"Dark cherry and vanilla aromas swirl around crisper flavors of rhubarb in this tight, leathery wine made in a restrained, savory style. Made for the table, it'll suit many meals with versatile aplomb.",88,Stickybeak 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A light and fruity wine that has bright black fruits and an edge of tannins. The black currant and acidity give the wine its fruity character, typical of the vintage. Drink now.",85,Château Bellevue 2014  Bordeaux
"Pleasing aromatics send up a mix of cherry, black tea and clean earth. The wine is tannic and substantial, with ripe black cherry fruit and a streak of caramel.",92,Owen Roe 2012 Anna's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"This wine has structure and ripe black fruits. It is made to be drunk young, with plenty of berry fruits and soft tannins. Drink from 2019.",86,Quinta do Portal 2015 Tinta Barroca (Douro)
"Raw pastry dough, blackberry jam and vanilla aromatics are offset by cigar box and leather notes. Compared to Rappahannock's nonreserve 2010 Cabernet Franc, this wine feels warmer due to its alcohol, which is more than 1% higher than the nonreserve bottling. The palate is chewy and muscular, with flavors of dried rose petal and espresso that surface late.",87,Rappahannock Cellars 2010 Reserve Cabernet Franc (Virginia)
"On first take, this smells a bit chunky and like stewed plum. The palate is firm and tannic, with roasted plum and berry flavors that are more savory than fruity. On the finish, a spicy beef-jerky flavor vies for attention with raw tannins. Drink through 2020.",91,Bodega Furlotti 2011 Finca Adalgisa Malbec (Luján de Cuyo)
"This easy-going Prosecco opens with a fresh bouquet of white flowers, citrus, peach and talc powder. The mouthfeel is crisp, fresh and very informal.",85,Trevisana NV Santiquaranta Extra Dry  (Prosecco)
There's a deep smoky element here that is offset by bright tones of cherry and blackberry. This is a wine that would pair beautifully at an outdoor barbecue with hamburgers and baby back ribs.,87,Corte Lenguin 2007  Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso
"The almost 100-acre vineyard of Brillette is situated at one of the highest points in Moulis. Ripe and generously structured, this concentrated wine has layers of blackberry fruits and solid tannins. It will age well, with its fresh acidity and dry core. Drink from 2019.",89,Château Brillette 2013  Moulis-en-Médoc
"Part of a Limited Release series, this is an all-stainless Chardonnay. Ripe, tart and focused, it offers spicy bursts of yellow and green fruits, and it shows a sur lie-derived texture. The pinpoint details are gorgeous.",91,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2011 Unoaked Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This Malbec is lush with flavors of ripe blueberries, blackberry jam, mocha and cassis all wrapped up with toasty oak. There's fine acidity and rich tannins as well. It's one of the best examples of the variety in California, and endlessly enjoyable through a long, spicy finish. Kudos to winemaker/owner Kenny Kahn.",94,Blue Rock 2010 Best Barrels Malbec (Alexander Valley)
"A deliciously  crisp and fresh wine with some good concentrated fruit, but more attractive acidity. There is just a hint of spice, but freshness is what this wine is all about.",87,Machherndl 2006 Kollmitz Federspiel Riesling (Wachau)
"This SB delivers citrus peel, grass and other common varietal aromas. The feel is a touch flabby and soft despite modest acidity, while flavors of citrus fruits and green herbs finish round and long.",86,Michel Torino 2013 Ciclos Fume Sauvignon Blanc (Cafayate)
The crispness of this wine is balanced by the intensely ripe fruit. Together the wine has concentration as well as a bright texture that makes it refreshing. The wine is ready to drink.,88,Jean-Paul Picard 2015 Le Chemin de Marloup  (Sancerre)
"Powerful, concentrated wine, a very solid Cabernet-dominated wine. It has dark tannins, the black currant fruit still hiding in the background. Dark and dense, it's destined for good aging, at least over the next six years.",90,Château Tourteran 2010  Haut-Médoc
"This gorgeous sparkler offers enticing scents of white stone fruit and spring flower. Vibrant and silky, the smooth elegant, palate delivers crisp apple, creamy white peach and juicy nectarine set against bright acidity and an ultrarefined perlage.",93,Villa Sandi 2016 Vigna La Rivetta Brut  (Valdobbiadene Superiore di Cartizze)
"Rich and soft, this wine is all black fruit, soft tannins and fragrant acidity. It's already attractive, full of warm fruitiness, and can be drunk from 2015.",86,Casaleiro 2013 Red (Tejo)
"Notes of cedar, paper and leather carry to the cassis laden palate, with meat juices and a hint of plum. Light in weight, with talcy tannins, this wine is straightforward and an easy drinking entertainer.",87,Robertson Winery 2002 Cabernet Sauvignon (Robertson)
"A blend of typical Alentejo grapes, this is a firm effort, with the fruit laced inbetween the complex tannic structure. The acidity gives the wine a final lift.",88,Herdade do Esporão 2010 4 Quatro Castas Red (Alentejano)
"Fine fruits, red-berry flavors and crisp acidity give this wine a fine balance and immediate attraction. It is lively with its bright texture and finishing acidity. Drink from 2017.",86,Château Sainte Barbe 2014 Merlot du Château Sainte Barbe  (Bordeaux)
"Grippy in wound-up black fruit and black pepper, this is a ripe, bright and softly layered wine, completely in keeping with its old-vine status in dusty, complex notes. Spicy cinnamon and leathery pepper combine on the lengthy finish. Drink now through 2021.",92,Seghesio 2013 Old Vine Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
"Fruity in a grapy, plummy way, this is a substantial wine with deceptively sweet undertones that finishes dry and with a slight tang of black tea.",86,Ministry of the Vinterior 2013 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Big and dry, this wine shows the tannic, firm character of the vintage. It has a dark, dense core of wood tannins while the juicy black currant fruit is still developing. The wine needs to age, so drink from 2018.",88,Château Teyssier 2011  Montagne-Saint-Émilion
"There's a lot of funk and animal hide on the nose of this earthy Toro. The palate is so concentrated it's like syrup, while flavors of leafy, earthy berry fruits are accented by chocolate and pepper. This finishes toasty, oaky and spicy, but also heavy and sticky.",88,Elias Mora 2011  Toro
"Shows a certain aggressiveness, offering up vibrant raspberry and cherry fruit, cola, mocha and oak flavors, but kept aloof by its acidity and tannins. It's certainly elegant and pedigreed, but it need 3–4 years in the cellar.",93,Merry Edwards 2010 Georganne Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Dusty cherry and red-plum aromas are simple and clean. A fresh, tight, normal feeling palate gets the job done, while flavors of cantaloupe, red plum and nectarine wrap up with pithy citrus notes and a hint of bitterness. Drink this year.",86,Marqués de Cáceres 2014 Rosado (Rioja)
"A very earthy Pinot Noir from the gorgeous Oppenlander Vineyard. The wine—from mostly Pommard clones—is a heady mix of aromatic mushrooms growing in dirt and bright cherry-strawberry notes, finished by a lilting lift of rose petal and supple spice. An elegant wine that would be tempting to drink early and often.",92,Couloir 2010 Oppenlander Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino County)
"A severity of tannin and heat opens this wine before mellowing into soft, juicy red raspberry and plum. Remaining relatively light bodied and restrained for the variety, it becomes softer on the chocolaty midpalate before a grippy finish grabs back the power.",88,Byington 2013 Smith Vineyards Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley)
"Very perfumed, this is a spicy Traminer with an amount of sweetness. The wine is ripe and rounded, with dominant tropical fruit. The acidity cuts through the richness. Screwcap.",87,Dürnberg 2011 Altes Kreuz Traminer (Niederösterreich)
"This wine has attractive fruit, crisp acidity and a good balance with the light tannic structure. Bright and fresh wine, it is ready to drink. This is one of the Ducourt family properties on the Right Bank of Bordeaux.",84,Château la Rose du Pin 2013  Bordeaux
"Nettle and celery aromas come in front of a citrusy, tight palate housing lemony acidity. This tastes mostly of lime, green apple and green herbs, while the finish introduces a lettuce-like flavor to go with racy lasting acidity.",88,12 Linajes 2014 Verdejo (Rueda)
"Smoky, rich, this wine packs a powerful punch of vibrant black cherry fruits, and generous sweet tannins. It is big, muscular, the structure wide and open. It shows richness and opulence, brought into line by a firm, youthful structure that needs five years or more to age.",95,Bouchard Père & Fils 2006  Echézeaux
"This is an attractive, ready-to-drink wine, a blend of Arinto and Fernão Pires. Bright and fruity with plenty of citrus freshness, it is lightly crisp and fresh at the end.",85,Quinta da Alorna 2014 White (Tejo)
"Aromas of mulberry, savory herb, green tea, vanilla and spice lead to medium-bodied, easy-drinking cherry flavors.",87,Sawtooth 2011 Sawtooth Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon
"A powerful and concentrated wine, this shows the region's dark and tannic side. The black plum and juicy black-currant flavors shine, and wood aging has smoothed the palate, which makes it feel dense and fully mature.",92,Wines & Winemakers 2008 Aguia Moura Em Vinhas Velhas Reserva Red (Douro)
"Cherry and berry aromas are touched up by oak-based vanilla, coconut and spice accents. While this is a bit choppy in feel, with citric-leaning acidity, flavors of red-berry fruits, smoky oak and coffee are nice despite a hint of heat and scour.",87,6cepas6 2013  Rioja
"This is a strawberry-pink-colored wine with candied flavors balanced by acidity. It is fruity, crisp and light in character.",84,Château Lamothe-Vincent 2015 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
"A rich and opulent wine, very ripe, packed with luscious blackberry and damson fruit as well as sweet tannins. It is a fruit salad of fruit flavors given structure by a core of dryness. Already a gorgeous wine, but one that will also age.",95,Château Rauzan-Ségla 2009  Margaux
"This is made from a majority of Cabernet Franc, with sizable additions of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot. Mint and bay leaf curry favor on the nose, while a severity of oak hits the palate.",84,White Rock Vineyards 2013 Claret (Napa Valley)
"Aromas of tropical fruit, pressed wild flower and ripe orchard fruit lead the nose. The round savory palate offers juicy peach, red Bartlett pear and a white almond note. Energizing mineral lifts the creamy flavors.",90,Gini 2015  Soave Classico
"Right Bank employs 72% Cabernet Franc to make a statement, accenting it with 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Malbec, 3% Merlot and 1% Petit Verdot. Herbal and pretty, this full-bodied wine remains tight in its youth, the tannins firm and powerful, barely letting in the mouthful of red cherry that awaits. Drink now through 2021.",91,Medlock Ames 2013 Right Bank Red Red (Alexander Valley)
"There is an aromatic, herbal lift among the full-fruited nose of this wine that is reminiscent of freshly peeled curls of ripe Cox Orange Pippin apples. The palate adds a pleasantly bitter, slightly phenolic edge that gives texture and and counterbalance to the soaring freshness of the citrus and apple notes. Concentration and power come in a compact, taut package that is likely to unfold a little more with bottle age. It finishes with the rich and honest flavor of crisp, ripe apples. Compelling now but it will be even better. Drink 2017–2030.",93,Domaine Ostertag 2014 Clos Mathis Riesling (Alsace)
"A big, ripe and juicy wine packed with black fruit notes and laced with acidity. The tannins offer a contrast to the fruitiness, bringing balance and structure. This is an impressive wine, the smoky aftertaste bringing out the wood aging.",91,Château Manon la Lagune 2010  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux
"Bright cherry and blueberry notes combine with hints of leather, earth, crushed pepper and grapeseed on the nose of this bottling. It's relatively light in body, showing peppery verve on the palate plus blueberry-elderberry fruit and bay-leaf herbals.",89,Clos La Chance 2012 JoLi Meritage (Central Coast)
"Charming and perfumed, with notes of musk, white flowers and wild grapes on the nose and exotic spices in the mouth. This is not a concentrated wine, but there's enough acidity here to balance the slight sweetness and to make it a refreshing apéritif. Drink up.",84,Messina Hof 2009 Muscat Canelli (Texas)
"Bacon, rubber and berry fruit aromas comprise the bouquet. Feels crisp on the palate, with roasted berry flavors and herb and pepper accents. It feels warm on the finish, with herbal leanings and some roughness.",86,Scala Dei 2008 Prior Red (Priorat)
"A sound, everyday Pinot Grigio, with good citrus and spice flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Gets the nod for simple richness.",84,Glen Ellen 2010 Pinot Grigio (California)
"Aromas of cranberry and berry are fresh and juicy. The flavors are tart and supple, showing depth and length. It's delicious in its own right but will shine on the dinner table.",90,Wind Rose 2012 Barbera (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Sweet and extracted in pineapple, tangerine, lime and vanilla flavors, this Chardonnay also is generously oaked, which gives it even richer vanilla and buttered toast notes. It's flashy, yet would benefit from greater dryness and restraint. Size isn't everything.",86,Anaba 2009 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"Tastes as ripe, bright and spicy as it smells, with intense, pure flavors of raspberry, strawberry and cherry essence dusted with crushed white pepper, cinnamon and vanilla. Drink this light-bodied, savory young Pinot now and over the next year or two.",88,Gundlach Bundschu 2010 Heritage Selection Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Only in California's warmer regions will you find the enormously ripe cherries and blackberries this Cabernet offers. It's as sweet as jam. Likeable, even opulent, but would benefit from greater dryness and structure.",86,Joseph Family 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"An excellent wine from the great Heiligenstein Vineyard. Its perfumed character is full of rich pear and peach flavors, with the cut of intense citrus. The tense mineral texture promises good aging. Screwcap.",91,Allram 2010 Heiligenstein Erste Lage Reserve Riesling (Kamptal)
"This rich, oak-driven Merlot from Sicily opens with bright cherry and blueberry backed by toasted almond, leather and pipe tobacco. There's a raw or chewy note in the mouth that will soften with a few more months of bottle aging.",89,Baglio di Pianetto 2006 Salici Merlot (Sicilia)
"This is a clean and bright selection, with pure notes of green melon, apple and fresh herbs. The lively palate offers lime peel and grassy tones that finish clean on the finish. It's an approachable and easy-drinking wine best enjoyed now.",87,Spier 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape)
"Attractive fresh fruit, crisp apples and vivid acidity make a great citrus wine, perfect as an apéritif.",86,Gritsch Mauritiushof 2009 Kalmuck Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"As is most often the case with Sangiovese, this comes across as a pleasant, rather generic red wine that could be almost anything. The fruit tastes of light cherry and plum, with a rather sour finish. Tannins are earthy and there is a hint of sweaty saddle as well.",83,Maryhill 2005 Proprietor's Reserve Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This charming and refreshing wine has aromas like green apples. Richer flavors that suggest white peach accompany a tangy but smooth texture. Light to medium bodied, it is perfect for lunch or pre-dinner drinking.",87,The White Doe 2013 White (California)
"You'll find this Pinot Noir drier, earthier, tarter and even more tannic than most coastal bottlings. It has flavors of cherry skins, black raspberries, cola, peppery spices and herbs. Drink now–2010.",87,Clos du Val 2006 Pinot Noir (Napa Valley)
"A blend of young vines fruit gives a very soft, gently rounded wine with only the lightest of depth. The fruit is full, the flavors show some spice, while yellow fruit tastes roll around underneath. Drink now.",87,Vincent 2006 Marie Antoinette  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
"As sweet as a dessert pastry, with vanilla, cream, toast, butter and pineapple jam flavors. Vibrant acidity provides balance just in time.",85,Michael Pozzan 2010 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This is a good yet basic Merlot with baked berry aromas. The mouthfeel is more lively and raw in feel, with modest berry and spice flavors that hit quick and hollow at just as quickly. A standard finish is fine but doesn't evolve.",86,Santa Carolina 2011 Reserva Merlot (Colchagua Valley)
Sweet candied apple overpowers this oddly textured and flavored wine.,82,Tedeschi Family 2014 Truchard Vineyard Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"This impressive wine, packed with both fruit and tannins, is just setting out on a long road of aging. It is rich, dense with dry fruit and wood tannins, and buttressed with dark black fruits layered with acidity. The wine, with its ripe fruit and firm structure, needs time. Drink from 2018.",93,Conceito Vinhos 2013 Conceito Red (Douro)
"Wild red berries, crushed pepper, lilacs and a frame of asphalt show on the exuberant nose of this bottling. The palate is loaded with meat, smoke, cedar, charcoal and easy boysenberry flavors, the perfect pairing for a hamburger. It is a tad light in body, especially since it hasaged for so many years.",89,DeTierra Vineyards 2010 Russell Estate Merlot (Monterey)
"This is a solid, chunky wine, rich in dark blackberry and and red plum flavors. Maybe the tannins are too hard at this stage, but its weight and rich fruit suggest aging potential. Drink from 2016..",89,Château du Cros 2011 Clos Bourbon  (Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux)
"Simple and fruity, with upfront blackberry jam, cherry, currant and cocoa flavors, wrapped into fine, smooth tannins. Tasty, but lacks definition and complexity.",85,Cobblestone 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Amber honey and peach jam aromas are in the forefront of this passito-style wine. Marmalade, praline and African honeybush tea fold into button mushroom notes in the background. These translate onto the palate effortlessly. The acidity feels sprightly and lifts this lucious wine. The finish is long and luxurious.",88,Barboursville Vineyards 2013 Passito White (Virginia)
"A big, toasty wine, full of ripe, delicious fruit, veering toward opulence. There are open yellow fruits along with toast and butter tastes. This is almost ready to drink now; only the acidity promises some aging.",90,Pascal Bouchard 2006 Fourchaume Vieilles Vignes Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"The yellow-fruited richness of mirabelle compote with a touch of vanilla becomes apparent on the nose. The palate is just as luscious as promised but also carries a welcome, thrilling streak of lemon oil at its core, brightening and framing the medium-sweetness with its zesty lift. A touch of pleasant phenolic bitterness can just about be felt, adding dimension to the palate. This is intriguing and exciting in the way it plays with richness and sweetness while keeping them on a very tight rein. Lovely. Drink 2017–2027.",94,Domaine Pfister 2013 Engelberg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"An aromatic wine, it has notes of tangerine and mineral. It drinks medium sweet (10 g/L residual sugar), with the sugar getting just a bit out in front of the acids.",87,Cave B 2013 Riesling (Ancient Lakes)
"With some blackberry, cassis and oak flavors, this is a pretty good wine. It's a little green, and the acidity is sharp. Drink up.",85,Edna Valley Vineyard 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast)
"Ripe fruit tones of raspberry jam and blackberry jelly open the bouquet giving this Brunello a plump, sun-kissed personality. It shows a dark garnet color in the glass and has flavors of toasted espresso bean, tobacco, leather and spice with aromatic vanilla endnotes.",90,Poggio Nardone 2008  Brunello di Montalcino
"This is a tannic while richly fruity wine, showing ripe warm-climate Cabernet Sauvignon flavors. Blackberries and dusty tannins are to the fore, giving a firm structure, fine juiciness and a dense texture. The wine could age, so drink from 2016.",90,Fiuza 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Tejo)
"Forward and spicy, this puts some muscle into the Merlot with earthy, tongue-gripping tannins. The fruit has a sweet tomato flavor, with a streak of cherry candy. Though not entirely knit together, it's a pleasant drink best enjoyed young.",86,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2008 Indian Wells Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Classic varietal aromas of tomato leaf, exotic fruit and citrus practically jump out of the glass. The bright palate doles out juicy peach, nectarine, grapefruit, celery and sage while a mineral vein lends energy.",91,Vie di Romans 2015 Piere Sauvignon (Friuli Isonzo)
"A robust, very ripe style of red wine, this is deep in color and packed with fruity flavors that tend toward prune and raisin. A taste of celery comes up on the finish. Though not high in alcohol it feels full-bodied and rich in texture, and rather heavy.",85,Saracina 2011 Skid Row Vineyard Malbec (Mendocino County)
"This stellar wine has a huge yum factor. Deliciously ripe and spicy, it's loaded with cranberry and raspberry fruit. There's an underlying tang of pink grapefruit acidity, along with aromatic highlights of violets and rose petals. Drink now through 2022.",93,Cowhorn 2013 21 Grenache (Applegate Valley)
"Purple as can be, with grapey aromas that aren't subtle in the least. Typically thick, with mild tannins and shy, almost reserved berry, cassis and chocolaty oak flavors. Dense wine, but not as expressive and deeply flavored as previous vintages. Drink now through 2011.",90,Viu Manent 2007 Viu 1 Malbec (Colchagua Valley)
"This is a bright, medium-bodied wine with a thickness of creamy vanilla that makes it seem slightly sweet, built atop crisper shocks of lime zest and orange peel. Ultimately it finishes smooth and velvety, a nice match for the table.",88,Davis Estates 2013 Private Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford)
"Medium-gold to the eye, this wine has aromas of white peach and bitter almond. There is an almost beer-like flavor profile, including peach, apple, hops and floral notes. Ever-present but not overpowering tannins and a bright, lingering finish make for an appealing and interesting wine.",89,Orgo 2014 Rkatsiteli (Kakheti)
"This unique blend of Dundee Hill Pinot Noir and Walla Walla Syrah seduces instantly with a bouquet redolent of smoke and licorice, tobacco and vanilla. Though it's Syrah that seems dominant, adding flavors of supple purple fruits to the aromatic mix, it seems apparent that the Pinot Noir component extends the finish, turning a potent and powerful wine into one that exits with delicacy and breeding.",93,Domaine Serene 2013 Grand Cheval Pinot Noir-Syrah (Oregon)
"Tasted at their regular release date less than a year after the vintage, the Tahbilk Marsannes aren't terribly expressive. The key is bottle age, and this Museum Release has it. Lemon custard and thyme are tinged with hints of toast and marmalade in this medium-bodied white. A touch of creaminess on the midpalate extends through a long finish.",92,Tahbilk 2009 Museum Release Marsanne (Nagambie Lakes)
"Complex and showing so much of what we love about Ribera del Duero. Baking spices, mature fruit and leather grace the stately bouquet, while the palate sings a pretty tune of berries, plum and brown sugar. There's thrust and potency to the mouthfeel but also a toasty, rich, mocha character. Drinking good now but should hold in there for another five to eight years.",92,Alidis 2001 Gran Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)
"Full, rich wine, with a concentrated structure to go with the pineapple and apple juice flavors. Still young, the wine should age for a year, to fill out the structure and give final richness.",91,Guy Saget 2010 Le Domaine  (Pouilly-Fumé)
"Enticing aromas of wisteria, Spanish broom and a whiff of pear emerge in the glass. The crisp, creamy palate is loaded with finesse, delivering white peach, nectarine zest, apple and a mineral note. Vibrant acidity brightens the creamy flavors while a foamy mousse gives it a smooth texture.",90,Vettori NV Extra Dry  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"This wine may have potential in the years to come, but is still searching for its soul at this young age. Aromas of dried black cherries and strawberries meet with black tea, juniper and a touch of tar on the nose. The palate is framed in a foamy acidity, offering plum and squeezed blackberry fruit, but dominated with a very herbal character that's still integrating.",88,Alexander-Smith 2014 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"This feels sharp and raw, with ripe, jammy blackberry and cherry flavors, plus a streak of sweet, toasty oak. Drink now.",85,Shadowbox 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Round, superripe aromas of earthy black plum come in front of a tannic palate. Earthy baked-cherry and black-plum flavors finish with licorice root and baking spice notes along with gripping tannins. Drink through 2019.",89,Bodega Las Cañitas 2010 Juan Cruz Navarro Torre Gran Malbec (Argentina)
"With 80% Chardonnay barrel-fermented and 20% Pinot Noir from vat, this prestige cuvée is ripe, with the fruit softening towards a more mature character. A tang of orange zest gives a crisp texture that contrasts with the spicy, rich aftertaste. The wine from the family's small vineyards in the Marne Valley is still developing; drink from 2018.",91,Liebart-Régnier 2010 Confidencia Brut  (Champagne)
"Tart in acidity, with cranberry, sour cherry candy and smoky, sweet vanilla flavors. It's an easy wine, at an easy price.",85,Sterling 2010 Vintner's Collection Merlot (Central Coast)
"At the risk of overgeneralizing, Martinborough Sauvignons typically show less overt herbal characters than their Marlborough counterparts. At least, that's the case for this medium-bodied wine. White grapefruit, stone fruit and underripe melon notes finish crisp and clean.",87,Palliser Estate 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Martinborough)
"Floral scents spring from the glass, followed by a graceful mix of flavors: rose petals, pomegranate and red berries. This elegant wine seduces as it winds through a long finish, with a creamy lick of caramel to finish up.",93,Expression 44° 2013 Roserock Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"This Slovenian Ribolla Gialla has aromas of peach and vanilla, with flavors of freshly baked peach pie, canned apricots and green apple. It is soft on entry, rounded in the mouth and shows good minerality on the finish.",90,Colliano 2013 Estate Bottled Ribolla Gialla (Goriska Brda)
"In a style that is reminiscent of neighboring Jurançon, Pacherenc produces fruity, fragrant and fresh sweet wines. There is a touch of honey and tropical fruit that balances the acidity and the crispness. A wine for pâtés as well as desserts.",88,Producteurs Plaimont 2010 Château Arricau-Bordes  (Pacherenc du Vic Bilh)
"Feels a bit thick and heavy now, with jammy raspberry, cherry, mocha and sandalwood flavors, but so good, so pure that a few years in the cellar have to benefit. A splendid acid-tannin balance provides the framework for aging. Better after 2011.",93,La Fenêtre 2007 Calmant Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Slightly sweet flavors of concentrated strawberry preserves create a rather thick mouthfeel. It's a jammy style of Pinot, to be sure, but with just enough supporting acidity to keep it from crumbling under its own weight. Drink over the next two or three years.",88,Seufert 2012 Vine Idyl Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"L'Anima, which is Italian for “the soul,” is a blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon and Gewürztraminer, and it shows pretty aromas of white flower, honey and exotic fruit. The density and creaminess of the mouthfeel recall the wine's warm-climate Tuscan roots.",87,Livernano 2010 L'Anima White (Toscana)
"A powerful and dense wine, showing some rustic character, big red fruit and dark tannins. This superb wine has weight and concentration, balanced acidity and a growing sense of maturity. This wine from the legendary Mouchão estate needs considerable aging; drink from 2018.",95,Mouchão 2007 Red (Alentejano)
"This Pinot Gris is marching to the beat of its own drum, with some funky aromas and toast notes along with lemon and pear fruit. It's a tad volatile in the mouth but has some nice depth of flavor and a lingering cashew finish. Likeable for its originality.",86,Pewsey Vale 2008 Individual Vineyard Selection Pinot Gris (Eden Valley)
"Very rich in oak, with massive buttered toast, caramel and crème brûlée flavors. The underlying fruit is good, suggesting pineapples and ripe peaches, but misses a beat for all that winemaker intervention. Drink now.",88,Far Niente 2007 Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Lots of rich, ripe blackberry and cassis flavors in this dry, full-bodied Cabernet. It's quite scoury in youth, with strong, edgy tannins and a hit of zippy acidity. Give it 5–6 years in the cellar to begin to calm down.",89,Kissos 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This estate-grown Riesling is sourced from some of the oldest vines on Red Mountain—planted in 1975–1976. Lush and textural, it's both rich and elegant, with flavors of pink marshmallow, honeycomb, pear and meringue. It fills the mouth with pleasing confectionary flavors, fine layering and depth. Residual sugar is 13 g/L—still dry enough for most foods.",91,Kiona 2011 Reserve Dry Riesling (Red Mountain)
"Made entirely from Nebbiolo, Italy's most noble grape, this offers a fragrance of McIntosh apple, grapefruit and yellow peach. The palate displays an enticing depth of flavors including red cherry, strawberry and notes of cinnamon-spice alongside a refined and persistent perlage.",91,Parusso 2010 Metodo Classico Nebbiolo (Vino Spumante)
"A soft, strawberry flavored wine that is smooth and immediately attractive. Despite its low alcohol, it has a ripe feel to it from the rich fruit and the almost off-dry character. The acidity gently kicks in at the end.",85,Carayon la Rose 2015 Rosé (Languedoc)
"Earthy, rubbery red-berry aromas lead to a hard-drilling palate with fiery cherry flavors and an allotment of herbal mint. The hollow finish leaves a salty flavor and heat.",84,Domaine Jean Bousquet 2013 Made With Organically Grown Grapes Malbec (Tupungato)
"There's a softness to this dry wine. It's forward and rich in currants and smoky oak, but could use greater acidity. The tannins also seem a little ungainly, although they could mellow out in a few years.",87,Beringer 2004 St. Helena Home Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Loosen's best Dr. L to date, this is a terrific value, delivering typical Mosel Riesling notes at a great price. Citrus blossom, lime and crushed stone aromas are followed by apple and citrus flavors in this just-slightly-sweet wine. Drink it now and over the next year or so.",90,Loosen Bros. 2010 Dr. L Riesling (Mosel)
"Lightly scented, this medium-bodied white opens with whiffs of white spring flower and orchard fruit. The soft, round palate offers mature pear, citrus peel and a hint of toasted hazelnut.",87,Giacomo Vico 2015  Roero
"This is the workhorse grape of Champagne and some domestic sparklers. Very little is bottled as still wine in Oregon. It has Pinot Noir color with some similar aromas of cola and sassafras, but veers off into an earthier, almost musky direction all its own. The pretty cherry fruit calls out for duck or salmon.",90,Amalie Robert 2013 Pinot Meunier (Willamette Valley)
"A blend of Nerello Mascalese, Nerello Cappuccio, Nocera and Nero d'Avola, this polished wine conveys earthy aromas including violet, ripe berry, leather, game and baking spice. The savory palate doles out juicy black cherry, ripe raspberry, licorice, cinnamon and clove alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2016–2020.",94,Le Casematte 2012 Quattroenne  (Faro)
"This vineyard-designate Brunello opens with ripe tones of prune, thick blackberry fruit and lingering but subdued Indian spice. This is not an overblown or overly intense wine. Instead, the focus is on elegance and longevity.",91,Tiezzi 2006 Vigna Soccorso  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"A blend of Sangiovese, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this opens with tones of fruit, mild tobacco and spice. The wine's measured intensity and bright acidity make it a good choice for cheesy pasta dishes.",87,Tenuta del Buonamico 2010 Etichetta Blu Red (Montecarlo)
"The cool-climate-loving Alvarinho translates well to the coastal Lisboa region. It's rich and creamy, acidity well in hand and supporting the melon and citrus flavors. It's a delicious wine now, but it will age, so keep it until 2015.",88,DFJ Vinhos 2013 Grand'Arte Alvarinho (Lisboa)
"This attractive, family-owned estate has produced a fruity, crisp and light wine. With its orange-zest acidity, citrus fruits and a tight, mineral character, it is a light wine—bone dry with just a touch of pepper at the end.",86,Domaine Sarragousse 2015 Rosé (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence)
"This wine features a melding of concentrated fruit, toasty oak and toffee notes, especially on the finish, which is similarly ringed in smoky oak. It's a meaty Cabernet Sauvignon out of Lodi, with a touch of burnt ember reminiscent of a campfire.",85,Mettler Family Vineyards 2009 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi)
"This is a softer Sauvignon Blanc for those not sworn to the grassy side of the grape, as the Buellton-based winery does a lot of barrel-fermenting. Aromas include pressed kiwi and a sour pucker of lime, and the broiled pear flavors prove easy drinking, if not exceedingly complex.",88,Dragonette 2012 Vogelzang Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
"In this wine, a core of juicy apple and Anjour pear flavors is dressed with light vanilla, nutmeg and cream accents for a beautiful, airy wine that's dry and not at all heavy. Baking spices linger on the long, vibrant finish.",90,Great American Wine Company 2013 Chardonnay (California)
"Initially a bit shy, this slowly opens in the glass to reveal aromas of ripe berry, leather, baking spice and a hint of scorched earth. The palate offers suggestions of raspberry compote, dried black cherry, vanilla and licorice alongside tightly wound tannins. A marked espresso note closes the finish. Drink after 2019.",89,Poderi Luigi Einaudi 2012 Terlo  (Barolo)
"Pretty scents show pure varietal character, with the accent on fresh berries and sweet herb. Flavors follow suit, with well-managed, ripe and smooth tannins. A medium-bodied wine drinking well right now.",88,Boedecker Cellars 2008 Stewart Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This wine opens with just a touch of reduction followed by quite pure aromas of red and blue fruit. The flavors are sweet and fresh, with the tannins bringing a light grip.",88,Charles Smith 2014 The Velvet Devil Merlot (Washington)
"This is black in color, and on the nose it's jammy and intense, with slightly reduced blueberry and exotic cumin scents. The palate offers a smooth texture, depth and balance alongside toasty, blackened flavors of berry, cassis and pepper. A chocolaty, lightly toasted finish is a fine ending to this lively, tasty Malbec.",89,Santa Carolina 2010 Reserva de Familia Malbec (Rapel Valley)
"Touriga Nacional's home is believed to be the Dão and this 100% variety wine gives a very fine, ripe and textured red. Still young with dense tannins and a rich and concentrated structure, it is powerful and needs several years to reveal its real, rich self. Drink from 2018.",93,Fontes da Cunha 2012 Munda Touriga Nacional (Dão)
"Made with 70% Nebbiolo and 30% Pinot Nero, this savory sparker offers aromas and flavors of wild cherry, juicy strawberry, orange zest and a hint of cake spice. Fresh acidity and a vibrant but refined perlage provide the backdrop.",90,Rivetti Massimo 2009 Duemilanove Rosé Metodo Classico Sparkling (Vino Spumante)
"Fragrances recall acacia, white spring flowers, honey, bread dough and beeswax. The concentrated palate delivers mature yellow apple, toasted walnut, clove, vanilla and pie crust alongside vivacious, persistent effervescence.",91,Bellavista 2007 Pas Operé Extra Brut Sparkling (Franciacorta)
"Briny citrus aromas are mild to the point of quiet. This clear-looking SB is in solid shape on the palate. Peppery lightly zesty flavors include a note of sweet green melon, while this tastes a bit like jalapeño peppers on the finish.",87,Viña Casablanca 2016 Nimbus Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"Zesty white grapefruit, green apple and lime form the core of this lithe, racy Riesling. Dry in style, it's feather light on the palate yet penetrating, honed by an edge of steel and minerality. The finish lingers long, yet refreshes thrillingly.",94,S.A. Prüm 2012 Graacher Dompropst GG Dry Riesling (Mosel)
"The wine has plenty of fruit, the right layers of tannin. And yet it seems one-dimensional—something that can happen with Touriga Nacional. The depth and complexity found in previous vintages of this wine are missing. So you get bold black fruits and a stylish structure in a wine that is almost ready to drink.",87,Quinta do Passadouro 2013 Passadouro Touriga Nacional (Douro)
"This is a beautiful wine with aromas of pear, peach and yellow rose. The palate is plush and intense, with a sassy, spicy close.",90,Meroi 2010 Friulano (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"A nose of wild blackberry and brambles lays the groundwork for a tender dance of fruit and herbal flavors, especially blackberry, pomegranate, eucalyptus and fennel bulb. Mouth-coating tannins dissipate on the finish, joined by a burst of tart pomegranate.",90,Carmel 2011 Kayoumi Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Galilee)
"Aromas of green olive, grilled asparagus, moist peat, mineral and coffee meld with earthy funk. The smoke and savory flavors are lithe yet concentrated, lingering on the finish.",94,Cayuse 2012 En Cerise Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Warm and mulchy at first; this is a muscular, dark wine despite the bargain price, and it's tight, tannic and herbal but serious in weight, structure and depth. The palate shows creamy, oaky, herbal fruit in front of a full, grabby, tobacco-accented finish. Elevated size and structure is what brings it up a notch.",87,Montes 2008 Special Cuvée Limited Release Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"This is a mouthfilling wine that doesn't go over the top in terms of ripeness or tannins, so it's smooth to drink and offers mild plum and cherry flavors.",88,Matchbook 2013 Tinto Rey Red (Dunnigan Hills)
"This a single-vineyard wine is dry and high in acidity, with cherry, tobacco and tar flavors, and has a rustic mouthfeel. Think of it as American Chianti, and drink with roasted meats and hearty pasta dishes.",86,Lava Cap 2005 Matagrano Sangiovese (El Dorado)
"Tart, clean and juicy, this has ripe flavors of apricot, citrus, tropical fruit and spice. With zesty acidity, it feels basically dry, despite the honeyed finish. A touch of oak lends vanilla and smoke notes.",87,Amici 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"This wine starts off with a broad blend of berries and cherries, and well-integrated, smooth tannins. But in the finish and aftertaste, a chemical bitterness emerges and persists.",87,Colene Clemens 2014 Victoria Estate Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"Sourced from Mike Sauer's Les Vignes de Marcoux Vineyard (near Red Willow), this sends up classic Yakima Valley Syrah scents––black tea, seaside funk, and umami, with drying tannins that seem soaked in ripe black cherry fruit. Juicy finish, with a streak of lemony acidity.",92,Mark Ryan 2008 Lost Soul Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"This expression of Montepulciano opens with a good deal of spice and chocolate backed by cherry and plum. The tones are simple and well-defined, making this a great value wine for homemade meat sauce and pasta.",87,Umani Ronchi 2011 Montipagano  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo)
The wine is tight and perhaps firm. Its extracted tannins and dry core are too much for the fruit.,83,Château Labatut 2015 Cuvée Prestige  (Bordeaux Supérieur)
"This ripe, still very young wine has a tangy, mineral texture that cuts into the white fruit flavors. Acidity, creamy texture and flavors of melon and apricots all give this wine the potential to be deliciously fruity. Drink from 2017.",88,Domaine Pascal et Mireille Renaud 2014  Mâcon-Villages
"On the palate, this feels velvety and smooth thanks to its rich texture and enduring flavors. The nose is characterized by black cherry, cola, licorice, espresso and tobacco notes",90,Prà 2010 Morandina  (Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso)
"This soft wine is yeasty with a strong bubbly mousse. It is balanced, moving towards the sweet end of Brut although with plenty of apple acidity to keep it crisp. Drink the wine now.",87,Nicolas Feuillatte NV Brut  (Champagne)
"A spray of lime pith mingles with white florals on the nose and palate of Prejean's Dry Riesling. It's dry on the palate, but softened considerably by a gorgeously concentrated apricot and white peach fruit profile.",87,Prejean 2009 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Shows good blackberry and currant flavors, but there's something off in the mouthfeel. It's a sharpness, a rugged, tart green chlorophyll feeling that suggests unripe tannins.",84,Le Vigne di Domenico 2007 Merlot (Paso Robles)
"Forceful on the nose, with herbal, saucy, rubbery aromas. It's weighty in the mouth, with blackberry, herbal tomato and dry spice flavors. Feels pretty good on the finish, which comes with a lasting herbal accent. A little grating but solid enough.",85,Veramonte 2008 Reserva Merlot (Casablanca Valley)
"An attractive wine from Chitry, south-west of Chablis, this is fresh, soft and fruity. It lacks complexity, but does have bright apple and pear flavors and refreshing acidity. It's a great apéritif wine, ready to drink now.",85,Simonnet-Febvre 2012 Chitry  (Chablis)
"Meaty aromas suggest baked berry, prune and other ripe fruits. The palate is almost soupy in its richness, while flavors of molasses, berry and toast are ripe and concentrated. A roasted-tasting finish features notes of cooked brown sugar.",89,Finca El Origen 2011 Gran Reserva Malbec (Uco Valley)
"The blend is largely Merlot, with splashes of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. There is a strong scent of vanilla that only partially masks the flavors of leaf and stem. Tannic and a bit earthy, this would be a good wine to pair with a red pasta sauce.",86,Mercer Canyons 2009 Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Attractive aromas of red berry, rose petal and a light note of cooking spice fill the glass. On the tightly wound palate, dried red cherry, sage and white pepper are offset by austere tannins that lead to a rather short, bracing finish.",87,Bel Colle 2012 Monvijè  (Roero)
"Pecorino is the white wine of the moment for those who love the rustic tastes of Italy's vast patrimony of indigenous grapes. This expression shows loads of peach, lemon and Golden Delicious apple.",87,Talamonti 2009 Trabocchetto Pecorino (Colline Pescaresi)
"The nose gives little away but the palate comes in with the fruity pleasant ease of ripe pear and gentle citrus freshness. This is rounded and ripe, fresh and bouncy, with a clean-cut finish.",89,Winzer Krems 2015 Kremser Wachtberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"There's a savory, almost chewy side to this Brunello that is enhanced by aromas of tobacco, spice, dark cola, licorice, blackberry and currant. The wine shows balance and intensity with a soft, plush feel in the mouth that stands in pleasing contrast against to wine's young tannins and acidity.",91,Conti Costanti 2008  Brunello di Montalcino
"Simple and straightforward aromas of red berry and mineral cap the aromatic nuances expressed in the Brunello Riserva. What the wine lacks is complexity, although it does feel rich, smooth and bright in the mouth. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers.",89,Le Potazzine 2004 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Really sweet and unctuous in texture, this pale copper-hued Muscat is a blend of white- and dark-skinned grapes. Peach and berry flavors are balanced by a spicy, green-herb tinge to the finish.",86,Vignobles de Balma Venitia 2011 Carte Rosé  (Muscat de Beaumes de Venise)
"This is a mint- and licorice-flavored wine, with its wood aging prominent at this stage. Full bodied, rich and concentrated, it shows strong signs of extraction that give it a bitter finish. Age this tannic wine for 2–3 years or more.",87,Château Lestruelle 2010  Médoc
"The product of a partnership between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie with the Perrin family of Château Beaucastel in Châteauneuf-du-Pape, this bottling achieves instant fame. Happily, it is also a very fine wine, perfectly balanced between crisp fruit and acidity. In the background a touch of tannin accompanies pepper and minerality. It is ready to drink.",91,Château Miraval 2015 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"If you drink this wine too cold, you'll miss the nuances behind the pineapple, orange and spice flavors. There's a minerally undertow, and some interesting herbal notes.",87,Girard 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Enticing scents of chamomile, white spring flower and white stone fruit mingle together in the glass. The creamy full-bodied palate doles out ripe honeydew melon, juicy yellow pear and nectarine zest while a ginger note adds depth. A far cry from the many bland Pinot Grigios that flood the market, this one is loaded with personality.",91,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano 2015 Anger Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige)
"With fragrant violet and red-fruit aromas, this is an enticing wine. Its structure and its concentration bring out its richness and dense black fruits. The wine is elegant, on the dry side of Ports with some firm tannins as well as fine ripe fruits and acidity. Drink this now or (better yet) wait until 2020.",91,Ferreira 2013 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port)
"Showing the tannins this estate bottling is known for, this is quite astringent despite the fabulous wealth of fruit flavors, which include ripe blackberries, sweet cherries, savory currants and anise liqueur, with a hint of Provençal herbs. Despite the hardness, this shows elegance and opulence that put it into the top ranks. Drink now–2016, at the very least.",94,Sabina Vineyards 2008 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
"Smoke, blackberries, black cherries, pencil lead and woody mints show on the nose of this wine from a label once owned by the California winemaking pioneer. The palate is heavily sprinkled with oregano, thyme and anise against a background of tart blueberry juice, and the tannins need some mellowing though 2017–2018, when it will drink even nicer.",88,Martin Ray 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"This is a high-powered, full-bodied wine. The aromas are like toasted baguette slices, vanilla and nutmeg, the flavors do a good impression of dark chocolate and blackberry, and the texture is saturated with fine tannins that give all those flavors plenty of support and lip-smacking appeal.",91,Michael David 2013 Inkblot Cabernet Franc (Lodi)
"Rose, leather, black cherry and balsamic aromas lead the nose on this friendly wine. The savory palate delivers crushed red berry and white pepper alongside lithe tannins that give it an easy drinking texture.",88,Col di Lamo 2011  Rosso di Montalcino
"Aromas of red-skinned berry, underbrush and leather lead into a medium-bodied palate that offers cherry, tobacco and a hint of white pepper. It's rather straightforward and already approachable so drink over the next few years.",88,Bonacchi 2012 Molino della Suga  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Punchy citrus, apple and lanolin aromas are a bit dusty and entirely typical of Rías Baixas Albariño. Direct citrus flavors and a note of briny orange peel finish a bit salty, with a hint of green banana.",88,Licia 2016 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Aromas that recall nail varnish eventually fade to reveal raisin, prune, chocolate and coffee notes that carry over to the palate along with plum, toasted oak and vanilla.",86,Colombaio 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
"On the nose, luscious peach notes are slightly muddied by earthier notes. On the palate, generous sweetness boosts all the fruit flavors to an intense lusciousness. There is balance in the form of lemony freshness and a lovely tangy texture. This is momentarily quite intense.",91,Joseph Cattin 2015 Hatschbourg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Spicy tangerine peels perfume this intense, full-bodied Gewürztraminer. It's richly textured, almost creamy, in mouthfeel but balanced brightly in acidity. Hints of fennel and pollen pepper a pleasantly phenolic finish.",89,Sheldrake Point 2015 Estate Bottled Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes)
"Aromas of truffle, new leather, black-skinned fruit, wild herb and pressed rose lead the nose. The velvety full-bodied palate delivers fleshy wild cherry, ripe cranberry, star anise and clove set against athletic tannins. Drink 2018–2023.",91,Tenuta La Fuga 2011 Le Due Sorelle Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"This leads with violet, black-skinned berry and baking spice aromas while red cherry, raspberry and white pepper flavors mark the savory palate. Smooth tannins and bracing acidity provide balance. Enjoy through 2020.",88,Marchesi di Barolo 2016  Barbera d'Alba
"Aromas of cured meat, violet and grilled herb waft out of the glass. The rather diluted palate offers wild cherry, game and a salty note alongside fleeting tannins and zesty acidity.",86,La Togata 2014  Rosso di Montalcino
"This offers aromas of new oak, coconut and a whiff of exotic spice that carry over to the underripe palate along with tart cranberry and an orange zest note. It lacks the fruit richness needed to stand up to the oak while raspy tannins leave an astringent finish.",86,Icardi 2013 Montubert  (Barbaresco)
"This Bordeaux-style blend, which includes all five classic Bordeaux varieties, opens with herbal aromas of forest berry, black-currant leaf and tobacco, all grounded in ripe, fruity tones of blackberry and cassis. The palate is concentrated and dense, with a full yet firm texture and flavors of black-plum skin, cherry, leather, bittersweet chocolate and anise that carry  through to the long finish.",90,Spier 2010 Creative Block 5 Red (Coastal Region)
"Tarry and gritty smelling up front, this offers herbal black-plum notes on second and third takes. This is a wide load on the palate, with huge, pounding tannins. Peppery berry flavors finish dry and abrasive.",86,Lar de Sotomayor 2013  Rioja
"For a higher-priced wine, this has some issues. The nose is heavy and murky, with leathery, baked aromas. In the mouth, it's somewhat choppy and acidic, thus punctuating the cherry tomato portion of the earth-and-leather flavor profile. Lingering oak accents the finish, which is zesty and leans toward sour.",85,Dominio Lasierpe 2007 Flor de Lasierpe Viñas Viejas Garnacha (Navarra)
"Country style, with its rough, earthy tannins and brambly berry flavors. Yet it's clean and likeable, with intensely jammy, berry and stone fruit flavors. It also has a nice, round, supple texture. A versatile wine with lots going for it.",86,Granite Springs 1999 Syrah (El Dorado)
"A beautiful Pinotage with superb expression and balance. Intriguing aromas of spicy cured meat, pepper, raw vanilla bean and mulled boysenberry abound, while the lush mouth offers concentrated dark fruit flavors of plum preserves and berry pie filling. Enjoyable now thanks to a creamy texture and silk tannins, though this wine also shows the potential to cellar for another 3–5 years.",91,Diemersfontein 2006 Reserve Pinotage (Wellington)
This Champagne is soft and has some sweetness (although technically Brut). Ripe melon and pear fruits are cut with enough acidity to keep the wine fresh and fruity.,87,Canard-Duchêne NV Authentic Brut  (Champagne)
"In the pale style made fashionable by Provence, this rosé is fruity, crisp and lightly textured. It's an attractive wine, fresh and ready to drink.",84,Philippe Girard 2014 Rosé (Sancerre)
"Vanilla, cedar and caramel abound on the nose of this opulent reserve Cabernet Franc. Its unabashed oakiness integrates well into the palate though, adding a sexy, spicy tone to ripe black berry and plum flavors. It's bold, concentrated and a bit brawny, but irresistibly so, finishing with remarkable depth and persistence. Hold till 2020 to allow its brawn to settle.",91,Raphael 2013 Reserve Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island)
"This delivers fresh aromas of white peach and sun-ripened apricot. Dry and tonic on the palate, this has a lively blast of acidity on the finish.",86,Cà Vittoria NV Costa dei Peschi Brut  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"This is a sound Pinot for everyday drinking. It brings some structural finesse to fairly simple sour cherry candy and cola flavors. There's a touch of green veggies that limits enjoyment, though.",84,Simi 2011 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County)
"Grassy aromas include notes of corn and apple. This feels fresh and citric, with moderate roundness. Salty citrus and kiwi flavors are lasting on a crisp juicy finish.",87,Viña Casablanca 2016 Nimbus Single Vineyard Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)
"Fruit is the star of this wine. It's gigantic and forward in sweet raspberry and cherry flavors that taste wild, picked under a hot summer sun. Fortunately, there's a lot of acidity, and firm tannins provide additional structure. The finish is thoroughly dry. A bit in your face now, but could do interesting things over the years.",90,Fort Ross 2009 Sea Slopes Fort Ross Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This is a ripe, lemon and orange zest-driven wine. It has a lightly mineral texture that gives structure as well as a cool feel. It's a delicious wine already but will be better by late 2014.",86,J. Portugal Ramos 2013 Marquês de Borba Branco White (Alentejo)
The 30-year-old vines of this estate surround a 16th-century castle. The wine is ripe although with intense acidity at the end. Wood aging has added spice and has smoothed out the bright acidity and red-berry fruits. Drink from 2019.,89,Château Cruzeau 2014  Saint-Émilion
"There's a real richness to this wine, as aromas of butter and cream flood the nose alongside notes of ripe peach and apple. The mouthfeel is as full and lush as one would anticipate from the bouquet, and the finish is long but clean. Drink now.",89,Hartenberg 2006 The Eleanor Chardonnay (Stellenbosch)
"New American oak cradled this wine, which includes 12% Petite Sirah. A strong aroma of root beer or Dr. Pepper wraps itself around smoky tar and toast, with a grippyness on the leathery finish that falls a touch flat.",86,Saddleback 2013 Old Vines Zinfandel (Calistoga)
"Randall Grahm's blend of 55% Roussanne, 26% Grenache Blanc and 19% Picpoul Blanc shows sliced honeydew, wet stone and a flash of topicality on the delicate nose. The mouthfeel is steely with layers of tense energy, showing lime pith and faint green banana, as well as lemon blossoms lasting long on the finish.",91,Bonny Doon 2013 Le Cigare Blanc Beeswax Vineyard White (Arroyo Seco)
"Winemaker Tyler Russell sources the fruit for this bottling from an extremely cool-climate vineyard. Tons of fresh-pressed boysenberries meet with wood ash, underripe berries, black olives, rosemary, roasted lamb and Mediterranean spices on the nose. Tart black-plum skin is layered with bay leaf, rosemary, thyme, crushed peppercorn and charred beef on the dynamic palate.",95,Cordant 2014 Presqu'ile Vineyard Syrah (Santa Maria Valley)
"Good and dry, with tough tannins that make it hard to drink now. With blackberry, currant, molasses and dark chocolate flavors, it seems like an ager, but may not have the concentration for the long haul. Try again in 2–3 years.",87,Calicaro 2010 Les Fauves White Hawk Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara)
"Full and generous, this has creamy peach and apricot aromas backed by a slightly spicy touch of vanilla bean and caramel. Pair this wine with coconut curry.",85,Riondo 2011 Monte Forte Lot 6 Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie)
"Tasty and true to type, this wine smells like ripe plums and cherries accented by dried thyme, and tastes slightly meaty on top of all that fruitiness. It's a smooth-textured wine in which moderate tannins add a good bite to the mouthfeel.",88,Cambridge & Sunset 2014 California Series Merlot (California)
"Fern, jasmine, green pear and tart mandarin create an aromatic, inviting nose. The palate supports these aromatics with an intense, concentrated freshness of bright, pure lemon on the midpalate. This is streamlined and refreshing, with just the right amount of invigorating spritz.",91,Türk 2016 Kremser Weinberge Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"Strong char, toast and barrel aromas are at the fore, getting way out in front of the fruit. The fruit flavors are tart and considerably more elegant than the aromas might suggest. There seems to be a bit of disconnect between the two.",87,Longship 2015 Wise Man Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills)
"The best wine from Phélan Ségur for several years, this shows less of the often-intrusive new wood and more of the fruit that had been missing in past vintages. It shows a subtle level of toast and a black currant flavor, plus great acidity and freshness on the finish.",92,Château Phélan-Ségur 2010  Saint-Estèphe
"Rich and toasty, this has aromas barrel-dominated aromas and flavors of vanilla and sweet, buttery oak. The underlying wine is strong in cherry and balsam flavors, which are girded by considerable tannins. Pair this with game meats, stews or barbecue to wrestle the structural elements into submission.",88,Fort Ross 2007 Fort Ross Vineyard Pinotage (Sonoma Coast)
"This blend of 50% Nebbiolo, 25% Barbera and 25% Syrah offers aromas of fudge, blackberry and plum that are somehow both lean and rich. It's thick and full on the palate, with pepper spice, leather, tobacco and violets, yet the acidity is quite powerful. Serve with hearty pasta.",87,Palmina 2010 Savoia Red (Santa Barbara County)
"Ripe black raspberry and cherry mark this lovely Pinot that is rich and concentrated. The oak is prominent, with a touch of meaty gaminess on the full palate. Balanced, the wine's acidity remains remarkably bright.",90,Marimar Estate 2012 Doña Margarita Vineyard Mas Cavalls Unfiltered Estate Grown & Bottled Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Aromas of nearly overripe black fruit mingle with accents of exotic spice. The palate delivers a flavor reminiscent of raspberries soaked in spirit, along with hints of cinnamon and white pepper. This offers lovely fruit, but it's a bit shy on length.",87,Le Marognole 2009 I Corsi  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
"Sweet oak perfume comes from 25% new French barrels. The oak influence is well integrated with ripe fruit, firm tannins, good concentration and medium-full body. They add up to an enticing, complex and delicious wine that is very lively, a bit lean, and will age through at least 2019.",91,Lynch Wines 2012 Strummer Syrah (Sierra Foothills)
"This blend of Grenache, Syrah and Petite Sirah from the Warner Springs area southeast of Temecula shows lots of promise for this producer. Smoky berries, uncrushed black peppercorns and a bit of asphalt show on the nose, with juicy, plump red fruits benefitting from lots of cardamom, allspice and other black spices on the palate.",92,Hawk Watch Winery 2011 Cold Fusion Red (South Coast)
This blended red from the little-known Piceno area of Central Italy offers ripe cherry fruit and prune followed by a dusty note of Graham cracker or rye bread.,86,Saladini Pilastri 2011  Rosso Piceno
"Roughly two thirds Merlot and one third Cabernet Sauvignon, this is the finest O•S Red since their 2007 vintage. Dark fruits abound, soaked in flavors of espresso, cedar, licorice and clove. It's a splendid wine for the price, one to buy by the case.",90,O•S Winery 2011 Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This incredibly tasty wine seems to melt in the mouth. Classic aromas of cinnamon, black cherry and cedar becomes more chocolaty on the palate as layers of cocoa, dark plum and toasted baguette unfold. Its texture is so velvety that the fine-grained tannins seem to dissolve as you sip, while still providing a slight grip that counteracts the richness and full body. Tempting now, it will be best 2022–2032.",95,Liparita 2012 V Block Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville)
"Intense aromas of white peach, green apple and pear carry over to the palate along with lemon zest, almond paste and a note of candied ginger. Crisp acidity brightens up the creamy fruit palate.",88,Ancilla 2012 Ella  (Lugana)
"This is Zinfandel at its richest. Boysenberry, vanilla and maple syrup aromas meet up with jammy fruit flavors that coat the mouth and linger on the finish. For all its fullness, it stays balanced and dry. It does not feel heavy in texture nor heavily oaked.",93,Earthquake 2012 Zinfandel (Lodi)
Overripe aromas of raisin and prune are matched on a dense raisiny palate that tastes like baked black fruits. The entirety of this wine is raisiny but not unfriendly or difficult.,84,Viña Maipo 2012 Vitral Red (Chile)
"Ridiculously high in alcohol, clocking in at nearly 16%, and it shows in a porty taste that frames the blackberry jam and chocolate flavors. Drink now.",84,Calcareous 2008 Grenache-Mourvèdre (Paso Robles)
"Nutty, meaty and complex, this crisp, high-toned wine offers food-friendly elegance and refreshment while teasing in savory hints of earthiness. Balanced and dry, it continues to impress as it glides along in the glass.",93,Bodkin 2016 Hotspur Rosé of Syrah (Russian River Valley)
"This Bordeaux-Rhône blend is quite soft and lush. It has chocolaty flavors of mashed ripe blackberries, currants, plum jelly and black pepper, wrapped into exceedingly finely ground tannins. Drink now.",87,Venteux 2006 Raucous Red (Paso Robles)
"Here's a straightforward but enjoyable Shiraz with notes of dark plum, cherry and strawberry on the nose and mouth. There's a touch of greenness on the palate augmented by firm, young tannins, but it all works out and fades smoothly on the finish.",86,Winery of Good Hope 2010 Mountainside Shiraz (Stellenbosch)
"Fleshy pumpkin and squash aromas are mature and lightly oxidized but in good form. A round, full palate offers vitality and balance. Earthy flavors of acorn squash and baked apple finish long and peppery. Drink through 2019.",90,Portal del Montsant 2013 Santbru White (Montsant)
"There's a pleasant and subtle chalky texture to this refreshing white, with aromas and flavors of white peach, underripe kiwi and orange peel. The cleanly fruited palate boasts great verve and liveliness, with tart gooseberry and lime flavors that unfold on the close. Drink now.",87,Fleur Du Cap 2016 Bergkelder Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape)
"This medium-bodied wine has a slightly dusty mouthfeel, which gives its palate just enough shape to highlight the flavors of dried dark-skinned fruit. It's a little pruney, but would probably work fine with stews or hard cheeses.",85,Les Trois Couronnes 2011 Red (Vacqueyras)
"This bottling from Fintan du Fresne has all the hallmarks of savory, cool-climate Syrah: deep blackberry aromas wrapped in black pepper, rosemary, game and tar. The palate adds pine and boysenberry to the mix, making for a compelling and lively wine.",94,Chamisal Vineyards 2014 Califa Syrah (Edna Valley)
"Keeping with past performances, Herencia is again one of Chile's best Carmenères. This is bold, toasty and ripe on the nose, with tobacco and vanilla nuances. The palate is huge but in shape, while toasty, chocolaty flavors of herbal plum and berry end chewy, stacked and deep. Drink through 2016.",92,Santa Carolina 2009 Herencia Carmenère (Peumo)
"Fruit-driven, with pear and apple, but an interesting streak of licorice running down the spine of the wine. It has depth and good structure, so the now-dominant young fruit will have support as it ages. Worth sitting on for a couple more years.",90,Lange 2010 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"Wallulla Vineyard provides the majority of the fruit for this Chardonnay. The lemon verbena and floral aromas and flavors are dialed way down here, with full malolactic fermentation providing a creamy feel.",85,Canoe Ridge 2011 The Expedition Chardonnay (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Some extra barrel time and single vineyard status separate this wine from Erath's regular bottling. This has narrow flavors of green apple and white  peach, not showing much new oak influence.",87,Erath 2011 Quail Run Pinot Blanc (Southern Oregon)
"Dilute, oddball aromas of blueberry and currant are rendered earthy and less than fully clean by a whiff of compost. This feels basic and jammy, while floral berry flavors settle on herbal and peppery. It finishes lean.",85,Alfredo Roca 2013 Fincas Malbec (Mendoza)
"This wine has aromas of freshly mowed grass, peaches and white flowers. It is slightly sweet with flavors of canned peach, white peach juice and apricot nectar.",87,Puklavec & Friends 2013 Moscato (Štajerska)
"Bristling acidity lends vitality to this full-bodied Chardonnay. Fresh tangerine, lemon and lime flavors are moderately concentrated on the palate, accented by touches of savory nut and smoke.",87,Silver Thread 2014 STV Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"This is winemaker Ross Cobb's own family project, from extremely cool sites along the Sonoma Coast, including the family's own Coastlands vineyard. Here, with Rice-Spivak, he skirts the edge of ripeness, producing a light, bright wine that's at first hard to penetrate. Faint notes of tart cherry and pomegranate weave through like a fog, a seasoning of allspice on the finish.",92,Cobb 2012 Rice-Spivak Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This Chardonnay has brisk, crisp acidity and flavors of pineapple, orange and mango. There are dominating notes of buttered toast and sweet butterscotch.",84,Cru 2011 Appellation Series Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Earthy and just the slightest touch reduced, this is a feral, juicy and intriguing wine from the well-known site, complex and medium to almost light-bodied in texture and approach. Cherry and pomegranate compote meet cardamom baking spices to suggest warmth and comfort in a glass.",93,Bruliam 2014 Sangiacomo Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"A bulky wine with an ample mix of cherry and chocolate flavors, this Gigondas is a big, fairly rich mouthful but is slightly lacking for nuance. Give it another year or two to see if more develops.",86,Pierre Henri Morel 2009  Gigondas
"Striving for complexity with plenty of cedary, toasty wood over cherry fruit, this Castilian Tempranillo–Cabernet blend aims high. It falls short of its aspirations, turning lean and somewhat astringent as green tobacco, herb and puckery, tart red fruit flavors take over. Finishes short and slightly raspy.",82,Osborne 1999 Solaz Red (Tierra de Castilla)
"The nose is lemony, warm and floral. It feels full, solid and sturdy on the palate, with tobacco, baked cherry, plum and herb flavors. The finish remains herbal, with coffee and chocolate notes.",88,Rios de Chile 2008 Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Cachapoal Valley)
"You'll find aromas of forest floor, leather, graphite, chopped mint and an earthy whiff of soil on this elegant red. The structured, medium-bodied palate delivers dark cherry, raspberry compote, star anise, espresso and a toasted note. It's balanced, with firm close-grained tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2019–2028.",92,Fontanabianca 2013 Bordini  (Barbaresco)
"A great buy at this price for its richness and overall integrity. Has a medium body, with fine, fuzzy tannins and bone-dry, complex flavors of wild berries, currants, herbs, tobacco and tons of peppery spices.",87,Z-52 2006 Zinfandel (Lodi)
"Delicate in aromas of honeysuckle, Asian pear, Gravenstein apple and a smoky butter element, this shows that quality Chardonnay can indeed succeed in this warmer region of Southern California. The wine is also soft and restrained on the sip, with fresh nectarine and white-flower flavors, finishing with a familiar kiss of oak.",90,Robert Renzoni 2015 Barile Chardonnay (Temecula Valley)
"One of the most famous Crozes-Hermitage bottlings, the 2005 Domaine de Thalabert is a little tough and unyielding right now, but shows promise in its persistent, peppery finish. It starts off with gamy, leathery notes and hickory smoke, all backed by crisp blackberry fruit and ample tannin. Try after 2012.",88,Paul Jaboulet Aîné 2005 Domaine de Thalabert  (Crozes-Hermitage)
"Full-bodied and heavy, with a soft texture framing red and black currant, leather, licorice and spice flavors. Would benefit from greater liveliness. Drink now.",85,Tolosa 2006 Edna Ranch Estate Grenache Noir Grenache (Edna Valley)
"Ripe and oaky, this will appeal to those who love their Chards voluptuous. It's strong in buttered toast, caramelized wood, sweet-and-sour pineapple candy and lemondrop flavors.",87,Manzoni 2011 North Highlands' Cuvée Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of mature dark-skinned berry, violet and a whiff of baking spice. On the bright silky palate, notes of pipe tobacco, chopped herb and a hint of game add depth to the red-berry core.",90,Tua Rita 2013 Perlato del Bosco Sangiovese (Toscana)
"Best to give this young Pinot a year or two in the cellar, because it's a little too closed to completely enjoy now. It doesn't show the generosity of the '01 or '05, but is more tannic and a little earthier. Should mellow through 2009 and let the cherry flavors emerge.",87,Paraiso Vineyards 2006 West Terrace Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Leathery animal notes blend with stalky berry and plum aromas in front of a bumpy palate with hard tannins. This tastes of herbal plum and berry, with a mildly green, oaky accent. That same oaky, green action repeats on the finish.",85,Finca El Origen 2015 Reserva Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Uco Valley)
"This is a rich, robust Pinot Noir, defining the big, tannic style. It explodes in cherry, cola and pomegranate fruit flavors, with the added note of caramelized oak. You can drink this wine now, but it should hold in the bottle for 6–8 years, gradually mellowing. The vineyard is in the cooler southern part of the valley, near Carneros.",90,Maldonado 2011 Los Olivos Pinot Noir (Napa Valley)
"This is an ambitious new bottling from the Delicato folks, and it largely succeeds in its ambitions. It's a smooth, lush Cabernet, soft and velvety, with flavors of black currants, cedar and dark chocolate. Shows real class and distinction in its price point.",88,337 Wine Cellars 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi)
"This wine has the weight that is typical of this appellation. It is full bodied, ripe with melon and yellow fruits. Contrasting with that, a crisper edge brings out minerality and a nervy texture. Drink from 2022.",92,Roux Père et Fils 2015 Les Macherelles Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet)
"Pure Syrah from the Boushey vineyard, this is wound tightly around a core of pomegranate and cassis. Threads of licorice, coffee grounds and liquid smoke provide darker highlights, while the lingering finish offers details of dried leaves and herbs.",90,Forgeron 2010 Boushey Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"A faint coppery-pink rosé, Taltarni's 2008 Taché is a blend of 58% Chardonnay, 37% Pinot Noir and 5% Pinot Meunier. It's lean and crisp, with a zesty, citrusy feel to the modest toast and mushroom flavors.",88,Taltarni 2008 Taché Sparkling (South Eastern Australia)
"This wine is alive with herbacious notes that give it a savory quality—cut grass and green olive blend effortlessly with rosewater and baked lemon. These are all well represented on the palate, which also offers a welcome green apple flavor. Good acidity and balanced weight offer a long and lifted finish, complex with character.",89,Blue Valley 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Middleburg)
"So pretty and polished, a captivating wine. Dry and crisp, it has an elegant, silky mouthfeel, with subtle spice, red cherry sour candy, Dr. Pepper cola and sandalwood flavors. A complex and delicious Pinot Noir to drink over the next 5–6 years.",93,Tyler 2008 La Encantada Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Mouthwatering aromas of wild berry, baking spice, toast and anisette take center stage on this vibrant wine. The fresh, structured palate delivers juicy red cherry, cinnamon, white pepper and sage alongside youthful, bracing tannins.",91,Cantina del Nebbiolo 2012  Barbaresco
"This opens with aromas of plum, menthol, licorice and a whiff of cellar floor. The palate offers dark berry fruit, clove, dried sage and white pepper alongside assertive, drying tannins and the warmth of evident alcohol.",89,San Lorenzo 2010 Bramante  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"This wine consists of all five red Bordeaux varieties plus 5% Syrah. Tart, soft and juicy with black and red cherry fruit, it's direct in its delivery of dried herb and licorice—flavors that complement the robust ripeness and density.",88,Clos Pegase 2013 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Raspberry and cherry aromas are mild while not stirring much excitement. This feels a bit raw and tannic, but it's got enough body to hold up. Berry and plum flavors finish with hints of spice and chocolate.",87,Piattelli 2012 Premium Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Luján de Cuyo)
"This wine is made from grapes grown on the producer's RockRise Mountain vineyard, 1,100-feet up. Graham cracker provides a decadent introduction to the nose and palate, as extracted, extended red fruit plays along. Full bodied and concentrated, with rounded corners, it ends in cola and vanilla.",90,Ferrari-Carano 2014 PreVail Back Forty Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Spice and fresh fruit give flavors of baked apples, a creamy texture and bright acidity. Well balanced, the aftertaste shows toast and honey flavors.",90,Domaine Denis Jeandeau 2008 Sécret Minéral  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
"From the famed slope of the Côtes de Py, this wine sums up both the great terroir and a great vintage. It has structure, with dry tannins permeating the ripe, rounded fruit. Its potential is considerable, anchored in great fruitiness and finishing acidity. Drink from 2019.",92,Château de Pizay 2015 Cuvée du Py  (Morgon)
"Waterbrook makes a  lovely, lighthearted, citrus- and melon-flavored Sauv Blanc. Crisp and elegant, it manages to be flavorful without being overpowering; it's a delightful summer sipping wine that will add zip to almost anything you serve it with.",88,Waterbrook 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Crop yields were down substantially in 2010, so perhaps that is why so many of the top estates' entry-level wines are so exciting. This one combines hints of wet stones and moss with multifaceted citrus nuances and struck flint, resulting in remarkable complexity. It's round and mouthfilling yet focused and long.",90,Baron Knyphausen 2010 Trocken Riesling (Rheingau)
"The nose conjures feral notes of skunk. A rich, syrupy palate tastes complicated and uneasy. Flavors of brown sugar and herbal black cherry are confusing, while the finish is herbal, earthy and green.",83,Luminis 2012 Allamand Altamira Malbec (Mendoza)
"This wine is herbaceous, crisp and lively. Tangy acidity envelops the citrus and green apple flavors, while the aftertaste is all about the tight, steely acidity.",84,Château des Antonins 2014  Bordeaux Blanc
"Aromas of nutmeg, cedar and mushroom lead this spicy red from Crete. On the palate, currants, vanilla and cinnamon are rich but balanced with a good acidity. Great with cheeses, duck.",90,Lyrarakis 2012 Oak Aged Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Crete)
"This sophisticated blend of Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Ribolla Gialla, Malvasia Istriana and Picolit opens with a deep, off-gold color and rich aromas of honey, apricot, candied fruit and a touch of exotic spice. The mouthfeel is creamy and long-lasting.",92,Jermann 2008 Vintage Tunina White (Friuli Venezia Giulia)
"Fruity, young and soft, this is an attractive Touriga Nacional-Syrah wine with strawberry flavors and just a touch of crisp red currant acidity. It's made for this summer, ready to drink.",84,Quinta do Casal Branco 2016 Terra de Lobos Rosé (Tejo)
"Spicy cola and strawberry form around a moderate body of ripeness and dense texture in this vineyard designate from a cool-climate appellation. Vanilla and smoke contribute additional flavor and complexity, while a sharpness of acidity finds its way on the finish.",90,Talisman 2013 Jamison Valley Vineyard Destein Estate Pinot Noir (Bennett Valley)
"A fairly elegant expression of the variety, this wine is bright in cherry kirsch and pretty aromas of rose petal and lavender, structured to age and enjoy with food. Rector Creek Vineyard is just north of Yountville and planted in rocky alluvial soils. Drink now through 2022.",91,Duckhorn 2012 Rector Creek Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Rubbery aromas of latex are earthy and suggest olive, wet dog and foxy, gritty berry fruits. This is saturated in feel, with prune and stewy berry flavors. Savory notes of prune, carob and rooty spice control a chunky, ripe finish.",88,Altaïr 2009 Red (Cachapoal Valley)
"This is a hard Prosecco to score. You expect the soft freshness and peachy tones that normally define this category of Italian sparkler, yet here, you get a more sophisticated and slightly oxidized expression. The vintage bubbly is made with organically farmed grapes (no sulfites) and offers aromas of pear and apple cider. Not for everyone.",86,Perlage 2008 Animae Millesimato Brut  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
"Firmly tannic, this wine is richly endowed with a solid structure and also with bold black fruits. It comes from the producer's main Douro vineyard. Concentrated and ripe, it will age and should be drunk from 2018.",87,Borges 2015 Quinta da Soalheira Red (Douro)
"Aromas of stewed prune, tobacco, resin and menthol lead the noses. The full-bodied, one-dimensional palate is rather evolved, offering raisin and clove alongside close-grained but not very persistent tannins.",87,Delibori 2012  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"What a creamy Champagne, its mousse bursting around the mouth. Impressively, all this creaminess is well balanced by full, dry fruits, flavors of pear and fresh bread and finished with crisp apples. This is not a wine for aging, but it is ready to go with many meals now.",93,Louis Roederer 2003 Vintage Brut  (Champagne)
"From the estate vineyard, located in the cobblestone-rich area known as The Rocks, this cellar-worthy effort is complex and riveting. Berries and citrus, juicy and tart, cling to the palate and pull through to a lingering finish. Pure and deep all the way through.",94,Otis Kenyon 2008 Stellar Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Smells like mealy fruit and bananas, while the palate is weak in constitution and a bit spritzy in feel. Tastes like bland white fruits with vanilla. Cloying on the finish.",80,Bodegas Fariña 2009 Dama de Toro Malvasia (Toro)
"The color of this blend of 76% Chardonnay and 24% Pinot Noir is a rich, golden pink. It's medium-bodied and rich in toast, strawberry and lime flavors that finish a little sweet. The acidity is fabulous. Might develop bottle notes over the years, but why bother. It's a beautiful bubbly to drink now.",90,Schramsberg 2009 Querencia Brut Rosé Sparkling (Napa Valley)
"This is a great buy. It's soft, rich and dry, with the velvety texture you want in a nice Syrah. Shows complex flavors of berries, cherries, cocoa, licorice and crushed pepper, and feels really stylish. Gets better as it warms in the glass.",90,Le Vigne 2007 Kiara Private Reserve Syrah (Paso Robles)
"This mix of mostly Zin with 14% Petite Sirah from a longtime source for this producer shows plenty of minerality around flavors of cinnamon stick, dark cherry and leather. Soft tannins give it approachability and juiciness that are buoyed by length.",92,Carol Shelton 2013 Rocky Reserve Florence Vineyard Zinfandel (Rockpile)
"This is turning into an impressive wine as it finds its way between solid tannins and ripe, full black fruits. It is dark and dense at this stage with tannins that dominate. A more juicy character will develop as the wine ages. Drink from 2017.",92,Château Dutruch Grand Poujeaux 2012  Moulis-en-Médoc
"This is a stalky wine, full of black-currant fruits and with just enough weight to balance tannins and the dry structure. It has the potential to become an attractive, fruity wine, so drink from 2018.",86,Château Grivière 2013  Médoc
"Flavors of honey, raspberry and orange jam, vanilla bean and minerals mark this vibrant Viognier. It's quite rich, but is balanced with good acidity.",87,Peachy Canyon 2012 Concrete Blanc Viognier (Paso Robles)
"From one of the Riboli family's new estate vineyards, this bottling is a clean but quite ripe style of Viognier, with blousy aromas of tuberose, coconut and guava. It's tighter on the palate, with honeydew, key lime and guava sorbet flavors.",88,San Simeon 2016 Stefano Vineyard Viognier (Paso Robles)
"The historic Pritchard Hill producer swings for the fences with this Cab, intense in black cherry, blackberry and cedar. Hard to penetrate on first try, it demands cellaring to soften its wall of hearty tannins, the merest hint of chocolate-coffee begging to break out. Lushly powerful and complex, it can be enjoyed through 2027.",91,Chappellet 2012 Signature Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A bit reticent on the nose, this only stubbornly offers up aromas of underbrush and ripe cherries. Then, on the palate, the fruit seems to darken, taking on black cherry overtones and hints of mocha before finishing tart and crisp. Drink now.",86,Saint Clair 2013 Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
"This is a “dry” vintage Prosecco with a hint of sweetness in the mouth that is surrounded by fragrant flavors of peach, kiwi and green melon. This luminous sparkler tastes firm and tonic and makes for an informal afternoon sipper.",86,Sant Eurosia 2007 Millesimato Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
"A selection from the Würzburger Innere Leiste, this wine offers something of a conundrum: the aromas and flavors are on one hand those of cooked or stewed fruit, while at the same time the wine is light-bodied, silky and vibrant. Worth a try.",87,Weingut Am Stein 2007 Montonia Spätburgunder (Franken)
"Big boned and brawny, this is a lushly textured wine full of intensely ripe black plum and cherry flavors. It's richly fruity, but textured with velvety tannins, crushed granite notes and a hit of acidity that lingers on the finish. A blend of Bulgarian and international grape varieties.",89,Castra Rubra 2008 Via Diagonalis Red (Thracian Valley)
"This appellation blend from Bryan Babcock is flamboyant on the nose, showing lime blossom, honeysuckle, wet cement and peach aromas. There's a great sizzle of acidity and pithy grip to the palate, supporting its strong stone fruit flavors.",88,Babcock 2015 Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"While forward, plump red-cherry and strawberry notes are buoyant, a deep vein of granite and minerals adds gravitas and complexity to this elegant wine. Fresh cranberry acidity drives a swift finish.",88,Silver Thread 2013 Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes)
"Dusty plum and black cherry aromas feature a touch of dry oak. Tight, snappy and properly tannic in the mouth, with full berry, baked plum and background spice flavors. Finishes with control and power; good red wine for the price.",87,Maximo 2009 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"This offers plenty of tannins and a dry, firm structure along with the weight of ripe plums, blackberries and a rich character. The wine is certainly going to age, with its solid texture and bold fruit aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",91,Lucien Lardy 2014 Les Thorins  (Moulin-à-Vent)
"Consumers are reaping the benefit of Australia's Chardonnay grape glut. This elegant, refined, cool-climate Chardonnay comes at a bargain price for its flavors of lightly grilled pineapple, melon, citrus and hazelnut. Drink now–2012.",90,Sticks 2008 Chardonnay (Yarra Valley)
"Equal proportions of Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier make this a well-balanced wine. It is initially soft with a creamy mousse followed by a good tang of acidity to keep it crisp. The apple fruitiness shows a wine from a fine vintage that is still young. Ideally drink from 2018.",91,Bertrand-Delespierre 2008 Millésimé Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne)
"Round, forward and fruity, this pleasant red does not scream out its varietal stamp, but it's a perfectly fine quaffer, a bit tart and short in the finish.",86,Locati Cellars 2008 Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Violets, lilacs, black pepper, blackberry paste and hot asphalt show on the nose of this 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah blend from the appellation in the heart of Monterey County. The palate is ripe and juicy with boysenberry and blackberry fruits, wrapped up in a tannic asphalt structure.",88,Ventana 2014 Rubystone Red (Arroyo Seco)
"This 95% Grenache rosé is a pale salmon hue. Subtle melon and berry fruit marks the nose, while the palate is medium in body and silky in texture, finishing with mouthwatering acids. Drink now.",89,Turkey Flat 2016 Rosé (Barossa Valley)
"Merlot and Nero d'Avola are blended to produce an easy wine with good integrity of fruit and fresh berry flavors. This a soft, plush wine that would pair well with home-cooked pasta or risotto.",87,Botter 2006 Terre del Sole Lunate Red (Sicilia)
"The rich gold hue and the scents of bruised, slightly cooked fruit, suggest that premature oxidation is setting in. Two bottles were tasted, with comparable results. It's lemony, somewhat oily, penetrating and concentrated, but should be consumed now through 2017.",87,Dion 2014 Chardonnay (Chehalem Mountains)
"An unusual edge of licorice clings to nose and palate of this fresh, zingy Riesling. The streamlined body is dry and pervaded by brisk, friendly lemon freshness.",89,Domaine Schoffit 2014 Lieu Dit Harth Tradition Riesling (Alsace)
"With its ripe berry and plum aromas, plus its background tones of spice and dark chocolate, this is a pure expression of Malvasia Nera. A touch of sour cherry gives the wine a bright, fresh finish.",87,Feudi di San Marzano 2010 Sud Malvasia Nera (Salento)
La Cala is a fun and easy expression of Vermentino from the sunny island of Sardinia that shows bright citrus notes backed by tones of honeysuckle and wild sage. Pair this wine with fried calamari.,86,Sella & Mosca 2008 La Cala  (Vermentino di Gallura)
"This wine is 61% Syrah and 39% Mourvèdre. Appealing aromas of red and black fruit, mineral, spice, earth and braised meat lead to a full bodied, still quite tightly wound palate. All the stuffing is there but it needs some additional time in bottle or a short decant to open up.",92,Force Majeure 2014 Parabellum Red (Red Mountain)
"Made from 100% Cab Franc, this is a soft, rather one-dimensional wine. It has complex flavors of cherries, red currants, cola, white pepper and herbs, but is short on structure and interest. Drink now.",86,Boëté 2009 Saunders Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Franc (Carmel Valley)
"An elegant wine, with nicely framed red berry fruit flavors. Hints of dried herbs and modest tannins put everything in balanced proportion.",88,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2009 Indian Wells Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A heavy, roasted, charred nose gives this a dark outlook, and the bulky but smooth palate of black fruits and baked flavors does little to lessen the load. Feels good on the finish, although it tastes rather normal and a touch bitter. Round and fairly rich Malbec.",88,Bodega Norton 2007 Privada Malbec (Mendoza)
"Forward but structured, it delivers underbrush, leather and dark fruit aromas punctuated with hints of orange rind and spice. The palate offers fleshy black raspberry and red cherry sprinkled with white pepper, licorice and a note of mocha alongside firm but round tannins. Drink now–2017.",89,SassodiSole 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
"A Côtes-du-Rhône style wine. Bring on the lamb, roasted potatoes and rosemary. It's dryish and soft, with rich flavors of raspberries, cherries, spices and Provençal herbs. The blend is Grenache, Mouvèdre and Syrah.",88,Demetria 2008 Cuvée Constantine Red (Santa Ynez Valley)
"This wine starts off a touch rubbery, so give it some air prior to serving if you can. The payoff is a pleasant mix of pear and citrus that's fairly broad on the palate yet balanced, and lengthy, too. This year's blend is 56% Chardonnay, 30% Sauvignon Blanc and 14% Verdelho.",87,Henry's Drive Vignerons 2007 Pillar Box White White (South Australia)
"Sweet and simple, with pleasantly exotic flavors of pineapples, green apples, pears, honeysuckle flowers, minerals, spices, vanilla, brown sugar and smoky oak. Easy to drink.",85,Ledgewood Creek 2007 Estate Grown Viognier (Suisun Valley)
"The Vineyard Select is made only on occasion. As in 2006, the cuvée includes a splash of Petit Verdot. From the extraordinary 2007 vintage, this wine has it all: depth, polish and panache. The richly fruity nose brings on the berries and cherries; they fill the palate and add layers of fig, plum, chocolate and coconut.",93,Walla Walla Vintners 2007 Vineyard Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"There's a generous, sunny quality to this Italian Pinot Grigio that comes across with ripe aromas of apricot, melon and Golden Delicious apple. There's a fullness to the mouthfeel as well with soft, slightly sweet fruit flavors at the end.",84,La di Motte 2010 Pinot Grigio (Venezie)
"Boasting a rustic charm, this opens with earthy aromas of sunbaked soil, game, leather and black-skinned fruit. The gamy note carries over to the ripe palate along with hints of Mediterrenean brush, star anise and white pepper that accent a blackberry core. Chewy tannins provide the framework.",88,Sella & Mosca 2012 Riserva  (Cannonau di Sardegna)
"Made in a ripe, soft style that's unusual for Howell Mountain, this Zin could almost be Grenache, or even a big Pinot Noir. The cherry pie filling, raspberry cream and Dr. Pepper flavors are wrapped into soft, gentle tannins. It's a luxurious, exotic Zinfandel whose heat from high alcohol adds a spicy element.",92,Dark Matter 2006 Zinfandel (Howell Mountain)
"The quality of Casarena's wines range from excellent to not great, with all points in between represented. This Malbec-led blend is heavy and raisiny on the nose, then syrupy in the mouth, with flavors running straight to candied and flat.",81,Casarena 2010 Reserva Sinergy Red (Mendoza)
"This is a lively, ripe wine. Peach and apricot fruits are laced with spice and acidity. Rich and fruity, it has a tropical, warm feel, a product of the ripe vintage. Drink now.",87,Domaine Saumaize-Michelin 2015 Creches  (Saint-Véran)
"Fresh and balanced, this bright savory sparkler delivers mouthfuls of green apple, white peach and lemon peel. Crisp acidity keeps it refreshing while a soft mousse gives it plenty of finesse. It has a dry juicy finish.",92,Andreola 2016 Dirupo Brut  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Winemaker Paul Clifton excelled in this vintage, finding the balance between the region's ripe fruit, natural acidity and powerful spice. Baked black cherry, hibiscus, earth, gingerbread and cola notes show on the nose. The palate is creamy and lush, but the acidity is persistent, carrying its dark red fruit and minty chocolate flavors into the finish.",93,Lucienne 2015 Hook Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Here's a very rich and full-bodied wine. It does have structure, giving firm tannins to balance the ripe red berry fruits. With this solid character, the wine will age and should be drunk from 2016.",87,Château Barrail Chevrol 2011  Fronsac
"This offers aromas suggesting honeysuckle and honeydew melon while the fresh, linear palate displays grapefruit, pineapple and sage. A hint of bitter nut closes the finish.",87,Fazio 2015 Aegades Grillo (Erice)
"A touch of pineapple informs the ripe pear fruit on the nose with extra tropicality. The palate is a little hot and boisterous but the fruit wins through. There is freshness, too, and a dry finish.",88,Gustave Lorentz 2015 Réserve Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Subdued aromas of mature black-skinned berry, spice and a whiff of leather lead the nose on this fresh, simple red. The soft, smooth palate shows juicy black cherry, blackberry and a hint of licorice. It's made to be enjoyed young so drink soon.",86,Corvo 2013 Rosso Nero d'Avola (Terre Siciliane)
"Ripe and creamy in apple and pear fruitiness, this is cut by just the right amount of acidity. It's balanced, with fruit and and bright steeliness working well together. Drink from 2016.",91,Simonnet-Febvre 2012 Fourchaume Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"This wine's bracing acids and dry finish suggest it's anything but a cupcake. It's a medium-bodied, vibrant mouthful of Sauvignon Blanc, boasting hints of nectarine and tomato leaf layered over a core of gooseberry fruit.",88,Cupcake 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Smooth, sweet and savory, this Cabernet has forward flavors of blackberries, black currants, cola and sweet oak. It's an easy wine to drink now.",85,Windsor Sonoma 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"A bit jammy and simple, with fresh, primary flavors of blackberries and cherries that are almost sweet. Oak adds creamy, smoky notes. Drink now.",86,C. Beck 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Earthy cherry aromas are downright raw, with a touch of green grass woven in. An acidic, choppy palate follows the nose, while this Garnacha from the Sierra de Salamanca region tastes of tart red currant and cranberry. A crisp finish is fresh but abrupt.",86,La Zorra 2014 La Moza Calabrés Garnacha (Sierra de Salamanca)
"It's a shame that the producer used too much wood in this difficult vintage. The fruit is delicate, with the black-currant flavors and acidity smothered by a burnt, toasty character that's hard to taste through. It will soften, although the wood will always be there. Vignobles Roux bought this Cru Bourgeois in 2013. The blend is 50-50 Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.",85,Château Taffard de Blaignan 2013 Cru Bourgeois  (Médoc)
"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is very strong in blackberries, black currants and cedar. It's also quite tannic. Clearly a rich, well-grown wine, but marked by immaturity, with unintegrated sweet fruit and oak flavors. Needs a good six years to start to knit together.",91,Hendry 2007 Hendry Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"All five red Bordeaux varieties are represented here, with 55% Cabernet Sauvignon leading the way. Red and black berries burst forth first, allowing for a juiciness on the palate, followed by tar, licorice and more blackberry. Balanced though full bodied, it finishes simply.",86,Peju 2012 Thalia Red (Napa Valley)
"Another fine white wine from Chehalem, dry but not sour, with lovely sweet/tart peach and pear, honeysuckle and lime flavors co-mingled. It has a full midpalate and a clean, refreshing finish.",92,Chehalem 2008 Dry Riesling (Willamette Valley)
"From a high-elevation site near the outpost of Annapolis, close to the Mendocino border, this is a briny, salty and soft wine, complex and bristling in acidity, yet possessed of subtle power and finesse. Enjoy now or over time, cellaring through 2018.",94,Sojourn 2013 Campbell Ranch Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"This blend of Rolle and Ugni Blanc, typical of Provence whites, is smooth, ripe and only lightly textured. The Rolle (Vermentino) that dominates gives an attractive perfumed character as well as a mineral texture and acidity. Drink now.",88,Château d'Ollières 2015 Prestige White (Coteaux Varois)
"Leesy fleshy papaya aromas come with a touch of sulfur and harshness. This feels solid, albeit modest in bubbles. Flavors of apple and green melon are lasting and steady on the finish.",88,Albet I Noya 2011 Brut Natural Reserva Sparkling (Penedès)
"This is a softly fruity wine that has attractive, easy apple and melon flavors. It is floral and ready to drink.",84,Bougrier 2015 Château du Jaunay Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"Roasted and meaty, with hints of raisin and licorice. The palate is ripe and chewy but balanced by solid tannins and fresh but natural acidity. And the flavors of blackberry, cassis and cola are true to the variety. Dense but approachable; drink now through 2009.",89,Ruca Malen 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"This dense, full-flavored Chenin exudes ripe fruit aromas and flavors of red apple flesh, wood-grilled peach and sweet orange oil. The mouthfeel is round but not fat, with good acidity and a spicy but clean finish. Drink now–2014.",90,Remhoogte 2010 Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch)
"Think of this wine as a tough, ornery relative who shows great depth once you get to know him. Leather, chocolate and prune notes mark the aromas and flavors, and the wine shows some alcoholic warmth and drying tannins. But the class shows through on the finish, which is long and richly textured. Give it at least another five years in the cellar.",90,Château de Beaucastel 2005 Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape)
"The bouquet on this blend from the Limarí region is perfumed, floral and slightly exotic, with spunky red-fruit scents and graphite. The palate is full and mouthfilling, with lightly herbal blackberry, plum, pepper and spice flavors along with mild heat and a toasted note. Despite showing a hint of burn, this is a serious wine with short-term aging potential. Drink now–2017.",92,Viña Tabalí 2009 Payen Red (Limarí Valley)
"Truly enjoyable, this has loads of fizzy bubbles and sweet tones of strawberry and raspberry tart. This sweet, sparkling red wine is made with low atmospheric pressure, giving it a soft, creamy feel.",85,Borgo Maragliano 2011 Brachetto (Piedmont)
"This garnet-colored wine has a pure aroma of ripe cherry. Made from a grape that is native to Moldova and Romania, its fruity palate is dominated by flavors of red and black cherry with notes of pomegranate and cranberry. Its lively acidity is pleasantly offset by graceful tannins.",89,Purcari 2014 Rara Neagra (Moldova)
"Pinot Gris is starting to have a presence in Washington, and the straightforward, citrus-flavored fruit shown here suggests a middle-of-the-road style. It's a tart, palate-cleaning wine with a hint of citrus-rind bitterness in the finish.",86,Columbia Winery 2000 Pinot Gris (Yakima Valley)
"A lean wine with green fruit flavors, this is made drinkable by its balance between fruit and the dry core of tannins. The wine should be drunk now.",82,Adega Vila Real 2015 Touriga Nacional (Douro)
"Rich, thick and robust, this offers a mélange of black cherry and strawberry. A fruity element dominates over any savory varietal character.",85,Spell 2013 Nichole's Blend Pinot Noir (Sonoma County)
"Crushed rose, pressed violet, perfumed berry, sage and a balsamic note are just some of the aromas you'll find on this full-bodied red. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, black pepper and licorice alongside tightly knit tannins and the subtle warmth of alcohol. Give it a few more years to come together. Drink 2018–2016.",90,Cantina del Pino 2011  Barbaresco
"A blend of equal parts Vermentino, Fiano and Chardonnay, Le Zere offers thick aromas of honey, yellow fruit and butterscotch. A sour, spicy flavor moves the wine forward over the palate.",84,Pieve Vecchia 2009 Le Zere White (Maremma)
"Big, powerful wine that is restrained by its ripe, dusty tannins. It is concentrated, with an almost Port-like texture, a result of the open lagars in which it is fermented. The fruit is likely to be rich and opulent as the tannins move into balance.",93,Wine & Soul 2008 Pintas Red (Douro)
"A blend of the favorite grapes of winemaker Edgar Torres (60% Grenache) and his wife, Erika (40% Syrah) from Kimsey Vineyard, this bottling shows bright and elegant aromas of boysenberry and elderberry with olive, wet river stone and pine forest. The chalky tannins still need time to evolve, but the black pepper, dark fruit, incense and myrrh flavors are well balanced.",93,Bodega de Edgar 2014 E2 Red (Ballard Canyon)
"For everyday consumption, this is good Cabernet with rousing fruit, body and pulse. The nose has smoke, rubber, pepper and cured meat to go with berry and cassis aromas, and the palate is very fruity, driving and loaded with flavorful cherry, raspberry and plum fruit. Not refined but good and honest.",86,Tour 52 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (San Juan)
"Coming from five different vineyards across the Niagara Peninsula, it's an intriguing wine with notes of wintergreen, lime zest, and herbs. It drinks just off dry with a lemon pith finish.",88,Cave Spring 2011 Riesling (Niagara Peninsula)
"This wine starts out a touch reduced before opening to reveal light aromas of almond, marzipan and spice. The palate puts a premium on elegance, with the concentration at times seeming a bit light but with the balance still there and a lingering finish.",89,Rôtie Cellars 2015 Northern White Marsanne (Washington)
"The Sonoma winery heads south to source fruit from this vineyard jointly owned by the Pisoni and Franscioni families. The nose offers cherry pastry, black olive, sandalwood and graphite, and the palate presents flavors of pomegranate seeds and cranberry-orange juice across finely grained tannins.",89,Anaba 2012 Soberanes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Lush texture meets crisp acidity in this full-figured exploration of ripe peach and pear. Nutty and quietly floral, it ends in a voluptuous finish of smoky spice.",91,Luna 2015 Reserve Estate Pinot Grigio (Napa Valley)
"This opens with aromas of coffee, coconut and black-skinned berry. The tightly wound palate isn't very expressive but eventually reveals dried cherry, toasted oak and espresso alongside bracing tannins. Give it another year or two for the tannins to unwind and then drink sooner rather than later.",88,Silvio Grasso 2011 Bricco Manzoni  (Barolo)
"This light Chardonnay from Puglia has very little pulp and offers measured aromas of stone fruit, melon and honey. It tastes thin and watery and would make a good companion to light finger foods on an easy afternoon.",84,Mocavero 2007 Chardonnay (Salento)
"Espresso and turmeric scents hit the nose first, trailed by dark berry and smoked wood tones. Tangy acidity frames the wine's slinky core, and the dusty tannins lend the palate some texture.",86,Fox Meadow 2011 Reserve Cabernet Franc (Virginia)
"This is complex and compelling. A spicy, minty, thyme-like character comes out in the aroma and continues in the flavor, most likely from some new barrels used in aging the wine. It's an attractive characteristic, and complements the bright cherry flavors, medium body and quite firm tannins.",89,Spann Vineyards 2011 The Classic Four Red (California)
"DiamAndes continues to put out clunky Viogniers from the Uco Valley. This is bland and waxy on the nose, with notes of green melon and nectarine. The palate is round and full but lacks personality, while flavors of papaya and melon are heavy and finish yeasty.",84,DiamAndes 2012 de Uco Viognier (Uco Valley)
"This blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot opens with acrid aromas that recall sweat and wet leaves. The palate delivers a mouthful of raw oak, roasted coffee bean and espresso. It lacks fruit richness and finishes on a bitter note of astringent wood tannins.",83,Vignaioli del Morellino di Scansano 2010 Riserva Roggiano  (Morellino di Scansano)
"This is part of a collection of wines from old vine parcels put together by Nicolas Potel. The wine comes from vines up to 62-years-old, that are rich in opulent fruitiness which is shot through with acidity. Wood aging has added a toasty character without losing any sight of the fruit. It is a fine wine that should age further. Drink from 2018.",92,Roche de Bellene 2014 Vieilles Vignes  (Puligny-Montrachet)
"One of the more structured Pinot Grigios, this opens with aromas that recall white flower, orchard fruit, a whiff of oak and chopped herb. The bright palate offers Kaiser pear, yellow apple, vanilla, candied citrus zest and a ginger note alongside crisp acidity.",89,Tiefenbrunner 2014 Turmhof Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige)
"This Riesling from Piedmont has a fragrance of white spring flowers accented by a hint of honey and beeswax. The palate is nervy and fresh, showing ripe pear, white pepper, clove and honey notes.",87,Ca' del Baio 2011 Riesling (Langhe)
"A clean, fresh wine, this opens with crisply varietal aromatics of citrus and orange blossom. The flavors follow suit, adding some fresh-cut pineapple as well; then the wine hits a wall and simply pulls up short.",86,Columbia Winery 2013 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Mocha and chocolate welcome you in, but once you get in there isn't much to taste. There's generic red fruit, spice and leather, but the wine seems acidified and on the razor's edge. Not overly generous and the mouthfeel is sheering.",84,Bodegas Escorihuela 2005 Cruz Alta Reserve Syrah (Mendoza)
"This wine, named for the present owners' mother, is full of red berry fruit, attractive acidity and toasty wood to balance. It has soft, generous tannins, an open, juicy texture and is very ready to drink.",88,Quinta da Lapa 2013 Nana Reserva Red (Tejo)
"Aromas of underbrush, scorched earth and dark baking spice lead the way on this firmly structured wine. The tense, full-bodied palate delivers dried black cherry, licorice, leather and tobacco supported by bracing, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2019–2029.",91,Pio Cesare 2011 Ornato  (Barolo)
"Here the fruit seems to stay in the watermelon/strawberry range, not under-ripe, but more in a high-acid, Euro style. The oak aging (18 months) cloaks it in a lush coat of milk chocolate.",89,Vidon Vineyard 2013 Mirabelle Clone 115 Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"Dry, creamy and crisp in acidity, this has rich pineapple, lemon, lime and buttered toast flavors. It's easy to drink and enjoy.",88,Martin Ray 2011 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This is a fruity, full wine that is dominated by Arinto, giving fresh, lemon and apricot flavors. It is crisp, lightly textured and offers a bright tang of zest and acidity on the finish. Drink now.",87,Caves Velhas 2014 Cabeça de Toiro Reserva White (Tejo)
"This is another excellent Malbec in Trapiche's single-vineyard series. Aromas of anise and licorice are exotic and a bit unusual, while blueberry, blackberry and herbal hints fill out the bouquet. The palate is full and jammy, maybe a touch soft, with layered flavors of black fruits, pepper and toast. A stocky finish with a licorice reprise shows a spot of heat. Drink through 2017.",92,Trapiche 2010 Suarez Lastra Terroir Series Single Vineyard Malbec (La Consulta)
"Light aromas of cocoa, herb, licorice and barrel spice are followed by medium-bodied cherry flavors. The finish seems a bit clipped.",88,Board Track Racer 2015 The Chief Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Here's a solid everyday Zin, lusty and rustic, offering up a big gulp of fruity flavor. Blackberries, cherries, mulberries, root beer, licorice, and just about every spice you can name shows up. It's a dry, tannic wine that will love rich, fatty meats and cheeses.",85,Renwood 2005 Zinfandel (Sierra Foothills)
"Textbook aromas of lychee and quince jelly open this spritzy Asti-styled Moscato. Despite its bubble content, this is smooth and easy in the mouth. Creamy, sugary flavors of lime, lychee and melon finish easy. This should appeal to Moscato fans.",87,Tussock Jumper 2013 Moscato (Valencia)
"This variety remains an extreme rarity in the state but the early offerings show promise. Here, the aromas are light, with notes of citrus zest, lees and mineral. The flavors are broad and creamy in feel, extending on the finish. It should show well at the dinner table.",89,The Walls 2015 Lip Stinger French Creek Vineyard Grenache Blanc (Yakima Valley)
"Rooty, stalky, earthy aromas are spread wide and thin. This Cab has a gritty feel and hard tannins. Stalky flavors of coffee grinds are herbal and tough, while heat, sauciness and tomato-leaf flavors suggest cool-climate origins. Overall this is racy and cool in style; drink now.",87,Piattelli 2011 Grand Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Tupungato)
"Direct blackberry and cassis aromas are on the dark side and inviting. This feels fresh and a touch wiry, while flavors of vanilla, tobacco, brandied cherry and plum are traditional and true to the region. Finishing flavors of clove and spice run dry and toasty.",89,Finca del Marquesado 2006 Reserva  (Rioja)
"Buttered toast, popcorn and butterscotch flavors mark this Chardonnay. The underlying wine struggles to come through, but shows good acidity and tropical fruit, lime and orange flavors.",85,Ferrari-Carano 2011 Tré Terre Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This superpremium effort from Precept Brands is loaded with fruit, and crafted with winemaker Charlie Hoppes' trademark style—lush oak, giving generous barrel flavors of butterscotch and toast. The barrel flavors dominate, complemented by bold black cherry, blackberry and cassis fruit.",88,Sol Duc 2005 Goose Ridge Estate Vineyard Meritage Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A waxy lemon-peel note and a whiff of lanolin lend a mineral-driven slickness to this delicately textured, penetrating Riesling. Ripe tropical-fruit flavors are honeyed and intensely concentrated, yet the finish is elegant with a swathe of fresh, clean flowers.",90,Eifel-Pfeiffer 2010 Trittenheimer Apotheke Spätlese Riesling (Mosel)
"While just a touch ripe on the nose, this rosé is wonderfully dry with a bright red plum and cherry compote palate accented by deep, stony minerality. Full bodied, yet pleasantly astringent on the finish, it's the perfect accompaniment to seafood.",87,Korta Katarina 2009 Plavac Mali-Zinfandel Rosé (Peljesac)
"Sirmian is a beautiful Pinot Bianco that really shows true varietal characteristics. The subdued bouquet delivers pear, stone fruit and crushed mineral. The mouthfeel is creamy, rich and ends with waxy flavors of lemon and Golden Delicious apple.",90,Nals Margreid 2011 Sirmian Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
"Large French oak barrels were used to ferment this toasty, ripe wine, which boasts notes of stone fruit and citrus. A mix of cool-climate Portuguese grapes and Chardonnay, it will smooth out and become rich and complex with time; drink after 2016.",92,Adega Mãe 2013 Dory Reserva White (Lisboa)
"Creamy and smooth with a dense and sophisticated style, this is the kind of top-shelf Pinot Grigio you could pair with lobster bisque or New England clam chowder. There are pretty aromas here of yellow flower, acacia, peach, pear and citrus.",87,Russiz Superiore 2008 Pinot Grigio (Collio)
"This celebration of legendary Jerry Lohr's 80th birthday is a winner on all fronts. A zesty, uplifting nose of blackberry, cola, licorice, leather and clay leads into a cohesively woven palate of soy, shiitake dust, roast beef and dark chocolate. The acidity is well-measured, the tannins are chalky and grippy and it's powerful without being flashy.",93,J. Lohr 2013 Signature Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Aromas of smoke, matchstick, mineral and red fruit are followed by lightly styled cranberry flavors that winnow toward the finish.",85,Latah Creek 2012 Alice Vineyard Malbec (Wahluke Slope)
"Retro makes one of the best, most consistent Petite Sirahs in California. Even though they used to source their fruit from Howell Mountain and this bottling now is from Pope Valley and Calistoga, it still shows the same qualities of complex interest based on impeccable winemaking. It's an amazing wine, dry, full-bodied and tannic, with a complex range of berries, currants, herbs and white pepper. Truly a Petite Sirah for Cabernet lovers. Drink now–2020.",93,Retro 2009 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley)
"One of the markers for grapes from the heart of the Dundee Hills is a deep black-cherry fruit core, and it's here in spades. In this penetrating, powerful wine, that dense fruit comes close to cassis, along with coffee and cola streaks. Drink now through 2026.",93,Archery Summit 2013 Red Hills Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Makes an interesting contrast with the J.J. Prüm bottling from the same site, weighing in at a full 1.5% less in finished alcohol, and showing mineral-inflected passion fruit flavors and a touch of vanilla. The sweetness is finely balanced by mouthwatering acidity on the finish.",90,S.A. Prüm 2009 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
Fruity aromas of fresh strawberry mash mix with touches of slate and a twist of dried mint on the nose of this bottling by winemaker Rick Hill. The palate relies on light black-raspberry flavors that are lifted by black-tea leaves and a touch of orange-rind tang.,91,Tantara 2014 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Initially just juicy black currants, it shows a more structured side very slowly. The result is a fruity wine, ready to drink soon.",85,Herdade da Malhadinha Nova 2009 Aragonês da Peceguina Aragonez (Alentejano)
"Fresh and easy, this delivers fruity aromas of Golden Delicious apple, apricot, honey and yellow flower. A drying mineral note renders a clean, polished finish.",86,Tenuta di Pietra Porzia 2011 Saula Carta Nera  (Frascati Superiore)
"This has a deeper-than-usual yellow-gold color, and slight aromas and flavors that are more earthy and nutty than fruity. It is difficult to find the varietal character. It's a basic, rather full-bodied and drinkable white wine.",81,Schmitz 24 Brix 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Sierra Foothills)
"You expected fruity, flowery flavors? A little sweetness? Then go someplace else. This wine is one of the driest of the year, and offers no relief at all from alcohol and other winey compounds. If there's a single, solitary flavor, it's watered down lemon juice. But it might be pretty good with clams on the half shell. —S.H.",85,Yalumba 2001 Y Series Riesling (South Australia)
"Here's a full-bodied blush sparkling wine that's rich with raspberries, strawberries, limes, toast and yeast. Mainly Pinot Noir, with 20% Chardonnay, it has a pale orange-pink color, and finishes slightly sweet.",87,Mumm Napa NV Brut Rosé Sparkling (Napa Valley)
"This dry style of Pinot Gris has a rich character, which allows the spice to come through strongly—the acidity lingering behind. Flavors of tropical fruits are allied to the smooth, ripe finish.",88,Domaines Schlumberger 2010 Les Princes Abbés Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Offering the creamy and floral intensity of sparkling wines at double the price, this bears subtle notes of peach, white flower, brimstone and dried herb.",87,Progettidivini 2011 Millesimato Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Made entirely from Pinot Noir grapes, this méthode Champenoise sparkler is golden peach in color with attractive aromas and flavors of orange blossom, hazelnut, orange peel and a slight sense of garden herbs. Dry, it makes for a nice wine on its own or in spritzers.",89,Breathless NV Blanc de Noirs Sparkling (Sonoma County)
"Lemon, lime, sulfur and matchstick aromas are solid. This Viura has a standard, fresh, zesty mouthfeel and common flavors of white grapefruit and lime. A minerally, citric finish is crisp and appropriate.",86,Bodegas Muriel 2014 Vendimia Seleccionada Blanco Viura (Rioja)
"Accents of crushed violets add interest to the wild strawberry, blackberry and plum fruit core. Mouthwatering and clean, this has dusty tannins and medium acidity that provide a nice structure.",85,Mwitu 2011 Wild Wine Pinotage (Western Cape)
"Easy, simple and clean, this no-fuss Chianti opens with white cherry, forest berry and blue flowers. It's a subtle, soft wine with a compact but watery close.",84,Caposaldo 2010  Chianti
"Black fruit, bacon and sawdust aromas introduce this fuller-styled, fairly heady Merlot. With ripeness written all over it, there's still plenty of liveliness and punch to the black cherry and blackberry flavors. Finishing notes of pepper and chocolate give it added character.",88,MontGras 2006 Reserva Merlot (Colchagua Valley)
"This sleekly styled wine displays aromas of citrus peel, green apple and Bosc pear. The citrus flavors are lightly spritzy, bringing a sense of lightness and freshness. It's perfect for a summer day.",88,Milbrandt 2014 Traditions Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Trebbiano grapes from the beautiful Spoleto area of Umbria (also found in the areas of Montefalco and Trevi) have been carefully selected to produce this rich, golden white wine that would pair with veal or roast turkey. Aromas here include apricot, yellow rose, Golden Delicious apple and candied citrus.",88,Antonelli 2007 Trebium Trebbiano Spoletino Trebbiano (Umbria)
"This blend of Carmenère and Carignan opens with very woody, resiny aromas as well as black-fruit depth to support all that oak. An austere, oaky, acidic palate is drawing, while toasty, herbal, roasted berry flavors are resiny and salty tasting prior to an all-wood finish.",87,Vistamar 2011 Enki Red (Central Valley)
"The baked berry, raisin and vanilla aromas in this Tempranillo and Garnacha blend are a touch soupy. It's tannic and firm on the palate, with tomato, berry and mildly oxidized flavors.",88,Bodegas Olarra 2014 Añares Crianza  (Rioja)
"Ripe and full, it offers great spice, yellow fruits and hints of tropical fruits. It has acidity and is dry, but it's delicious because of its rounded texture and generous body. Drink from 2015.",89,Domaine Gérard Neumeyer 2012 Le Berger Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"An abundance of apple flavors—green, golden and red-cheeked—plays on the nose. Their crisp, crunchy, sweet tartness is apparent everywhere and explodes afresh with every tiny bubble that bursts. Creamy autolysis provides a generous background to this fizzing, fun wine. This is light-footed, exuberant and finishes with a joyous concert of apple-delight.",91,Jenkyn Place Vineyard 2010 Brut Cuvée Sparkling (England)
"Adastra is an organically farmed vineyard and the wine shows an earthy profile that's substantial and defining. Full bodied and ripe, it rides a tension of acidity that provides freshness, seasoned in tart cherry and pomegranate.",91,Talisman 2013 Adastra Vineyard Pinot Noir (Los Carneros)
"A Napa Valley wine from the Central Coast folks at Fess Parker Winery, this Cab was aged for more than two years in 67% new French oak. Briary, it drips in brawny black fruit and highlights of tobacco, clove, leather and black pepper. An uplifting hit of acidity maintains a balance against the heft.",93,Addendum 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This is a concentrated bruiser from a ripe warm vintage. Aromas of cheesy oak, vanilla, maple and blackberry require as much air as possible. Saturated, heavy and jammy on the palate, this pounds the palate with rugged tannins. Flavors of blackberry, prune and chocolate finish thick, chewy and grabby. This is not about elegance—it's all about power and concentration. Drink through 2025.",92,Dominio Basconcillos 2011 Estate Grown 12 Meses en Barrica Made with Organic Grapes  (Ribera del Duero)
"Another big, dense expression of the vintage, this has a softness to the tannins that makes it accessible, though the wine will benefit from time in the cellar, through 2017. Cinnamon and clove intermingle with black cherry and currant, finishing in a hint of tobacco.",90,Provenance Vineyards 2012 Barrel Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"Touches of vanilla, cream and lovely hints of oatmeal allude to developing, evolving autolytic notes. These are edged with pure lemon, giving equal expression to emollience and freshness. On the midpalate the creamy, generous richness of yeast comes through, providing stucture and a canvas against which tart apple and Amalfi lemon can play. Depth and serious intent shows amid the sensuously fine fizz. Although this wine is refreshing and bright now, more bottle age will make it even more alluring. The pure and lasting finish leaves you wanting more. Drink 2017–2017.",95,Nyetimber 2010 Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (England)
"Really ripe, this is a full-bodied wine that is full of tropical fruit contrasted with green apple flavor. It has weight, intensity and just a hint of spice. This should be aged 1–2 years at least. Screwcap.",90,Nigl 2010 Herzstück vom Kirchenberg Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"There's a bright, lively nature to this Prosecco Extra Dry that is enhanced by aromas of butterscotch, lemon drop and apricot. Sweet fruit flavors are followed by soft creamy foaming.",85,Le Manzane NV Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Dry black cherry and berry fruit shows some early chemical accents, and the wine stays sort of thin and hard all the way to the end. It's peppery and tight, with a simple dark-fruit personality. A little awkward at 14.5%.",84,Barzagoso 2004 Crianza  (Rioja)
"This is a structured, fairly austere Cabernet fermented in stainless steel and then aged in French oak. Dark and concentrated, the profile ripe in blackberry, cedar, sage and bittersweet chocolate.",90,Pride Mountain 2011 Vintner Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Intensely smoky and earthy on the nose and palate, this Georgian qvevri-aged wine is a showcase of minerality and textural complexity. It's a savory wine with bristling tannins, and it bears just a hint of citrus that keeps the palate fresh and bright.",88,Our Wine 2010 Vineyard Akhoebi Rkatsiteli (Kakheti)
"This is rather closed, with subtle aromas of red berry, cooking spices, scorched soil and underbrush. The firm palate offers tart sour cherry, chopped mint, dried sage and dark cooking spices set in a framework of solid tannins.",89,Barale Fratelli 2011 Bussia  (Barolo)
"From the highest (at 1,000 feet) of the Kunde's vineyards, it's lavishly oaked, with aromas of butterscotch, spice and custard; also nutty and creamy notes. Marked by intense tropical fruit aromas and oriental spices, it also tastes very rich. It's the best of a very good trio of limited-production Chardonnay wines.",90,Kunde 1998 C.S. Ridge Vineyard Chardonnay (California)
"This fascinating medium-bodied wine has a wild streak that first brings rhubarb and forest-floor aromas, then deep dark flavor nuances like mushroom, black cherry and more tangy rhubarb. It has good acidity and fine-grained tannins to support all that complexity. It offers all the complexity one looks for in a Pinot.",92,On Point 2015 On Point Christinna's Cuvée Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Other than being very sweet, this dessert wine has little to recommend it. It's soft and rich in white sugar flavors, with traces of oranges, red currants, chocolate and anise. High alcohol gives it a peppery burn.",83,Carol Shelton NV Black Magic Late Harvest Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
"Big, bold and black in color, this wine is full of new wood perfumes, and it has a smooth, polished texture. Rich, fruity and firmly balanced, it has dark tannins that create a powerful structure. It offers some aging potential.",90,Château Thénac 2009 Red (Côtes de Bergerac)
"Coming from the Radian Vineyard atop the Sta. Rita Hills, the appellation's veteran Bryan Babcock delivers aromas of pineapple cake, fresh apricot and lemon butter. The wine is well oaked, so expect vanilla and baking spice, but there's a lemony acidity as well, creating a well-balanced wine.",92,Babcock 2013 The Limit Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Polished and creamy, this is made to appeal to the popular style. It's rich and ripe in tangerine, apricot and lime fruit, with toasty, vanilla overtones. Brightened by crisp acidity, it's a lovely wine to drink now.",90,Liquid Farm 2010 Golden Slope Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"A pretty, floral nose adds a surprising dimension to this wine, but on the palate, the flavors fall somewhat flat. A good balance of oak and fruit prevails, but the nose suggests more.",82,Prejean 2005 Reserve Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"A smooth, toasty wine that has rich black fruits and generous tannins. Broad and ripe, it shows all the warmth of the Alentejo—a full-bodied wine that is ready to drink.",88,Tapada de Villar 2013 Reserva Red (Alentejo)
"Spicy and jumpy smelling, with red fruit aromas. The palate is alert, upright and tangy, with both citrus and red raspberry flavors. Reasonably good in terms of mouthfeel, with a light, herbal finish. A bit lean but exceedingly fresh.",85,Carmen 2008 Merlot (Rapel Valley)
"Thick, rich and ripe in vanilla, the American oak in this wine is pronounced and intense, wrapping itself around notes of candied apple and toffee-caramel.",87,Roche 2013 Barrel Select American Oak Reserve Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Very wound-up aromas of dried and dark red berries and asphalt show on the nose of this bottling from Temecula, another sign that Italian varieties can thrive in the warmer climate. The flavors are impressively deep and spicy, with black currant, blackened berries, pencil shavings, vanilla and char.",90,Ponte 2014 Montepulciano (Temecula Valley)
Rich flavors like vanilla and fig combine with a creamy texture and sweet finish to make a cream puff of a wine. The texture is soft and acidity quite low.,84,Nica 2012 Chardonnay (California)
"This is a really good example of a blended wine from Aragón. It's 50% Garnacha with 25% each Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon, and thus it is more complex and interesting than your run-of-the-mill varietal Grenache. Mellow aromas of ripe fruit and spice open things up, followed by balanced flavors of berry fruits, vanilla and cream. Easygoing and highly recommended for the price.",89,Borsao 2007 Crianza Selección Red (Campo de Borja)
"Aromatically speaking, this Pinot is rustic, roasted and rough, with notes of leaf and asphalt. The feel is grabby and sticky, with chewy tannins in front of the chunky, raisin-like flavor. The finish is baked and rubbery tasting.",86,Leyda 2011 Single Vineyard Cahuil Vineyard Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley)
"It's hard to find Chardonnays priced at less than $20 that pack this much interest. This bottling offers fresh-squeezed underripe tangerine, lemon blossoms, lemon curd, crisp Gala apple, sharp grapefruit skin and a bit of butter on the nose. A salty lemon butter and marmalade flavor show on the palate, along with pear, apple and nectarine, framed by intense acidity.",90,Sextant 2015 Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"Packed with strawberry aromas and red berry fruits, this is a ripe, fruit-forward wine only lightly disturbed by tannins. There is a great juicy quality here.",86,Georges Duboeuf 2009 Château des Bachelards  (Fleurie)
"Good ripe and rich wine that shows some of the opulence of Meursault. It has a good balance between toast and broad yellow and white fruit flavors. With acidity an extra component, the wine is attractively complete.",91,Roux Père et Fils 2007 Clos des Poruzots Premier Cru  (Meursault)
"Aged for 14 months in stainless steel with lees influence, this Viognier is expressive of peach, flower, mineral and crème fraîche. It doesn't pack the flamboyance that many Viognier's do; instead, it demonstrates poise, bearing medium body and balanced acidity. A minerally tang and a squirt of blood orange accent the finish.",87,Barboursville Vineyards 2010 Reserve Viognier (Virginia)
"A nice everyday sparkler. It's a little sweet and very forward in lime and strawberry flavors, with the yeast and toast complications of a fine sparkling wine.",87,Gloria Ferrer NV VA de VI Ultra Cuvée Sparkling (Sonoma County)
"When vineyards or, at least, land is in the family since the 15th century, it is interesting to taste their wines trending back to “bio.” This Baron de Montfort vineyard is certified organic. The result is fresh while also ripe, this is a lightly wood-tinted wine. It has a dry edge along with blackberry fruits and firm tannins. The acidity at the end acts as a counter-balance. Drink from 2019.",88,Château Lagrange Monbadon 2014  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux
"Savory aromas of grilled meats and barbecue sauce come with resiny oak and carob notes. This feels solid in the mouth, with an oak-driven texture that's cut by nice acidity. Core flavors follow the nose: savory berry with resiny oak, herbs and BBQ notes. Spearmint flavors and racy acidity drive the finish.",88,Ventisquero 2010 Queulat Gran Reserva Single Vineyard Carmenère (Maipo Valley)
"Beautiful lemon-scented wine, balancing rich butter and apricot flavors with intense, pure acidity. The wine at this stage is toast and fruit, still coalescing into its long-term future.",94,Domaine Leflaive 2008 Clavoillon Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet)
"A real success, this 100% Merlot, sourced from the Stillwater Creek and Conner Lee vineyards, is exotically scented with a rich mix of baking spices, coffee, dust, pencil lead and cedar. Lots of oak influence, but it plays well against the tart and mellow berry flavors. There is a suggestion of dried leaf, perhaps an indication of older vines.",92,Market Vineyards 2008 Benchmark Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Hailing from Sagemoor, Oasis and Canyon Vineyard Ranch, this wine has aromas of toasty spices, peach, butter and corn on the cob. The flavors are lighter in style with a creamy feel and a pleasing sense of balance.",88,Browne Family Vineyards 2013 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Rosemary-marinated steak, roast pork roll stuffed with prunes or dark chicken or turkey meat would make perfect paring partners to this red blend from southern Tuscany. Aromas of spice, mature cherry and leather are soft and penetrating.",90,Massi di Mandorlaia 2007 Colpetroso  (Maremma)
"This rich, dark take on the cool-climate vineyard delivers all the great Syrah components. Lavish cooked beef, fudge, loam and mint aromas accent its black currant and blueberry base. The palate is coated with soft, polished tannins that present savory beef and black currant flavors, steeped in peppercorn and lavender.",92,Epiphany 2014 Bien Nacido Vineyard Syrah (Santa Maria Valley)
"Brian Loring's bottling of this vineyard planted by Gary Pisoni and Gary Franscioni is bursting with raspberry syrup, cola and peppercorns on the nose. The palate boasts notes of strawberry juice, red berries and hibiscus. It's luxurious and sexy.",95,Loring Wine Company 2013 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Interesting and well structured, this can age a few years or more. Aromas of honey, stone fruit and butterscotch candy give this wine a sophisticated edge.",88,Villa Russiz 2009 Pinot Grigio (Collio)
"Jammy, somewhat green aromas are suggestive of tomato sauce with oregano and thyme. This feels full, creamy and thick, with earthy, herbal berry flavors that finish with creamy weight and chewy tannins.",86,Cicchitti 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Starts off with mineral, lemon and anise aromas that develop on the palate into dried spices, ground flint and lime. It's light in body, yet finishes strong, with clean citrus flavors and a lasting sensation of powdery talc.",87,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2000 Rancho Chimiles Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Aromas of dark fruit and cedar lead the nose and follow through to the warm, soft palate with peppercorn, licorice and dried blackcurrant. Velvety tannins provide the framework but it's shy on freshness, so enjoy soon.",89,Fabrizio Dionisio 2011 Il Castagno Syrah (Cortona)
"This is a bright, crisp, nonvintage blend. While it is fruity and youthful in character, the blend's older vintages also make it taste mature. Pear and apple notes dominate, lacing through the tangy, zesty texture.",88,Montaudon NV Réserve Première Brut  (Champagne)
"An estate-grown Pinot Noir from the wilds of Freestone, this wine delivers in high acidity and perfumed aromatics that are highlighted by violet and sandalwood. The taste leans towards tart cherry and strawberry. Medium in weight, it's a structured wine, with just the right amount of heft and oak on the finish.",93,Joseph Phelps 2012 Pastorale Vineyard Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Concentrated and structured, this layers wood and vanilla flavors with a taut, mineral character. With its richness and well-balanced citrus, tropical fruit flaavors, it will certainly age for at least four years. Screwcap.",93,Domaine Laroche 2010 Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis)
"This rosé is mouthfilling and round, with ample melon and berry fruit, a sprinkling of dried spices and minimal herb notes. It actually drinks almost like a red wine for its weight and berry-scented richness, but remains refreshing on the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now.",93,Château de Ségriès 2015  Tavel
"There's a ton of ginger spice mingling nicely with the strong floral component of honeysuckle, orange blossom and dried hibiscus flowers in the nose of this wine. Ripe peach and grapefruit oil support the earthy characters and flesh out the full, flavorful mouth, closing nicely with a clean medium- length finish.",87,Domaine de Fonfile 2008 Viognier (Vin de Pays d'Oc)
"The blend includes 6% Syrah, and the wine has a pretty plum and blueberry color, that (perhaps by the power of suggestion) carries through into the aromas. It's tight, tart, and clean, offering a mix of berry fruits and a finish lined with vanilla and tobacco. Overall the balance is excellent, the wine juicy and fresh, and the blend just about perfect.",87,Columbia Crest 2008 Two Vines Merlot (Washington)
"While the wood flavors are prominent, they don't mask the ripe berry fruits in this Merlot-dominant blend. Blaye sister-brother team of Marie-Pierre et Pierre-Charles Dartier produced a wine with a rich character. It is full of wood spice, hints of mint and acidity. Drink from 2019.",89,Château Cailleteau Bergeron 2014 Tradition  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"Aromas of cedar, plum, toast, espresso and a whiff of blue flowers lead the nose of this Sangiovese blended with 15% Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The ripe, straightforward palate offers ripe cassis, coconut, mocha and a hint of anise alongside firm, fine-grained tannins.",88,Castello di Monastero 2012  Chianti Classico
"Chimney Rock continues a successful string of vintages with this powerful '05. It's a distinguished wine that calls to mind the description of Stags Leap Cabernet as an iron fist in a velvet glove. Rich and full-bodied, it has lush flavors of black currants and smoky new oak. Easy to find, with 28,000 cases produced. Drink now through 2012.",92,Chimney Rock 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District)
"Make this wine a little drier and the score would rise. As things are, it's just too sweet and one-dimensional in jammy raspberries and cherries, while oak brings buttered toast and roasted coconut flavors that are candy sweet. Good as it is, it palls after a while.",86,Pali 2009 Cargasacchi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Light and mostly fresh, with shy peach and green-fruit aromas. The palate is soft and reticent, with lower-level acids and chunky melon and papaya flavors. Finishes pithy and thus mildly bitter. Drink soon or wait for the 2008.",84,Peñalolen 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Limarí Valley)
"This compelling wine comes largely from The Rocks District. Seeing just a kiss of new French oak (25%), it offers exquisitely fresh, rich aromas and flavors, with notes of plum, pipe tobacco, leather and earthy funk.",91,Saviah 2012 Tempranillo (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Earthy, foresty aromas of plum and dark berry fruits show a touch of wet animal fur. This is sturdy and fairly full in build, with leafy flavors of plum, pepper, chocolate and toast. Mild green notes of mint and herbs accent a spicy finish,",89,Primus 2014 Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"This vivacious white is a beach pour with class. Fresh lemon zest and floral aromas and a combination of white fruit, minerals and citrus on the palate are lively and light, but the wine has some weight behind it.",88,Domaine Gioulis 2013 Sofos The Wise One Moschofilero-Chardonnay White (Peloponnese)
"A full blast of oak and related aromas open this creamy, ripe wine. Plump on the palate but with just enough acidity to preserve balance, this rich, friendly wine features walnut, papaya and citrus flavors that finish woody, smooth and long. Drink now.",90,Bodega Catena Zapata 2013 Catena Alta Historic Rows Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"As pale as a rosé can be, this is a smooth and rounded wine. Ripe, perfumed red fruits offer a tang from a squeeze of lemon. The acidity gives the right amount of freshness to this attractive, drink-it-now wine.",87,Barton & Guestier 2013 La Villa Barton Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Let this wine breathe for a couple hours in a decanter to unlock it. Right out of the bottle, it's a bit brittle and Porty. Airing brings out the cherry-raspberry fruit, and it softens and enhances the earthiness and spices, making for a more fulfilling experience.",91,Buena Vista 2008 Arpad's Selection Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
"Dark fruit and a meaty consistency make for a bold and delicious first impression. The wine delivers layers of cherry, blackberry spice, leather and spicy tobacco. The wine shows some modern oak touches of vanilla softness, but by no means in an exaggerated fashion.",92,Tenuta Friggiali 2007 Agricola Centolani Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"This Coda di Volpe has a subdued nose that lets aromas of chopped herb and mineral reveal themselves slowly. It's tonic and firm with good crispness and an easy overall approach. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers.",85,Cantina del Taburno 2007 Amineo Coda di Volpe (Beneventano)
"Black as night, it offers classic characteristics. Oodles of black pepper on the nose and palate are seasoned over soft, lush tannins and hearty layers of licorice, dark chocolate and coffee. It's ready to enjoy now but will also grow gracefully over many years.",91,Spellbound 2009 Reserve Petite Sirah (Napa Valley)
"A 100% varietal wine, this offers tremendous quality for the price, a well-crafted showcase for currant, cedar and bark that remains savory at its core. Grippy in tannin and contained oak, it's drinkable now but will benefit from time in the cellar, through 2021.",91,Martin Ray 2013 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A Chardonnay with an unusual companion, 8% Sémillon, this is floral and fruity in equal measure. Tight, bright acidity supports flavors of fennel and green apple, with the oak impact playing a subtle supporting role. The finish is nicely crisp.",90,Apriori 2013 Chardonnay (Mendocino County)
"The Bertins Premier Cru vineyard is on the southern Volnay side of Pommard, giving a comparatively soft generous style of wine. Even so, there is plenty of structure here with powerful dark toasty flavors balanced by rich blackberry fruit. This is a fine wine with great potential. Drink from 2022.",94,Domaine Henri Delagrange 2014 Les Bertins Premier Cru  (Pommard)
"Dark on the nose, with peppery spice, mocha, basil and secondary berry aromas. Shows power and density in the mouth, with burnt, blackened flavors of blackberry, plum and pepper. Even more peppery on the finish. More black and dark than typically herbal and spicy.",86,Viña Bisquertt 2010 La Joya Reserve Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"The inclusion of 11% Aligoté, which was sourced from a block planted in 1979, makes this Chardonnay unique. The Aligoté seems to thicken the core fruit, and it adds flesh and rind-like flavor, along with old-vine details of dried herb and spice. It's a pleasing mix of integrated stone-fruit, grain and citrus-peel notes.",90,Upland Estates 2010 Chardonnay (Snipes Mountain)
"Sweet oak tones of cinnamon, ripe cherry and raspberry are delivered via a beautifully intense bouquet. This is a Brunello with tight tannins, fresh acidity and solid structure.",94,Cupano 2006 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"This tan-colored brut is outright oxidized and bready from front to tail. A foamy full palate is awkward, while this tastes yeasty and stale, as oxidized wines often do.",81,Valdivieso NV Brut Sparkling (Chile)
"This is an elegant, refined and lighthearted red that shines with a wooded tannin structure and accents of pencil and clove. Rounded and smooth on the palate, it's bright and succulent in blackberry and black currant flavors, with well-integrated oak.",90,Trefethen 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oak Knoll District)
"Quite oaky on the nose, showing lots of caramel and butterscotch flavors on the palate, this Chardonnay is anchored by its apple and peach flavors. It opens up nicely with some breathing time; decanting would not be out of order.",89,àMaurice 2009 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a soft, lightly fruity wine with citrus and grapefruit flavors. It has some minerality and an attractive texture that gives shape to the wine. Drunk fresh in the summer, it will make a fine apéritif.",85,Château Bertinerie 2012  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux
"From a high altitude estate in the Vaucluse, this blend of 60% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 5% Cinsault is pale and coppery in hue, yet shows ample richness and weight on the palate. Notes of wet stone, berry and citrus linger on the mouthwatering finish.",88,Chêne Bleu 2014 Rosé (Vin de Pays de Vaucluse)
"Golden honey in color, the Ramspeck Sassolini is lush with lemon flavor and high acidity that lingers on the palate, crisp and tart. Sourced from Lake County fruit, a fine place for crisp whites, this wine is balanced in alcohol and richness too.",87,Ramspeck 2010 Sassolini Pinot Grigio (Lake County)
"Once you get past the herbal edge, there are nice red berry and fudgy chocolate brownie aromas and flavors that play together nicely. A touch of sweet spice appears after swallow to liven up the juicy fruit core. Drink now.",86,Beyerskloof 2008 Synergy Cape Blend Red (Stellenbosch)
"You don't get to taste the Foglia Tonda variety often. This blend sees 35% FT, with the rest being Sangiovese. The wine is rich in cherry and vanilla nuances.",89,Donatella Cinelli Colombini 2004 Cenerentola Red (Orcia)
"Big, ripe and juicy, this wears its rich black fruits right up front. A strong and firmly tannic structure serves as a background to the fruit. The wine is rich, complex and full of potential. Spice, ginger and nutmeg come through at the end along with the fruit. Drink from 2022.",94,Château Malartic-Lagravière 2012  Pessac-Léognan
"This tastes sweet and simple, with lemongrass and tropical fruit notes. It's high in acidity, giving it a sweet and sour finish.",82,Felten Cellars 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Barbara County)
"Despite its pale, white color this Ausbruch emanates notes of dried Medjool dates and dark raisins. Currant and golden sultana also get their due. Brighter sweetness illuminates the poised palate that is lit up with fresh acidity. All the while the rich, sweet, sumptuous and dark caramel notes provide a sonorous background. Evidence to what giddy heights a Welschriesling (not related to Riesling) can rise. The finish comes with a satisfying fillip of apricots. This is unusual and should spur the curiosity of sweet wine lovers.",93,Rosenhof 2013 Ausbruch Welschriesling (Burgenland)
"A firmly structured wine, showing dark black fruits and a very mineral texture. The tannins are chalky, dusty, chewy. Along with all this tight structure, rich fruits are waiting underneath. Give it 4–5 years.",89,Borges 2008 Reserva Tinto Red (Dão)
"A scratchy, rough nose with forced creamy oak aromas is also a bit fiery and hot. A heavy palate with surface-level oak tastes more of clove and cured beef than honest fruit. A sticky, cloying palate is creamy and overtly oaky.",83,MontGras 2015 Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"Candied peach, melon and grape notes are sweet and simple in this fruity white wine. Made from Diamond, a Concord-grape hybrid, with just a splash of Riesling, it's forward and easy but finishes with a crush of sweet-tart citrus. Drink now.",86,Fulkerson 2016 Juicy Sweet Estate Diamond (Finger Lakes)
"With a vibrant orange-gold color, giant nut, honey and alcohol aromas and very full body, this bold, late-harvest-style wine compares to a rich style of Spanish Sherry. It begs for roasted, salted almonds or Serrano ham as a pairing.",86,Quady NV Fino Gena Nonini Palomino (Madera)
"White pepper and smoke notes highlight the intense minerality in this steely Riesling. Lemony on the palate, this is crisp and brisk, and it comes with notes of wet slate and steel on the finish.",87,Wagner 2010 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"This wine is two-thirds Merlot, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Mesquite, dark cherry, vanilla, herb and spice aromas lead to tart, tingly flavors with bunched up tannins.",87,Burnt Bridge 2013 Blend X Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This is a smooth wine whose tannins have been already integrated into the blackberry fruits. It is ripe, still young of course, and with a stalky texture in the background. With acidity and fruitiness, the wine needs to age. Drink from late 2017.",87,Château la Barotte 2015 Cuvée Prestige  (Bordeaux)
"Whole berry pressed with 11% saignee from Syrah and Primitivo rounding out the blend, it's a very pretty, pale salmon color with notes of strawberry, watermelon and mineral. It drinks medium sweet with abundant cherry flavors.",85,Gecko 2012 Barbera Rosé (Wahluke Slope)
"Comes on solid and strong with smoky aromas of black fruit, coconut and shoe polish. Stout and layered in the mouth, with full tannins and a nice mix of bold berry flavors, tobacco, herbs, spice and lemony oak. Tastes similar on the finish, with tobacco and spice lasting the longest. Complex and healthy; drink now through 2018.",91,Recoletas 2004 Vendimia Seleccionada  (Ribera del Duero)
"Dense almost to the point of chewiness, this is a concentrated blend of Syrah, Carignan and Grenache. Earthy, plummy notes pick up hints of dark chocolate and licorice before ending rich and velvety.",90,Château d'Or et de Gueules 2010 Les Cimels Red (Costières de Nîmes)
"Crunchy red fruit is front and center in this vineyard-designate, well capturing the tone of the appellation. Raspberry, black tea and brooding tannins surround a light-bodied frame further highlighted with violet and cardamom.",90,Tessier Winery 2015 Morelli Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Green Valley)
"Crisp acidity comes to the rescue of this slightly sweet wine, giving it a bracing mouthfeel that balances the sugary pineapple, peach, apricot and honeysuckle flavors.",84,Renwood 2006 Viognier (Lodi)
"This ripe rounded red-fruited wine is soft and smooth. With its creamy texture and light acidity it is a fine apéritif style. The name means happy cicada, a common feature of life in Provence. Drink now.",86,Château Carpe Diem 2016 Cigalle Joyeuse Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Simple and soft, this is one to drink now. It rewards for the wealth of cherry, blackberry, licorice and cocoa flavors that finish dry and clean.",84,Beringer 2005 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Exotic, attractive aromas of blueberry, cardamom and sandalwood get this Syrah off on the right foot. It feels concentrated and jacked up, with fully ripe, creamy flavors of blackberry, cassis and pastry. This is a chewy, layered, dense and jammy New World Syrah ready to drink now–2014.",91,Lapostolle 2009 Cuvée Alexandre Las Kuras Vineyard Made with Organic Grapes Syrah (Cachapoal Valley)
"This estate wine is packed with attractive fruit. With grapefruit and orange-zest flavors, it is tightly crisp. Set against that are the ripe red-currant and berry fruitiness, layers of acidity and a pinch of pepper. Drink this refreshing wine now.",90,Château les Valentines 2016 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This is a strong, dry and tannic Cabernet Sauvignon, with intense blackberry, black currant and new oak flavors. Right now, it's immature, offering little beyond sheer power. Will it age? Six years is no problem. After that, the overripeness, in the form of raisins, may easily kick in.",90,Alpha Omega 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A faint nose of lemon starts things off. Simple and clean on the palate, that same citrus character pervades, keeping things short and snappy.",84,Paradise Springs 2013 Chardonnay (Virginia)
"Here's a gorgeous sparkler made with Sangiovese that offers enticing scents of blue flower, perfumed berry, vineyard dust and a note of baking spice. The creamy, silky palate doles out juicy red cherry, crushed strawberry, McIntosh apple, tangerine zest and a cinnamon note alongside an ultrafine perlage. Watch out—this goes down beautifully!",92,Il Borro 2011 Bolle di Borro Brut Metodo Classico Sangiovese (Vino Spumante)
"Earthy scents of scorched earth, underbrush, licorice and dark berry emerge in the glass. The firm palate offers tastes of black raspberry, sage, toast, oak and espresso alongside assertive tannins that leave a drying finish.",89,Terrazze dell'Etna 2012 Carusu  (Etna)
"A good example of how well the Central Coast can make Chardonnays that satisfy even without oak barrel aging. The wine is clean and brisk in acidity, with ripe flavors of limes, kiwis and green melons.",88,Tolosa 2011 No Oak Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"There's a slightly sweaty note in the nose, but plenty of fruit in the mouth. Blueberry and black cherry, cassis and blue plum gather with substantial earthy chewy tannins. The high alcohol that's listed does not show in the flavor or the finish; in fact, this does a bit of a quick fade into flavors of coffee grounds.",86,Plaisance Ranch 2014 Malbec (Applegate Valley)
"This medium-weight wine flows effortlessly from start to finish, blending aromas of smoke and nuts with a citrusy core. Picks up savory nutty, cheesy notes (like a good Gruyère) on the long finish.",88,Ronco del Gelso 1999 Chardonnay (Friuli)
"A big, fat, ripe, unctuous wine. Shows massive black cherry, chocolate and cedar flavors, with prickly spices through the finish, and firm tannins. Bold and impressive now with rich fare.",88,Steven Kent 2006 Petite Verdot (Livermore Valley)
"This is a fresh wine that has just the right balance between spicy wood and red-currant fruits. With its acidity and crisp character, it is going to be a bright, fruity wine from 2017.",86,Chateau la Rame 2014  Bordeaux
"Although it's young, this wine has seen some time in oak, which has given it a ripe fruity character balanced by toast. It's rich and full with balancing acidity and a spicy aftertaste. It needs to age a few months, so drink from 2016.",88,Herdade de São Miguel 2014 Colheita Seleccionada Branco White (Alentejano)
"A popular favorite in the Northwest, Lemberger is a rustic, grapey, Zin-wannabe that offers pleasingly soft, fruity flavors well-suited to summer. This contains 24% Merlot, which adds weight to the fruit. Its soft tannins and light chocolate flavors make this a great go-to wine for the backyard barbecue. Best Buy. —P.G.",87,Covey Run 2000 Lemberger (Yakima Valley)
"A study of umami, this wine shows shiitake mushrooms, decomposing wood, soy and hibiscus on the nose. The palate is silky smooth yet with immediate verve, unfolding with flavors of loam, beef char, teriyaki-laced berries, smashed plums and graphite. It's focused yet expansive.",93,Wrath 2012 Swan/828 Pinot Noir (Monterey)
"A classic mix of cedar, tobacco, charcoal and earthy cherry aromas set the stage. In the mouth, this is minerally and tight, with crisp, pointed acidity. Flavors of vanilla and spice are oak-based, while raspberry and herbal notes are straight from the vines. A long, balanced finish simmers with spice and cigar box notes. Drink now until as far out as 2028.",92,Fuentes 2010 Finca El Puig Red (Priorat)
"Ignore the sediment in this unfiltered wine and find vibrant fruit aromas, fresh and zesty red-fruit flavors and a vivid acidity that creates good balance. It has a light to medium color, bright cherry and cranberry flavors, moderate tannins and a fairly rich texture.",88,La Clarine Farm 2013 Jambalaia Rouge Red (Sierra Foothills)
"There's an unripe, green edge to this Zinfandel that detracts from its appeal. Yet it has some good blackberry fruit, and it's nicely dry and tannic. Pair this with rich meats and cheeses to coax out the sweetness.",84,V. Sattui 2009 Mounts Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"Lively, fresh and very clean, this has bright acidity and an attractive touch of strawberry. It's dry, with a crispness that balances the rich fruit.",86,Bott Frères NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Crémant d'Alsace)
"This wine's nose barely hints at ripe apple and white pepper, but the palate sings with aromas and flavors: fresh lemon, ripe and juicy red apple and a slightly herbal, grassy touch. All of this appears on a delicate, light-bodied frame enlivened by zesty acidity. The finish is long, intriguing and dry.",90,Gunter Triebaumer 2016 Furmint (Burgenland)
"This wine needs food so much, it practically cries out loud for it. It's like the essence of lemons and grapefruits, in a bone-dry, crisply tart package that makes the taste buds sing. The oak has been kept in the background to emphasize the clean, racy flavors, although partial sur-lie aging adds creamy notes. Oysters and this wine would be a marriage made in heaven.",89,Robert Mondavi 1998 Sauvignon Blanc (Stags Leap District)
"Fresh and straightforward, this stainless steel-fermented Pinot Gris has simple, pleasant pear fruit flavors, and just a suggestion of caramel running through it. Perfectly suited for every day quaffing.",87,Illahe 2009 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"This stylish Merlot-based wine has juicy red-berry flavors that are sustained by acidity and firmed up by tannins. Still dry from its dense structure, it's developing well. Drink from 2018.",88,Clos Beauregard 2013  Pomerol
"Dry while also fruity, this is crisply textured and crisp to taste. Red-currant and orange-zest flavors blend well with a mineral texture to leave a clean, deliciously fruity aftertaste.",90,Devaux NV Cuvée Rosé Brut  (Champagne)
"Here's a savory nectar made with late-harvested grapes—95% Malvasia delle Lipari and 5% Corinto Nero—that opens with aromas of dried stone fruit, nut and sweet spice. The palate doles out apricot, fig, hazelnut and a dollop of acacia honey while fresh acidity brightens the rich flavors and prevents it from being overly sweet.",90,Hauner 2012  Malvasia delle Lipari
"All dry tannin and bramble aromas, this wine is a tough proposition. François Maurin and son Raphael handle the organic vineyards and wine fermented in stainless steel.",81,Château la Croix Blanche 2013  Francs Côtes de Bordeaux
"This wine is still in its shell, with notes of dark raspberries, cocoa and barrel spices. It's lusciously rich, dense and layered with firm tannins that need time in the cellar to soften. Just a baby now, it will be best from 2017 on.",92,Northstar 2010 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This inky black blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot delivers a thick, impenetrable appearance with jammy notes of blackberry preserves and maraschino cherry. It presents chewy, succulent fruit but is not overdone or too heavy on the close.",87,Cescon Italo Storia e Vini 2007 Chieto Red (Veneto)
"Nutty, with a note of baked lemon, this affordable, approachable wine is robust in tropical ripeness yet retains enough acidity to remain fresh and fruity throughout.",87,Kirkland Signature 2015 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This wine comes off a bit green and vegetal with aromas of tomato leaf, plum skins, pepper and black olive. The mouth is firm and assertive with gripping young, green tannins that linger, leaving a strong sense of astringency on the finish.",85,Segal's 2004 Dovev Single Vineyard Kosher Merlot (Galil)
"With an opaque purple tint and brawny, gaseous aromas of raw oak, bacon, black olive and blackberry, this old-vine Cabernet is blocky, tannic and bullish. Intense, toasty flavors of herbal blackberry and baked plum finish muscular, blackened, herbal and a touch bitter. Best from 2017–2022.",90,Miguel Torres 2010 Manso de Velasco Cabernet Sauvignon (Curicó Valley)
"With huckleberry and other blue fruit aromas and flavors, this wine doesn't seem varietally correct, but it's hard to ignore its lightly sweet, soft-feeling appeal and chalky tannins. It's not profound but still makes you reach for another sip to ponder it.",87,Diversion 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington)
"This light, fruity and fragrant white has a strong herbaceous character that is recognizably Sauvignon Blanc. It is crisp, clean, fresh and ready to drink.",85,Château Nicot 2014  Entre-Deux-Mers
"Opting to focus on the herbal side of California's historic grape, this wine shows dark cranberry on the nose but lets the chaparral, thyme and cola do the heavy lifting. The palate is dominated by shrub character, with wild mint, sage and oregano flavors seasoning the dried-berry fruit.",89,Robert Hall 2014 Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"Usually this block is at the top of the offerings from Coeur de Terre, but a leathery aroma and dried-out fruit knock it down in this vintage. Earth, cola, mint, a hint of cherry and a pleasant spiciness are also there, but the saddle leather dominates. Two bottles tasted.",86,Coeur de Terre 2010 Renelle's Block Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This medium-dry spätlese balances savory with sweet. Initially earthy, mineral tones build to plumper peach and pear through the midpalate. It's gossamer in texture, but finishes strong with a polished strike of steel and acid.",88,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler 2013 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Spätlese Riesling (Mosel)
"This young Garnacha is fresh and fruity, and entirely approachable and likable given the price. The palate is fairly smooth and medium in weight, with blackberry flavors that fade to darkness on the finish. This was made for everyday sipping.",87,Valcantara 2011 Old Vine Garnacha (Cariñena)
This smells and tastes rather vegetal; it lacks richness and comes across a bit sweet.,80,Arrowhead Mountain 2008 Primary Red (Sonoma Valley)
"Faint hints of lemon meringue pie play on the nose. The palate is wonderfully light-footed and very slender. Crisp green-apple and citrus notes abound against the backdrop of biscuity notes of yeast. This dances on tiptoe and would make for an ideal, sprightly apéritif with all its crispness and its dry finish.",89,Wolfberger NV Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"With a few years in bottle, this is maturing well. It has ripeness, the tannins beginning to soften into rich spice and damson jelly flavors. The acidity is still very present as is the dry core.",86,Chateau de Launay 2005 Les Vignes de Julia  (Bordeaux Supérieur)
"This slightly flowery wine truly speaks of its variety, bursting with aromas of orange zest and peppery spice. It's medium in body, with some attractive fleshy pear notes, but falls away a bit quickly on the finish. Best as an apéritif.",87,Darting 2007 Durkheimer Hochbenn Trocken Muskateller (Pfalz)
"From old vines, up to 45-years-old, the wine is attractively off dry, retaining plenty of acidity as well as gaining touches of honey and creamed apples. The wine is light while deliciously fruity. Drink from mid 2018.",89,Château Moncontour 2016 Demi-Sec  (Vouvray)
"Deep and sultry aromas of black fruit, mineral and toast mix with licorice gum drop and leather to form a good bouquet. The palate, however, runs more sharp than expected, with high acidity propelling lean, narrow pie-cherry flavors. A bit hollow but fresh and pure. Starts better than it ends. 70% Malbec and 30% Corvina.",87,Masi Tupungato 2008 Paso Doble Malbec-Corvina Red (Tupungato)
"Maison Louis Latour doesn't make this pricey Pouilly-Fumé, but is responsible for its commercialization in the U.S. Slightly grassy nuances accent gooseberry and grapefruit aromas, while the palate picks up a pleasant creaminess and weight. The crisp finish is dry and flinty, garnished by fresh green herbs.",88,Château de Tracy 1999  Pouilly-Fumé
"Pervasive notes of red apple and red pear that are both intense and restrained rise from the glass. They persist freshly and beautifully on a fluid, rounded body that is given much direction and shape by taut, bright acidity. There is a beautiful balance and great concentration with a warm, alcoholic finish.",88,Gebeshuber 2015 Muschelkalk Rotgipfler (Thermenregion)
"Globe-trotting Laely Heron's take on roughly 16-year-old vines in Monterey reveals aromas of Coca Cola, black cherry, ripe plum, sweet beet juice and a bit of tree bark. The palate is powered by anise-spiced cherries and pomegranate, fairly straightforward but quite quaffable.",89,Heron 2013 Pinot Noir (Monterey County)
"Aromas of overripe black plum and black cherry aromas accompany notes of leather, espresso, and powdered sage. The one-dimensional palate offers hints of baked plum alongside evolved, fleeting tannins but the fruit is drying up fast.",86,Bonacchi 2009 Casalino  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"This Chardonnay-led blend, with 20% Viognier and 10% Sauvignon, opens with mature notes of apple peel, orange rind, toasted walnut, honeycomb and baking spice. The round, robust offers those same notes, followed by a subtle, refreshing salinity that appears on the finish.",89,Gérard Bertrand 2013 Cigalus White (Aude Hauterive)
"This aromatically appealing wine brings aromas of blue fruit, barbecue briquettes, herbs, mineral and assorted spices. The fruit flavors are lithe yet intense, with a squeeze of tannins that lead to a supremely long finish.",92,Betz Family 2012 La Côte Rousse Syrah (Red Mountain)
"Citrus and herb characteristics show strongly in this full-bodied wine. They are enhanced by light wood flavors that smooth out the acidity. The result is a full, rich wine that could age. Drink from 2015.",91,Château Maison Noble 2012  Bordeaux Blanc
"Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot come together to offer black currant and vanilla aromas in this dense Bolgheri red. The palate doles out ripe black plum and cedar-inflected tobacco flavors, set against fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2020.",89,Tringali Casanuova 2013 Renzo  (Bolgheri)
"Fruity, spicy and brightly acidic, the Sol Duc represents the estate's best barrels. It's a generous wine, full bodied and lush, with cherry and cassis flavors. Light touches of leaf and herb come through as well.",90,Goose Ridge 2008 Sol Duc Goose Ridge Estate Vineyard Meritage (Columbia Valley (WA))
This 60-40 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot opens with jammy aromas of cherry marmalade and blackberry preserves. The fruit tones are very intense but the spice nuances are integrated and folded within the natural density of the mouthfeel.,87,Antonino Tringali-Casanuova 2008 Patrimonio  (Bolgheri)
"Dry in style and acidic, this blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier is marked by quince, papaya and Meyer lemon flavors. Despite its honeyed richness, it finishes clean and tart with citrusy acidity.",87,ONX 2012 Field Day White (Paso Robles)
"An elegant, elaborate Pinot Noir, clearly well grown. The structure is impeccable, with brisk, citrusy acidity and finely ground tannins. The flavors show long hangtime ripeness, flooding the mouth with raspberries, Dr. Pepper cola and exotic pie spices. There's even a note of balsam and mushrooms. Very fine now, with decanting, but should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",92,Freeman 2009 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Fragrant ripe red apples mingle with the more mellow notes of baked apples. Above it all, faint floral notes play beautifully. The palate brings out fresher apple flavors of ripe Braeburn and Reinette. Clean and wonderfully invigorating freshness pervades everything and makes for that wonderful Riesling rollercoaster of ripeness and tartness. Lovely and ready now but will be drinking well until 2020, with a lovely baked apple finish.",91,Domaine Charles Baur 2012 Brand Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"An aromatic touch of ivy plays alongside green pear on the nose. These aromas continue on the palate where they acquire a zesty, fresh edge reminiscent of grapefruit. A note of pepper joins on the slender, dry body. This is aromatic, light and very refreshing, with an invigorating, lip-smacking finish.",92,Eichinger 2016 Ried Hasel Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"Profound enough for serious contemplation but with enough broad fruit appeal to serve to a crowd. There's loads of upfront Asian spice and lychee, afloat on a luxurious, sensually textured palate. Notes of geranium and macadamia nuts keep the taste buds entertained and carry over to the lingering finish. The noticeable residual sugar suggests pairing with something slightly sweet, like Tilapia in a mango salsa. Drink now to 2011.",92,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2007 Wintzheim Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Lush and velvety, this wine offers big, dark cherry flavor around a tangy minerality. From three vineyard blocks planted to Pommard and Swan clones, it balances opposites in the way full-bodied luxuriousness meets acidity-driven juiciness, creating a desire for more. Let this wine open in the glass or cellar through 2023.",95,Wayfarer 2013 Estate Grown Golden Mean Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview)
"Made from a field blend of old vines, this is a dense wine. Full of tannins and with a strongly mineral texture (you can almost taste the dirt), it is solid with rich fruit, acidity and hints of wood aging. This powerful wine needs to age another year, so drink from 2018.",92,Secret Spot Wines 2014 Lacrau Old Vines Red (Douro)
"Argentine Nebbiolo is a rarity, and for one to be this good is a blessing. Leather, dark berry, earth and citrus aromas are mellow and subdued, but the palate is full and forward, with baked berry, molasses and espresso flavors. This is tannic and chocolaty on the finish, with lasting sweetness.",89,Viña Alicia 2007 Coleccion de Familia Nebbiolo (Luján de Cuyo)
"This is rich, while also such a stylish wine. It is ripe and full of tannins while masking that firm structure with immensely generous fruit. The two give the wine power, density and elegance. Drink this impressive wine from 2025.",95,Château Pichon Longueville 2014  Pauillac
"Carignan, Grenache, Cinsault, Petite Sirah, Mourvèdre and Pinot Noir make up this mongrel blend. The wine is dry and quite complex in berry, leather, cola, currant, spice and cedar flavors, although it's very soft. Not going anywhere, so drink now.",86,Wesley Ashley 2007 Intelligent Design Cuvée Red (Central Coast)
"Flat on the nose, then almost identical on the palate, this blend of Malbec, Syrah and Bonarda tastes grassy, lightly green and weedy. Cherry and berry flavors are weak. Tasted twice with similar results.",80,Conquista 2013 Oak Cask Red (Mendoza)
"Hints of sun-dried hay and honey add rustic charm to crisp yellow-peach and apricot flavors on the nose and palate of this off-dry, aromatic wine. Spritely with lemon-lime acidity, it finishes with a refreshing spray of cut green herb.",87,Murfatlar 2011 Zestrea Demisec Feteascǎ Regalǎ (Murfatlar)
"The pungent aromas of grass, waxy lemon and canned corn on the nose are followed by more citrus and overripe melon on a palate. This is zippy and clean but finishes slightly bitter.",85,Smart Cookie 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Full bodied, savory and retentive of tannin and oak, this is a robust, rich and ripe wine, with a tang of dark cherry, cola and vanilla. Youthful, it has ample acidity to keep it fresh in the glass, but allow it to open over time.",90,Guarachi Family 2014 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This is the epitome of Provence rosé, made for balmy oceanside drinking. It is fruity and tangy, with an attractive bite of acidity to lift the fresh while rounded character.",87,Château du Rouët 2014 Cuvée 1840 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Villa Maria's entry-level Sauvignon Blanc remains a solid bargain year after year. Delicate leafy notes provide lift to gooseberry and pineapple flavors. It's a very good, fruit-driven introduction to the regional style at a fair price.",88,Villa Maria 2014 Private Bin Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"This wine is slightly spritzy and sugary, with simple yet clean apple flavors. The finish is sweet, quick and pleasantly quaffable. Best to chill it down before drinking.",85,StoneCap 2011 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Lifted chamomile joins riper pear and apple fruit on the nose of this wine. On the concentrated palate these are joined by lemon and grapefruit zest in an unapologetically bracing style. This wine is clean, dry, fresh and totally lip-smacking with the full force of citrus behind it.",90,Emile Beyer 2015 Tradition Riesling (Alsace)
"Sweet and pretty on the nose with scents of honey, lemon and pressed apples, there's an interesting white pepper spice enhancing the warm, apple cider palate. There's a hollowness in the midpalate, however, that could use a boost.",83,Hunt Country Vineyards 2009 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"The lightest of the cuvées from Jean-Maurice Raffault, this is soft, fruity, already drinkable. It has a heady perfume, red fruits and light acidity all attractively packaged in a round structure.",87,Jean-Maurice Raffault 2011 Les Galuches  (Chinon)
"Rather closed aromas burn off in the glass to reveal mature black berry fruit and cooking spices. The palate delivers stewed plums, espresso and toasted oak alongside bracing tannins. Enjoy soon with four-cheese gnocchi.",87,Fossacolle 2012  Rosso di Montalcino
"While the wood flavors are prominent, they don't mask the ripe berry fruits in this Merlot-dominant blend. Blaye sister-brother team of Marie-Pierre et Pierre-Charles Dartier produced a wine with a rich character. It is full of wood spice, hints of mint and acidity. Drink from 2019.",89,Château Cailleteau Bergeron 2014 Tradition  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"Smooth, deep aromas of berry, spice, earth and minerals are rolled into a pure, harmonious whole. This Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is racy, clean and layered on the tongue, while oaky flavors of vanilla and cream are backed by ribald blackberry and cassis. The elegant finish is potent and deep. Drink through 2020.",93,Errazuriz 2011 Don Maximiano Founder's Reserva Red (Aconcagua Valley)
"A blend of 80% Primitivo and 20% Aglianico, this dense wine opens with aromas of toasted oak, spearmint and spice alongside ripe black fruit and prune. The one-dimensional palate serves up mature—almost overripe—blackberry layered with hints of vanilla extract, bitter prune and sugared coffee.",87,Ager Falernus 2011 Vino e Anima Red (Falerno del Massico)
"The nose on this single-vineyard bottling from the top of the appellation above Corralitos entertains the nose with a spicy fruit-punch aroma, lifted by crushed cloves and a bit of juniper. It is both voluptuous and racy on the palate, with lots of rhubarb and pomegranate ripeness, yet pencil shavings and chai tea spice throughout.",92,Sante Arcangeli 2013 Split Rail Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Wichmann is the smallest of the estate vineyards and holds the oldest vines. That old-vine intensity rings true here, in a low-alcohol wine with splendid aromatics. Musk, chocolate, almond candy and caramel swirls around black raspberry and black cherry fruit. The depth of flavor is striking.",94,Trisaetum 2013 Wichmann Dundee Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Dusty, oaky aromas of papaya, corn and green banana precede a full, buttery palate with matching flavors of buttery oak, papaya, creamy vanilla and green banana. Brine and popcorn notes protrude from an otherwise mild finish.",88,Kingston Family 2013 Sabino Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)
"The lovely wines from this pioneering estate, now in the capable hands of second-generation winemaker Jason Lett, are generally priced well below any comparable efforts. Here the texture and minerality evoke surpassing elegance. Lime, grapefruit, a bite of pineapple all come into play, with the depth and balance that suggests several years of life ahead.",92,The Eyrie Vineyards 2013 Pinot Gris (Dundee Hills)
"Made with a blend of 50% Trebbiano and 50% Malvasia, this delivers aromas of Tuscan almond cookies, citrus and dried apricot. The concentrated palate offers layers of candied nectarine zest, fig and toasted almond. Pair it with seasoned cheeses or cantucci.",90,Castello di Monsanto 2005 La Chimera  (Vin Santo del Chianti Classico)
"Exceptionally fruity in raspberries and cherries, this Pinot shows finely-ground tannins that give it a distinguished texture. It's so forward in flavor that it may not be an ager, so drink up over the next three years.",88,Walt 2011 Gap's Crown Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Sea salt, lemon, lime, grapefruit blossoms and a touch of ripe nectarine give complex depth to the nose of this high-end winery's larger-production white. The palate offers similar flavors, from brisk lime juice and sliced apples to warmer touches of sea-salt caramel.",90,Presqu'ile 2013 Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"Scratchy cherry and raspberry aromas are lightly herbal. This 50-50 blend of Cabernet Franc and Cab Sauvignon is tightly wound, with punchy acidity. Herbal raspberry and red-plum flavors finish dry and lightly oaked, with rawness and herbal notes.",87,Rafael Cambra 2013 El Bon Homme Red (Valencia)
"This is a fabulous wine, a notch above the three other vineyard-designated Pinots from Black Kite. Black tea, black cherry and herbal aromas blend with focused cherry, rhubarb and cranberry flavors in this full-bodied, complex wine. It's balanced by moderate tannins, giving it both structure and texture, and will drink best after 2020.",94,Black Kite 2014 Stony Terrace Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Aromas of yellow pear, Spanish broom and a whiff of honeyed nut float from the glass. The medium-bodied palate shows good weight and depth for the cool wet vintage, offering golden apple, nectarine zest and bitter almond framed in vibrant acidity. It finishes crisp and clean, with an underlying pinning of flint on the close.",89,Falchini 2015 Ab Vinea Doni  (Vernaccia di San Gimignano)
"Savory sage- and cress-like herbal notes mingle with ripe pear and yellow plum fruit on the nose of this winie. The palate delivers that rich fruit in a slender frame, making for a juicy, refreshing experience.",89,Steininger 2016 Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"This easy-drinking red opens with pretty aromas of purple wild flower and red berry. The slim, simple palate offers tart sour cherry and orange zest alongside brisk acidity and angular, somewhat fleeting tannins.",86,Pinino 2014  Rosso di Montalcino
"Sonoma Valley stalwart Sam Sebastiani returns to the winemaking fold with this small-production Sangiovese. A juicy study in robust, powerful tannins and fresh plum, it has a trace of anise on the back of the palate. Blended with 8% Petite Sirah and 4% Malbec, it spent a year in older French oak barrels and is a delicious California version of the Italian classic.",91,La Chertosa 2012 Reserve Sangiovese (Sonoma Valley)
"Good color, and the kind of flavor that many countries would kill for in so inexpensive a wine. It's ripely fruity, with firm tannins and dry acidity. Well-rounded and supple, this is an excellent value in an elegant dinner wine. —S.H.",86,Fetzer 1999 Valley Oaks Syrah (California)
"Aromas of chemical, plastic and milk chocolate are dominant and mask the wine's black-fruit content. The palate feels condensed and narrow, while woody, baked flavors of berry fruits finish resiny and chocolaty.",85,Bodegas Muriel 2010 JME  (Rioja)
"Grapefruit zest dominates this wine right now, but ripe honeydew melon also is shining though. As the wine opens up, it also reveals peppery, tangy spice and a refreshingly clean finish.",93,Gruber Röschitz 2012 Hundspoint Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel)
"This is a juicy, red-currant-flavored wine. With its round feel and soft, smoky tannins, it has an initial smoothness that is given some bite by the red-berry acidity on the finish.",84,L. Tramier & Fils 2010  Hautes Côtes de Nuits
"An interesting blend that incorporates 12% Sémillon with the Viognier. The Bordeaux grape adds weight and smoothes out the Viognier, which tends to be hot and sharp. What you end up with is a slightly buttery white blend that could go well with a variety of spicy dishes.",86,Zerba Cellars 2006 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This wine has all the richness and ripeness of the Alentejo. Packed with dense black fruits and balanced acidity, it is a blend of two perfumed grapes, Touriga Nacional and Syrah. The wood aging has rounded out the natural tannins of the fruit and given a concentrated wine that will still need to age. Drink from 2017.",92,Companhia das Quintas 2012 Herdade da Farizoa Reserva Red (Alentejo)
"Touches of smoke and grain extend throughout this uniquely savory off-dry kabinett. Rich streaks of peach and marmalade brighten the palate, accented by bursts of lemonade acidity, but overall, there's a bit of disarray throughout.",86,Matheus 2013 Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"Like a Beaujolais Nouveau, this is a lively, grapey wine, with fresh-from-the-fermenter flavors of raspberries, red cherries, cinnamon and pepper.",85,Frog's Leap 2008 La Grenouille Rouganté Rosé (Napa Valley)
"This clonal study explores the earthy side of the grape, with mulberry and dark cranberry fruit running alongside damp oak forest and slightly funky chaparral aromas. Lively flavors consume the palate quickly with tart cherry and peppery spice, all lifted by mouthwatering acidity.",91,Fess Parker 2014 Clone 2A Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"Light raspberry fruit carries a suggestion of clean earth and dried herb. The tannins show some substantial grip. The overall balance is fine, though the wine drinks younger than most 2012s. Best after 2020.",91,Domaine Divio 2012 Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"While the wine is full in the mouth with ripe fruits, it also has a delicious poise and freshness that makes it ready to drink. It's a well-balanced wine, full of fruitiness and acidity in harmony.",88,Château d'Esclans 2014 Whispering Angel Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Fresh primary red cherries and berries are nuanced with complexities of soil, smoke and tobacco in this lovely blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Cutting cranberry acidity and fine persistent tannins lend four-square structure. The finish lingers on subtle touches of smoked nut and cedar.",90,Fox Run 2012 Meritage (Seneca Lake)
"This Beaver State answer to Moscato d'Asti is sweet, sweet and more sweet. Who knows what the actual residual sugar reading is? That said, the lemon-lime aromas with notes of basil and tarragon are nice, and the wine is currently quite fresh (although it likely won't last long). Not too bubbly or aggressive, and pretty in the mouth due to fairly snappy acids. Drink now with fruit-based desserts or frosted cake.",85,Silvan Ridge 2002 Early Muscat - Semi Sparkling Muscat (Oregon)
"A lean style of wine, grassy and herbaceous, with dry tannins that are already showing signs of maturity. There is still some attractive juiciness, but the acidity and the tight tannins are good indications of the lightness of the wine.",84,Producteurs Plaimont 2002 Château du Bascou Red (Côtes de Saint-Mont)
"This dry, tart wine smells like sliced apples and has lemon pastry-like flavors without the sweetness. The palate is full-bodied but cut with a zing of lemon and green apple.",84,Las Positas 2015 Verdigris White (Livermore Valley)
"Rustic aromas of baked berry fruits, black olive, herbs and eucalyptus lead to a forward, fairly tannic palate. An herbal flavor profile includes olive, blackberry, plum and spice notes, while the finish on this Cabernet-led blend tastes peppery and herbal, which is nothing unusual for Chile. Drink through 2020.",91,Siegel 2012 Unique Selection Red (Colchagua Valley)
"Perfumed with wood flavors, this is a dry wine at this stage. Let the black-currant fruitiness from the organic Merlot/Cabernet Sauvignon grapes come through before drinking. Acidity and a fresh character promise well. Wait until 2019.",88,Château Frédignac 2014 F de Frédignac  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"A chunky, deep-fruited Malbec that is all about blackberry fruit. There's no funk or odd, floral, overcropped aromas here; instead, it's focused on roasted blackberry flavors, a natural herbal character, and coffee and mocha on the finish. Emphasizes size and friendliness.",88,Kaiken 2008 Malbec (Mendoza)
"This is a small property under the same ownership as Château Paloumey. It is unusual in the 20% Petit Verdot that goes into the blend. That gives the wine its deep color and rich generous black-plum fruit. Solid and dense, the wine will age well. Drink from 2020.",91,Château La Garricq 2014  Moulis-en-Médoc
"A vibrant purple color and foxy berry aromas announce the jammy palate and punchy acidity of this wine. It tastes of herbal plums and berries and doesn't hold up on the oaky, pulpy finish.",85,Tossals 2015 Junior Red (Montsant)
"Concentrated and structured, this wine also manages to be sleek and glossy but by no means weightless. It opens with aromas of blue flowers, cedar, black currant and herb while the dense palate doles out black currants, blackberries and licorice. Tightly packed but fine-grained tannins provide the framework. Drink 2017–2027.",92,Tenuta di Trinoro 2012 Magnacosta Cabernet Franc (Toscana)
"Genuine, honest and straightforward, this ruby-colored Valpolicella Superiore from the Valpantena area boasts aromas of red fruit and blueberry with pretty accents of spice, leather and cola. It's smooth and velvety on the palate with a buoyant, cheerful touch of acidity on the finish: Pair this wine chicken or pork.",86,Zecchini 2008 Vigneto Calandra di Romagnano  (Valpolicella Valpantena Superiore)
"From Dwelley vineyard grapes, this barrel-fermented Viognier offers appealing toasty fruit coated in buttered nut goodness. Meyer lemon and stone fruits, dusted with cinnamon, give it a French pastry sort of finish, though it is completely dry.",89,Stottle 2008 Viognier (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This intensely fragrant wine leads with aromas of red currant and violet. The palate offers strawberry, mandarin orange and almond alongside fresh acidity and delicate tannins. Enjoy soon.",89,Peter Zemmer 2013 Schiava Gentile Schiava (Alto Adige)
"No question this is a taut, crisp, mineral, smoky Sauvignon Blanc from the grape's heartland. It has plenty of herbaceous edges, but the core is ripe, tropical and juicy.",86,Remy-Pannier 2007  Sancerre
"This is almost entirely Syrah, done in a high-acid, citrusy style. Flavors are sharply etched and tight—pomegranate, raspberry, baking chocolate and espresso. Straightforward and well-balanced despite its 15% alcohol.",87,Kana 2006 Dark Star Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Perhaps this wine just needs some additional cellaring, as the finish is long enough to suggest promise, but this particular bottle was in a cranky stage, showing lots of toasted oak and coffee-like aromas and tart acidity. The tannins seem ripe, so it's worth trying again in a year or two.",87,Aramis 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)
"This medium-bodied wine is high-toned in red fruit and tannin, a mix of cedar, black currant and blackberry that broods in the French wood it spent almost two years resting within, 60% of it new. Small percentages of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc are in the blend.",86,Forchini 2012 Proprietors Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley)
"Sweet honeysuckle, lime blossoms and honeydew show on the very flowery nose of this bottling from a newer property near the old mining town of Pozo. The sip tightens up smartly with Anjou pear and honeysuckle flavors, but it's the powerful acidity that makes for a compelling palate.",89,Vintage Cowboy 2016 Chardonnay (Paso Robles)
A beetroot character to this wine is off-putting. It masks the fruit and acidity that otherwise would show well.,83,Wines & Winemakers NV Azul Portugal 10-Year-Old Tawny  (Port)
"This rosé is almost as rich as a red wine, the difference being a fresher, red-fruit character. It has vanilla flavors, a dry texture and a touch of pepper.",84,Quinta do Portal 2012 Colheita Rosé (Douro)
"This wine is a blend of Merlot (42%), Cabernet Sauvignon (35%), and Cabernet Franc. Brooding aromas of scorched earth, barrel spice, wood and dark fruit lead to a bold dark-fruited palate backed by firm tannins. It displays plenty of breadth and brawn, with the oak primary now but likely to integrate over time.",91,Force Majeure 2014 Parabellum Red (Red Mountain)
"Smoky aromas and layers of tannin and fruit give this wine great complexity. It is smooth, juicy and fresh while also having perfumed tannins and an elegant, lightly mineral structure from the Cabernet Franc. The wine's cherries and red berries are still encased in the structure, allowing it to develop slowly. Drink from 2024.",95,Château Cheval Blanc 2013  Saint-Émilion
"Bright black cherry and raspberry flavors take center stage in this unoaked Cabernet Franc. Juicy and ripe, it's best enjoyed now through 2016 to appreciate its forward, fruity exuberance.",88,Lamoreaux Landing 2014 T23 Unoaked Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes)
"The Insania White is 90% Semillon, 10% Sauvignon Blanc, and made at Three Rivers for heavy metal rocker Geoff Tate. The 2011 is round and fruity, with flavors of fig, apple and pear. It's a forward, juicy wine, quite tasty, but without the edgy depths of the 2010.",87,Geoff Tate 2011 Insania White Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Flat slightly flabby aromas of green and grassy black fruits smell of sweet plastic and oak. This feels raw, choppy and scraping. Flavors of minty, herbal black fruits are toasty and show grainy, forced oak. Pepper and mint flavors along with scratchy tannins make for a solid but rough finish.",88,Loscano 2013 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Uco Valley)
"Grilled porcini, camphor, forest floor and oak aromas lead the nose. The evolved palate has largely dried up, showing suggestions of dried cherry and powdered sage set against bracing tannins that leave a raspy finish.",85,Taliano 2009 Tera Mia Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"Robust and spicy, with a soft, juicy mouthfeel framing Zinny flavors of wild cherries, mulberries and briary blackberries. It's pretty tannic, and calls for rich, greasy barbecue.",87,Dashe Cellars 2009 Tood Brothers Ranch Old Vines Zinfandel (Alexander Valley)
"Stylish oak aromas combine with rich fruit flavors in this full-bodied, velvet-textured wine. It smells like ripe black cherries, vanilla and caramel, with a fruit-forward palate. Made by the Lange Twins Winery.",86,Caricature 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Clarksburg)
"Cigar-box aromas and a rich character give this wine a sense of perfumed concentration. It is young, with a stalky character still evident. The structure is firm, and the blackberry fruits still coming together. Give this wine until 2017 before drinking.",90,Mas de Cadenet 2013 Red (Côtes de Provence Sainte-Victoire)
"With floral aromas mixed with darker notes of asphalt, mineral, leather and berry fruit, this opens well. The palate is rubbery in feel but structured. Flavors of bold berry fruits, chocolate and herbs end chewy, warm and chocolaty. For a basic Carmenère-Cabernet blend, this is on the money.",89,Viña Santa Cruz 2011 Chamán Reserva Carmenère-Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"On the nose, this is challenging: gaseous, oaky aromas of wet cement also contain notes of bitter lettuce, baking spices and general grit. Raw, tannic and abrasive on the palate, this unfolds to offer herbal flavors of berry and plum. Tannic, scratchy, rugged and mildly green on the finish.",88,Mas Igneus 2011 Barranc dels Closos Red (Priorat)
"Made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, this brawny, full-bodied wine evokes tobacco, coconut and cherry cola, the flavors commingling within a frame of taut structure and moderate acidity.",90,JCB 2014 The Surrealist Red (Napa Valley)
"Here is a very elegant and smooth wine that leaves a silky, polished impression in the mouth. It awards the nose with bright aromas of wild berry, licorice and toasted almond. It's simple, genuine and sophisticated all at once.",93,Castello di Neive 2007 Santo Stefano Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"There's an inkling of floral character on the nose of this otherwise robust, brooding and brawny vineyard-designate. It's overwhelmed by grippy tannins and a bitterness akin to tobacco. Along the way dark cherry and forest earth make an appearance—particularly pine and a whiff of tar.",85,FEL 2013 Hirsch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"A fairly standard Chardonnay, rich in oak, lees and ripe citrus and tropical fruit flavors, but raised up by brisk acidity and a fine minerality that gives it extra complexity. It's rich with honey and brown sugar, but doesn't feel cloying.",86,Icaria 2012 Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"This lightly wood aged Douro blend is certainly rich, full of generous white stone fruit as well as melon. With its balancing acidity, the wine is both rich and crisp and will be better from 2017.",89,Quinta de la Rosa 2015 La Rosa Branco White (Douro)
"This wine is co-fermented with 12% Petite Sirah, both varieties from one estate block planted to a century-old clone of Teldeschi, a nearby vineyard still in existence. Tart in cherry, red plum and cassis, it's refreshingly unusual and deliciously vibrant. Anise, cinnamon and black pepper round out the finish. The tannins and oak are well-managed and integrated.",91,Stuhlmuller Vineyards 2012 Rogers Schoolhouse Estate Zinfandel (Alexander Valley)
"Pegasus (an 80-20 blend of Sangiovese and Syrah) offers easy aromas of cherry liqueur, cola, licorice, rum cake and light spice. It's light and compact in the mouth and would pair well with pizza or pasta.",86,Podere Guado al Melo 2008 Pegasus Red (Toscana)
Jammy aromas and flavors that are as rich as maple syrup give a sweet accent to this full-bodied and mouth-filling wine. It has a touch of tannin for grip and finishes on the sweet side.,86,Z. Alexander Brown 2015 Uncaged Pinot Noir (Monterey County-Napa County-Sonoma County)
"So light and delicate, this is a wine beautifully poised and balanced. It has liveliness, pepper apricot and a hint of honey. Still very young. Drink from 2017.",92,Nittnaus Hans und Christine 2012 Eiswein Grüner Veltliner (Burgenland)
"Made with 95% Sangiovese and 5% Merlot, this straightforward wine has restrained aromas of red berry, menthol and a hint of earth. The palate is a bit more expressive, offering mouthwatering Morello cherry and eucalyptus. Bright acidity and mellow tannins underscore the juicy fruit.",88,Gracciano della Seta 2014  Rosso di Montepulciano
"It took a couple of minutes for the smelly chemical aromas to disipate, but afterwards it showed a good deal of ripe fruit, earth and smoked meat. On the palate it proved to be soft and chunky, with most of the flavors at the front, and although the flavors were not as intense in the mid palate, they did return and the wine ended with a pleasant medium finish.",89,Michele Chiarlo 2003 Cannubi  (Barolo)
"A solid Cab at an attractive price. There's a lot going on in this structured and well-balanced wine. Aromas of black currant and licorice dominate the nose alongside secondary glimmers of black pepper and crushed violets, all framed with a sweet oak streak. Flavors of juicy black raspberry linger well into the finish, which gradually fades into gorgeous white pepper spice.",90,Stark-Condé 2008 Unfined and Unfiltered Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch)
"This is a bit fat and forward, with flavors of tropical fruit and banana, and a light dusting of cocoa, cinnamon and butterscotch. It's a tasty wine to drink up as soon as possible.",87,Stoller 2005 Chardonnay (Dundee Hills)
"Dark in color, intense in fruit flavor and firmly packed with tannins, this blockbuster Bordeaux-style blend feels massive and grippy. It tastes like cranberry and blackberry, leaving astringency on the palate that will match up to the richest foods. Age a few bottles through 2019 to see how it matures.",88,Marietta Cellars NV Arme Lot Number 3 Red (North Coast)
"This widely available and comparatively cheap bottling nabbed quality fruit to present aromas of black raspberry, dark cranberry, crushed graphite and chaparral. There is refreshing if slightly dried fruit on the palate, where blackberry paste is lifted by thyme, marjoram and turned-earth flavors.",88,Edna Valley Vineyard 2015 Pinot Noir (Central Coast)
"This is a complex wine that offers firm tannins and rich fruit. It has weight, density and a strong sense of ripeness. With balance and depth, it's a wine with good aging potential. Drink from 2015.",90,Château Loumelat 2011 Cuvée J-J Lesgourgues  (Bordeaux)
"Seems somewhat crisper and less weighty than prior vintages, with the custardy mouthfeel buttressed by lemony acids. You'll also find apples, sweet plums and the obligatory toast and vanilla. —J.C.",87,Gallo of Sonoma 1999 Laguna Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"At the northern end of the Ladoix appellation, this small Premier Cru has produced a red-fruited wine shot through with acidity and spicy flavors. It is juicy, showing red cherries, raspberries bolstered with a layer of tannins. The wine is ready to drink, although it will age at least until 2023.",90,Capitain-Gagnerot 2013 La Micaude Premier Cru  (Ladoix)
"This is a warm and ripe style of Sauvignon Blanc. It has a crisp edge that is contrasted with the full white stone fruit and warm acidity. The fruitiness is intense, juicy and full of great final crispness.",85,Georges Vigouroux 2016 Pigmentum Sauvignon Blanc (Côtes de Gascogne)
"Sharply herbal, this shows a bit of a green edge, which comes across as bitterness on the finish. The pale red-fruit flavors hint at thistle and bramble more than ripe berry, but the balance is there to carry the wine well with food.",86,Edwin Dyer 2011 Le Cadeau Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Enticing aromas of white spring flowers, Spanish broom and orchard fruit lead the way. The refreshing palate doles out white peach, green apple and pear alongside firm acidity and a racy perlage. A mineral note backs up the finish.",89,La Farra NV Selezione Extra Dry  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"A subdued nose leads to a very zesty palate, with grapefruit zest and crunchy green apple. The fruit is lively, clean and rather vivacious. Lemony freshness brightens the dry finish and makes you sip more.",89,Domaine Ehrhart 2014 Herrenweg Riesling (Alsace)
"This Bordeaux-style blend is Baer's top wine. A bright bouquet of violet, berry, pepper and stone greets you at first sniff, and it gets better and better from there. Dark fruits weave through a supple and striated flavor palette, long and detailed.",93,Baer 2009 Arctos Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A sound wine for everyday drinking, this has firm tannins and blackberry, currant and cedar flavors, plus a touch of spicy licorice on the finish.",86,Five Rows 2011 Durant Ranch Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"This Chardonnay is generally solid. However, on the nose, palate and finish you'll find a briny, almost pickled character to go with aromas of citrus fruits, flavors of melon and apple, and finishing notes of melon and lime. All in all, there's not a lot to this wine.",84,Undurraga 2012 Aliwen Reserva Chardonnay (Chile)
"Spicy orange rind and sunny tangerine notes offset steely shards of lime and mineral in this bracing, deeply concentrated Riesling. The midpalate smooths out richly, glazed by a sheen of lanolin that stretches out the finish. Drinks beautifully already, but should improve through 2020.",93,Thörle 2013 Saulheimer Probstey Trocken Riesling (Rheinhessen)
"There's no oak at all on this savory young Sauvignon Blanc, which delivers its richness directly to the palate, undiluted. Those flavors are of green fruits: melons, apples, limes and the slightly sour, flowery tang of gooseberries. Fine acidity makes it all brisk and mouthwatering. An outstanding Sauvignon Blanc for today's ethnic fare, at a great price.",90,Husch 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino)
"Aged in large Slavonian casks, this straightforward but robust wine features aromas of dried blue flowers, black currants, dried cherry and prune that carry over to the palate along with ground white pepper and cedar sensations. The warmth of alcohol appears on the midpalate.",88,Domìni Veneti 2011  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"This is a tangy, not entirely varietal wine that's dense in black tea and black fruit, with layers of tobacco and dried herb. Give it time in the glass to open.",87,Meadowcroft 2013 Cornerstone Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"Murky, earthy aromas of plum and red berry feed into a creamy, saturated palate that's adequately balanced but not perfect. Syrupy blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors end with spice and herbal notes. This is 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% each Merlot and Syrah.",87,Luigi Bosca 2013 De Sangre Red (Mendoza)
"Whiffs of smoke lend a savory feel to pressed apple notes on this dry, delicately framed wine. The palate bristles with lemon-lime acidity and finishes long and lean with a hint of wet stones.",86,Bellwether 2012 A&D Vineyard Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Sumptuous, ripe and very full on the palate, this wine is dense and packed with notes of botrytis that give a strong sense of structure. This well-balanced wine shows potential to age, offering rich acacia honey and beautiful final acidity. Drink from 2020.",94,Château de Rayne Vigneau 2011  Sauternes
"This is a beautifully ripe, tangy wine with fine acidity and hints of spice. Lemon and crisp green apple notes shine through the still tight, mineral texture. The concentration of the fruit suggests it will age well. Drink from 2018.",89,Quinta do Vallado 2015 Reserva Branco White (Douro)
"Full bodied and rich, this is a big, toasty example of white Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Grilled mango notes lead the way, with vanilla and toast framing tropical and stone fruit on the long, oak-lined finish.",91,Famille Perrin 2014 Château de Beaucastel White (Châteauneuf-du-Pape)
"Aromas of olive, mushroom and berry fruits are lightly herbal. This Cabernet feels scratchy, abrupt and edgy, while herbal raspberry and plum flavors finish solid and with a slight note of pickle.",87,Concha y Toro 2015 Casillero del Diablo Reserva Privada Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"All varietal coming from Hedges Estate Vineyard, this all-new French-oak-aged wine opens with aromas of toast, spicebox, espresso and cherry. The palate is tightly wound with dark fruit flavors and abundant oak accents throughout that linger on the finish. The wood (all new French) needs time to integrate but there is much to enjoy.",90,Finn Hill 2012 Le Beau Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"A reserve selection that’s seen some barrel aging, but not too much. The toasty, chocolaty oak is hardly noticeable under a firm wallop of cherry-berry fruit that turns velvety on the palate. Some softly bitter tannins creep in on the finish, letting you know that the best is yet to come. Pick up a few bottles and drink them over the next couple of years.",88,Château Mas Neuf 1998 Prestige des Gibelins Red (Costières de Nîmes)
"This new producer is off to a good start with its first vintage. The fruit is clean and complex, ranging from watermelon to wild strawberry to pie cherry as it washes across the palate. Deep in color, yet light in the mouth, this not only makes you reach for a second glass, it makes you wish the vineyard, planted in 2001, would hurry up and age.",90,Eastburn Vineyards 2006 Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"The chalk soil of the appellation is reflected well in this tangy, mineral wine that shows hints of the wood aging in large barrels, which rounds out the crisp fruits and gives a pinch of spice. The wine is still young and will be better from 2017.",89,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2014  Meursault
"Rich and succulent, this mountain-grown Cabernet offers concentrated black currant, cherry, red licorice, date-nut cake, vanilla and smoke flavors that are wrapped into firm, complex but gentle tannins. It's lovely now, with the focused balanced to age for several years.",89,Stonestreet 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Given that the package holds the equivalent of four regular-sized wine bottles, this delivers a fair quaff for the price tag. Slightly sweet, it has a candied, bubblegum character, light melony fruit and a granular, sugary aftertaste.",84,Black Box 2009 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Focused blackberry aromas meet with graphite shavings, a touch of new leather and chipped oak on the nose of this Bordeaux blend. The medium-bodied palate offers dark purple-fruit flavors, cocoa dust and anise, lifted by strong acidity. It finishes with a vanilla-toast element.",90,Harmony Cellars 2013 Aria Diamond Reserve Meritage (Paso Robles)
"An easy, likeable Pinot Noir. It's drinkable now for its light, silky texture and savory cherry, cola and spice flavors.",86,Babcock 2007 Rita's Earth Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Riper and fruitier than Donati's less expensive '08s, the Ezio is a Bordeaux-style blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon. This swaps elegance for a more full-bodied, robust style that comes across as heavy.",86,Donati 2008 Ezio Red (Paicines)
"Fermented and aged in new barriques, this deeply golden-colored wine opens with aromas of toasted oak, vanilla bean and oak-driven spices that carry over to the palate. It lacks the fruit richness needed to stand up to the oak and racy acidity, giving it a lean character.",85,Poggio Alloro 2012 Le Mandorle  (Vernaccia di San Gimignano)
"Brander's Au Naturel is the winery's highest expression of unoaked Sauvignon Blanc, and the 2011 is one of their greatest ever. Dry and crisp with acidity, it's fabulously complex with flavors of citrus and tropical fruit, green apple, gooseberry, minerals, spices and dried herbs.",92,Brander 2011 Au Natural Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley)
"This dry wine from the Ribbon Ridge vineyard, adjacent to the winery, is briskly tart without being sour. Flavors of lemony tea and Meyer lemon meringue intrigue immediately. There is splendid structure and complexity in play here, with layers of flower, citrus and mineral, all in perfect harmony. It's easy to believe this wine could age through 2024, even longer.",94,Trisaetum 2013 Ribbon Ridge Estate Dry Riesling (Ribbon Ridge)
"Chewing gum and light berry aromas come with a floral note. Crystal clear and lean on the palate, this tastes of mild citrus fruits and peach pit. Dry on the finish, with a nip of grapefruit.",86,Arrumaco 2015 Garnacha Rosé (Spain)
"This plump Rosso di Montalcino offers ripe, succulent fruit notes of black cherry, blueberry and fresh plum, rounded by toasted espresso and almond. All that results in a soft, round and smooth mouthfeel.",89,Fossacolle 2009  Rosso di Montalcino
"Plum, blueberry and a tinge of sour dried-fruit aromas get lifted with dill, spearmint and anise on the nose of this wine. It's juicy on the palate with purple and blue fruits, but cut with a strong and nice mint character, also showing some dark chocolate nibs.",89,Falkner 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Temecula Valley)
"This is a thin, tart wine, with simple apricot, citrus, honey and peach flavors that finish sour and dry.",83,Castle Rock 2011 Pinot Grigio (Monterey County)
"This is a sweet, floral bubbly with mature notes of pear and peach and chewy sweetness. It has a soft, creamy texture and would pair well with salty and sweet foods alike.",86,Cà Vittoria 2007 Millesimato Dry  (Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene)
"Crushed floral aromas, berry-infused tea and cherry candy aromas give this wine a sweet profile. The palate, however, is anything but. It pounds with toasty black fruit, licorice and fiery menthol. The feel is a bit tannic but not terribly harsh, so maybe another three to five years will serve it well.",88,Nuntia Vini 2005 Volvoreta Probus  (Toro)
"Bigode, the mustache, is a soft and juicy wine, light in texture with strong acidity. Red berry fruits are prominent, fragrant and perfumed. Drink now.",83,DFJ Vinhos 2010 Bigode Red (Lisboa)
"As with the other single-vineyard wines from Brooks, this was give 18 months in French oak, and shows strong accents of baking spices and plum cake. The fruit leans toward raisins and figs—just on the edge of overripe—and continues into a finish with vanilla wafer and macaroons. There's a lot going on, but it has not (yet) knit together.",87,Brooks 2014 Big Cheese Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Savory pepper and raw-beef notes mark on the nose of this tightly wound bottling, as well as nut brittle and teriyaki aromas. Plum skins, lavender and carpaccio show on the sip alongside a wash of flowers and herbs, from lavender to rosemary. The tannins are mouthcoating and need time to develop. Drink 2018–2028.",93,Lost Blues 2013 Walking Boss Syrah (Paso Robles)
"Delicate black cherry, forest floor and leather aromas lead the nose. The dense palate delivers mature black plum, vanilla and star anise flavors supported by ripe tannins. Drink 2018–2023.",89,Poggio dell'Aquila 2011  Brunello di Montalcino
"Pressed flowers, undergrowth and blood orange lead to a lithe, medium-weight palate that comes with juicy acidity. The finish features hints of desiccated black fruit and clover honey.",86,Sultry Cellars 2010 Inked Red (Arizona)
"This opens with aromas of underbrush, tilled soil, blue flowers, oak and baked plum. The palate offers dried cherries, figs, nutmeg, tobacco and anisette alongside assertive but polished tannins. Drink through 2020.",91,Caven 2008 Messere  (Sforzato di Valtellina)
"This is a unique wine indeed. The style here is heavy, thick and shows the limits Pinot Grigio can achieve in terms of extraction and richness. The wine's appearance shows a copperish hue and the texture is thickly laced with carmel, candied fruit and apricot.",88,Antonutti 2010 Vis Terrae Pinot Grigio (Friuli Grave)
"This producer shows its aptitude for whites with this dry, estate-grown effort, a bit cloudy thanks to the lack of fining and filtering. A touch of grass is on the nose, but then it's all rich, vanilla-laden texture and pear, the body medium and the wine lengthy and in balance.",90,Belden Barns 2014 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Mountain)
"A deep color and aromas of toasted baguette, wood smoke and black cherry signal a classic style. The flavors are like dark-chocolate-covered cherries and cranberries. The toasted character of new oak barrels persists from the aroma to the finish, but it's well complemented by ripe fruit, an impressively tannic texture and lingering finish.",95,Hourglass 2012 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Made from one of the star grapes of Vinho Verde, this is a ripe, creamy wine. It has hints of lemon zest, along with grapefruit and a herbal aftertaste. It is crisp and ready to drink.",86,Quinta das Arcas 2013 Arca Nova Colheita Loureiro (Vinho Verde)
"There is an austere character to this wine, tannins edged with minerality. It has weight as well as concentration and, as compensation, sweet cherry juice to go with all this structure.",89,Henry Fessy 2009  Chiroubles
"This full, rich style of rosé gets its color from grape skins, which provides a touch of tannin as well as strawberry flavor and attractive acidity. It's definitely for food.",86,René Geoffroy NV Rosé de Saignée Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne)
"Eucalyptus leaf, black raspberry and black cherry aromas combine for a sultry nose on this bottling, one of this producer's many expressions of individual sites in the region. Herbes du provence show on the sip, then flavors settle into gravel and graphite minerality, all based on dark strawberry and plum fruit.",92,Foley 2013 JA Ranch Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"This mildly aromatic blend of Grenache Blanc, Roussanne and Vermentino marries apple and lime flavors into a fresh, citrusy white that persists nicely on the finish. Drink now.",86,Chateau Mourgues du Gres 2010 Les Galets Dorés White (Costières de Nîmes)
"Rich, ripe scents of cherry pie and cherry cola waft from this profoundly aromatic Merlot. It's boldly alcoholic and full bodied, but the palate shows restraint with crisp red berry flavors highlighted by a streak of acidity. Soft, furry tannins coat the finish.",86,King's Garden Vineyards 2010 Merlot (Finger Lakes)
"Here's an inky, densely concentrated blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet with intense aromas of chocolate, coffee, ripe berry, plum and spice. The wine is rich, well textured and offers enormous length on the close. Those bright cherry flavors leave a rich and long impression.",91,Castello di Meleto 2005 Rainero Red (Toscana)
"This ripe, black-fruit-flavored wine is concentrated and intense. Big, bold tannins partner with rich blackberry and black-plum fruits. The weight is balanced by acidity and bright fruit at the end. Drink this wine now.",91,Herdade do Rocim 2014 Reserva Red (Alentejano)
"Château de Cérons, which also produces sweet wines, uses the same grape varieties for this dry white. It has an almost honeyed character that fills out its crisp acidity and citrusy orange flavors. Drink from late 2018.",90,Château de Cérons 2015  Graves
"Hints of smoke on the nose dissipate with aeration to reveal a bright raspberry perfume. Full bodied and expansive on the palate, it offers up plenty of concentrated blackberry and cherry flavors. Zesty acidity leads a brisk, clean finish.",89,Croteaux 2015 Jolie Rosé Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island)
"Reminiscent of good white Burgundy, this atypically (for Australia) flinty Chard has notes of gunmetal, intricately intertwined with white peach and toasted oatmeal. Finishes soft and round but long, with hints of lemon.",90,Cheviot Bridge 2000 Chardonnay (Victoria)
"Pretty aromas suggest ripe berry, spiced plum and a bit of eucalyptus. The polished palate offers mature blackberry and cinnamon alongside smooth but rather fleeting tannins.",87,Fazio 2012 Torre dei Venti Nero d'Avola (Erice)
"Dry and soft, this is a warm, creamy Pinot Blanc. It has pear and quince flavors, a touch of spice and delicate acidity. It is rich on the palate and ripe and ready to drink now.",85,Sipp Mack 2011 Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
"93-95 Barrel sample. Robust and rich wine, balancing well the rich fruits, flavors of plum juice and sweetness along with very firm, solid tannins.",94,Château Smith Haut Lafitte 2009 Barrel sample  (Pessac-Léognan)
"As the wine ages, it shows a soft, toasty and nutty side that adds complexity to the tight fruitiness that remains. It's a wine in transition, still fresh while adding some concentration, broadening the steely texture and giving hints of the serious wine it will be. Drink from 2018.",93,Trimbach 2011 Réserve Riesling (Alsace)
"Failla reaches into this new appellation within Napa Valley for this vineyard-designated Chard. It's a little heavier and softer than the Chardonnays from Sonoma County usually associated with the winery. Very rich in tropical fruits and pears, while the oak is lavish in vanilla and buttered toast. Drink now.",89,Failla 2011 Haynes Vineyard Chardonnay (Coombsville)
"Vines on the southern slopes of the Montagne de Reims have given this wine a soft character and ripe fruitiness. Fresh baked apples and bright acidity are right out front to produce a refreshing, accessible wine that is ready to drink now.",87,Autréau de Champillon NV Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne)
"A directly appealing wine with notes of peach, tropical fruit and buttered popcorn. It's lightly spritzy, with a creamy feel to the fruit flavors.",87,6 Under 2013 Chardonnay (Washington)
"Big and flavorful, this full-bodied wine boasts butter, toast and smoke nuances layered over ripe pear and marzipan flavors. Fermented in stainless steel but aged in French oak, it has a rich texture and overt sweetness without going to extremes.",88,Cherry Tart 2014 Chardonnay (California)
This medium-dry Champagne is attractively structured and really fruity. It does have something of the mineral texture of a drier Champagne that is contrasted with apricot and honey highlights. It is ready to drink.,88,Piper-Heidsieck NV Cuvée Sublime Demi-Sec  (Champagne)
"The Wohlmuth family has owned this vineyard since 1803, producing wines with impressive continuity. The Sauvignon Blanc is rich, and almost tropical, but without being heavy. Apples, pears and apricots combine beautifully. It could age for a year or two, but is thoroughly drinkable now.",91,Wohlmuth 2012 Hochsteinriegl Sauvignon Blanc (Südsteiermark)
"Scented impressions of ripe pear and aloe vera pervade this wine. The palate shows texture and more fruit than you might expect from slender Sylvaner. The finish is brisk, clean and taut.",89,Boeckel 2015 Vieilles Vignes Sylvaner (Alsace)
"This wine is from Talley, and while it's nowhere near as good as the parent company's Pinot Noir, it's not bad for the price. Shows a nice, silky texture with bright, juicy flavors of cherries, cranberries and toast.",86,Bishop's Peak 2011 Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County)
"Pear and vanilla ride a wave capped by ripe tropical flourish in this thick and richly layered white from the heart of the appellation. Stainless-steel fermented, it exudes succulence and a strong taste of canned peach.",88,Round Pond 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford)
"A simple, rustic wine, with jammy raspberry, red currant and cocoa flavors. There's a metallic taste that may or may not be related to thre screwtop.",83,Record Family Wines 2010 Randy's Red Grenache-Syrah (Paso Robles)
"White flower and pink bubblegum notes lend a slightly confected tone to this semisweet Hungarian sparkling wine, but it's an undeniably drinkable, peach-flavored sip, with sharp effervescence and a tasty sugar-cookie finish.",85,Törley NV Fortuna Doux Sparkling (Hungary)
"There can't be many, if any, other 100% Pinot Blanc Champagnes. Allowed in the appellation, the grape is only really found in this southern Aube region. It comes to the fore with Aurélien Gerbais (fourth generation), produced from vines planted in 1904. This wine is a soft, creamy and immediately drinkable, with ripe apple and pear flavors. It would repay a few months more in bottle; drink from 2017.",92,Pierre Gerbais NV L'Originale Extra Brut Pinot Blanc (Champagne)
This is the latest vintage from the always impressive long-running joint venture between the Symington family in Portugal and Bordeaux wine consultant Bruno Prats. The wine is elegant and structured with nothing to excess. It has delicious black-currant fruit as well as a core of firm tannins. It is a wine for aging: ripe while so poised. Drink from 2020.,95,Prats & Symington LDA 2014 Chryseia Red (Douro)
"This meaty, gamy wine is 84% Mourvèdre, and marries its earthy flavors to the ripe black fruit of the Syrah. The two mix well, but could use a bit more bottle time to fully integrate. Blood, meat, cassis, and smoke mingle, and some heat slips in at the end, along with rich coffee grounds and dark chocolate. Big, flavorful, lingering.",93,Mark Ryan 2008 Crazy Mary Mourvèdre (Red Mountain)
"Yes, this wine is supersweet, but it's also pristine in its clarity. Despite layers of honeyed richness, the aromas and flavors of lime and pineapple provide great energy and focus; there's even hints of slate-driven minerality on the nose and the long, mouthwatering finish.",94,Grans-Fassian 2006 Trittenheimer Apotheke Beerenauslese Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer)
"Moderately bodied and spiced, this is a straightforward expression of the variety, a mix of pomegranate, red cherry and cassis, that has a deceptive richness on the finish, wrapped in oak.",90,Ampelos 2013 Rho Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Thick in cherry-vanilla, big oak and tannin, this vineyard-designate contains handfuls of Petite Sirah and mixed blacks that are, as the producer puts it, too long to list. Given 10 months in American oak, it offers a balance of fruit and leathery power, from raspberry and blackberry to Sunday morning bacon. Drink now through 2020.",90,Elyse 2012 Morisoli Vineyard Zinfandel (Rutherford)
"Earns high praise for its deep, complex flavors that suggest fully ripened grapes, well-treated by the winemaker. Waves of blackberries, cherries, herbs, violets, pepper and spices flood the palate, leading to a long, rich, tannic finish. Best opened soon for its freshness.",91,Mark Moretti 2007 Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"Buoyantly perfumed of blossoms and sun-kissed peaches, this light-footed Muscat is chock full of aplomb. Valvin Muscat's heady aromatics may be overwhelming to some, but they're true to type here. Enjoy now for its youth and vitality.",87,Lakewood 2013 Valvin Muscat (Finger Lakes)
"This is a densely tannic wine, very ripe and concentrated. It is perfumed, rich, and blackberry fruited, showing the character of Touriga Nacional, but in an exaggerated form. Age the wine for at least two more years.",86,Adega Mayor 2010 Solista Touriga Nacional (Alentejano)
"Don't let the label mislead you; this is not a dessert wine. It's off-dry, with a pretty suite of lemon, orange and citrus peel flavors. A whiff of tea runs through the aromas, and a bit of lemon oil in the finish.",88,Hogue 2012 Late Harvest Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Tart, tight and delicately spicy, this offers unusual depth considering the cool vintage. Give it extra breathing time as it opens up slowly, showing lemony acidity, cranberry fruit and remarkable persistence.",89,Kelley Fox 2011 Momtazi Vineyard Pinot Noir (McMinnville)
"This wine boasts aromas and flavors of dried red fruits, fresh mint and cocoa powder. Medium weight, with soft, dusty tannins and a medium-length finish. A young wine, but quite approachable now.",86,Alexander 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Galilee)
"This wine is fresh without being too herbaceous. Sauvignon Blanc controls crispness with flavors of almonds, citrus and quince. The tangy, steely aftertaste will soften from the end of 2015.",85,Château Taussin 2014  Bordeaux Blanc
"This medium-sweet wine brings aromas of acacia flowers and lemon lime zest to the fore. In the mouth there are flavors of honeycomb, lemon and acacia flower. The finish is delightful and slightly sweet.",86,Jidvei 2016 Treasure of Transylvania Medium Sweet Gewurztraminer (Tarnave)
"Powerfully intoxicating in aroma, this North Coast Cab turns slightly thin and tannic upon tasting, with a melange of herb and coffee flavor.",84,Chasing Lions 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (North Coast)
"This dry, acidic young Pinot Noir isn't offering much richness, but does have a nice heart of cherries and persimmons. Nice and elegant, it's pretty good for the price. Give it an hour in a decanter and drink now.",88,Toad Hollow 2011 Goldie's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"There is, as usual with Pinots from Garys', a lusty, almost overwhelming quality to the wine. It's a full frontal assault of flavor, with cascades of cherries, raspberries, cola, licorice, sweet leather and smoky char that go on and on. It's an achievement, but what the wine has in directness, it's missing in subtlety. Drink this big, bold California Pinot Noir now, or hold through 2010.",88,Loring Wine Company 2006 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Dark, spicy scents run side by side with licorice root and black cherry notes. This juicy, layered blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% each of Merlot and Syrah is a potent number with black- and red-plum flavors backed by a lasting, bold, angular finish. Drink through 2023.",91,Enrique Mendoza 2011 Santa Rosa Reserva Red (Alicante)

"This is ripe, fruit-driven Shiraz with ample weight and ripeness. Hints of smoke and sage add nuance to the blueberry and black cherry fruit, while coarse-grained tannins provide adequate structure and grip. Drink now–2022.",88,Wirra Wirra 2014 Catapult Shiraz (McLaren Vale)
"Butterscotch and candle wax aromas signal a wine in the early stages of decline. In addition, this shows dusty apple and mild citrus scents. The palate is being kept upright by citrusy acidity, while flavors of nectarine and citrus end with bready, aged notes. Drink immediately or wait for the 2012.",86,Vionta 2011 Limited Release Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Toasted nut, yellow melon, pear and struck match scents show on the nose of this bottling from a steep, rocky vineyard in the mountains between Malibu and the Conejo Valley. It's tightly wound on the palate, with a core of pear, apple and nectarine flesh, accented with sea salt and oak smoke flavors.",88,Cielo 2015 Three Sixty-Five Viognier (Saddle Rock-Malibu)
"Rich and spicy, this complex blend holds Touriga Nacional, Trincadeira and Aragonez. It has juicy fruits and balanced tannins, black currant fruitiness and delicious acidity. With a touch of spice and an herbal backdrop, the wine is ripe and ready to go.",90,Lusovini 2011 Terras de Fialho Red (Alentejano)
"This Sangiovese is deeply concentrated, redolent of raw blueberry, simple red fruit, spice, leather and perfumed candle. The sour cherry notes on the finish add a tart, crisp point on the tail end of this wine.",89,Castello di Querceto 2003 La Corte Sangiovese (Colli della Toscana Centrale)
"A bright and relatively light expression of the variety, this wine imparts more red berry than black, with seasonings of cinnamon and nutmeg. Soft, smooth and unfussy, it retains solid acidity from start to finish, with a taste of vanilla custard on the finish.",88,Balletto 2012 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"This small-production wine from two spectacular sites in the Petaluma Gap is robustly earthy and spicy, showing compost and blue fruit flavor. Broadly structured, it expands on the palate, its finish dotted with black tea and clove.",92,Guarachi Family 2015 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Merlot is the principal grape here, with Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot filling out the blend. This is an elegant, sculpted wine, built upon a sturdy foundation of supple, ripe Columbia Valley fruit. Raspberry and cherry flavors get a spicy lift from the Petit Verdot, while the Cabernet adds focus and heft to the tannins.",93,Lauren Ashton Cellars 2011 Cuvée Estelle Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The 12-months of oak aging has given this wine a fine structure, hints of mint and attractive tannins. Grown in vineyards south of Lisbon, it is ripe and sunny, while still firm. It is wine that is now ready to drink.",88,Cooperativa Agricola de Santo Isidro de Pegoes 2013 Adega de Pegões Touriga Nacional (Península de Setúbal)
"That 40-year-old Colombard even exists in the Russian River Valley is quite remarkable and so it's a worthy exercise to taste this wine for the sake of history and diversity alone. Happily it's also quite fresh in pineapple, pear and exotic lemongrass, textured throughout, dry and steely on the finish.",88,Y Rousseau 2013 Old Vines Colombard (Russian River Valley)
"Very similar to Peju's regular '05 Cab Franc, released a few months earlier, except it tastes much oakier. You'll find the soft structure and cherry, currant and violet flavors, but the toasty oak and caramel are overwhelming.",87,Peju 2005 Reserve Cabernet Franc (Rutherford)
"This Extra Dry (slightly sweet) vintage Prosecco delivers a lean, slightly watery style and piquant bubbles that recall lemon soda. The wine is firm and steely in the mouth with tonic bubbling and layers of fresh fruit on the close.",85,Val d'Oca 2008 Millesimato Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)

"This vintage is light in color with perfumed fruit and attractive red currant and orange fruit. It is floral, touched by raspberries as well as a strong streak of acidity. This refreshing wine is ready to drink.",89,Ravoire et Fils 2016 Domaine Saint Ferréol Les Vaunières Rosé (Coteaux Varois en Provence)
"Livermore Valley-based Fenestra loves to source fun stuff from Lodi, and Graciano has proven to like Lodi very much. In Fenestra's hands this varietal is soft and round, perfectly fine drinking, a taste of Bing cherry in liquid form.",87,Fenestra 2009 Graciano (Lodi)
"This is a light-colored wine with spice, wood flavors and balanced acidity. It is soft with caramel and vanilla flavors along with touches of red berries and dried fruits. The aftertaste is fruity.",85,Kopke NV Reserve Tawny  (Port)
"This is powerfully impressive, with its firm structure giving great depth to the rich black-cherry and plum fruits. Dense and tannic, it needs to age for at least four years.",93,Duorum 2009 Reserva Old Vines Red (Douro)
This Sangiovese-based rosato is vinified solely in stainless steel in order to preserve the freshness of its forest berry and cranberry flavors. A touch of bitter almond adds brightness to the finish.,86,L'Antica Fornace di Ridolfo 2011 Cantalici Petali di Rosé Sangiovese (Toscana)
"Made from grapes planted in 2006, this Syrah reflects its young-vine fruit in the form of light, primary, somewhat grapy flavors. It shows traces of herb and tobacco, which are balanced by tannins. All in all, this a promising start for this new vineyard block.",88,Eight Bells 2010 Red Willow Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"Cherry soda, mint and crushed almond characterize the nose of this luminous rosé made with the hearty Aglianico grape. The wine is creamy and smooth with fresh berry acidity on the close. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers.",85,Cantina del Taburno 2007 Albarosa Rosé (Campania)
"This Cava has a funky nose that's unusual. The palate is a bit flabby, with sweet banana and peachy flavors. There's not much to the finish and overall this comes across as overly simple and strained.",83,Paul Cheneau NV Brut Sparkling (Cava)
"This wine makes a big impression with wild, earthy aromas and dense, fruit-laden flavors. It blends ripe plum, smoke, tart blackberry and rich black cherry notes on a base of firm tannins and fresh acidity. These are rich, complex and carry through to the lingering finish. It's made from 85% Mourvèdre, plus Syrah, Grenache and Counoise.",90,Holly's Hill 2013 Patriarche Red (El Dorado)
"Combining 76% Pinot Noir and 24% Chardonnay, this wine has a depth of richness and focused, supportive acidity that work well to complement each other. Stone fruit, vanilla biscuit, cherry kirsch and green apple are all within the spectrum of flavors here, finishing with grace and a hint of spice.",95,Iron Horse 2012 Classic Vintage Brut Sparkling (Green Valley)
"Here's a sweet and luscious Barbera d'Alba with bright, thick concentration and immediate aromas of blackberry, cassis and cherry. There is an obvious wood element here that adds tones of spice, vanilla and tobacco. The high density and richness of the wine leaves purplish glycerin trails on the side of the glass.",89,Cascina Ballarin 2007 Giuli  (Barbera d'Alba)
"Forward and lightly spicy, this is a good, all-purpose white wine, with bright flavors of apple and pear. It's not a big wine in any way, but perfectly quaffable and right for a wide variety of noodle dishes.",87,Maryhill 2013 Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The aromas are a little sweaty and the wine has not entirely knit together, even after four years. Fruit flavors are raisined, the acids feel chalky, and the finish resolves into some bitter phenolics.",84,Spangler 2013 Cabernet Franc (Southern Oregon)
"From tiny production of 2.5 acres, there is a spicy, lightly toasty wine that brings out a richness in the Sauvignon Blanc and gives the apricot and pear fruit roundness. The wine is ripe, full in the mouth, tangy and zesty with a more refreshing herbal aftertaste. Drink from late 2016.",88,Château Maison Noble 2015  Bordeaux Blanc
"This medium-bodied red offers ample cherry and leather flavors but not much richness or depth. It's clean on the finish, with modest tannins and mouthwatering fruit.",86,Michel Picard 2012 Red (Côtes du Rhône)
This extroverted reserve-style wine combines generous buttery and nutty nuances with crisp and bracing apple and Anjou-pear flavors to find a very good balance. It feels full bodied and luxurious but stays lively due to good grape acidity.,90,Domaine Anderson 2015 Estate Chardonnay (Anderson Valley)
"Tight, bright acidity leads off this elegant, perfumed wine. With its white fruit and citrus flavors it is both rich and refreshing. A fine mineral streak runs right through this complex, certainly ageworthy wine.",92,Emmerich Knoll 2011 Ried Loibenberg Smaragd Riesling (Wachau)
"Hints of fennel add a splash of green to the intense yellow peach, pineapple and honeysuckle flavors of this penetrating, off-dry Riesling. The palate is lush with sweet fruit flavors, but spirited lemon-lime acidity carries it to a dry, elegantly floral finish.",88,Hosmer 2011 Riesling (Cayuga Lake)
"If you know Chardonnays from the Edna Valley, on California's Central Coast, this tastes like one. It's bright in acidity and forward in jammy lime, kiwi and vanilla fruit, with a stony minerality. It's a pretty wine to drink now.",87,El Roy 2009 Chardonnay (Alexander Valley)
"Light aromas like canteloupe and flavors like honeydew melon make this wine fruity and easy to enjoy. It's medium bodied, fruity and smooth.",87,HandCraft 2015 Artisan Collection Pinot Grigio (California)
"Fresh and fruity on the nose, this bottling by Joey Tensley and Alex Guarachi shows strawberries and olallieberries as well as crushed black rocks, wet slate and char aromas. Those same fruits power a zesty palate enhanced by lavender and black-tea flavors.",90,Tenshen 2014 Red (Santa Barbara County)
"Spicy-sweet notes of dried orange peel and mango waft from this aromatic late-harvest wine. Lip-smacking marmalade sweetness is countered by a piercing strike of lemon acidity. Juicy and quaffable, it would be a lovely accompaniment to spicy Asian cuisine or a cheese plate.",87,Millbrook 2014 Late Harvest Riesling (Hudson River Region)
"It conveys the purest scent of cut green pears, a crisp but cushioned body, and zesty, citrusy freshness. It's very complete and for immediate consumption.",90,Buchegger 2013 Holzgasse Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"Soft, simple and hot. Tastes like melted cherry pie filling, sprinkled with cocoa, anise and pepper, with a burning finish. Drink now.",82,Kenneth Volk 2005 Starr Ranch Vineyard Tempranillo (Paso Robles)
"A simple, proper Pinot Noir, dry and silky in the mouth. It shows modest raspberry and cherry flavors, with an edge of oak.",84,Chime 2010 Pinot Noir (California)
"Deep in color, with raisiny, fully ripe and heavy aromas. Feels tannic, extracted and rubbery, but amid the weight and bite there's black plum, pepper and coffee flavors. Finishes with drawing tannins and a dark wave of toasty flavor. A big wine with mouthfeel issues.",85,Sottano 2010 Merlot (Mendoza)
"A crisp and grassy wine, this is fresh and full of green fruit notes. It is ready to drink now, with grapefruit, gooseberry and crisp apple flavors.",84,Casa Santos Lima 2014 Lab Branco White (Lisboa)
"Basic citrus aromas lean towards grapefruit. This blend of 70% Godello with Treixadura and Albariño feels fresh and snappy, with bracing acidity. Briny flavors of white grapefruit and tangerine finish fresh and cleansing. Drink immediately.",86,Peza do Rei 2014 White (Ribeira Sacra)
"Without any wood aging, the wine shows just the yeastiness from aging on the lees. That fills the palate with spice and a touch of pepper. The wine needs a little more time. Drink from 2018.",84,Domaine Sauvat 2015 Anthéus Chardonnay
"A Claret (Merlot, Cabernet, Malbec) blend topping out at more than 16% alcohol and being released seven years after the vintage is unusual, to say the least. It's oaky, tannic, blocky and generic, but the bottle age has tempered the tannins a bit and somewhat taken the edge off the alcohol.",83,EdenVale 2007 Claret (Rogue Valley)
"Vanilla, licorice, herb and woodspice aromas are followed by slightly gritty-feeling cranberry flavors. This wine is interesting, but it doesn't all come together.",88,Gamache 2012 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Zippy white grapefruit and lemon juxtapose more savory tones of crushed mineral, pressed apple and pear in this off-dry Riesling. The palate is sprightly and bright with a clean, moderately persistent finish. Drink now through 2019.",87,Treleaven 2014 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Forest floor, new leather, pressed violet, ripe berry, Mediterranean herb and eucalyptus aromas lead the way on this robust red. The densely concentrated palate shows raisin, vanilla, prune and espresso alongside the warmth of evident alcohol. Chewy tannins provide support while a hint of licorice wraps up the finish. Give it a few years to unwind, then drink to capture the remaining fruit richness.",89,Tassi 2012  Brunello di Montalcino
"With intense banana aromas, this is a tight wine with high acidity. It has crisp red-currant fruits that are not quite ripe. Tangy and shot through with banana flavors, the wine will be better from 2016.",84,Georges Duboeuf 2014 Domaine des Darroux  (Chénas)
"Rose, violet, charred earth and plummy aromas emerge from the glass. The soft, straightforward palate offers dried black cherry, prune, mint and mocha alongside round tannins. Enjoy through 2016.",87,Guidi 1929 2011  Chianti Colli Senesi
"This wine has acidity and a good balance between the fresh, crisp character and the richer yellow fruits. It is ready to drink.",85,Paul Reitz 2014  Saint-Véran
"Subdued aromas of yellow flower, orchard fruit and a whiff of nut lift out of the glass. The palate seems rather evolved, offering suggestions dried citrus zest and a hint of baked yellow apple. It closes on a bitter almond note.",86,La Boatina 2015 Pinot Grigio (Friuli Isonzo)
"Picked at 33 brix and fermented in new French oak, this heavy, almost oily dessert wine has a floral aroma as intense as bottled perfume. Flavors suggest orange liqueur, honey and candied apricots. It pulls together just enough acidity to avoid falling into a fat, cloying finish.",90,Apolloni 2014 Lacrima d'Oro Muscat (Willamette Valley)
"The aromas are on the rustic side for this simple, fresh wine. To taste, the juicy fruit offers a good barbecue wine, with its soft but dry tannins and bright red berry fruit flavors. Drink now.",84,Herdade Grande 2006 Condado das Vinhas Red (Alentejano)
"Smoky bacon and a bittersweet element of black tea make for an exotically spicy, complex and full-bodied wine from the mighty vineyard site overlooking the Petaluma Gap. Black cherry, pomegranate and cardamom are wrapped in a swaddling of toasted oak, while the mouthfeel is dense and concentrated.",93,Black Kite 2014 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This has a dark red-black color, with densely packed aromas that seem so tight they are not giving up much. Flavors of concentrated dark plum and white pepper are interlaced with very firm tannins. It's full bodied, young and wound up tight. Drink it now for the wow factor, or be adventurous and save it until 2020 to see how much more flavor complexity develops.",87,Naggiar 2010 Estate Grown Reserve Syrah (Sierra Foothills)
"This is a dry style of rosé. Packed with red currant and berry fruits, this blend of Cabernet Franc and Grolleau has a touch of spice to add extra interest. It is perfumed, crisp and ready to drink young.",87,Domaine du Petit Clocher 2016  Rosé de Loire
"This blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc, 10% Merlot and 10% Sangiovese opens with aromas recalling blackberry, cedar and Mediterranean herb. The savory, medium-bodied palate delivers ripe black cherry, mocha and black pepper notes with firm tanninc underpinnings. Drink through 2019.",89,Grattamacco 2015 Rosso  (Bolgheri)
"This wine is concentrated and shows hints of bitter extraction as well as ripe fruit. There is a tough dryness that will soften given time, yielding a palate that's rich and fulfilling. Wait until 2016.",86,Château Croix Mouton 2011  Bordeaux Supérieur
"The Aurora has just a bit more texture and density than its superb companion wine, the Avellana Pinot Noir. Black cherry, cola and baking spice notes are accented with touches of iron filings and slivers of dark chocolate. Thoughtful winemaking is on display here, creating a dense wine that is nonetheless immediately accessible and delicious.",94,Ponzi 2010 Aurora Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Surprisingly austere for a Beaujolais-Villages, the wine has a firm, dry character that hides the natural fruitiness of the Gamay. Dense tannins and acidity give a cool feel to this stalky wine. It has red fruits, intense and tight acidity and a perfumed aftertaste. Drink now.",84,Louis Tête 2013 Les Combes  (Beaujolais-Villages)
"Classic California Petite Sirah, which means the wine is bone dry, acidic and tough in tannins. It's flavorful, offering a mouthful of blackberries, black currants and licorice. The tannins reprise on the finish, leaving behind a puckery bitterness. Good with short ribs, barbecue.",88,Twisted Oak 2007 Petite Sirah (Calaveras County)
"This boasts a classic nose of red berry, forest floor, spice rack and a balsamic note. The full-bodied palate delivers juicy red cherry, mature strawberry, clove, grilled herbs and anise alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. An earthy note of truffle closes the finish.",93,Costa di Bussia 2010 Bussia Vigna Campo dei Buoi  (Barolo)
"An iconic wine, this shows bold spice and smoke flavors that are brushed over a core of dark, luscious fruit. It's already soft and plush with a touch of sweet, sun-ripened cherry on the finish.",91,Paolo Scavino 2008 Monvigliero  (Barolo)
"A supple, medium-bodied Pinot Noir with a pronounced acidic edge. Cranberry is the starring fruit here, framed by coffee-like oak. Crisp and a bit astringent on the finish.",85,Mt. Difficulty 2009 Roaring Meg Pinot Noir (Central Otago)
"A touch stemmy on the nose, with herbal aromas and a hint of brine. Round on the palate, with a good mouthfeel and herbal berry flavors. Shows bounce and heat on the finish, but also a final note of green.",85,Castillo de Monjardin 2009 La Cantera Garnacha (Navarra)
"Vanilla, clove, allspice, dried ginger and soy are laced into black-plum sauce on the nose of this densely layered wine. The palate is even-handed, with tight boysenberry spiced up by caramel and bitter espresso notes.",88,Opaque 2012 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)
"A rich concentrated wine that is solid with tannins and ripe with black fruits. The fruits are up front with the densely tannic character equally prominent. With spice, bitter coffee as well as fine berry fruits, the wine is still young. Drink from 2019.",93,Famille Laplace 2012 Château d'Aydie Tannat (Madiran)
"The top red from Adega Mayor, this is serious and impressive. Its firm, dry and dusty tannins are balanced by an intense blackberry flavor and contrasted with licorice and coffee notes. As it ages, it will become more intense and elegant.",91,Adega Mayor 2008 Pai Chão Garrafeira Red (Alentejano)
"This big but complex wine offers wonderful varietal characteristics. Sage and blackberry highlight the aromas, while equally interesting black pepper, beef and blackberry flavors expand on the palate. It has very good depth and a distinctive flavor profile, too.",92,Amador Cellars 2014 Syrah (Amador County)
"Mild, compact and fresh, this ruby-colored Brunello shows bright aromas of crisp berry fruit backed by vanilla, toasted almond, cola and a touch of campfire. The mouthfeel is streamlined and tight, making for a less informal expression of this greatest of Tuscan reds.",89,Fattoria La Lecciaia 2008  Brunello di Montalcino
"Those notorious mountain tannins have largely melted, making the wine drinkable now, although it will hold for a decade with proper cellaring. Lush and velvety, with a drop of Cabernet Franc, this is voluptuous in cherries, black currants and fine, toasty oak.",94,Duckhorn 2003 Merlot (Howell Mountain)
"One word describes this Chardonnay: fabulous. It's really everything a California Chardonnay can deliver. Ripe tropical fruit, pear, green apple and honey flavors are wrapped into buttery, smoky oak. The richness is brightened by crisp acidity and a touch of minerals, showing its pedigree with every nuance. Drink soon, to enjoy its youthful beauty.",95,Rochioli 2010 Sweetwater Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Ripe cherry, cassis, animal and smoke aromas are staunch. Saturated, drawing and highly tannic now, this needs age. Currently, flavors of medicinal cherry and cassis run deep and strong. Toasty, chocolaty, minty finishing flavors add to a simmering whole. Drink through 2024.",89,Matarromera 2013 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)

"Ripe aromas of prune, cassis and blackberry come with notes of spice cake, minerals and lemon peel. This feels grabby and strong, with pronounced acidity and tannins. Baked blackberry, black currant and toasty flavors are supported by a beam of firm acidity that carries onto the finish. Drink this powerful Rioja now through 2022.",93,Viñedos de Paganos 2012 La Nieta  (Rioja)
"Very ripe aromas and flavors resemble sweet raisins and prunes, but the flavors are dry and more savory than outright fruity. Black pepper, dark chocolate and charred beef notes seem perfect to pair with a grilled steak or giant portobello mushroom. It's a big-boned but well-balanced wine.",90,Rock Wall 2013 Rock Hound Red (California)
"A surprise from the Assyrtiko-dominant island of Santorini, this delicious red is made from an endangered island variety. Rich aromas of cherry, violet and clove are followed by a balanced array of juicy red and black berry and complex warming spice flavors. The tannins are firm but the wine is smooth in the mouth. Pair with meat and rich cheeses. A find.",90,Domaine Sigalas 2008 Mavrotragano (Santorini)
"Since last reviewed in 2008, the Alloro Vineyard's grapes seem to have gained in complexity and sophistication. Elegant and fine tuned, this new release combines scents and accents of rose petals, wet rock and raspberries with generous, supporting acidity. The finish extends gracefully with the finesse of Premier Cru Burgundy.",91,Rex Hill 2011 Alloro Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"The wine is firm and still structured. With wood, dense tannins and just the hint of juicy black-currant fruit, it needs time. From 2019, it should be a richer fruitier wine, always with a tannic core.",86,Château Cayla 2014  Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux
"Here’s a country-style Cab that won’t break the bank but offers solid value. The fruit is light and clean, suggesting blackberries and plums, with oregano and thyme notes and the slightest touch of toasty oak. Tannins are soft but fine, and it finishes very dry.",84,Callaway 1998 Coastal Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Tan in color, this has fleshy, almondy aromas. It feels flat and creamy, with soft, lightly oxidized flavors of mealy apple and walnut oil. This is past its prime.",82,Bitácora 2010 Verdejo (Rueda)
The toasty framework around soft and spicy red fruits needs a bit more bottle age to integrate fully. Accents of herb and leaf add a bit of complexity which show promise for future enjoyment. Drink 2018–2022.,87,Lazy River 2012 Pinot Noir
"The mysteriously named Inchinnan offers a flavorful mix of mint, berry, cherry, milk chocolate, Asian spice, cedar and cola. It's harmonious, with subtle power and excellent length.",92,Carabella 2010 Inchinnan Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)

"With 75,000 cases of this wine now coming to the U.S., it has to be one of the more ubiquitous New Zealand offerings. Thankfully, the quality is very good, with ripe nectarine aromas and flavors touched by just a slight varietally correct grassiness. Long and mouthwatering on the finish.",88,Whitehaven 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"This is a sumptuous wine from Viosinho, a grape winemakers almost gave up on due to low yields. With its lees stirred for 18 months, the wine has intensity and a lightly oxidative character. Now maturing well, its citrus fruit is becoming almost toasty, certainly nutty. Great acidity keeps this rich wine full of crispness. Drink now.",91,Casca Wines 2013 Monte Cascas Vinhas Velhas Old Vines White (Douro)
"91-93. Barrel sample. Big, bold and fruity, this shows plenty of rich blackberry-juice flavor and fine tannins. The fruit and tannins are well balanced, with a juicy character on the finish.",92,Château Lascombes 2011 Barrel Sample  (Margaux)

"This amber-colored Riserva offers slightly oxidized flavors of caramel, butterscotch and yellow rose. There are Sherry notes in there too, but not enough of them to disregard the wine. It shows good length and persistency.",86,Contratto 1999 Riserva Giuseppe Contratto Sparkling (Piedmont)
"Light and fruity, a wine with touches of typical Cabernet Franc perfume. The wine is dry, crisp with raspberry flavors and a spicy, fresh aftertaste. Screwcap.",84,Calvet 2011 Limited Release Rosé Cabernet Franc (Bordeaux Rosé)
"This has a grand array of exotic flinty, meaty, smoky and spicy aromas. The powerful flavors taste a bit restrained at first sip, then unfold and seem to expand on the palate. Pure and brilliant layers of ripe blackberry, smoked herbs and darkest chocolate ride on an elegant texture of fine tannins and supportive acidity. Drink from 2018–2030.",96,Terre Rouge 2012 Ascent Syrah (Sierra Foothills)
"Vintner Carlo Cattaneo offers a lean, crisp expression of Sangiovese with aromas of cassis and spice. The wine shows sharp acidity on the close.",84,Massanera 2005 Prelato di Massanera Sangiovese (Toscana)
"Lively and crisp, this wine hints more at fragrant red berries and red fruit than the tannins of Cabernet. The structure is there, but in the background, giving the wine a chance at a couple of years' bottle aging.",88,Steininger 2011 Rosé Sekt Cabernet Sauvignon (Österreichischer Sekt)
"This is a bold, showy wine with assertive oaky, smoky, spicy aromas, a very firm texture and equally oak-driven flavors. Plenty of tannin gives a grippy mouthfeel and full body, so it should pair well with meat and cheese.",88,Nottingham Cellars 2012 Micro-lot Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley)
"Burnt, edgy and stemmy/stalky from start to finish. The nose gives off a charred nut and asphalt character, while the palate is edgy, hard and bitter, with briary flavors of roasted fruit and stems. Questionable and compromised for the price.",83,Puro Uno 2008 Malbec (Mendoza)
"Front-loaded with gooseberry and feline aromas and flavors, this Sauvignon Blanc will appeal to those who like those New Zealand-like notes. It also has richer flavors of Meyer lemons and limes.",84,Kenwood 2007 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County)
"A juicy, spicy wine, packed with open, generous black fruits. The blend of Castelão and Trincadeira gives blackberries, some raisins and a smooth chocolate underlay.",88,Quinta do Casal Branco 2004 Falcoaria Red (Ribatejo)
"Montes' first Alpha Malbec is serious and healthy, with rubbery, leathery berry aromas and crusty, dark oak scents. This is full and fairly oaky on the tongue, with herbal black-fruit flavors, raw wood notes, espresso-like bitterness and heat on the finish.",88,Montes 2010 Alpha Malbec (Colchagua Valley)
"This modest Pinot Noir is pale in color and light in body, but don't discount it. Pretty notes of strawberries are attractively underlined by hints of twigs and cocoa. It turns more cranberry-like and slightly astringent on the finish. Drink now.",86,Fernz 2011 Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
"The easy-to-find Gnarly Head, a blend of 50% Zinfandel, 20% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Petite Sirah and 3% Syrah, is young and ready to drink.Its fruity nose and peppery spice tmakes it a full-blown crowd pleaser ready for backyard barbecues.",86,Gnarly Head 2010 Authentic Red Red (Lodi)
"Rounded rose and honey notes with inflections of apple and Mirabelle are cut very pleasingly by the citric freshness of tangerine peel. This is easy drinking, medium bodied and aromatic.",88,Paul Blanck 2014 Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Very deep in color and spicy-smoky in flavor, this full-bodied wine is packed with dark-fruit flavors like blackberry and blueberry. Aromas like grilled beef and spicy flavors like cardamom and smoke give it a bold character that's hard to deny.",86,Cocobon 2014 Red (California)
Waxy plum is given ample richness from a taste of milk chocolate in this luxuriously full-bodied voluptuous wine. Big lush tannins are met by a smoky backdrop of robust oak and a spicy hit of clove on the finish.,89,Duckhorn 2014 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Charred, almost burnt aromas dominate the nose on this muscular, tannic Malbec. Like the nose, this tastes largely of blackened hickory and coffee, meaning the fruit is buried under a lot of barrel weight. Drink through 2027.",91,Terrazas de Los Andes 2012 Single Vineyard Las Compuertas Malbec (Mendoza)
"Winemakers Greg Morthole and David Ramey showcase this vineyard site well, a special spot in the heart of the appellation. Rich and spicy, the wine features tastes of black tea, deep dark fruit and zesty minerality, all layered by toasty oak. Full bodied and luxurious, it finds its way to a bright, fresh finish.",92,Davis Bynum 2013 Jane's Vineyard Dijon Clone 777 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Made entirely with the native grape Timorasso, this structured elegant white opens with aromas of acacia flower and hay. The bright palate delivers apricot, lemon zest, hazelnut and a touch of ginger while a mineral vein energizes the finish. Enjoy through 2025.",90,I Carpini 2010 Brezza d'Estate Timorasso (Colli Tortonesi)
"Sanguine and restrained, this is a lovely version of the variety from the region. It is high-toned in refreshing acidity and accented in red cherry and a memorable spiciness of cinnamon and pepper. Completely understated, it will do well at the table or on its own as aperitif fare.",93,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2012 Zeigler Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"Heavy, soft and dense, like melted black cherry and raspberry marmalade, sprinkled with cinnamon, brown sugar and nutmeg. Rich, but lacks vitality. Drink now.",85,Verve 2008 Laetitia Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"There's an assertive garrigue character to this wine, with strong aromas of thyme, bay, lavender, fennel and white pepper that overwhelm the red fruit tones. The medium-weight palate offers a bit more fruit, with flavors of strawberry and raspberry to partner with the assertive mentholated-herb notes. Accents of oak and sweet spice unfold on the finish.",89,Blanville 2013 Helios Red (Languedoc)
"Emiliana began as Vinedos Organicos Emiliana, but now goes only by Emiliana because getting certified as an organic winery proved too difficult. Still, Emiliana's vineyards are organically farmed, and this five-grape blend made by Alvaro Espinoza is intense and extracted yet still finely knit. It's a serious wine with slight herbal/pine aromas, robust red-fruit flavors, and a smooth, stylish finish. Not overdone, so drink now.",90,Emiliana 2005 Coyam Red (Colchagua Valley)
"Made with just 10% new oak and in both American and Hungarian barrels, this wine celebrates both juicy red plum and raspberry, offering sizable power in an elegant package. Soft tannins and measured acidity maintain a freshness in the glass, with a nuanced, easygoing finish.",90,Pellegrini 2012 Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
"This Blanc de Noirs—91% Pinot Noir with small amounts of Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier—opens with a tad ripe, with a light and airy mousse and a predominance of strawberry flavor. It's easy to like—dry, soft and round with a long finish.",87,Chandon NV Blanc de Noirs Sparkling (California)
"The wine is rich, exuding ripe black fruits as well as dried prune. It balances the fruit with some firm tannins that will allow the wine to age for a few years. For now, it is opulent, finely balanced, and leaves a fine perfumed aftertaste from the Touriga Nacional in the blend.",90,Offley 2013 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port)
"Earthy, rather savory notes of moss and dusty minerals contrast bright, fruity flavors of fresh peach and papaya on this semidry Riesling. It's refreshing and spry on the palate, with a brisk and cutting finish. Drink now.",85,Lucas Vineyards 2013 Semi Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Aromas of lees and spice edge out peach and pear notes. The palate is dry and creamy in feel, with the fruit flavors light and elegant. The lees influence dominates.",88,Nefarious 2014 Estate Grown Defiance Vineyard Viognier (Lake Chelan)
"A cherry-fresh wine that's so full of fruit that its structure becomes secondary. A dry edge of tannin supports the fruit and acidity, making this wine so drinkable now.",88,Domaine de l'Hermitage 2012  Menetou-Salon
"There's a wild, natural streak to this wine of garrigue herbs and game matched with fruit notes of dark cherry and plum guts. The medium-weight mouth is juicy but offers nice structre with dusty tannins and a fudgy finish. Drink now.",87,Mourrel Azurat 2009 Red (Fitou)
"This delightful Chianti Classico shows Sangiovese charisma with bright fruit aromas, cherry, white almond and pressed violets. It's smooth and silky, with a touch of sourness on the close.",89,Querceto di Castellina 2008 L'Aura  (Chianti Classico)
"Carmo was formerly owned by the Rothschild family of Château Lafite. In this now maturing 2009 selection, there is a firm character, leavened by dried fruits, dark berries and some smooth woody characters. It's a wine to drink now, or age for 2–3 more years.",88,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal 2009 Quinta do Carmo Red (Alentejano)
"A mix of Cabernet and Merlot, with small amounts of four other grapes, this is a soft red, with red and black fruit flavors. It's smooth and accessible, offering plenty of cocoa and sweet baking spice notes.",89,Swiftwater Cellars 2008 Proprietary Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Underbrush, scorched earth, leather and camphor aromas lead the way along with an earthy whiff of game. On the ripe chewy palate, notes of crushed mint, clove, licorice and grilled porcini accent a juicy black-cherry core. Firm close-grained tannins offer taut support.",90,Seghesio 2012 Ginestra  (Barolo)
"The latest version of this popular blend drops the Chardonnay and adds 11% Grüner Veltliner to the Roussanne-Viognier blend. It seems to elevate the aromatics, pushing lush scents of lemon drop, pineapple, and candied orange peel forward. Those perfectly rendered citrus peel flavors put a frame around the tart fruit, and there is a hint of white pepper in the spicy finish.",90,Syncline 2009 Subduction White White (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Made with 90% Merlot and 10% Alicante, this easygoing red opens with delicate aromas suggesting red currant and baking spice. The straightforward palate delivers red plum and clove alongside soft tannins. Enjoy soon.",87,Podere Ciona 2014 Semifonte Red (Toscana)
"This producer continues to up its game with this variety, becoming more impressive with every vintage. With the majority stainless-steel fermented, it offers tart, tangy grapefruit pith, lemon and lime around a grip of sublime texture and length.",94,Galerie 2016 Naissance Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Beautifully concentrated aromas precede flavors of violets, pepper, sweet spice, plum and red berries. The wine is full and round in the mouth with excellent acidity and tannin. A little tight and closed right now, it should open up to be even more balanced and better integrated in 2–3 years.",89,L'Ostal Cazes 2004 Red (Minervois La Liviniere)
"Edgy, nervy and funky, with unfamiliar aromas and flavors. The nose is pickled and the palate is tart, linear and green. Loses itself as it opens, turning more herbal, sweaty and strange. Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company, LLC.",82,Tamaya 2007 Winemaker's Selection Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Limarí Valley)
Lively fruit flavors and great balance make this wine easy to appreciate and a versatile pairing with food. Fresh cherry and raspberry aromas meet rich flavors on a smooth texture that has just enough light tannins for a little grip.,89,Bogle 2014 Old Vine Zinfandel (California)
"This perfumed, new-wood-flavored wine is clear-cut and structured. Firm tannins are layered with black fruits and touches of perfumed violets, allied with solid structure. It fills the glass with ripe aromas, while acidity at the end gives a final lift. Drink from 2016, although the wine can be enjoyed now.",89,Quinta do Monte d'Oiro 2011 Lybra Syrah (Lisboa)
"Made entirely from Syrah, this opens with black currant and pepper aromas. The concentrated palate delivers prune, cedar and tobacco flavors, framed by sleek tannins. Drink through 2020.",89,Ciacci Piccolomini d'Aragona 2013 Fabius Syrah (Sant'Antimo)
"Imposing, concentrated and tannic, this Syrah-based blend needs time to mature and soften. It has vivid aromas and flavors of black pepper, clove, cranberry and dark chocolate plus an almost rigid mouthfeel from a thick underpinning of fine tannins. The distinctive flavors match the powerful structure, so it should age well. Best to drink after 2020.",92,The Withers Winery 2013 Mr. Burgess Red (El Dorado)
"This wine is concentrated with both tannins and fruit. With acidity and a fresh aftertaste the fruit is full of black-currant flavors. At the same time, the tannins assure a fine future. Drink from 2019.",89,Vignobles Carreau Selection 2014 Château Les Petits Arnauds Excellence  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"Situated in the Tarn River valley, south of Cahors and west of Toulouse, this estate has turned towards Bordeaux in its choice of grapes. The wine has structure, tense tannins as well as black currant fruit flavors. It's a rich, generous wine, and with its acidity and firm background it will age. Drink from 2018.",92,Domaine D'en Ségur 2013 Cuvée Germain Red (Côtes du Tarn)
"This 100% varietal wine brings nuanced aromas of herb, pencil lead, vanilla bean and barrel spice. On the palate, it's reserved with lightly grainy tannins and a tart cranberry-filled finish.",90,Abeja 2013 Heather Hill Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"A medicinal quality comes at you right away, followed by chocolate-coated cherry, creamy oak and a distant note of paint or chemical. Feels round and voluminous, with minty, rubbery flavors of oaky, berry and chocolate. Finishes dry and oaky, with a buttery aftertaste.",85,Caligiore 2010 Reserve Bonarda (Mendoza)
"Darker in color than normal rosé, Bordeaux Clairet also has more richness. This wine is concentrated with vanilla and sweet strawberry flavors, although with a lack of freshness. Treat this as a red wine.",83,Château de Parenchère 2010 Rosé (Bordeaux Clairet)
"Soft and warm, with toast and butter adding richness to the white peach and green plum fruits. The acidity and texture are very evident, giving this wine a certain nervous energy.",87,Joseph Drouhin 2008  Rully
"This is aged in oak, but the vessels are large casks, or foudres, so the impact isn't that noticeable. The wine is meaty and savory on the nose, but the palate shows more herb-garrigue flavors and superripe cherry fruit. Drink now–2017.",89,Ogier 2013 Héritages Elevé en Foudres de Chêne Red (Côtes du Rhône)
"This smells dark and bold, offering Port-like aromas of chocolate ganache, buttercream frosting, brown spice and sun-baked fruit. Hearty and toasty, the palate packs plenty of muscle in the form of strapping tannins and supporting acids. Pair this with seared flank steak with a coffee-soy rub to accent the wine's decadence.",87,Breaux 2007 Meritage Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot-Malbec-Petit Verdot-Cabernet Franc Red (Virginia)
"Drinkable and very generic in taste, this medium bodied wine has little varietal character and a broad, soft texture.",81,Loft 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (California)
"Tart and bright, with an almost-jammy mix of raspberry and strawberry preserves, this concentrated, fruit-powered Merlot overdelivers for the price. Along with the luscious fruit are darker streaks of iron, coffee grounds and char, all in a classy, well-designed, four-vineyard blend.",91,Arbor Crest 2009 Four Vineyards Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The four soils designation refers to the wine's origins in different vineyards throughout the valley. A great followup to the marvelous 2009, the wine showcases artful blending. It's incredibly rich and ripe in black currants, cassis liqueur and smoky oak, yet balanced in acids and tannins. Drink now and through 2022.",93,Sequum 2010 Four Soil Melange Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Soft and fruity, this young wine is full of red fruits and attractive acidity. It has a core of tannins that will soften over the next few months. Drink from 2018.",86,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2016 Vieilles Vignes  (Bourgogne)
"Much higher production than Noceto's Riserva and sourced more broadly, this Sangiovese is more rustic and earthy, its cranberry flavors bursting from the seams, and would be yummy with thin-crust pizza.",85,Noceto 2009 Sangiovese (Amador County)
"A blend of different parcels in Puligny-Montrachet, this creamy wine shows a medley of ripe fruit flavors, both yellow and tropical, and subtle toast from wood aging. Juicy acidity cuts through its richness, leading into a full aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",90,Maison Champy 2015  Puligny-Montrachet
"Structured with green plums and currants, this delicious, limpid wine envelops the palate with citrus and pure, crisp fruit flavors. A great expression of terroir-driven Riesling, with a mineral and steely structure to support the fruit.",94,Nikolaihof 2005 Vom Stein Smaragd Riesling (Wachau)
"This is a perfumed wine, opulent and with a fine smoky structure. With great ripe berry and red-currant fruit, the wine has a juicy character, bright and crisp with acidity while also solidly textured. Drink this wine from 2023.",93,Domaine de Suremain 2015 En Sazenay Premier Cru  (Mercurey)
"Rates about the same as the winery's reserve bottling due to grassy, green aromas of prickly raspberry. Big, chunky and sort of awkward on the palate, with herbal, rooty flavors. Burns on the finish with heat and spice.",82,Zorzal 2009 Pinot Noir (Tupungato)
"A juicy wine, rich, ripe and sweet in jammy fruit and caramelized oak flavors. Black raspberries, blackberries and mocha, spiced with cinnamon and pepper, flood the mouth, wrapped into beautifully sculpted, sweet tannins. A lovely wine to drink now. The wine is mainly Syrah, with 5% Cabernet Sauvignon.",92,Hall 2007 Darwin Red (Napa Valley)
"This is a generous, likable Syrah for drinking soon. It's dark in color, full-bodied and dry, with ripe flavors of blackberries, plums, cola, anise, sandalwood and peppery spices. The soft tannins help the wine finish rich and silky.",89,Wrath 2007 877/Noir Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Packaged in a thick, heavy glass bottle, this hearty Montepulciano d'Abruzzo opens with oaky tones of spice and wood shop, backed by notes of ripe fruit and exotic spice.",86,Terra d'Aligi 2006 Tolos  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo)
"A blend of top sites Celilo and Conner Lee, this appealing wine displays aromas of candy corn, corn silk and chamomile. The stone-fruit flavors are elegantly styled, showing a sense of restraint and balance that carries through the lingering finish.",91,Abeja 2013 Chardonnay (Washington)
Rich aromas like Anjou pears and rose petals combine with generous ripe pear and vanilla flavors. It feels full-bodied but is light in alcohol and has a soothing texture. Good acidity balances the ripeness and the finish lingers.,88,Rock Wall 2012 Rock Hound White (California)
"Good for Burgess for holding this Syrah back for a little while. It's beginning to soften, just barely. The tannins are still strong, but you can taste those bright blackberries and cherries starting to show meaty hints of wild grilled portobello mushrooms. It will drink well in late 2014 with hearty roasts and stews.",89,Burgess 2010 Syrah (Napa Valley)
"Intense on the nose, this has spice, leather and ripe berry aromas. It feels clean, plummy, juicy and bright, with lifted red and black fruit flavors. Showing chewy tannins and additional juiciness on the finish, it's very nice and delivers the goods.",89,Pascual Toso 2010 Reserve Barrancas Vineyards Malbec (Mendoza)
"Frankly sweet, and somewhat oily in texture, this is low in alcohol (7.5%) but high in sugar and ripeness, bringing tropical fruits like mango and papaya to mind.",86,Franz Künstler 2005 Hochheimer Reichestal Kabinett Riesling (Rheingau)
"This bottling combines, as usual, ripe tropical fruits, oak and minerals with excellent acidity to yield a wine that's opulent in the way of a rich Chardonnay, yet balanced and elegant. It's a full-bodied wine whose richness is almost over the top at this point. Give it up to three years of aging to mellow.",90,Talley 2011 Rincon Vineyard Chardonnay (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"Pure pink in color, this ripe wine is soft with rich red fruits. It is attractive and fruit-driven, delicious as an apéritif.",84,Château Thuerry 2014 Les Abeillons Rosé (Coteaux Varois en Provence)
"This is a smoky, wood-aged wine, with a bitter toast flavor that smothers the fruit. It does have the fruit weight, so that toast flavor will certainly soften. But to judge by the intense wood character, this bottling will likely always have a severe edge.",85,Château Fleur la Mothe 2010  Médoc
"Straightforward, this Chard shows well-ripened flavors of pineapple jam, nectarines, peaches and vanilla. It finishes with caramelized, butterscotchy sweetness.",84,Geode 2006 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County)
"As soon as you unscrew the top on this 100% Syrah blush wine, the aromas of raspberries and strawberries release into the air, like incense. Those fruits follow through in the taste, turning jammy, heavy and sweet. The alcohol is a heady 14.9% by volume.",84,Vina Robles 2012 Roseum Huerhuero Rosé (Paso Robles)
"Mild tones of cantaloupe, pear and apple mark this watery, light-bodied wine. It's simple and enjoyable, perfect for less serious situations.",83,Casanel 2014 Patricia Marie Pinot Gris (Middleburg)
"This blend of Malbec, Merlot and Tannat is lean and austere—probably the effect of the vintage. That gives powerful tannins and less in the way of fruit. It's firm, hinting at more juicy fruit but likely to remain dry and structured. Drink from 2018.",87,Jean-Luc Baldès 2013 Clos Triguedina Red (Cahors)
"Made entirely with native grape Nascetta, this opens with aromas of white spring flower and a whiff of hay. The straightforward, rather lean palate offers tropical fruit, lemon zest and a hint of toasted hazelnut alongside refreshing acidity.",87,Serra dei Fiori 2015 La Regina Nascetta (Langhe)
"A bright Pinot from a great spot, this wine takes a while to open, especially aromatically, but once it does it has a lot to say. Structured and soft, it's meaty in savory cranberry and earth, bright with fruit and acidity. Cellar until 2017–2019 and it should have even further built up its vocabulary.",92,Drew 2011 Weir Vineyard Pinot Noir (Yorkville Highlands)
"This superripe blend of Grenache (70%), Syrah (15%) and Mourvèdre (15%) is full-bodied, with a rich, creamy texture and a long, velvety finish. Spice and herb notes accent dusty black cherries, and a hint of cocoa sneaks in as well. Drink now–2017.",92,Mas de Libian 2012 Khayyâm Red (Côtes du Rhône)
"Proprietor Michel Gassier is turning out excellent values at all levels. This supple red blends 72% Grenache with 24% Syrah and 4% Mourvèdre. Raspberry and rhubarb notes on the nose give way to flavors of ripe cherries, baking spices and dried herbs. The finish is long and velvety. Drink now–2020.",91,Château de Nages 2011 Vieilles Vignes Red (Costières de Nîmes)
"This bright, light wine shows floral aromas, lightly herbal flavors, crisp acidity and a lively mouthfeel. It will make a good, refreshing pour at lunch or before dinner.",85,Insatiable 2013 Chardonnay (California)
"Any aroma is virtually undetectable. The palate is thin and sour, with little in the way of fruit.",81,Deer Creek 2011 Chardonnay (Rogue Valley)
"This all-out Zin makes no bones about its sweetness, heavy oak spiciness and full body. Maple syrup, brown sugar and cherry jam are the dominant notes that crowd the aromas and flavors and linger on the finish. Very rich and full-bodied, it has prominent caramelized oak notes that keep the tannins from biting.",87,Seven Deadly Zins 2011 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi)
"This is a simple, soft and quite floral wine, showing a wealth of dusty tannin and full-bodied power. Cedar and pomegranate are the highlights that ride a textured wave of chalky oak.",88,Rutherford Hill 2013 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley)
"An assertive and mouthfilling wine, this has a relatively light color. Aromas are on the earthy side, but the flavors are ripe and focused on cherries and berries with deeper hints of clove and coriander. It's full bodied, plush in texture and long on the finish.",93,Freeman 2013 Keefer Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Still very young, this is an off-dry wine with bright acidity. The wine is not in balance with the sweetness clashing with the fruit. It could come together in a year, but that is somewhat doubtful.",83,Sauvion 2013  Vouvray
"Here's a very elegant, balanced Pinot that shows classic Carneros character. It's a vibrant, likeable wine, silky and dry, with pleasurable flavors of cherries, cola, herbs and spices. The finish is especially rewarding, lasting through a long, spicy aftertaste. Drink now.",89,Bouchaine 2005 Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"A 100% varietal wine from a light-handed producer, this captures a sense of muted, yet juicy red cherry around structured tannins, making for an elegant experience. Integrated oak ensures a layered, medium-bodied wine, with a leathery, coffee-like finish. Cellar through 2020.",90,Longboard 2012 Syrah (Russian River Valley)
"A fine, elegant Chardonnay for drinking now. It has rich, honeyed layers of buttercream, citrus and tropical fruits and spices, brightened with crisp acidity.",87,Babcock 2009 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County)
"Juicy acids brighten up the mouthfeel, with pineapple, citrus and black-cherry-cola flavors commingling. This was aged nine months in 20% new French barrels.",87,Kings Ridge 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Smoke and oak dominate the nose, with some fairly light, pretty fruit underneath. The oak seems mismatched for the weight of the fruit, which is sweet and charming, like cherry lifesavers.",87,Madroña 1998 Reserve Zinfandel (El Dorado)
"With a high bite of acidity and bright, focused fruit, this Pinot Gris defines the white wines of the Edna Ranch, and the wider Edna Valley. The wildflower, lemon, lime, green apple, sage and white pepper flavors have a honeyed edge, but the wine is bone dry.",88,Tolosa 2007 Edna Ranch Pinot Gris (Edna Valley)
"This wine comes from the coolest pocket of the producer's estate, the last part typically picked. It offers a study in savory tannin development and thickness, the skins unable to soften gently in the cold. Earthy clove defines the flavor, along with a leathery meatiness and firm structure. A suggestion of black cherry tries to muddle through. Drink now through 2023.",94,Lynmar 2013 Quail Hill Vineyard Bliss Block Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"The estate wine of Aydie is the most serious and long-lasting of the range produced by the Laplace family. It has an intense, concentrated structure, very dark and rich, with a mineral edge. Age for 4–5 years.",93,Château d'Aydie 2008 Tannat (Madiran)
There is just a faint touch of honeysuckle on the nose. The palate follows with creamy floral peach notes on an incredibly light-bodied fluid palate of great intensity and stony depth. It is only on the aftertaste that the full volume and power of these aromatics shine. This feels like the aromatic heart of Alsace itself.,93,Domaine Schoffit 2013 Clos Saint-Théobald Grand Cru Rangen Muscat (Alsace)
"The oak on this wine is heavy-handed, and it comes in the form of fresh dill, turmeric and vanilla aromas. On the palate, the wine is supple and slick, with a dark cherry flavor and more heavy oak influence. It finishes tangy, and the note of dill lingers.",85,Shenandoah Vineyards 2010 Founder's Reserve Chambourcin (Shenandoah Valley)
"Fairly light in color and body, this wine sings in fresh cranberry and orange before revealing a meatier underbelly of black tea and sautéed mushroom. Finessed and vibrant in minerality, it has pretty rose and fresh-picked cherry characters that dance on the palate as it evolves and unravels provocatively in the glass.",95,Gary Farrell 2013 Rochioli-Allen Vineyards Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Cherry and blackberry notes dominate this ripe, full wine. It has a smoky, toasty character that lends good balance and aging potential. The estate is planted with Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.",88,Château de Bordes-Quancard 2010  Bordeaux
"This off-dry, honeyed Tokaj wine has a penetrating minerality that extends from start to finish, with aromas of honeysuckle and fresh tangerine skin. Slightly dusty on the palate, it shows hints of dried herb and crushed stone, and it finishes on a delicate flower tone.",87,Château Hellha 2002 3 Puttonyos Aszú  (Tokaji)
"The light aromas suggest notes of star fruit and citrus. The palate is flavorful, with racy acids keeping the fruit in focus.",89,Kerloo 2015 Blue Mountain Vineyard Grenache Blanc (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Kudos to winemakers Adam and Dianna Lee for managing to wrest a Syrah this likeable from the difficult 2011 vintage. It's almost worth aging, with a delicious core of molten blackberries, black currants and green tea, and significant tannins, the kind that lock the palate down. And the wine may in fact hold and develop a bit. But the fruit won't outlast the tannins much beyond 2017. Whenever you drink it, give it a few hours in the decanter.",89,Novy 2011 Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands)
Forceful aromas of pie crust and heavy berry fruits are clumsy but generous. There's elastic tightness to the palate along with herbal berry flavors. The finish loses fruit while cranking up the toasty afterburners.,86,Santa Alicia 2012 Reserva Shiraz (Maipo Valley)
"Extra Brut, yes, but the ripeness of the Chardonnay gives a rich, creamed apple character that balances the very dry aftertaste. It is still a fledgling Champagne needing to fill out. Give this until 2016 before drinking.",89,Huré Frères 2009 Inattendue Blanc de Blancs Extra Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)
"There's plenty of cherry pie, red currant, mushroom and sandalwood flavor in this dry Cab Franc, which was blended with a little Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot for complexity. It feels stylish, yet there's a tough, astringent mouthfeel that seems unlikely ever to go away.",87,Kenefick Ranch 2009 Caitlin's Select Cabernet Franc (Calistoga)
"Intense lemon-lime acidity contrasts luscious yellow cherry and peach flavors in this vibrant, penetrating Riesling. Semidry in style, it's fine and filigreed in texture yet powerful enough to maintain a strong, long finish.",88,Atwater 2013 Middle Block One Riesling (Seneca Lake)
"Cedarville is loved for its Syrah and Grenache but it can expertly handle its estate Zinfandel too—grown at 2,500-foot elevation—This smoky, raspberry-wrapped, silky wine is full of big, round mountain tannins yet somehow manages to be light on its feet on the finish. Have it with sticky ribs.",89,Cedarville Vineyard 2009 Estate Zinfandel (El Dorado)
"The very pure scent of freshly cut Conference pear subtly presents itself on the nose. The palate continues in the same, friendly and evocative vein, adding notions of ripe stone fruit, subtle melon hints and a creamy, textured core of exquisite elegance. Cream and fruit vie for attention—but remain slender, citric and toned until the echoing last note.",93,Müller-Grossmann 2014 Alte Reben Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"Soft, sunny acidity and luscious mouthfeel give this Chardonnay an overall plushness. The palate is marked by creamy peach and apple flavors accented by delicate wisps of vanilla and spice. While straightforward in style, it's supple and pleasing.",87,Lamoreaux Landing 2013 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"With a touch of reduction from its 18-month maturation in new French oak, this wine is concentrated and youthful, still unwinding. Tangerine and peach flavors contrast with the more expected bite of apple, while moderate acidity brings freshness to the full-bodied nature of this rich, rewarding white.",93,Sbragia 2014 Gamble Ranch Vineyard Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"This is a textbook Chianti Classico, with dark berry and plum aromas accented by hints vanilla and clove. The palate boasts a core of wild cherry flavors layered with balsamic herbs. Still tightly tannic, it needs a few more years to unwind.",92,Castello della Paneretta 2010  Chianti Classico
"An off-dry blend of Viognier, Pinot Gris, Gewürztraminer and Riesling, this has a full midpalate with plenty of peach and apricot fruit. From there it stays simple and slightly sweet right through the finish.",84,Lake Chelan 2009 Stormy Mountain White White (Lake Chelan)
"Here is a dark and impenetrable Negroamaro with evident oak shadings that add spice, vanilla and toast to the natural cherry and plum. The wine is dark and meaty with a smooth disposition and chewy succulence.",88,La Corte 2005 La Corte Vigne Vecchie Negroamaro (Puglia)
"Aromas of pear, yellow apples and pineapple carry over to the palate along with a banana note. The juicy palate is balanced by bright acidity, making this perfect for everyday fare from lightly seasoned fish to pasta topped with tomato sauce.",86,Kellerei Kaltern Caldaro 2012 K White (Vigneti delle Dolomiti)
"Produced from a 17-acre vineyard, dominated by Merlot, this is the top wine of Château Renard. It is structured and firm with tannins and dense concentration that will probably remain with this rich wine as it matures. Drink from 2018.",89,Château Renard Mondesir 2011  Fronsac
"The pairing possibilities with this wine seem endless: seafood of all kinds, chicken, pasta salad, maybe pork, but it'd also make perfect sense to drink it as an aperitif. Clean and dry in the mouth, mineral and chalk are at the fore, with lime pith, soy and grass underneath. Finishes medium-long, with more of the same.",89,Frankland Estate 2002 Cooladerra Vineyard Riesling (Western Australia)
"Stewed strawberries, blackberry jam, maple, brown sugar, black pepper, teriyaki and pork fat show on the lush nose of this bargain bottling. It's soft on the palate, with fruity strawberry and ripe plum flavors, as well as some more serious beef char elements. It's fun, easy and delicious.",90,Maddalena 2014 Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"The black pepper and anise qualities lead the way, offering a combination of brood and kick that's unique. The wine tends toward a tartness but a dry finish gives it a food-friendly advantage. Not terribly impressive but good overall.",83,Gere Attila 2003 Prestige Kékfrankos (Villány)
"This Grenache/Syrah/Tempranillo blend is already showing hints of oxidation. The toasty nose brings scents of sweet baking spices and orange liqueur as well, but the fruit is dried out and the finish astringent and attenuated.",85,Upper Five 2014 Oso Grande Red (Rogue Valley)
"Heady scents of fragrant jasmine, wisteria and white orchard fruit lead the nose, while the frothy, slightly sweet palate offers succulent yellow apple, pear and ripe white peach. Firm acidity and a creamy perlage provide the framework.",88,Case Bianche 2014 Tenuta Col Santago Undici  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Bright and tangy, this wine delivers a full bouquet of citrus and white flower aromas. Touches of white pepper and crushed mineral appear on the finish, followed by bright acidity.",87,Donna Olimpia 1898 2011 Obizzo Vermentino (Toscana)
"This aromatic, red-cherry flavored wine demonstrates the freshness of the year and the grape. It's a finely textured wine that is structured and accessible, with firm, dry tannins. It can be aged for 2–3 years.",90,Lucien Lardy 2011 Les Chênes  (Fleurie)
"A rounded, very soft Chardonnay from Chablis producer Simmonet-Febvre. There are green fruits, with hints of pears and light acidity. The edge of green tannin gives the wine some shape, but it is essentially soft. Screwcap.",84,Simonnet-Febvre 2006 Chardonnay (Vin de Pays des Portes de Méditerranée)
"Fresh and approachable but lean and focused on the nose, this wine shows chalk, wet slate, iodine and mandarin orange oil aromas. It's extremely limey and quinine-driven on the tangy palate, with the judicious acidity of squeezed lime and tangerine juice.",91,Morgan 2013 Highland Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Despite the Napa Valley address, this ordinary wine tastes like it could come from anywhere. But it's a little rough in feel, with currant and plum sauce flavors.",84,Wine Spots 2009 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"A blend of Merlot and Cabernet, Orchidea (with a pretty silkscreened -label) displays a black, inky color and syrupy aromas of cherry liqueur, savory spice, brown sugar and molasses. It's thick and succulent, with a dense, raw mouthfeel.",91,Fattoria di Casalbosco 2007 Orchidea Red (Toscana)
"A collaboration between winemaker Nick Goldschmidt and his daughter Chelsea, this 100% Merlot delivers great value. Oaky in plummy black fruit and tobacco, it shows a touch of cedar and clove amidst mountainous tannins. An ideal wine for pepper steak off the grill.",88,Chelsea Goldschmidt 2012 Merlot (Alexander Valley)
"Chunky rubbery aromas of black plum form the first act. This feels big and wide, with grabby tannins. Flavors of toast, burnt oak, licorice and blackberry finish woody and with scratchy tannins.",88,Alcance 2013 Vigno Carignan (Maule Valley)
"Soft and sweet on the nose with scents of cherry pie, vanilla and spice, this unusually light-bodied Plavac Mali is fresh and vibrant with a bright red fruit core and zippy acidity. There's a tinge of green on the midpalate, but soft, furry tannins and the sour cherry finish are pleasant.",86,Dingač Winery 2009 Plavac Mali (Peljesac)
"This wine from Moris Farms is ripe with thick layers of blackberry, forest fruit, green leaf, dried hay and earthy Porcini mushroom. It has a chewy, almost sweet consistency with bold texture and good length.",89,Morisfarms 2005  Monteregio di Massa Marittima
"Ceago's Reserve seems a little top-heavy in oak. The caramel and woodsap coating smothers the underlying wine, which is very fine, to judge by the winery's '07 unoaked Chard.",84,Ceago Vinegarden 2007 Reserve Chardonnay (Clear Lake)
"This blend of Niellucciu, Sciaccerellu and Syrah is both rich and stalky. That gives acidity, black currant fruit and a youthful texture. It's balanced with rich tannins which will allow it to age further. Drink from late 2018.",88,Union de Vignerons de l'Île de Beauté 2015 Domaine Vetriccie Red (Corse)
"A good, scoury sparkler, with nice citrus, vanilla and toast flavors and a whistle-clean finish. The bubbles are a little rough.",87,Mumm Napa NV Brut Reserve Sparkling (Napa Valley)
"This is great white wine, especially at this price. With no oak, it shows pure, clean orange, pineapple, fig and vanilla flavors that are brightened by crisp acidity. Flashy and showy, yet complex, it's a beautiful wine to drink now.",92,Dutton-Goldfield 2011 Dutton Ranch Shop Block Pinot Blanc (Green Valley)
"Finished off dry, this masks its residual sugar with ample acidity. Some portion of the winery's numerous individual Riesling lots is barrel fermented, and here there are unmistakable highlights of caramel. On the palate it's smooth and rich, with wide-open flavors of peach and pear.",93,Trisaetum 2014 Estates Reserve Riesling (Willamette Valley)
"La Piazza is a line of wine from Sicily's Calatrasi winery that uses fruit from various parts of Italy. This is their Pinot Grigio from northern Italy that tastes rich and creamy and is made in a New World style. Aromas revolve around butter, almond paste, peach and apricot. It doesn't have huge length, but it does taste rich and dense.",85,Calatrasi 2006 La Piazza Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie)
"With 45% Mourvèdre and 35% Cinsault this has turned into a highly flavored and aromatic wine. It has great fruits and a rich texture that has a herbal edge. It is certainly a food rosé and with its up-front fruit, it could do with a few months to calm down. Drink from late 2017.",91,Les Vignobles Gueissard 2016 Cuvée G Rosé (Bandol)
"A pleasure to taste a Cabernet this rich in fruit, yet one that finishes so dry. It's delicious in blackberries, currants and mocha, wrapped into sweetly smooth tannins. It's a little high in alcohol and soft in acidity. Drink now.",88,Justin 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Reasonably nice peach, melon and apple flavors are nothing extraordinary, but together they make for a decent nose. The palate is soft but not what you'd call flabby, while flavors of pear, apple and banana are innocuous and shouldn't send anyone running to the door. For best results, drinknow.",84,Carta Vieja 2008 Clásico Sauvignon Blanc (Loncomilla Valley)
"Generic red berry, licorice, baking spice and oak aromas set up a round, sticky, almost syrupy feeling palate. This multigrape blend tastes rooty and baked, with blackberry and stewed plum directing the flavor profile. Brown sugar and licorice flavors stick out on the finish.",87,Aljibes 2012 Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"A blend of Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this offers a powerful and rich opening that exudes enduring tones of black spice, dark fruit, leather and tobacco. The palate has a round, chewy consistency, with polished tannins and loads of concentrated fruit.",91,Poggio al Tesoro 2010 Mediterra Red (Toscana)
"Fistfuls of oak, heat and chocolate-covered blackberry form the basis for this hugely ripe, leathery wine that features a sideshow of tannin. Brick and licorice notes fill out the rest of the generously robust package.",87,Pezzi King 2013 Oakey Grande Estate Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"This thin, light effort carries flavors of baby aspirin, or orange candy. It's one dimensional, bearing little varietal character.",83,Bridgeview 2006 Viognier (Southern Oregon)
"Dusty aromas of cocoa, herbs and spice grace prune and plum scents. This is firm, layered and healthy in mouthfeel. Flavors of baked plum, blackberry and mocha finish dry and well balanced. This has more than a few years left in it. Drink through 2023.",92,Bodegas Riojanas 2010 Viña Albina Reserva  (Rioja)
"A lean, edgy wine, which shows bramble fruits, red berries and tense tannins. There's fine structure and, given a few months, the acidity will turn this into a good food wine.",86,Quinta do Gradil 2005 Cortello Syrah (Estremadura)
"Lees, yeast and no discernible fruit aromas make for a faulty nose. This tastes briny, pickled and sour, with notes of rotten fruit.",80,Maximo 2014 Edicion Limitada Viura (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"It's too bad California can't produce more Grenache Blanc, especially along these lines. This is a crisp, dry, layered white complex in almond, honey, green apple and dried apricot tones and tartness. Very dark in color, like an apricot liqueur, but the flavors are fresh and refreshing.",92,Terre Rouge 2011 Grenache Blanc (Sierra Foothills)
"A freshly perfumed wine, very flowery, structured with minerality and freshened by yellow peaches, dried apricots and tight acidity. To drink now, but could age a few more months in bottle.",88,Steininger 2007 Riesling Sekt Riesling (Kamptal)
"Ripe blackberry notes dominate this wine's nose and palate. Their ripe, tart juiciness makes for an appetizing, fruit-driven palate. Smooth but pervaded by freshness, it's a vibrant, juicy blend full of refreshing, ripe fruit. Uncomplicated but delicious.",90,Meinklang 2015 Burgenlandrot Red (Burgenland)
"Dense and meaty up-front, this opens with aromas of mulled berry and savory spices. An almost mean tannic bite on a narrow palate offers little cushion or support, while blackberry, chocolate and mint flavors finish like bricks in the mouth due to fierce tannins. Drink or hold.",88,Dehesa de los Canónigos 2011 Solideo Reserva 25 Meses  (Ribera del Duero)
"Gallo has held this Chard more than 4 years before release; the reason may be an acidic tightness that still dominates the wine. It's deep in mineral-infused apricot and quince fruit. The barrel regimen consisted of 100% new oak. It's a big, absolutely dry, almost rasping wine, and may be one of those rare California Chards capable of aging. See what it does after 2008.",90,Gallo Family Vineyards 2003 Chardonnay (Northern Sonoma)
"Obviously wood aged, this is still a richly fruity wine. The two elements are still coming together, the spice and toast on the one hand, the ripe blackberry on the other. Give the wine time and it will be a good expression of the structure of the vintage. Drink from 2016.",89,Château le Calvaire 2010  Bordeaux Supérieur
"Minty, scratchy aromas of cherry and berry air out well. This feels chewy yet fresh in the mouth, with plum and cherry flavors matched by good overall intensity and balance. A controlled finish tastes dusty and loamy; drink through 2017.",88,Viña Herminia 2010 Crianza  (Rioja)
"A welcome barnyard funk of sour cherry, wet leather and mulched shrubbery kicks off the nose on this wine from the likable Joey Gummere, once know for the Kenneth-Crawford wines. Fennel seed flavors and violet characters emerge on the very pretty palate, which has both tannins and mouth-washing acid on the finish.",91,Transcendence 2012 F Street Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"From a estate in the Marmet family since 1990, the wine has ripe Merlot flavors that give a generous character. Big, bold fruitiness dominates this wine whose structure is firm while smooth. Drink starting from 2019.",87,Château Ségonzac 2014 Vieilles Vignes  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"Made from a majority of Roussanne, the remainder 15% Viognier, this is a savory and herbal white, aromatic in lemon and honey. Dry, with medium-bodied weight, it veers into almond and chamomile flavors, blending seamlessly on the palate before finishing smooth and fresh.",91,Quivira 2013 Roussanne-Viognier (Dry Creek Valley)
"Still tannic and acidic after all these years, this dry Grenache offers a ripe heart of cherries and cherry liqueur. Earns a point or two for elegance. Drink now.",87,Ampelos 2008 Delta Grenache (Sta. Rita Hills)
A Mendocino Sangiovese with odd vanilla notes that's stingy in fruit and tannin.,82,Girasole 2010 Sangiovese (Mendocino)
"Dominated by Viosinho, a grape found more often in the Douro, this wine has a fascinating perfumed character. It's smoky, with white currant and green herbs, and a steely edge that adds to the tight structure of the wine.",88,Quinta de Chocapalha 2011 White (Lisboa)
"The Muscadelle gives a ripe perfumed wine. It is fruity while also full of floral and spice flavors. Made from organically grown grapes, it is crisp and direct, full of apricot and pear flavors. Drinkable now, although it will be better from 2017.",90,Château Tour des Gendres 2014 Conti-ne Périgoudine Parcelle Jeanneton No ZB100 Muscadelle (Bergerac Sec)
"Hints of graphite mark the nose, but this wine is tight and restrained aromatically. Green apple and citrus flavors are crisply defined and tightly focused, ending long, with mouth-tingling acids. Give it another couple of years to develop in the bottle.",90,August Kesseler 2009 Rüdesheim Berg Roseneck Trocken Erstes Gewächs Riesling (Rheingau)
"Ripe tropical fruits star in this opulent, bold wine. The acidity is there, just enough to give this rich wine the support it needs. It is a complete wine—ripe and spicy, just give it some more time. Drink from 2018.",92,Domaine Ferret 2015 Le Clos  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
"Chalk and peach blossoms swirl into an alluring nose on this wine from a biodynamic-minded estate. It's light and airy on the palate, showing flavors of grapefruit and light honey, with brisk acidity and a chalky minerality making for a good, clean, fun wine.",88,Demetria 2013 Estate Viognier (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Light and silky, this packs a real punch in complexity, with layers of raspberry, cherry, cola and sweet oak. There's a mushroom-driven earthiness you might call Burgundian. The tightness suggests aging, possibly over the long haul.",91,Bailiwick 2010 Pinot Noir (Chalone)
"This is becoming a wildly popular offering from the Miller family of Bien Nacido and French Camp fame, and for good reason. Black slate, blackberry and pungent purple fruit power the nose. The palate shows lots of juiciness, but with a plum-peel tang and hints of tobacco. It's not extremely complex, but quite quaffable.",87,Smashberry 2013 Red (Central Coast)
"A grippy, powerfully concentrated wine, this is rich and full bodied in every way. It packs dense heaps of tobacco leaf with tar and baked, almost dried plum. A luxurious, decadent quaff from a Calistoga-based producer, it shows the vintage well.",90,Bennett Lane 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This is the small-production, flagship wine from the Sierra region's best producer of Rhône-style wines. Lovely, spicy, floral aromas and generous, complex and layered flavors make the wine irresistible, while its strong but velvety texture sets it up for a long life in the cellar for those who can resist. It smells lightly oaky, like a cigar box and cocoa, tastes deep and focused on blackberry, pomegranate and dark chocolate. The mouthfeel is both rich and a bit reserved. Best to drink from 2020 to 2030.",96,Terre Rouge 2013 Ascent Syrah (Sierra Foothills)
"Though the vineyard sits at 1,100 feet, hints of tropical fruits give this wine a ripe feel. Pineapple and mango mingle with crisper citrus flavors, yielding a wine that is both fresh and ripe. Drink now.",86,Pierre Merguey 2014 Vielles Vignes  (Viré-Clessé)
"Inky garnet in the glass, this wine offers aromas of black cherry and bell pepper. Fruit, cooling herb and spice flavors coexist peacefully on the palate, with hearty doses of cassis, black cherry, licorice, eucalyptus, chili flakes and bell pepper. Strong but smooth tannins never overcome a nice sense of fruity brightness that lingers on the palate.",90,Galil Mountain 2011 Yiron Red (Upper Galilee)
"From selected, sunny parcels of vines, it's powered by its citrus and pear fruits along with an intensely mineral texture and supreme concentration. It's a Sancerre to keep, still young and gawky, best drunk from 2016.",95,Henri Bourgeois 2012 Jadis  (Sancerre)
"From a site on the edges of Santa Rosa, this vineyard-designate shows a wealth of baked strawberry and is noteworthy for its vibrantly fruity aromatics. Ripe, velvety and lush on the palate, it delivers sensually and deliciously, with a lasting imprint of cola spice on the finish.",93,Siduri 2014 Parsons' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This is pretty much the same blend as Zachary's Ladder, but with higher alcohol and all new French oak. Perhaps the wine is not yet fully resolved, as the gamy Syrah and grippy, tannic Cabernet seem to be butting heads. The broadly displayed red fruits leave a chalky finish.",90,Gorman 2009 The Evil Twin Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"Earthy aromas of white mushroom and dried roses that are characteristic of Tuscan Sangiovese are what you notice first here. The wine then segues to fruit and spice aromas, although those berry notes are on the mature and jammy side. Fresh acidity and firm tannins suggest a pairing with red meat.",87,Vasco Sassetti 2005  Brunello di Montalcino
"Impenetrable upon entry, this tannic wine is leathery on the palate, offering notes of cedar, pencil shavings and tobacco. Big shouldered and full bodied, it's powerfully dense and concentrated.",85,V. Sattui 2012 Cabernet Franc (Alexander Valley)
"Saffron and honey accent juicy tropical mango and pineapple aromas in this vibrant yet delicately framed ice wine. The palate is elegantly nuanced with hints of candle wax, herbs and crushed stone; savory spice notes linger on the finish.",87,Leonard Oakes 2011 Ice Wine Vidal Blanc (New York)
"Made mostly with red grape Nerello Mascalese vinified as a white wine, this conveys a pretty fragrance of wild flower, dried herb and hay. The round palate offers tropical fruit, McIntosh apple, flinty mineral and rosemary alongside energizing acidity.",89,Terrazze dell'Etna 2012 Ciuri  (Etna)
"Despite only 15% new oak, this wine comes across as toasty and caramelly, with delicate touches of pear, honey and wet stones. There's plenty of weight and length, so fans of oaked whites will find plenty to like.",87,Paul Jaboulet Aîné 2007 Les Cèdres White (Châteauneuf-du-Pape)
"Youthfully fruity now, with sweet, jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, licorice, vanilla oak and spices. Comes from the warm, southern part of Salinas Valley. Could develop, but it's a gamble.",87,Scheid Vineyards 2005 Reserve Claret Red (Monterey)
"Tropical-fruit aromas are slightly oily but on target for Verdejo. This wine displays a full, round palate held together by acidity and white-fruit tannins. Lightly salty grapefruit flavors finish moderately long, with citrus overtones. Drink as soon as possible.",89,Marqués de la Concordia 2016 Federico Paternina Verdejo (Rueda)
"Merlot, Cabernet and Syrah form the core of this wildly successful red blend from Ste. Michelle Wine Estates. Soft and juicy, it's packed with flavors of vanilla, pipe tobacco and cola, while keeping the stuffing and structure of a substantial wine. An appealing red blend, especially for consumers new to wine.",86,14 Hands 2011 Hot To Trot Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This holds 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 39% Zinfandel and 1% Petit Verdot. It satisfies in dusty dried cranberry and chocolate components, offering all-around balance with a shot of brawn, the latter most likely from the Cab's birthplace on Howell Mountain.",90,Paraduxx 2011 C Blend Red (Napa Valley)
"Lovely aromas pour from the glass, a heady mix of lime, Asian pear, cucumber and apple. In the mouth some sweet honey pours over the crisp fruit, and the wine feels lush and perfectly melded, despite its youth. Residual sugar is under 2% and the alcohol just 12%.",88,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2009 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is one of Iron Horse's sweeter sparkling wines. There's a sugary edge to the raspberry, strawberry, lime and orange flavors. But it's not too sweet, and there's plenty of balancing acidity. The blend is 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay.",88,Iron Horse 2006 Russian Cuvée Sparkling (Green Valley)
"Underbrush, scorched earth, ripe berry, blue flower and leather aromas take shape in the glass. The full-bodied enveloping palate doles out black cherry marinated in spirits, fleshy raspberry, truffle game and dark baking spice alongside firm, velvety tannins. A licorice note marks the finish. It's evolving quickly and won't need years to come around. Drink 2020–2030.",93,Gigi Rosso 2013 Arione  (Barolo)
"While the initial impression is fruity, the wine then shows almond and spice characters. The texture, is thin and light, like apple juice with taut acidity.",82,Pierre Morey 2010  Bourgogne
"This top tier effort captures all the most distinctive characteristics of good Oregon Pinot Noir. Black cherry fruit, a liberal dash of cola, a touch of sassafras and a dusting of baking spice combine in a burst of flavor. Delicious already, it will drink well for another half decade or longer.",92,Fullerton 2015 Bella Vida Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Castle Rock is one of the most reliable sources of inexpensive Columbia Valley red wines. Ignore the generic label—what's inside the bottle is well-made. Light flavors of black cherry, soft tannins and a finishing flourish of mocha and red apple give this both lift and length.",86,Castle Rock 2011 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Still showing too much wood, this is a wine that needs a lot of time to outgrow its austerity. It's all structure at the moment, with black currant fruit obscured in the background. There is a mineral edge that promises to soften in a few years as well. Drink this wine from 2018.",90,Château Croizet-Bages 2011  Pauillac
"Dry in style and exuberantly fizzy, this fresh, fruity Riesling “secco” (modeled after the Italian Prosecco) offers loads of fresh tangerine, peach and lemon flavors. Bold acidity off sets a lingering finish of soft, foamy mousse. Drink now.",88,Von Schleinitz 2016 Kon-Secco Sparkling (Mosel)
"Spicy plum and cherry aromas are oaky and smell a bit like freshly laid cement. This is more tight and racy than fat or heavy, evidence of a cool vintage. Lightly herbal flavors of currant and plum are spicy and finish with oak-driven notes of toast as well as green olive and pointed acidity. Drink through 2017.",89,San Pedro 2010 1865 Single Vineyard Syrah (Cachapoal Valley)
"You'll find savory blackberry, cherry, currant and cola flavors in this dry blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, as well as smoky, oaky notes. The problem is excessive softness. There's no proper structure, so it all collapses in mid-palate.",85,Boëté 2009 Cheval Rouge Red (Carmel Valley)
"Syrah (40%) takes the lead on this blend with the balance equally split between Grenache and Mourvèdre. Aromas of dried herb, cranberry jam, olive, white pepper, vanilla and dill lead to bold full fruit flavors that hold nothing back. Barrel notes—at times a bit predominant—are speckled throughout.",89,Colter's Creek 2013 Arrow Rim G-S-M (Idaho)
"There is a distinct barnyard aroma to this wine. The palate seems more clean, and it offers firm, red berry fruits and tannins. A blend of Trincadeira, Aragones and Alicante Bouschet, this is fruity and structured.",86,Julian Reynolds 2009 Tinto Real Red (Alentejano)
"Fruity, floral and calm on the nose, with nothing aggressive or out of place. The palate is deep, flush and offers great mouthfeel, while the flavors run toward big, juicy berry, cassis and chocolate. Like most Catena high-enders, this Cabernet-Malbec blend features a toasty finish of coffee and mocha, and overall it's stylish and impressive. Drink now through 2014.",93,Bodega Catena Zapata 2006 Nicolas Catena Zapata Red (Mendoza)
"This is a sleek, streamlined and very dry red wine. It's not big and rich, but it is elegantly crafted, with no flaws to mar the acidity and finely ground tannins. The flavors, of cherries, anise and dried herbs, are complex.",87,Lang & Reed 2008 Cabernet Franc (North Coast)
"This dark-hued wine is still very closed and firm. Dark chocolate and licorice flavors are prominent against a backdrop of black fruit, hinting at the wine's considerable wood aging. It does have great weight and richness, so let it develop and drink from 2017.",93,La Bastide Blanche 2010 Cuvée Estagnol Mourvèdre (Bandol)
"Aromas of wild flowers, honey, lychee and oily citrus fruits announce a minerally palate with steely yet tropical flavors of citrus and lychee. This is better cut than most, with racy acidity that keeps things running on the finish. Drink now.",89,El Esteco 2014 Don David Reserve Torrontés (Calchaquí Valley)
"Crafted from the oldest vines in one of the oldest vineyards in the Walla Walla Valley, this displays lovely aromatics of leaf, herb, earth and wild berry. Tight and contained, it opens into a focused, lively wine with great acidity. It has the potential to age well for a decade or more.",92,Seven Hills 2010 Seven Hills Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (OR))
"Firm and tartly wound, with cassis and black cherry at the core of a young, stiffly tannic, Cabernet-based blend. Black fruits are nuanced with earth and olive, smoke and graphite, all subtle but definitely in view.",90,Seven Hills 2008 Planing Mill Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"From vineyards close to Juliénas, this is a bright wine full of cherry juice and fresh acidity. It does have a sense of structure with a background of tannins and minerality that will allow it to age, although it is delicious now.",86,Domaine des Mouilles 2014  Beaujolais-Villages
"Merlot makes up half of this blend, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Petit Verdot. Vanilla, pencil shaving and woodspice predominate on the nose and palate.",87,Mercer 2012 Reserve Cavalie Red (Horse Heaven Hills)
"This is the high-elevation Kimmeridgian soil interpretation of Viognier at the Lagrézette estate from enologist Claude Boudamani with consultant Michel Rolland. Despite its high alcohol, it is restrained and serious with structured fruits and a sense of balanced power. The fruits, apricots and white peach sing harmoniously with the pepper and spice from wood aging. Drink from 2017.",92,Château Lagrézette 2014 Le Pigeonnier White Vision Viognier (Côtes du Lot)
This wine comes from the heart of the Dão region. It is firm and dark with tannins and a concentrated texture. Fine acidity cuts through the black-fruit character. The wine is ready to drink.,87,Caves da Montanha 2010 Vinha do Poeta Red (Dão)
"Somewhat tough initially, with the tannins coming before the fruit, and a distinctly lean character. But this is deceptive, because there is certainly enough fruit there to give richness after two years' aging, when the blackberry and licorice flavors will come up through all that dryness.",89,Casa de Santar 2004 Red (Dão)
"Savory oak aromas and related spice notes blend with earthy berry scents. This wine has a racy mouthfeel tempered by creamy oak. Woody, spicy, earthy flavors of berry fruits and tomato conclude with a note of vanilla on a traditional Rioja-style finish.",88,Vallobera 2015 Reserva  (Rioja)
"There's a toothpasty sweetness to this Zin, like a raspberry mint candy. Also odd is that it's already throwing significant sediment even though it's still a young wine. Eccentric, but it has its charms.",84,Saini 2011 Old Vine Pear Block Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"I might have thought there was oak on this wine, it's so rich and vanilla-smoky, but there isn't. Just goes to show. It's dramatic in rich peach, fig, date and ripe green melon, but where does all that butterscotch and crème brûlée come from? The grapes come from a single Beckstoffer-owned vineyard in Rutherford.",90,Broman 2005 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"This wine offers nice balance between the ripe-fruit tones of pear and green-apple and the green, stemmy herb and grass notes. There are subtle smoke and spice accents that unfold on the finish, following a plush mouthfeel that's enlivened by bright citrus tones. Drink now.",86,Fat Barrel 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Stellenbosch)
"This blend of two types of Garnacha and some Carignan is a consistently top performer from this Catalonian region. This edition smells reedy and spicy, but also like ripe plum and raisin. A generous balanced palate holds flavors of vanilla, plum, cherry and peppery spice. On the finish, this is composed in feel, dry and spicy. Drink through 2019.",90,Edetària 2014 Selecció Garnacha (Terra Alta)
"A two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, one-third Merlot blend, this is the winery’s prestige cuvée. Lushly perfumed with blueberry, black cherry and red fruits, it’s high-toned and assertive. A serious effort that is still tight as a drum, tannic and deeply streaked with black spices, smoke, tar and coffee.",92,Hedges 1997 Red Mountain Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Subdued aromas recalling grilled herb, orange peel and a hint of freshly picked rose come together on this. The palate offers sour cherry, mint and licorice alongside fine-grained tannins that leave a firm, rather astringent finish.",88,Renato Ratti 2012 Marcenasco  (Barolo)
"Vanilla, cedar and plum notes benefit from a dusting of cracked pepper in this medium-bodied dry red. The tannins are supple to the point of creaminess, and the finish warm and spicy. Drink now.",88,2 Up 2014 Shiraz (South Australia)

"This high-altitude, Chehalem Mountains vineyard puts on a show with this 2012. A sweet chocolate and cherry nose unfolds into a complex, elegant and beautifully proportioned wine, with blackberry, mineral and baking spice components. The lingering finish promises even better things to come if you give it another six to eight years in the cellar. Drink 2015 through 2025.",94,Lemelson 2012 Chestnut Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This wine's incredibly distinct nose of pure fruit shows plump raspberries alongside delicate grapeseed, a pinch of baking spice and a whiff of yeast. Though the wine is light in color and frame, the palate shows lots of earth, tobacco smoke, cherry pits, bouquet garni and rosemary, with refreshing wild berry fruit.",94,Thomas Fogarty 2012 Will's Cabin Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"With residual sugar of 22.4%, this dessert wine has fantastically sweet flavors of apricot jam, tangerine marmalade, gingersnap cookie, vanilla and crème brûlée, balanced with crisp acidity. The alcohol is a refreshingly low 9.8%.",92,Williams Selyem 2006 Saralee's Vineyard Cluster Select Late Harvest Gewürztraminer (Russian River Valley)
"Truffle, new leather and plum are some of the aromas you'll find in this taut red. The palate delivers Morello cherry, crushed raspberry, star anise and earthy game flavors, set against bright acidity and tightly wound tannins. Drink 2018–2023.",90,La Ciarliana 2013  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano
"Spicy woody aromas include a note of mushroom. This feels hard and ultratannic, with acidity suggestive of red-wine vinegar. A wiry mix of salt and sour flavors is attached to savory plum fruit, while this pinches down on a drying abrasive finish.",88,Don Manuel Villafañe 2014 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Blue flowers, dark berry and allspice aromas unfold in the glass. The palate offers black currant, black cherry, peppercorn and espresso alongside drying, angular tannins.",87,Il Fitto 2013 Sangiovese (Cortona)
"There's a mysteriously attractive aromatic profile to this winery's top-end Syrah bottling, with violet perfume blending into blueberry syrup, anise and spearmint. The flavors are bold but not over the top, with lavender, dried berry leather and espresso combining into a seriously memorable wine.",92,Stolpman 2012 Angeli Syrah (Ballard Canyon)
"Red cherry fruit, with edges of white pepper, plays charmingly on both the nose and palate. The svelte figure of the wine belies its depth: this has subtle, Burgundian virtues and earthy undertones that provoke stimulating conversation and thought. An ideal accompaniment for subtle, nuanced dishes or a really good book.",92,Prieler 2010 Blaufränkisch (Leithaberg)
"Too sweet and oaky, with sugary vanilla and pineapple jam flavors. Could be a Starbucks drink. Saved a bit by crisp acidity.",84,Starmont 2008 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"The Cesari family has perfected its formula for achieving pure pleasure in liquid form. This is superstar Amarone, with loads of chewy, ripe fruit, decadent dark chocolate, leather, moist pipe tobacco and candied raspberry flavors. Even with all of the richness, extraction and deliciousness, this is an elegant wine. Drink after 2018.",94,Cesari 2006 Il Bosco  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"This wine is named for the four Sullivan brothers, one of whom makes the Benovia wines and another who makes this wine, among others. A clear labor of love, this small-production Chardonnay is well tended to. A sweetness of honeysuckle opens on the nose, followed by a depth of vanilla oak and stony minerality, the acidity fresh and bright.",92,Grey Stack 2014 Four Brothers Vineyard Chardonnay (Bennett Valley)
"Immediately, you know you are before a great Brunello with bright fruit aromas backed by forest floor, balsam notes, bramble, blue flowers, red apple and mint. The presence of wood is all but invisible and the wine sings true to its territory and tradition. The wine's natural acidity and intensity promise a long and glorious aging future before it.",96,Biondi Santi 2001 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Horsey berry aromas join forces with molasses, vanilla and graphite. Ripped with power, this Malbec's tartaric acidity is amplified and scratchy. Baked plum, blackberry and vanilla flavors end with abrasive residual acidity that creates length but also edginess. Drink through 2021.",91,SignoSeis 2012 The Angel Oak Celestial Barrel Fermented Malbec (Valle de Uco)
"This kitchen-sink blend of Merlot, Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Cabernet Franc proves more herbaceous than ripe on the nose, with dried and chopped oregano and thyme, wet slate and cigar box notes. It's all earth and stone on the palate, with just a touch of stark plum fruit emerging.",88,Joullian NV Retro Rouge Red (Carmel Valley)
"The lightest wine in the range of wines produced at Château du Cèdre, this is dominated by sweet, soft red fruit. Attractive, bright and fruity, this is ready for drinking now.",86,Château du Cèdre 2011 Cedrus Malbec
"This is toasty and overflowing with wild berry and cassis aromas. The palate is tight and tannic, with salty berry fruit flavors that seem wild and untamed. Stays salty on the finish, with herbal notes sneaking in. It smells great, but it's rough in terms of feel.",88,Marques de Griñon 2007 Caliza Syrah & Petit Verdot Red (Dominio de Valdepusa)
"A creamy textured, citrus-flavored wine that is ripe and smooth. It has a crisp fresh character with its lemon and ripe melon fruit and bright acidity.

"Three-plus years in the bottle have been kind to this Pinot, letting the parts meld together. The oak is knitting with the cherry, raspberry and cola fruit, resulting in a creamy-sweet mouthfeel. Very nice, and should hold over the next 4–6 years.",91,Artesa 2007 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"This wine shows a high degree of spiciness with a rose petal-like flourish—a stellar first effort from a new estate vineyard along Eastside Road. Brambly raspberry and dark cherry flavors seem brushed by a subtle waft of campfire smoke and molten chocolate, all swirling together in the glass as a lengthy, lively palate framed by acidity.",96,Williams Selyem 2014 Lewis MacGregor Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Fresh apple and white floral notes meld effortlessly into an elegant vanilla note on the nose and palate of this dry, full-bodied Chard. Nicely concentrated, yet brisk with acidity, it's an excellent food pairing companion.",86,Rosehall Run 2008 Rosehall Vineyard Chardonnay (Prince Edward County)
"The very intriguing nose of this bottling by a winery that explores all types of Pinot Noir sites and styles shows sarsaparilla, sandalwood, incense and fresh boysenberry aromas. The palate is all about freshness, with blackberry and black raspberry flavors lifted by anise, peppercorns and wild thyme. Great depth and verve throughout.",94,Tantara 2015 Zotovich Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"This refreshing rosé, just slightly dilute, brings watermelon and strawberry with a touch of minerality. It's a blend of saignée and whole-cluster-pressed wine, aged half in steel and half in neutral wood.",87,Fullerton 2016 Three Otters Pinot Noir Rosé (Willamette Valley)
"With perfumed black-currant and damson fruitiness, this is a juicy wine. That freshness contrasts with a firm texture, chocolate and smoky flavors and a tannic aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",86,Quinta da Lapa 2014 Reserva Syrah (Tejo)

"Soft and almost sweet in jammy, pie-filling raspberries and cherries. It's luxuriously soft and silky, with polished tannins, and lots of people will love it. Would benefit from greater depth and complexity, but it sure is lovely. Drink now.",90,Costa de Oro 2008 Gold Coast Vineyard Reserva Oro Rojo Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"Made using fruit sourced from the high-elevation Haute-Serre estate, this wine is surprisingly elegant despite the high alcohol. It has a fresh blackberry flavor, with acidity that's balanced by the stewed-fruit richness. The tarry texture and firm tannins all promise long-term aging.",93,Georges Vigouroux 2009 Cuvée Icône du Château de Haute-Serre Malbec (Cahors)
"A gold color indicates maturation, while loud, tropical fruit aromas fold in lychee, citrus blossom and sweat. The palate is electric due to citric acidity, while flavors of orange, tangerine, lemon-lime and grapefruit finish with a chalky feel.",82,Acordeón 2011 Torrontés (Cafayate)
"A heavy, powerful wine, with very concentrated tannins. Flavors of licorice, bitter chocolate and black plums give a sense of richness and opulence. Still young, the aromas are yeasty, but these should open up for a rich, dense wine.",90,Quinta do Noval 2005 Cedro do Noval Red (Douro)
"A big, bold and rich Port that is smooth and very plush with a velvet feel. The style is ripe and rounded, a delicious medley of jammy fruits and soft tannins.",88,Fonseca NV Ruby  (Port)
"Consistent with the mediocre 2006. This amounts to generic red wine in a catchy, youthful package. It offers basic raspberry and strawberry aromas and flavors along with scouring acidity. It's bouncy and free-flowing, but hardly what we'd call an elevated premium wine.",82,Hat in the Ring 2007 Ring Master Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Softly layered, this ripe, bold wine shows a wealth of body and complexity. The ripeness will please for its interwoven notions of Dr Pepper, black-cherry jam and black pepper, its tannins leathery and full of bravado.",95,Macauley 2013 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Some lovely red wines are coming from the Montecucco wine region (located in coastal Tuscany) and Collemassari leads the pack of this new and exciting group of vintners. Soft cherry, leather, spice, and earthy mineral tones create harmony and momentum.",91,Collemassari 2007 Riserva  (Montecucco)
"This structured red features aromas of tilled soil and ripe berry. The palate delivers violet, mature black cherry, crushed berry and ground white pepper alongside smooth, polished tannins. It's ripe and ready, so enjoy soon.",89,Fattoria Le Pupille 2011 Riserva  (Morellino di Scansano)
"The core of the “K” range, this wine shows its wood and tannins right up front. It's certainly powerful, with a sense of concentrated black fruits behind the firm and dry structure. A dark and brooding wine, this has enormous potential, so give it at least six years.",93,Clos Troteligotte 2011 K Malbec (Cahors)
"Full-throttle Chardonnay, creamy and opulent, showing lemon custard, orange honey, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors, brightened with crisp, zesty acidity. Exceptionally rich and balanced, it's a beautiful wine for pairing with shellfish entrées.",93,Stonestreet 2009 Gravel Bench Chardonnay (Alexander Valley)

"Quite pale and pink in color, this wine has more flavor and body than the color would suggest. It blends cherry and ripe pear notes on a smooth mouth-filling texture that clings to the palate and extends the finish.",87,Yorba 2016 Shake Ridge Vineyards Rosado (Amador County)
"Pure purple fruit aromas arise on the nose of this bottling by pioneer Fred Brander, as do heady cocoa, leather and herb-crusted beef roast scents. Fresh black currant and espresso cream flavors show on the palate, with a chalky tannic structure that steadily reveals more layers of flavor, from blackberry to dried dill.",90,Brander 2013 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Le Bruciate Riserva offers bright aromatic nuances of cola, root beer and a touch of shaved ginger backed by loads of black fruit and smooth spice. The wine shows great personality and persistency.",90,Canneta 2005 Le Bruciate Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"From the folks at Merryvale, this is a blend of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Syrah and Petite Sirah. Big, dense and juicy, with a dusty tannic underbite, it's bold, brambly and exuberantly delicious.",92,Forward Kidd 2012 Red (Napa Valley)
"Aromas of underbrush, leather, flint, wild berry and a balsamic note mingle in the glass. The structured palate delivers dried cherry, crushed raspberry, grilled herb and anise alongside firm, fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity. Hold for additional complexity; drink 2018–2035.",95,Ferrando 2010 Black Label  (Carema)
"Plump and sweet, this corpulent kabinett features aromas and flavors of honey, tangerine and melon, with just the vaguest hints of slatey minerality. A hint of bitterness on the finish helps balanace some of the weight and sugar. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",86,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch) 2006 Bernkasteler Badstube Kabinett Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer)
"Zesty and tongue prickling, this is fresh, fruity and ready to drink. It has a sugar sweety character which is tempered by acidity and a touch of red currant.",83,Mapreco 2014 Rosé (Vinho Verde)
"Touches of honey, saffron and spice lend warmth and suppleness to this dry, exceptionally brisk Riesling. It's a bit lean on the palate, but vivaciously fresh, finishing on a deliciously astringent bite of lime pith.",89,Domdechant Werner 2013 Hochheimer Trocken Riesling (Rheingau)
"This blend of Grenache, Petite Sirah and Mourvèdre is fighting (and winning) above its weight (price) class. Tarry, gritty, asphalt-like aromas blend with smoky berry notes to form an inviting bouquet. The palate is round and juicy in feel, with herbal, minty red-berry flavors and a deep, flush finish that's showing a high level of complexity. Drink through 2018.",92,Bodega Volcanes de Chile 2011 Tectonia Red (Central Valley)
"Aromas of black plum, raspberry and sage set the stage for flavors of black cherry, raspberry, nutmeg and clove. There's a nice sense of spice piggybacking on luscious fruit, while strong but not overpowering tannins fill the palate and gently subside into a soft savory finish.",91,Montefiore 2013 Aria Reserve Red (Judean Hills)
"There's a delicate hint of toasted spice that lends depth to the yellow apple and melon fruit core of this wine. The well-balanced palate offers ripe fruit flavors and medium acidity, while hints of orange peel and toast linger softly on the close. Drink now.",88,Painted Wolf 2015 The Den Chenin Blanc (Swartland)
"Hints of lanolin and honeycomb accent bright lemon zest and grapefruit aromas on this dry, yet intensely juicy Riesling. On the palate, squirts of yuzu and lime add tang to pristine honeydew flavors. Finishes moderately long with a murmur of wet stones and crushed minerals.",89,August Kesseler 2012 Rüdesheim Trocken Riesling (Rheingau)
"A very great success, although it is expensive. Shows perfect Dry Creek Zinny character, with briary, brambly wild forest berry fruit, cola and spices, and a savory note of grilled meat. The finish is dry and balanced. More than half the oak barrels were new French, giving the wine a rich coat of toast. Drink this beauty now and over the next eight years.",94,Ledson 2007 Reserve Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"A fine vein of graphite extends through this bold yet refined Bordeaux-style red. It's robustly fruity, bursting with cranberry, red cherry and raspberry flavors, but enticingly savory as well, nuanced by hints of leather and balsamic vinegar. Dense tannins should smooth out between 2018 and 2020.",90,Benmarl 2014 Slate Hill Red (New York)
"Shows Petite Sirah's rustic, tannic nature, with a robust body housing flavors of berries, currants, carob powder, crisp bacon and sandalwood. With its sweet finish, it doesn't seem like a longterm ager, but will mellow over the next several years.",85,Bardessono 2008 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley)
"Fresh and fruity, this is a refreshing, lively rosé. It is dry with strawberry flavors and a crisp acidity on the finish. Drink now.",86,Bott Frères NV Rosé Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"This wine comes from the Niven family, whose winemaker Christian Roguenant enjoys pushing varietal boundaries. Lively and vivacious, aromas suggest jasmine tea, lime, green pear and wet cement minerality. The palate blends the welcoming flavors of orange blossoms with cut-grass herbaciousness and chalky minerals.",88,Tangent 2014 Paragon Vineyard Albariño (Edna Valley)
"Hints of tart redcurrant have a softenting creamy edge. The palate fizzes with tiny bubbles that disperse the red-fruited, creamy tartness across the palate. A lovely touch of white pepper and enduring, beautiful briskness brightens everything from the first sip to the last echo of flavor on the lip-smacking finish. It's fresh, mouthfilling and exuberant.",92,Camel Valley 2014 Rosé Brut Pinot Noir (England)
"Shows a bit more age than its vintage might indicate with notes of dried cranberries and cherries accented by cinnamon and vanilla. The light fruit flavors are a mixture of sweet and tart with dry, chalky tannins.",86,Frenchman's Gulch 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington)
"Full, ripe and creamy, an unctuous Chardonnay from one of the largest private estates in France. The wine features melon, a line of citrus and pure, bright acidity. Screwcap.",88,Domaine du Tariquet 2009 Chardonnay (Vin de Pays des Côtes de Gascogne)
"Sourced from the Boushey Vineyard, this includes 10% Roussanne. One-third was barrel-fermented, resulting in an especially rich mouthfeel, with a lush core of melon, tangerine, pineapple, papaya and citrus flavors. It has excellent length and power.",91,Two Vintners 2011 Grenache Blanc (Yakima Valley)
This Zin is rich with flavors of liqueur and spice with a suggestion of Dr. Pepper. Let this Zin open a bit in the glass. It's softly textured on the finish with a taste of raspberry and vanilla.,86,Borjón 2010 Reposado Zinfandel (Shenandoah Valley (CA))
"Here's a toasty, rich blend of various grapes including Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Nero and Refosco that shows well evolved aromas of spice, dusty mineral, candied fruit, plum and prune. It shows firm, smooth texture and would pair with meatloaf or roast beef.",87,Montelvini 2002 El Zuiter Red (Delle Venezie)
"This is a sophisticated Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated, Bordeaux-style blend, with 9% Merlot, 5% Petit Verdot and 5% Malbec. It carries a note of leather and drying tannins, suggesting that you should drink it fairly soon. It should be delicious with a grilled steak.",87,Roza Ridge 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rattlesnake Hills)
"Italy's most iconic sparkler, this is made entirely from Chardonnay and aged on its lees for at least 10 years. Layers of flavors include yeasty sensations of baked bread, pastry cream, honey, vanilla, juicy pear and candied lemon peel. It has depth and complexity, with an ultrafine mousse that enhances the creamy texture. Drink through 2020.",93,Ferrari 2002 Giulio Ferrari Riserva del Fondatore Chardonnay (Trento)
"Young and tight, this new release from a founding Oregon viticulture family already shows good balance in a smooth, buttery, somewhat oaky style. The fruit flavors coat the tongue and roll into the seductive barrel notes. Let this bottle age until early 2016 and it will really shine.",90,Knudsen 2013 Chardonnay (Dundee Hills)
"Generic apple aromas are short on intensity and length. This tastes of melon but not much more. A light, dilute finish with bready flavor notes ensures that this is O.K. for easy quaffing.",84,Tololo 2014 Chardonnay (Maule Valley)
"Minty and sharp in acidity, and not offering much richness now, especially at this price, although it does feel stylishly dry and elegant. Shows proper cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors.",86,Sonoma-Cutrer 2007 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Rubizzo is a fantastic value wine that is simple and concrete but also bright, cheerful and fruit-forward. The cherry tones are plump and mature and the wine feels softly round on the close.",88,Rocca delle Macìe 2008 Rubizzo Sangiovese (Toscana)
"A vanilla bean element leads the nose on this wine, with cherry, olallieberry and caramel syrup coming in as well. The palate isn't quite so delicious, with the vanilla flavors remaining alongside woody elements, purple fruits and black olives.",86,Clavo Cellars 2010 Dreamer Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)
"Packaged in a fun screwcap bottle, this easy Primitivo opens with bitter almond and cherry flavors, followed by crisp fruit and citrus freshness. It would pair with grilled pork chops.",84,Cortenova 2010 Primitivo (Salento)

"Angular plum and berry aromas are rubbery. This Syrah feels wide and blocky, but solid. Black-fruit flavors finish with drawing tannins and a shot of black coffee.",86,Alta Cima 2013 Speical Edition Reserva Syrah (Lontué Valley)
"An appetizing mix of oatmeal and tart apple fills the nose. The fizzy palate boosts apple and rhubarb flavors and spells total refreshment and verve. These notions are underpinned by soft, biscuity notes of autolysis, always circling back to juicy, crisp apple. If you want refreshment, look no further.",89,Digby Fine English NV Brut Sparkling (England)
"Hard and extracted, this wine shows little more than tannins. The fruitiness is hard to discern and may never come through.",83,Château Penin 2011 Les Cailloux  (Bordeaux Supérieur)
"Incorporating 30% of the variety in Musqué clone, this wine offers fresh flavors of green apple, grass and pea shoots, as well as a distinct notion of oak. Aged in both new and neutral Acacia, as well as stainless, it has a spicy quality akin to lemongrass that lingers on the finish.",86,Tamber Bey 2016 Lizzy's Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Oakville)
"Oak aromas ride high on a ripe, smoky nose that's pumped full of black-fruit scents. This is a chewy, dense style of Cabernet with thick, rubbery tannins.

"Made with 70% Sangiovese, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot, this has aromas of red plum and a whiff of cinnamon. The rather lean palate offers strawberry and vanilla along with a smoky finish. Enjoy soon.",87,Fattoria Montellori 2013 Moro Red (Toscana)
"Here's a classic and fresh interpretation of Chianti Classico that is light and crisp without being too thin or sharp. In fact, ripe fruit tones of blueberry and cassis do a nice job of smoothing out the overall effect.",88,Querciavalle 2006 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"Super light in color, this Garnacha has a pretty nose of cassis liqueur and is bunny-soft with barely any tannic imprint at all. Pair with equally light fare like not-too-pungent cheeses, breadsticks and such, or drink while cooking the main meal.",85,Riaza 2011 Garnacha (Clements Hills)
"Granular and punchy upfront, with heat and animal fur aromas on the nose. Settles with airing, revealing a heavy but solid palate with plenty of oak and candied red-fruit flavors. Falls off on the finish, with mint, resin and herbal notes.",85,Cueva de las Manos 2010 Reserve Malbec (Mendoza)
"A plump, amply concentrated Riesling, with plenty of pineapple fruit to balance the hints of kerosene, slate and lime. Finishes crisp and clean, with a dry quality that invites another sip. Drink now.",88,Von Buhl 2005 Armand Kabinett Riesling (Pfalz)
"A blend of two parcels of vines in Meursault, this is an impressive wine that's equal in quality to a Premier Cru. Full and ripe, the palate boasts flavors of apples, peaches and green plums, but maintains an elegant character throughout. Age this fine wine and drink from 2016.",93,Patrick Javillier 2011 Cuvée Tête de Murger  (Meursault)
"Black cherry, chipped slate and cola notes lavish the nose on this top-end bottling of best barrels from the single-vineyard specialist. The palate offers much more depth, with ripe alpine strawberry, black plum skins and blackberry fruit, all seasoned by crushed nutmeg and shaved juniper.",93,Testarossa 2013 Niclaire Pinot Noir (California)
"A touch blossomy against a core of ripe raspberry and cherry perfume, the nose on this traditional-method Pinot Noir sparkler is particularly alluring. The palate is elegant and fresh, marked by fine, mouthfilling mousse and delicate raspberry-candy finish.",89,Macari 2010 Cuvée Gabriella Brut Rosé Sparkling (North Fork of Long Island)
"Would have benefited from being held back a year or so longer before release, but you can compensate by cellaring it. Dry, very full-bodied for a Pinot Noir and rich in tannins, it shows robust blackberry and black cherry flavors. Should mellow and improve after 2015 or so.",90,Roar 2010 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"The understated but alluring perfume of ripe pear peel leads the nose of this wine. Its concentrated body has the lovely, peppery, yeasty midpalate feel that we always hope for in Grüner. Subtle, light, savory and fresh, it finishes dry and zesty.",91,Nigl 2016 Freiheit Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"More aromatically restrained than its Oak Ridge Vineyard counterpart, the Atavus Vineyard wine brings notes of rose petal, herbs, lees and spice. The palate is textured with tremendous energy and tension to the fruit and savory flavors as they dance and tussle toward a long, graceful finish.",91,Analemma 2012 Atavus Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Columbia Gorge (WA))
"With rich cherry fruits and a firmer underlying structure, this is a dense wine. It is still fresh and fruity but has also developed a broad, generous feel that gives weight. It is ready to drink.",90,Château des Gimarets 2011  Moulin-à-Vent
"From one of the most beautiful vineyards in Valdobbiadene with decades-old vines that show their twisted and contorted trunks, this pretty Prosecco Superiore delivers feminine notes of freshly chopped sage and yellow rose.",88,Ruggeri & C. 2011 Vecchie Viti Brut  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Rui Reguinga, named Portugal's Winemaker of the Year in 2009, produces this sumptuous wine. The fruit is rich, with jammy berries and plums, balanced with spice from wood aging. The core of tannins suggests a powerful wine that will age well.",94,Quinta do Quetzal 2007 Reserva Red (Alentejano)
"Rather lean in flavors, it shows a bit of herbal, savory aromas and tastes slightly earthy and vegetal like fennel or celery. But those aspects are subtle enough that it still makes a good sturdy white wine that is neither too rich nor too soft.",84,Pennywise 2013 Chardonnay (California)
"Attractive and complex aromas like dried figs and lemon meringue fade to leaner, crisper flavors suggesting green apple and white peach in this light-bodied, well-balanced wine. It's best to drink after 2018 when it will have opened up to more richness.",89,Domaine Anderson 2014 Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Anderson Valley)
"If you know Elqui, than this funky wine's murky, stewy, muddy aromas won't come as a shock. In the mouth, this is soft and mushy, with little to no noticeable acidity. Flavors of burnt leaves and stalky berry fruits offer minimal punch, while the finish tastes stewy and rooty, which is nothing unusual for northerly Elqui.",83,Elqui Wines 2013 Limited Release Pinot Noir (Elqui Valley)
"Riper and richer than some standard RDDs, with aromas of tomato, raisin, maple and blackberry. The palate is ripe and grabby, with serious tannins and structure to frame dark fruit, chocolate and brown sugar flavors. A full and positive wine that has restraint. Will settle in the bottle and should be at its best come late 2008/early 2009.",88,Monte Negro 2006  Ribera del Duero
"Good, deeply extracted flavors in this darkly soft wine, with blackberries, plums and spicy, chocolaty chai tea. It's nicely dry. The tannins are a little off, with some ragged, green edges that won't age away, so drink now.",86,Niner 2007 Bootjack Ranch Merlot (Paso Robles)
"It opens with intense aromas of tropical fruit, green apples and a note of Mediterranean herbs. The juicy palate delivers white peach, pear, banana, papaya and almond alongside bright acidity that leaves a clean, refreshing finish. Drink now through 2016.",90,Ca' Lojera 2013  Lugana
"Crisp in the nose, with nuances of graham cracker, menthol, mushroom and herbs. Those herbal notes carry into the flavor profile and mix with plum and oak. It opens up a little and becomes fairly friendly on the finish, where the tannins are medium.",88,B.R. Cohn 1997 Olive Hill Estate Vyds Special Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley)
"A 80-20 blend of Cabernet and Corvina (a native grape of northern Italy), this refreshing red wine opens with a lively ruby color and simple aromas of berry fruit and red rose petal. Pair this wine with picnic foods such as grilled sausage or hamburger.",84,Duca del Frassino 2009 Cabernet and Corvina 3 liter BIB Red (Venezie)
"Freshly sliced apple aromas make a refreshing start for this crisp, mineral and citrus-laden wine. Its acidity is upfront, calling for food. It has a zesty texture and a further kick of acidity at the end.",86,Jean Perrier et Fils 2016 Abymes Cuvée Gastronomie Jacquère (Savoie)
Lifted cedar and pine notes interspersed with appealing woodsy scents give way to a surprisingly intense palate that shows some nice peppery notes but ultimately falls short on the finish. Nearly imperceptible tannins suggest early consumption.,85,Angove's 2006 Red Belly Black Shiraz (South Australia)
"Dried oregano and sage notes lend a dusty, savory tone to the nose of this racy, light-bodied kabinett. The palate, by contrast, surprises with layers of lush, ripe tropical fruit cut with a razor's edge of acidity and lime zest. Finishes snappy and bright.",90,Maximin Grünhäuser 2012 Herrenberg Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"Bright aromas of apricot, pear, lavender and jasmine capture the senses while the richly sweet stone fruit flavors also bring pleasure. The concentration and acid don't entirely match up but there's still much to enjoy.",86,Washington Hills 2013 Late Harvest Riesling (Washington)
"There's a layer of sweetness to this viscous wine, which exudes aromas of graham cracker and pear, finishing in a light coating of lemon.",85,Pangloss Cellars 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County)
"Rich and juicy with aromas of preserved peach, fresh apple and even a hint of berries, this Riesling is dry in style, yet remarkably forward with fruit. The palate is bright, with zesty lemon-lime acidity that lingers on a medium-long finish.",88,Atwater 2011 Dry Estate Vineyards Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Quince and pear fruits dominate this off-dry wine. It has a hint of honey, its ripe fruit pierced with acidity. A great wine as an apéritif or to go with cold cuts.",90,Domaine de la Rouletière 2010 Demi-sec  (Vouvray)
"Aromas of apricot, honey and vanilla give this dessert wine a luscious start. On the palate, balanced, creamy flavors of citrus, fruit and honey linger. Full but not cloying, the wine will pair well with creamy cheeses.",85,Jackson-Triggs 2007 Icewine Vidal Blanc (Niagara Peninsula)
"Pear and apple aromas are light and oaky but nothing out of the ordinary. A creamy palate is just vital enough, while woody flavors of barrel spice run side by side with peach and melon notes. A clean, mild finish provides for a good ending.",86,MontGras 2014 Reserva Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley)
"Darker and earthier than most basic Garnachas, with aromas of compost, baked earth, crusty black fruits and leather. The palate has a nice, ripe, bodied feel, while flavors of blackberry and boysenberry bring just the slightest hint of herbal green. Toasty and solid on the finish.",86,El Burro 2008 Kickass Garnacha (Cariñena)
"This wine is dry and smoky, with tannins that will allow it to age. The fruit, though, only hints at red berry fruits and should be more developed for a simple appellation wine such as this. Drink from 2017.",87,Château de Santenay 2012 Vieille Vignes  (Bourgogne)
"This tastes like an alcoholic fruit drink with apricot, orange and mango flavors. Still, it's clean and pleasant.",83,Jenica Peak 2011 Coastal Series Chardonnay (California)
"Firm and fragrant, this opens with scents of violet, iris, ripe plum and sweet baking spice. The chewy palate delivers dried plum, ripe black cherry, white pepper, anise and clove while fine-grained, polished tannins provide support.",91,Panzanello 2011 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
Grapy candied berry aromas mix with loud oak that smells like clove and mint. This has a narrow astringent mouthfeel and strange-tasting berry flavors that end with a rugged finish.,83,Quattrocchi 2013 Malbec (Mendoza)
"This full-bodied white opens with aromas of white rose, honeysuckle, lychee and a whiff of nutmeg. The rich palate has a silky texture, delivering apricot, white peach and a confectionery note.",89,St. Pauls 2015 Passion Gewürztraminer (Alto Adige)
"Made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon grapes, followed by Merlot and a curious 1% of Sauvignon Blanc, this penny-colored wine is herbal in jalapeño and not terribly fruit-forward. It's extremely low in terms of alcohol and finishes diluted.",83,Delectus 2014 Rosé (Knights Valley)
An initial blast of hot summer field and nepeta muddles the clarity of the nose. This is a bit flat and lacking in verve. Flavors of apricot and nectarine turn pithy on the finish.,86,Pazo de Galegos 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"This blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon with 40% Merlot is youthfully exuberant and full of life. Plum aromas lead into pencil and clove, the fruit at first subdued in order to make way for the complexity of savory seasonings. Ready to enjoy, it packs a refined punch of leather on the finish.",90,Taken Wine Co. 2013 Red (Napa Valley)
"Bracingly tart, almost to the verge of tasting sour, this blend of grapes from several Dundee Hills vineyards has cool vintage flavors of spiced apple and rhubarb. The acids rule, suggesting that it be paired with fatty fish like salmon.",87,J. Christopher 2011 Dundee Hills Cuvée Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"This wine has a bitter edge to it, although attractive fruit lies underneath. It is juicy, packed with red fruits and acidity, although that surface bitterness is off-putting.",84,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2014 Léon  (Coteaux Bourguignons)
"Spicy and green at first, with an aromatic resemblance to salsa and bell peppers. In the mouth, that bell pepper character never goes away, but with time it becomes more subdued as powerful berry fruit and chocolate come on strong. The finish, however, is hard as nails, courtesy of fierce tannins, thus an affinity for tannin is required to get much from this unusual wine.",83,Weisinger's of Ashland NV Mescolare - lot 12 Red (Rogue Valley)
"If you're a Brunello fan, you'll love this quintessential Rosso for early drinking pleasure. It opens with a fragrance of violets, perfumed berries and baking spices that segue into dark cherry flavors accented with cinnamon, mocha and licorice. It's robust with big, enveloping tannins, and ready to enjoy now.",90,Capanna 2012  Rosso di Montalcino
"This wine is lean on the nose and perfumed in honeysuckle and apple blossom. With its power in balance, the fruit can shine. Lemon and Gravenstein apple exude from the entry while a medium-toned structure buoys the subtle spicy notes of the oak, never letting them overtake the finish.",91,Lusso Della Terra 2013 Reserve Chardonnay (Alexander Valley)
Pure bright smoky fruits give this wine its edge of tannin and great red plum and spice flavors. Its youth adds a dry character to the fruitiness and acidity. Drink this from 2018.,88,Domaine du Petit Clocher 2015 Cabernet Franc (Anjou)
"Aged partly in concrete vats and partly in oak, this shows concentrated sensations of ripe plum, sour cherry and raspberry layered with espresso notes. Pair this with grilled vegetables or spicy cheeses.",87,Principe Corsini Fattoria Le Corti 2010  Chianti Classico
"Easy to like now for its silky texture, brisk acidity and upfront raspberry and cherry jam flavors. It's textbook Pinot Noir, offering the lightness in the mouth you expect from this variety, yet packing plenty of power. Give it an hour or two in the decanter, and it should be lovely with beef, lamb or tuna.",90,Thomas Fogarty 2010 Rapley Trail Vineyard Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"A big, burly proprietary red blend, Voluptous combines Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller percentages of Syrah, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Zinfandel , creating a rich, darkly fruited wine with dusty tannins. Well-structured despite its girth, it delivers layers of licorice and leather on the finish. Drink now.",87,Eagle Eye 2008 Voluptuous Red (Napa Valley)
Aromas of oily petrol and stone fruits lead to a round palate. This offers mild papaya and melony flavors in front of a leesy-tasting finish that's solid in feel.,85,Falernia 2015 Reserva Pedro Ximénez (Elqui Valley)
"Only a cave cooperative could deliver Hermitage at this price. Even better, the wine is excellent and admirably reflects its terroir. Cracked pepper, leather and mocha aromas lead into flavors of coffee, black olive and peppery spice. It's medium to full in body and slightly creamy in texture, with a long, silky finish that reflects bottle age. Drink now–2025.",91,Cave de Tain 2011 Noble Rives  (Hermitage)
"A blend of 70% Sangiovese, 15% Sagrantino and 15% Merlot, this opens with aromas of blue flower, plum cake, raisin, mocha and a whiff of resin. The dense palate offers blackberry, plum, vanilla, roasted coffee bean and sage alongside tightly compacted tannins that need to unwind.",89,Arnaldo Caprai 2009 Riserva  (Montefalco Rosso)
"This Bordeaux blend is three fifths Cabernet Sauvignon, yet deftly weaves in smaller percentages of Merlot, Cab Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec. Fruit-driven and complex, it's a smooth ride through fresh fruit flavors of plum, blueberry and cherry, focusing into a finish with ripe, polished tannins.",92,Tulpen 2007 Coalesce Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon are blended to create a soft, luscious wine that's loaded with bright cherry, rich chocolate and mocha flavors. It would pair beautifully with steak in green-pepper cream sauce.",90,Caiarossa 2007 Pergolaia Red (Toscana)
"This is a measured Brunello that shows just enough aromatic intensity and texture to safely bet on its aging potential. At this young stage, the bouquet is still a bit shy with soft but balanced fruit tones set against savory spice and tobacco. In the mouth, the wine is bone dry and very fresh.",89,Poggiotondo 2008 Agricola Centolani  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Linear and elegant, this bears dusty tones of granite and black fruit that accompany lingering background aromas of spice and tobacco. Dark and deeply extracted, the wine lasts long on the palate, expressing dark plum and cigar flavors along the way.",91,Villa Raiano 2008 Raiano  (Taurasi)
"Monte Tombole Valpolicella opens with easy cherry and blueberry aromas backed by light nuances of spice and sweet vanilla. The wine is fresh, lean and crisp on the close.",85,Villa Erbice 2007 Monte Tombole  (Valpolicella Superiore)
"A curiously spicy, herbal wine that seems to have lost its fruit. There is a bitter edge that may soften over the next few months.",82,Quinta do Cavalinho 2016 Herdade dos Templários Touriga Nacional Rosé (Tejo)
"Lots of oak and ripe fruit in this flashy Cabernet. Too much of both, in fact. Explodes in blackberries, cassis, buttered toast and caramel, wrapped into the ripest, sweetest tannins imaginable. But beyond the obvious palate flattery, there's not a whole lot going on.",87,Castello di Amorosa 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Sweet and viscous, this ratchets up the level of sugar and concentration beyond that of Weil's 2009 auslesen. Dried apricots rule, but nuances of musky spice and candied pineapple play supporting roles. Unctuous enough to pair with dessert if need be, but better on its own, or perhaps with aged hard cheeses.",95,Robert Weil 2009 Kiedrich Gräfenberg Beerenauslese Riesling (Rheingau)
"Dill and butter aromas announce aging in American oak, while the berry aromas are solid but common. This is a tightly wound wine with black cherry and olive flavors followed by length on the palate. It's not edgy, complex or beguiling, but it is full of fruit and has good balance. Imported by Martín Códax USA.",86,Martín Códax 2005 Ergo  (Rioja)
"Made in a New Zealand style, which is very dry, crisp in acidity, minerally and rich in citrus flavors, with a sour, green note of gooseberry. A brisk Sauvignon Blanc that will love goat cheese.",87,Wellington 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Valley)
"Tropicality rules the roost on this wine, which offers peach, papaya, apricot, mango, coconut and even banana aromas on the nose. Ripe apples, cherimoya and poached peach show on the palate. It's all a little bit much, but not overdone, with enough restraint to achieve balance.",88,Le Mistral 2016 Jack McGinley Vineyard Viognier (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
"Classic herbaceous, catty aromas usher in a wine that has crisp, gooseberry and grapefruit flavors. It's bright and tight, with acidity that dominates all the fruitiness. It needs to be drunk by 2015.",85,Henry Brochard 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Val de Loire)
"This wine is structured and firm, with some bitterness. Acidity and red-currant fruits bring out the freshness of the year while still needing time to develop. The wine is concentrated and tight at the end. It will take time to be ready, so don't drink before 2022.",90,Louis Latour 2014 Les Damodes Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges)
"Straightforward red-fruit aromas suggest cherry and plum. Rubbery, pinching tannins are the adhesive for this punchy young Rioja that tastes of raspberry and cherry and finishes steady.",86,Campellares 2014  Rioja
"Aromas of French oak, vanilla, coconut and a funky trace of barnyard dominate the nose. The muddled, rather rustic palate shows overripe black cherry, glazed plum, game, sweet and sour sauce and a note of bitter walnut. Dusty tannins give it a drying, fleeting finish.",85,Feudi del Pisciotto 2013 Versace Nero d'Avola (Terre Siciliane)
"A sweet smell of honeysuckle and grapefruit candy permeates the nose of this bottling, along with cut honeydew melon and apple blossom. Sugary mandarin juice is the primary flavor on the palate, but it's properly offset by acidity a chalky texture.",87,Coquelicot 2016 Riesling
"A Bordeaux-style blend made primarily from Merlot, plus Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Malbec, this is layered with waves of blackberries, blueberries, currants, dark chocolate and oak flavors. The tannins are pure and refined. Production is 2,000 cases.",92,Cameron Hughes 2010 Lot 335 Meritage (Oakville)
"This smells like fresh pavement at first, with gritty black-fruit and burnt leaf notes. The palate feels edgy, with a spotty red-fruit flavor that's matched with notes of resiny oak and vanilla. It finishes in a similar fashion. Novo Imports and Aidil Wines & Liquors.",85,Federico Paternina 2008 Clisos Crianza  (Rioja)
"This stunning TBA is a powerhouse of superripe peach, mango and orange flavors. The palate feels smooth and rich, with honey and marmalade flavors, but it's ethereally light, with a dusty minerality and shrieking lemon acidity that reverberates on the finish. Gorgeous now, but should develop an earthy, honeyed intensity over the next decade.",96,S.A. Prüm 2010 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Trockenbeerenauslese Riesling (Mosel)
"So ripe and rich in fruit, you won't even notice the absence of oak. The grapes come mostly from Lodi, with a touch of Monterey. Brightened with crisp acidity, the flavors are of spicy, zesty tangerines and vanilla.",87,Round Hill 2010 Oak Free Chardonnay (California)
"From the heart of the Napa Valley, this estate white is dry in floral lemon and lime, in addition to more voluptuous helpings of apricot and peach. Stainless-steel fermented, it offers crisp acidity before taking on complexity on the finish, more weighty than on the palate.",90,Round Pond 2014 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford)
"A red blend from the eastern end of the Entre deux Mers region, this is a smooth and already accessible wine. Attractive black fruits and soft tannins accompany touches of vanilla. It's ready to drink.",86,Les Vignerons Réunis de Monségur 2012 Luna B  (Bordeaux)
"A clean, classic minerality leads on this unique and food-friendly Chardonnay. On the palate, fresh fruit flavors mingle with a touch of oak, and the finish offers both length and character.",84,Wagner 2005 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"Elegant on the nose, it offers aromas settling between violet, white pepper and chai tea. The 5% Petite Sirah adds a nice touch of viscosity to the palate. The flavors range from cinnamon to licorice with nice bitterness and acidity, making the fruits of plum and prune almost an afterthought.",93,Proulx 2011 Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"A sweetly delicious bubbly, with fine bubbles and a rich yeastiness to the citrus, cherry and vanilla flavors. The blend is of French Colombard, Chardonnay and Sangiovese.",86,Korbel 2009 Made with Organically Grown Grapes Brut Sparkling (California)
"Young and still a bit yeasty, with the flavors still integrating. The toasty barrel and bourbon flavors are matched to medium acids and stone fruits. This needs more time in the bottle to show all its strengths.",91,Rulo 2009 Birch Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Unbelievably rich and decadent, this tastes of honey drizzled over crushed ripe pineapples, guavas and pears. Added hints of buttered toast, vanilla bean, caramel and sweet cream come with scads of savory pie spices.",95,Jarvis 2010 Finch Hollow Estate Grown Cave Fermented Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Quite creamy and sweet on the nose, with marshmallow and candy aromas that are not that convincing. Solid in the mouth, with herbal fruit, chocolate and plump tannins, body and extract. Better in terms of mouthfeel and concentration than flavor. Malbec, with Cabernet, Syrah and Petit Verdot.",86,Alta Vista 2007 Atemporal Red (Mendoza)
"For Central Otago Chardonnay, this is rather rich and chunky on the palate, delivering hints of grilled sweet corn and ripe melon. It falls off a bit on the finish, so drink up over the next several months.",88,Peregrine 2010 Chardonnay (Central Otago)
"Ripe and smooth, it has layers of red fruits, a touch of caramel and delicious acidity. It's full of flavor with depth as well as some richness.",89,Château Saint-Pierre 2013 Tradition Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Ripe in dense black cherry, this wine has a pleasant juiciness that keeps it balanced in the glass. A firmness of acidity supports the well-integrated tannins and lithe fruit, while the finish brings a swirl of cinnamon-cola and vanilla.",90,Truchard 2013 Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this opens with bold, opulent tones of black fruit, ripe cherry, espresso bean and plum. The wine's delicate acidity and ample extraction are followed by flavors of leather, spice and dark chocolate.",91,Tenuta Argentiera 2010 Villa Donoratico  (Bolgheri)
"Smoked sausage, raspberry and cherry spice start this exuberant red blend. The wine has an overall spicy character and a bigger, open style. Easy drinking and fun, pair it with grilled ribs or duck.",84,Skouras 2006 Synoro Red (Peloponnese)
This has lemony and slightly bitter citrus-skin flavors that are made for fresh seafood and shellfish. Notes of tart lemon and green pineapple are matched by the substantial acids.,86,Winter's Hill 2011 Estate Pinot Gris (Dundee Hills)
"Smoky up front, with lightly herbal berry and plum aromas but also leafiness and scratchiness. Has grip and structure, but tastes roasted and meaty, with raw oak and spice flavors leading to a minty, oaky, grabby finish.",86,Sottano 2010 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"The nose promises creamy freshness with the telltale passion fruit notes of Sauvignon Blanc wrapped in a rounded, sunny palate which restrains aromas but delivers lime-zest refreshment and a very clean, satisfying finish.",89,Zantho 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Burgenland)
"This is a very ripe wine stuffed with blackberries, cherries and cocoa, but it's also pretty tannic, although sweet oak softens the blow. Feels lush and good, but rustic around the edges. Drink now with beef dishes.",86,Hahn Estates 2007 Meritage (Central Coast)
"This plump-textured blend of Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier features aromas and flavors of apricot, melon, mango and ginger. Drink it over the next nine months for its appealing, forward fruit nature.",89,Mas Carlot 2013 Cuvée Tradition White (Costières de Nîmes)
"Fragrant and lush with floral/citrus aromas, this stainless-fermented Chardonnay is inviting and seductive. Brilliant, bright fruit anchors a wine that is tense and dense and vividly thrilling. The acids are natural and flavors seamlessly run from lemon/lime to pineapple to orange, and keep on keeping on, with fresh, water-washed rock in the finish.",93,Rulo 2008 Sundance Vineyard Chardonnay (Wahluke Slope)
"Made from the Manzoni grape, which is a cross between Pinot Bianco and Riesling, Santi Angeli has a lovely fragrance of pear, apple and stone fruit that carry over to the palate along with citrus and spice. It 's long and linear with a crisp finish.",88,Case Paolin 2011 Santi Angeli Manzoni (Venezie)
"With swathes of delicious herbal and green Sauvignon Blanc fruit just delicately underpinned by the wood aging, this is a wine that is rich while remaining so crisp. It is the tangy grapefruit and crisp texture that will allow this wine to age. Drink from 2020.",93,Château Margaux 2014 Pavillon Blanc du Château Margaux  (Bordeaux Blanc)
"An interesting wine that needs time to resolve its internal conflicts. At less than three years, it's jammy, almost candied in raspberry and cherry fruit, sprinkled with freshly ground pepper and with a trace of beef jerky. Yet such is the acid-tannin framework that the wine could surprise with extended cellaring. Try after 2014.",92,Aril 2008 Syrah (Napa Valley)
Earthy rubbery berry aromas suggest pencil eraser and rubber. This Malbec-Syrah blend feels chunky and on the heavy side. Baked blackberry and chocolate flavors finish stewy and wayward.,86,Mauricio Lorca 2014 MIO Malbec-Syrah (Mendoza)
"This is a tough wine, packed more with tannins than fruit. A bitter chocolate character comes from over-extraction of the tannins. The fruit is slow in coming, although there are hints of juiciness. Give it until 2017.",84,Château Fonsèche 2012  Haut-Médoc
"A spark of flint leaps out of the glass, followed by green plums and Conference pear. That stony touch also tempers the concentrated body and runs from start to pleasantly long finish, ending in a pleasantly bitter sting. Drink as of 2016.",94,Salomon-Undhof 2012 Von Stein Berglagen Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"Emina 2009 Tinto Fino Roble (Ribera del Duero). Purple and big, with black fruit aromas along with plenty of young oak, licorice, cola and bacon. The palate has a saturated, lush feel and bold flavors of blackberry and oak. On the finish it's all coconut, butter and dill. Ribald and offering a lot.",89,Emina 2009 Tinto Fino Roble  (Ribera del Duero)
"Ripe and juicy this is a wine that brings out perfumed black fruits and lively acidity. It is made to be drunk young, preserving all the berry fruitiness and leaving the tannins in the background. Drink from late 2016.",88,Domaine Berthoumieu 2012 Haute Tradition Tannat-Cabernet (Madiran)
"A fine Chardonnay, marked by crisp, citrusy acidity that cleanses the mouth and makes the wine so refreshing. Flavorwise, it's a powerhouse, with pear, green apple, lemon meringue, buttered toast and smoky, vanilla flavors that finish in a swirl of cloves and pepper.",91,Gary Farrell 2006 Russian River Selection Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Frankly delicious, offering wave after wave of black cherry jam, red currant, licorice, mocha, vanilla and buttered cinnamon toast flavors, wrapped into soft, smooth tannins.",88,J. Lohr 2010 Gesture G-S-M (Paso Robles)
"Scratchy red-berry aromas come with a whiff of latex and milk-chocolate-covered cherry. It feels grabby and tannic, with flavors of baked berry, cinnamon and burnt rubber. The finish is warm, with an offsetting sweetness.",84,Region 1 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"A basic but clean stone-fruit nose opens this tight-feeling citrusy Godello from Bierzo. A briny mix of white-fruit and citrus flavors is tangy, salty and minerally on the finish.",87,Dominio de Tares 2015 La Sonrisa de Tares Godello (Bierzo)
"This blend of 54% Grenache, 28% Shiraz and 18% Mourvèdre often offers solid value. The 2009 features hints of mocha, vanilla and red plum on the nose, accented by a pinch of peppery cinnamon. In the mouth, it's medium to full in body and richly textured without being over the top, then ends on a warming spice note. Drink now and over the next few years.",90,Kaesler 2009 Avignon Red (Barossa Valley)
"Though it's barrel fermented, this is a thin, hard-edged wine with green and slightly stemmy flavors only partially masked by the buttery barrel notes.",83,Airlie 2006 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
"This lovely Verdicchio opens with an alluring fragrance of white spring flowers, Spanish broom and a whiff of sea breeze. The creamy palate delivers white peach, tropical fruit and lemon notes, all brightened by crisp acidity and mineral accents.",89,Tenuta di Tavignano 2012 Misco  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore)
"This value-priced wine shows pressed Bing cherry juice, sagebrush and balsamic fig vinegar on the nose. The palate offers a complex combination of flavors—mocha, espresso, blackberry and anise.",87,Edna Valley Vineyard 2013 Merlot (Central Coast)
"There's power in this wine amidst the notes of waxy lemon, peach pit and blossoms. The bitterness of melon rind comes in on the finish, but there's enough acidity to keep the palate refreshing, interesting, and quite food friendly.",88,Greyrock 2016 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Full bodied and richly textured, this is an approachable wine that should nonetheless drink well through at least 2025. Toasted coconut accents cassis and blackberry fruit, folding in hints of vanilla on the long, mouthwatering finish.",92,Penley Estate 2012 Phoenix Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra)
"Gravenstein apple, honeysuckle and jasmine aromas show on the relatively boisterous nose of this bottling from a large vineyard on Highway 46 east of Paso Robles. There is compellingly grippy texture to the sip, with ripe flavors of pear and honeydew melon. A salty acidity takes it to the next level.",89,Broken Earth 2015 Albariño (Paso Robles)
"Not the best Monte Bello to emerge in recent years. There's a sharpness of acidity that cuts the palate, and it accentuates the fresh fruit, giving it a jammy zing. More troubling is an overripe raisiny flavor. This bottling is, of course, one of the most ageable in California, but the inherent imbalance seems to mitigate against long time in the cellar.",88,Ridge 2007 California Monte Bello Red (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"The Merlot certainly does its job here of smoothing out the Baga tannins. Together, they yield a soft, red fruit-flavored wine with minimal tannins and juicy acidity, adding a burst of flavor on the finish. Drink now.",87,Global Wines 2014 Encontro Q do E Merlot-Baga Red (Bairrada)
"This is another of Hidalgo's superb 30-year-old Sherries, and this example shows hazelnut, butterscotch and citrus aromas on a lifted, luxe nose. The mouthfeel is just right, with oily weight cut by sharp acidity. Flavors of apricot, orange peel, toffee and almond skins finish long and unwavering.",93,Bodegas Hidalgo NV Vinos Viejos de Hidalgo Amontillado Napoleon 30 Years Old Sherry (Jerez)
Generous ripe fruit is found on a wine packed with cherry and raspberry flavors. Hints of banana appear along with the vintage's signature tannic structure. Keep for 6–9 months.,86,Pierre Dupond 2010 Domaine de Boischampt  (Juliénas)
Aromas of ripe red apple and pencil lead are followed by tart cherry and cranberry flavors. It's a unique interpretation of the variety.,88,Nefarious 2012 Estate Rocky Mother Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Delicate and light with a pale pink color and creamy white foam on the surface, this is a great little sparkling aperitivo wine to pair with spicy tapas or finger foods. Rose, raspberry and a touch of strawberry open the fragrant bouquet.",85,Cleto Chiarli 2012 Rosè Brut de Noir Sparkling (Romagna)
"An excellent medium-bodied wine from an estate better known for its olives, this is dark in color but with a lighter, tawny rim. The complex aromas combine sweet baking spices with ample cherry and berry notes. Flavors kick in with juicy strawberry, dark cherry and subtle shadings of nutmeg and wood smoke. The texture is plush and almost soft, and the taste is warmly luxurious.",92,McEvoy Ranch 2012 The Evening Standard Pinot Noir (Marin County)
"This is firm, showing a ripe plum-skin flavor and a severe line of tannin. There's some bitterness along with a good depth of fruit flavor, structure and acidity, all of which suggest aging potential.",88,Louis Max 2009 Clos des Chênes  (Volnay)
"This luminous, hay-colored Grillo imparts measured notes of banana and exotic fruit that add extra richness and dimension to what is a simple and easy-drinking white wine overall. You could pair this wine with a long list of seafood, vegetable and pasta recipes—and you can't beat this low price.",85,Feudo Arancio 2007 Grillo (Sicilia)
"Dusty and yeasty on the nose, this has an eggy, sweaty note. It feels good but drifts a bit on the palate, while the flavors run stalky and sweet, with a touch of apple for crispness.",83,Jaume Serra NV Cristalino Extra-Dry Sparkling (Cava)
"Softly tannic and sinfully rich, a drink-me-now Cabernet that offers plenty of upscale Napa pleasure. The flavors are intricate, offering tiers of blackberry and cherry jam, currant, mocha and toasty oak.",89,Bennett Lane 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This dry and full-bodied wine is a little rugged and heavy in texture, with an astringently tannic finish. But it has enough cherry, berry and oak flavors to make it a pretty good buy at this price.",84,Leaping Lizard 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Minerally on the bouquet, with apple and oceanic notes. Turns citric and acidic on the palate, with pineapple, orange and tangy flavors. Shows astringency on the finish, but at least it's juicy and driving.",85,Zarate 2010 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"A somewhat flat baked jammy nose offers up a helping dose of oak spice. This feels chunky but largely healthy, while oaky minty flavors of berry fruits and plum show a tomato-like quality on a blocky finish.",87,CVNE 2014 Viña Real Crianza  (Rioja)
"55% Cabernet Sauvignon and 45% Merlot aged two years in new French oak, the wood notes are quite prominent along with mint, cherry, and chocolate. True to the vintage, it's lighter in style with tart fruit flavors, mouthwatering acids, and firm tannins that still need some time to come into their own.",86,Koenig Vineyards 2010 Cuvee Alden Private Reserve Red
"Aromas of mature berry, fig, pressed rose and crushed herb lead the way. The no-frills palate offers juicy red cherry, dark culinary spice and tobacco alongside close-grained tannins and fresh acidity. Drink after 2023.",89,Pelassa 2013  Barolo
"Made with organically grown grapes and with no added sulfites, this opens with earthy aromas of black-skinned fruit, ground pepper and a whiff of truffle. The lively, simple palate offers black cherry and clove alongside vibrant acidity.",86,Paolo Marcarino 2014 Zeroincondotta  (Barbera di Piemonte)
"Very dry, crisp, taut and mineral, a tense wine with a streak of green berries and almost achingly fresh acidity. This is certainly a food style of Riesling, too dry for aperitif. Screwcap.",89,Zimmermann 2007 Rosshimmel Riesling (Kremstal)
"A blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Syrah, this has fruity aromas of dark-skinned berry along with a whiff of all spice. The fresh easygoing palate shows blackberry, black cherry and a hint of ground pepper accompanied by soft tannins. Enjoy soon.",87,Castello d'Albola 2014 OSO Red (Toscana)
"This dry wine has that combination of tight minerality and great acidity that is common to young Chenin Blanc. It comes from a narrow valley carved into the steep cliffs of Vouvray, giving a wine that has richness as well as this tangy aftertaste.",88,Cave des Producteurs de Vouvray 2013 Les Fosses d'Hareng  (Vouvray)
"Appealing aromas of mature orchard fruit and chopped herb lead the way. The ripe round palate doles out creamy pear, white peach, candied ginger and a hint of bitter almond while just enough fresh acidity gives it a lift.",89,Latium di Morini 2015 Campo Le Calle  (Soave)
"This is a pure Pinot Noir cuvée from an Aube-based producer. It has a curious candied character reminiscent of fruit drops due, perhaps, to its youth. Give it a few more months to gain depth and drink from 2018.",85,Jean Josselin NV Cuvée des Jean Pinot Noir (Champagne)
"Inky dark, with deep berry, sandalwood and sawmill aromas. Color and potency are not lacking in this modern-styled Tempranillo, which hits like a hammer. Feelwise, this is a tough, angular wine that will benefit from another year or two of aging. Now it's very tight and tannic, with piercing acidity.",87,Marqués de Cáceres 2005 MC  (Rioja)
"This is a big blush wine with bold orange and strawberry fruit flavors. There's a honeyed edge to the palate, but it's vital with acidity. Great with Mediterranean fish stew or paella, or on the beach with cold cuts.",87,Melville 2012 Estate Pinot Noir Rosé (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Made in the slightly sweet, crisp popular style, this Sauvignon Blanc offers easy flavors of pineapple, pear and apple juice, with the sweet vanilla of oak.",86,Ledson 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Smooth and juicy, this opens with aromas of wild berry, blue flower and a whiff of grilled herb. The soft, succulent palate doles out black cherry, chopped mint, cinnamon and a hint of mocha alongside dusty tannins and bright acidity. It's rather straightforward but delicious.",91,Principe Corsini 2013 Le Corti  (Chianti Classico)
"The aromas are so light you need to strain to get at them, with notes of vanilla, coffee and cherry. The palate brings plentiful coffee and cherry flavors that show a pleasing sense of texture. One wants more aromatically, but the palate delivers.",89,Seven Falls 2013 Merlot (Wahluke Slope)
"This is the kind of wine that tastes like no effort was spared in its production. It's impeccably made, with clean, ripe fruit, crisp acidity and a nice touch of oak. The palate is full of California-ripe Meyer lemons and peaches with a touch of New Zealand gooseberry.",90,One Three 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Thin and tart, with aggressively astringent tannins. There is a noticeable scent and flavor of rubber as well.",83,Mansion Creek 2008 Waldheim Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Aromas of ripe berry, leather, truffle and a whiff of balsamic herb emerge on this straightforward but extremely enjoyable red. The approachable, juicy palate offers black cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, white pepper and a touch of clove alongside big, velvety tannins. Drink through 2022.",90,Cantina del Nebbiolo 2012 del Comune di Serralunga d'Alba  (Barolo)
"Tantara's 2012 Pinots tend to be cloudy and light like this one, which delivers aromas of cranberry and allspice. It's very soft on the palate, with light chai flavors and the tartness of barely ripe pomegranate.",92,Tantara 2012 Lindsay's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"An intense pepper and spice-influenced wine from the Gebling Vineyard above Krems. It is rich, weighty and intense, with the spirited acidity lending a refreshing edge. For aging over several years. Screwcap.",90,Hermann Moser 2011 Kellerterrassen Reserve Riesling (Kremstal)
"This wine has an extra measure of creaminess in the texture while giving up floral, lightly spicy and wonderfully fruity flavors. There's no obvious oak influence, just ripe raspberry, strawberry and macerated black-cherry notes that softly coat the palate and cling to the finish.",89,Red Rock 2015 Reserve Merlot (California)
"This wine opens with aromas that recall burned tire rubber, asphalt, coffee bean and eucalyptus. The palate offers jumbled sensations of sweet, mature plum, blackberry and powdered sage alongside green, astringent tannins that generate a bitter close.",86,Piccini 2008 Villa al Cortile Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Menthol, ripe berry, vanilla and mocha aromas emerge in the glass. The palate offers dried black cherry, coffee and toast but not much fruit richness alongside bracing tannins that leave an astringent finish.",87,Cascina Bruciata 2012 Cannubi Muscatel  (Barolo)
"Concentrated blackberries mix with lush and inviting purple flowers and baking-spice notes on the nose of this appellation blend. It's juicy on the palate with minty blackberry and licorice-laced olallieberry flavors, making for easy drinking.",88,Anglim 2013 Syrah (Paso Robles)
"The new Mercer Canyons label gets off to a good start with this Chardonnay that's low in alcohol and clean. Bracing and leesy, this is definitely European in style, and it offers celery and melon flavors along with palate-refreshing minerality.",88,Mercer Canyons 2011 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Meaty, condensed and full of understated plum and berry fruit. This is a nice bargain Merlot with currant, plum and pepper for flavors, and then a dash of mellow coffee on the finish. With solid core flavors and an integrated mouthfeel, it ranks as a positive wine for the money.",86,Quasar 2006 Reserva Merlot (Curicó Valley)
"From vineyards in the eastern Douro Superior region, this perfumed white is soft, smooth and finely balanced. The acidity is just right, giving the rich pear fruit a crisp edge and refreshing aftertaste. Drink now.",90,Colinas do Douro 2015 Verdelho (Douro)
"This incredibly zesty and fruity bottling shows raspberry, lavender and white pepper on the nose. It's fun to sip, with snappy red fruits and hibiscus most prominent. Complexity comes from touches of rooibos tea and potpourri. It's still extremely youthful.",89,Silvertip 2014 Unfiltered Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Firm and muscular, with mixed berries and cherry fruit, this beautifully defined Cabernet shows excellent penetration and focus. The finish is long, smoky, and carries a hint of gun metal.",93,Nefarious 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Wahluke Slope)
"The aromas are brooding, with notes of plum, barrel spice, incense and black cherry. The palate is rich and concentrated with blackberry flavors, backed by firm tannins that need some time to settle in. It's high on the hedonistic scale.",93,DeLille 2014 Shaw Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"This ripe, honeyed wine is very rich and smooth. Apricot and mango flavors dominate. Balance comes with the final tang of lemon zest acidity.",86,Domaine François Schmitt 2010 Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
"Sweet and soft, this simple Chardonnay has flavors of oranges, pineapples, vanilla, cream and buttered toast. It's made in a style to appeal.",86,Maldonado 2009 Parr Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"Produced from a field blend of old vines in a gravity-fed winery at Quinta da Faísca, this is a concentrated and structured wine from grapes grown in the Vale de Mendiz in the heart of the Douro. Still young and still masking the black fruits with the tannins, it is slow to develop. It is rich, though, full in the mouth and likely to be a fine wine as it slowly matures. Drink from 2019.",92,Secret Spot Wines 2013 Lacrau Old Vines Red (Douro)
"Aromas of wild berry, menthol, baking spice and a balsamic note lead the nose. On the tightly wound palate, bracing tannins support raw cherry, anise, tobacco and a hint of coffee alongside firm acidity.",89,Dosio 2011 Fossati  (Barolo)
"A smooth, deliciously drinkable blend of Mauzac and Loin de l'Oeil gives crisp acidity, green fruits and tangy acidity. It's a wine that's fresh and ripe at the same time, a very dry wine that will certainly be best with food. Drink from late 2016.",86,Domaine des Terrisses 2015 Grande Tradition White (Gaillac)
"Violet-red in the glass, this wine has fragrances of watermelon and black cherry. Tannins come on strong at first but are undercut by astringent notes of cranberry alongside flavors of cherry, pomegranate, vanilla and French toast.",89,Recanati 2013 Reserve Marselan (Galilee)
"Very fragrant green floral and apple aromas on the nose yield to a round, soft, full palate bearing light strawberry and apple flavors. It’s a bit on the sweet side for a brut, but the aromatics keep it quite interesting and pleasing.",87,Bellavista NV Cuvée Brut  (Franciacorta)
"This Chardonnay-Viognier blend is slightly sweet, with vegetable-infused pineapple flavors.",80,Bloomfield 2008 Devil's Daughter White (Contra Costa County)
"This is subdued, almost invisible, with herbal flavors accented with bitter greens. Barely ripe red fruit leaves a flat taste, with no life in it. Two bottles tasted.",83,Zimri Cellars 2013 Beacon Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir
"Clean white-fruit aromas are simple but pleasant. This Viura has a round, plump body that's a touch flat. Salty citrus flavors come with notes of lime and green banana. A lasting finish is mild and tasty. Drink immediately.",87,CVNE 2016 Monopole Viura (Rioja)
"One of Testarossa's best 2011 Pinot Noirs, of 14 released, this wine is, in a word, gorgeous. First off is the silky texture, as airy as a cloud. Then there are the flavors, complex and lush in raspberries, cherries, brown sugar, cinnamon and oak. The wine is so delightful to drink now, you might miss out on cellaring it until 2018 to see where it goes.",93,Testarossa 2011 Doctor's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Produced from old vines in the Aegerter Domaine, this wine is dominated by red fruits and spice from wood aging. It is fruity, perfumed and likely to be ready to drink soon. Drink from 2018.",85,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2015 Vieilles Vignes  (Bourgogne)
"Lovely, crisp acidity marks this dry, complex Pinot Noir. It's not an ager, but very elegant, with delicate sour-cherry candy, cola and mushroom flavors. A great wine to serve with mushroom-based entrées.",92,Beaulieu Vineyard 2010 Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros)
This is a fresh and light Prosecco that puts great emphasis on citrus and grapefruit aromas. Beyond those layers are touches of white flower and peach. Try this wine with a bowl of warm popcorn.,85,Canti NV Heritage Extra Dry  (Prosecco)
"Made from grapes picked early specifically for rosé, this bone-dry wine keeps alcohol low and flavors rich. A pale copper hue, it offers flavors that mimic a cava, without the bubbles. Racy minerality underscores a juicy, fruit-driven palate of lemon, lime and orange. A hint of coffee and crème brulée pokes through the refreshing finish.",91,Cayuse 2012 Edith Armada Vineyard Grenache Rosé (Walla Walla Valley (OR))
"The Wess style is for rounded wines, with a ripe, creamy texture. While this Terrassen is all about fresh fruit, it also has the same extra richness in its makeup. The floral character of Riesling is evident, as are flavors of white peaches and dried apricots. There's even a touch of pepper for the spice. Screwcap.",90,Rainer Wess 2007 Terrassen Riesling (Wachau)
"Easy and fresh, you could pair this Italian white with freshwater fish or grilled shrimp. It delivers one-dimensional tones of citrus, peach and melon.",84,Canti 2011 Pinot Grigio (Veneto)
"This gorgeous Brunello proves that top producers can make outstanding wines even in challenging vintages like 2009. It opens with an elegant bouquet of violet, red berry, spice and a whiff of new leather. The delicious palate delivers fleshy black cherry layered with mint, licorice, balsamic herbs and cinnamon-spice. It's impeccably balanced with firm tannins and fresh acidity that give it an age-worthy structure. Drink 2016–2024.",94,Il Marroneto 2009 Madonna delle Grazie  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Aromas of tree bark, pencil eraser, olive, plum and berry fruits are solid. This is quite good for Maule Syrah. The acidity is lively and bracing, while plum and apple-skin flavors finish raw and grating.",87,Viña el Aromo 2010 Private Reserve Syrah (Maule Valley)
"Lush aromas of cinnamon, black and red cherry, vanilla and toasted brioche show on this unabashedly potent and downright delicious bottling by the region's pioneering winery. Soft tannins joyously present rounded red-fruit and vanilla-cake flavors, with rich accents of cherry compote and chocolate chip cookie that are cut by streaks of bitterness and tartness. It's a voluptuous, attention-grabbing wine.",95,Justin 2014 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"This is the Left Bank companion to the winery's La Soeur blend. Here the Cabernet Sauvignon is dominant, with Merlot and a splash of Petit Verdot making up the last third. Firm, dark and tight upon opening, it sends up scents of smoke and charcoal, forming a wreath around dense fruit flavors of blueberry and cassis. A young wine, with perhaps a decade or more of life ahead of it.",91,Ancestry 2011 Le Frère Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This luminous bubbly hits such a light shade of pink, it only hints at being a rosé sparkler. It is incredibly delicate down to the smallest detail and would pair with salmon canapé appetizers.",85,Canella NV Rosé Brut Pinot Nero (Veneto)
"A neutral cava with white candy and mango on the nose. The palate is both foamy and scouring, with soda cracker, apple and citrus pith creating the flavor profile and finish. Shows basic flavors, normal mouthfeel and scouring acidity.",86,Sàniger 2007 Brut Sparkling (Cava)
"An appealing Cab Franc, among the better versions of the variety. Shows the weight and structure of a fine Napa Cabernet Sauvignon, except the flavors veer toward red cherries and red cherry liqueur. Drink now, with honey-baked ham.",90,Girard 2007 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley)
"Because it comes from vines in one of the coolest parts of the Douro, high on the plateau north of the river, this is a fresh, fruity wine. It has crisp apple acidity that is made richer by touches of apricot and light spice. The wine is tight, a straight line of clean acidity. Drink from the end of 2016.",86,Quinta de Porrais 2015 Porrais White (Douro)
"Concentrated cherry and strawberry flavors gain layers of complexity from lavish floral and brambly forest notes on this lovely Cab Franc. The palate is soft and a bit fleshy, but bright acidity adds balance and structure.",87,Whitecliff Vineyard 2010 Cabernet Franc (New York)
"This blend of Saperavi, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot has prominent aromas of smoke and cured meats. There are flavors of red and black fruits and a touch of smoky sweetness in the finish.",82,Lion-Gri 2011 Saperavi (Moldova)
"In a word: stately. The wine starts with cedar, leather and olive aromas, followed by complex flavors of cinnamon, red fruit and a touch of spicy smoke. This wine will age well but is delicious now.",90,Nemeion Estate 2008 Reserve Agiorgitiko (Nemea)
"Blangé is a supremely clean and pristine white wine to drink as an aperitivo or with fresh salads or seafood. There are bright fruit notes here of peach, pear and citrus but there's also a very attractive mineral tone that holds it all together. The wine is fresh, crisp and tonic throughout.",87,Ceretto 2008 Blangé Arneis (Langhe)
"A beautiful Pinot, authoritative and masculine, with firm tannins, hard acidity and a bone-dry finish. The core of black cherries, cola, spices and sweet oak is irresistibly good. Compelling now right out of the bottle, and should develop over the next six years.",93,Foxen 2009 Julia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"This wine has a deep pink color with a touch of amber, and very bright and zingy aromas. Mouthwatering, crisp fruit flavors are full of citrus and cherry. The lively texture is due to great grape acidity that lights up this wine.",89,Bravium 2014 Signal Ridge Vineyard Rosé of Rosé (Mendocino Ridge)
"This California bottling of an Italian varietal is rustic, with flavors suggesting cherry pie filling. This should pair with burgers and similar fare.",84,Mosby 2008 Teroldego (Santa Barbara County)
"This is a unicorn wine that only gets made in exceptional years—the last time was a decade ago. Hailing from Morrison Lane, the oldest Syrah plantings in the valley, it brings mesmerizing aromas of blackberry, black fruit, moist earth and wet stone. The black-fruit flavors consume the palate, showing density, depth and exceptional length. It's a complete heart-stopper.",96,K Vintners 2012 The Hustler Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"From old vines, this is the estate wine of Carvalhas. Black in color, it is hugely rich, dense and brooding. The wine is still young, pushed forward by tannins as much as fruit and packed with a concentrated structure. Spice at the end and a dry aftertaste need time to soften. Drink from 2018.",93,Quinta das Carvalhas 2012 Carvalhas Vinhas Velhas Red (Douro)
"91-93 Fresh, bright in style, a spice cake of flavors while keeping taut fruit and final acidity. The texture, though, promises good ageing.",92,Château Nairac 2010 Barrel sample  (Barsac)
"There is a lot going on in this unique, affordably priced blend of 36% Pinot Noir, 28% Syrah, 27% Merlot and 9% Zinfandel—underripe mulberry, thyme, crushed pepper and fennel aromas on the nose. It balances well on the palate, where bright acidity and textural tension hold the boysenberry, anise and lavender flavors together.",90,DeTierra Vineyards 2013 The Puzzler Red (Monterey)
"Very soft, it feels like the vinous equivalent of a creampuff. The fruit is lightly tropical, with notes of caramel and banana, cut through with a streak of citrus and apple.",87,Three Rivers 2008 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Truffle, underbrush, mature plum, saddle leather and a balsamic note emerge on this robust red. The hearty, one-dimensional palate delivers dried black cherry, licorice and grilled herb alongside solid if not very persistent tannins. You'll also notice the heat of alcohol on the rather quick, drying finish.",89,Palazzo 2010 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"A reserve-level Merlot, this is blended with 9% Cabernet Franc and 2% Syrah, then barrel-aged for 18 months in new, one- and two-year-old French oak barrels. Oaky, smoky, charred and tannic, it's a bit of a bruiser. But dig down and you'll find cassis, black cherry, coffee, cola, licorice and tar—in short, a compelling range of dark flavors, all well-integrated. Drink soon.",90,Tinhorn Creek 2011 Oldfield Series Merlot (Okanagan Valley)
"Here's a Cab that needs food to round it off and polish its rough edges. Very dry and a bit angular in tannins, with a peppery bite and generous flavors of cherries and blackberries.",89,Schug 2004 Heritage Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley)
"From the producer's dry-farmed estate vineyard, this elegantly powerful wine opens in cracked black pepper, dried herb and cedar, continuing the peppery theme on the palate. Black cherry and high-toned blackberry combine with the more savory elements, with an overall softness of texture and lengthy finish.",93,Tres Sabores 2012 Zinfandel (Rutherford)
"A surprising 30% of this wine is Clairette, a white grape variety. Perhaps that accounts for the wine's apparent freshness. Hints of crushed stone mark the nose, while the ripe flavors suggest peaches and berries, tailing away slowly on the finish. Drink this mouthfilling rosé over the rest of 2017.",90,Chateau de Manissy 2015 Cuvée de Lys  (Tavel)
"Aromas of dried berry, scorched soil and anisette lead the nose. The ripe palate offers spiced blackberry, juicy wild cherry, licorice, ground pepper and mineral alongside firm, fine-grained tannins and just enough freshness.",90,Nanfro 2011 Sammauro  (Cerasuolo di Vittoria)
"The wine is aromatic and fresh, although its herbal character doesn't quite fit with the rest of this crisp and fruity wine. It may improve, but at the moment it is not balanced or together.",84,Ravoire et Fils 2013 Le Pont Rosé (Bandol)
"One sip is all it takes to fall in love with this 100% Cabernet, which hails from the winery's Stags Leap District vineyards. It's soft, lush and opulent in blackberry, cherry, blueberry, cassis, dark chocolate and smoky oak flavors. Although it was aged in 100% new French oak, the oak isn't at all heavy. Rather, it's perfect, adding just the right touch of smoke. Really fabulous, and the tannins define Stags Leap, so strong yet sweetly refined. If you can keep your hands off it, this is a wine to cellar for many years.",97,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2008 Cask 23 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"There's a sugary sweetness to this Pinot Noir and Chardonnay blend, in roughly equal measures. It's rich and ripe in raspberries, limes and oranges, with the doughy, leesy sourness that marks a good sparkling wine. Feels somewhat rough and aggressive now, but elegant and complex. Could develop bottle complexity over this decade.",90,Schramsberg 2006 Brut Sparkling (Sonoma Coast)
"A little tough and gritty in the mouth, and lacking in the opulence you want in a Pinot Noir. But it's dry and crisp, and shows some decent cherry, red currant and cola flavors.",85,Beaulieu Vineyard 2008 Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"A rich and creamy wine with good structure and plenty of fruit. The nose yields berry essence, vanilla and smoky wood notes, while the palate has depth, layering and composed flavors. There's coffee and chocolate on the finish, and the texture and length seem just right. It's oaky for sure, but this vintage of Q can handle it. Drink now through 2012.",91,Zuccardi 2006 Q Malbec (Mendoza)
"This wine is dense and still firm, although the red-berry fruits are being to integrate well into the structure. It shows signs of its wood aging that will need to go away for the wine really to develop. However, a juicy background promises well. Drink this wine, from a small Grand Cru close to the village of Aloxe-Corton, from 2020.",93,Au Pied du Mont Chauve 2012 Clos des Fietres  (Corton)
"Ripe berry, cassis and grilled meat aromas presage a fresh, zesty palate with free-flowing acidity that pumps up cherry, red plum, cassis and loamy earth flavors. It stays fruity, stout and smooth on the finish. The wine is ripe and fully representative of Mendoza and winemaker Alejandro's Vigil's style.",91,El Enemigo 2011 Cabernet Franc (Mendoza)
"This eye-opening blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Petite Sirah is dark and sexy in color, showing aromas of black cherry, sarsaparilla and black tobacco on a densely complex nose. It is soft and lush on the palate, with caramelized blueberry and black-cherry flavors, boosted by a touch of smoked meat.",93,Parrish Family 2012 Silken Reserve Red (Paso Robles)
"From the cru village of Boudes, this wine is now mature with its soft red fruits and juicy acidity creating a fruity refreshing wine. The wine, produced on the edge of France's central mountains comes from vineyards that are just a couple of mountain ranges away from Beaujolais in a direct line to the east.",87,Domaine Sauvat 2015 Les Demoiselles Gamay
"Lots of cedar is evident on the nose and palate of this red blend. The berry and cassis aromas and flavors are a bit hard to discern and also bear a too-prominent minty, slightly herbaceousness. This medium weight wine closes with a dry tart woodiness that lacks mass appeal.",83,Cousiño-Macul 1997 Finis Terrae Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Maipo Valley)
"The Ribbon Ridge estate delivers beautifully ripened fruit—so ripe, in fact, that the first impression is of sweet tree fruits, although the wine is actually quite dry. Peaches, citrus and nectarines are in the mix, and when the tangy acidity kicks in, a long, mineral-driven ride across the palate ensues. Luscious, long and detailed, this is a spectacular Riesling.",94,Trisaetum 2012 Ribbon Ridge Estate Dry Riesling (Ribbon Ridge)
"Earthy, leathery aromas and dense tobacco and cedar flavors make this wine a bit of a taste adventure. The mouthfeel is posh and finely tannic, and black cherry and dark chocolate notes kick in and last through the finish.",86,Easton 2013 Cooper Ranch Barbera (Shenandoah Valley (CA))
"This is firmly structured, and it shows the earthy fruit character of Savigny. The red plum flavor is cut with acidity. It's worth aging for 2–3 years.",87,Domaine Champy 2010 Aux Forches  (Savigny-lès-Beaune)
Delicate aromas of ripe orchard fruit and bread dough carry over to the dry but lightly effervescent palate along with Anjou pear and citrus. Crisp acidity gives it a clean finish.,88,Borgoluce NV Gaiante Glera
"Fresh and lively, this works the green side of the fruit spectrum, from gooseberry to grapefruit, with a dollop of wet stone. It's a good, all-purpose Sauvignon Blanc, not especially tart, with a welcome bit of barrel-induced roundness.",88,Calliope 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (British Columbia)
"Concentrated flavors and a richly tannic texture make this dry wine more sophisticated and interesting than many other red blends. It combines cranberry, black cherry and cinnamon notes for a mouthfilling and harmonious impression.",90,Whiplash 2015 Red (California)
"The spicy, oaky aromas are obvious and fun, leading to fully ripe flavors like blackberry jam in this full-bodied, deeply colored and velvet-textured wine. It's big but smooth, and the oak influence is welcome, adding interest and complexity.",90,Mettler Family Vineyards 2013 Epicenter Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi)
"Medium-weight (more Gamay than Cabernet in the heft department) with a soft, subtle dusty texture, this Rapel Valley Cab offers red-berry and dried-spice aromas, and red plum and cedar flavors. Goes down so easily that you just might forget that wine has alcohol in it. Best Buy.",87,La Palma 2001 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rapel Valley)
"There's a hint of fresh ramp that adds a curious dimension of umami to this otherwise bright, floral auslese. The palate is sweet and juicy, with flavors of apricot and peach and a striking tangerine acidity that penetrates through the finish.",91,Maximin Grünhäuser 2011 Abstberg Auslese Nr. 84 Riesling (Mosel)
"Creamy aromas of vanilla cookies and melon lead to a plump palate with just enough vital acidity to keep things fresh. Citrusy flavors lean toward clementines and grapefruit, while the finish is peachy but  also pithy in flavor.",85,Alma Andina 2013 Pinot Grigio (Mendoza)
"This wine combines opulent, ripe, almost sweet fruit flavors with good, firm tannins in an appealing way. It tastes full-bodied, drenched with blackberries and finds a good balance that makes it appetizing.",87,Three Pines 2012 Black Granite Red (California)
Slight hints of riper stone fruit mingle with citrus and green-apple-focused flavors. This wine is fresh and carries some earthier notes of bruised apple peel that add interest and texture. The finish is dry and brisk.,87,Domaine Vincent Stoeffler 2014 Tradition Riesling (Alsace)
"Ripe, powerful red-cherry flavors are balanced with crisp acidity and a backbone of granite in this medium-bodied Pinot Noir. It's a fresh, forward wine, with firm, upright tannins and lingering nuances of licorice and dark toast.",90,Von Schleinitz 2015 Pinot Noir (Mosel)
"A Cab-based Bordeaux blend with a little Syrah, this wine tastes surprisingly cooked for such a cool vintage. There's a raisiny, smoky, baked blackberry and cherry flavor that makes for an imbalance that won't age away.",83,Rocca 2005 Bad Boy Red (Yountville)
"Here's a simple, straightforward Cabernet Sauvignon from northern Italy with an attractively low price tag and lively aromas of cherry, chocolate and spice. It shows rich, dense texture as well.",87,Astoria 2007 Icóna Cabernet Sauvignon (Piave)
"This is a cave cooperative's top white Crozes bottling, fermented and aged in oak. Smoky, toasty notes support exotic apricot and pineapple fruit that's initially attractive, then doesn't quite follow through on the finish. Drink now.",89,Cave de Tain 2015 Les Hauts d'Eole Marsanne (Crozes-Hermitage)
"A big, ripe and spicy wine that is full of red fruit notes and gentle tannins. It is open and accessible, its fruit juiciness already a pleasure to taste. There is fresh acidity on the finish. Drink now through 2019.",90,Wines & Winemakers 2011 Companhia das Lezírias Catapereiro Escolha Red (Tejo)
"Very fresh and acidic to the point of tasting sour, this ruby-colored Chianti offers bright berry aromas and white cherry crispness. The wine seems perfectly engineered to pair with cheesy pasta or pizza.",84,Buccia Nera 2008 Guarniente  (Chianti)
"This wine starts off a bit smoky and cedary, but with time it develops more typical Hermitage notes of cassis, hickory smoke and meat. It's medium to full in body, with a rich texture and long finish. Approachable now, but should age easily through 2018.",91,Domaine Philippe & Vincent Jaboulet 2007  Hermitage
"There's a definite ripeness to the bouquet of this wine, with rich scents of mealy melon, peach, strawberry and banana. The palate, however, shows more restraint in flavors of crisp watermelon, firm cherry and citrus peel. Medium acidity lends lift and freshness to the mouthfeel and finish. Drink up.",87,Calmel & Joseph 2014 Villa Blanche Rosé (Pays d'Oc)
"With its vinicultural eye on New Zealand, this full-bodied and rich wine offers a mouth-filling mix of citrus and tropical fruits. It's lush and forward, dense with fruit and highlighted with lemon verbena. The overall effect is like sipping on a vinous lemon-drop cocktail. Quite delicious!",91,J. Scott Cellars 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Southern Oregon)
"Lush, plush and absolutely delicious, this shows a range of softly approachable flavors, including blackberry, cherry, currant, anise, cocoa, mineral, buttery oak and spice. The tannins are thick but finely ground. It's firmly set in the modern cult style and may not be an ager, but it sure impresses now.",94,Constant 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Savory notes slowly unfold—almost like the umami-touch of soy sauce —amidst the dark cherry fruit, while juicy accents suggest this should be paired with Asian cuisine.Try this with five-spice roast ribs or pork belly and plum sauce. Structured, slightly grippy tannins and fresh acidity keep everything in check.",86,Arndorfer 2011 Die Leidenschaft Zweigelt (Niederösterreich)
"This bottling reflects the past several years' fine-tuning the winery's vision in the vineyard and in the cellar. Including small amounts of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, it's a rounded, concentrated wine that expresses the vintage with ripe, grippy tannins that beg for further resolution. Blackberry, clove and leather flavors rise to the fore. Cellar through 2035.",95,Inglenook 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"Coming from the winery's estate vineyard high up in Upper Mill Creek, this wine is starting to show a bit of age, offering aromas of anise, dried cherry, green pepper and cigar ash. Equal parts dark and green, the flavors come off a bit disjointed, with bell-pepper notes on the finish.",88,Walla Walla Vintners 2012 Cut Bank Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"A wine that is proof that not all powerful wines also need high alcohol, this intense 13% ABV wine is concentrated, almost black in its color, a classic Malbec. It has all the solid tannins, structure, the darkest of black plums and licorice flavors. It should age well.",93,Jean-Luc Baldès 2006 Clos Triguedina Probus Malbec (Cahors)
"A wine that reveals its rich, jammy fruit slowly. When it arrives, the fruit is soft and generous, with strawberry jam and red plum flavors. It also has intense fresh acidity, a dry tannic core and aging potential.",90,Joseph Drouhin 2009  Côte de Beaune-Villages
Abbazia di Novacella presents a focused and bright expression of Gewürztraminer that delivers fresh fruit and honeysuckle followed by zesty lime and wild sage. The wine shows soft thickness and creaminess on the close. Very nice.,88,Abbazia di Novacella 2011 Gewürztraminer (Alto Adige)
"Produced from low-yield organic grapes grown close to the sea, this wine is intense and ripe. Smooth strawberry flavors are lifted with wild thyme and pepper. Bone dry, juicy and full of concentrated flavor, the wine comes from an estate owned by Lord and Lady Bamford.",91,Château Léoube 2015 Secret de Léoube Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This blend of Malbec, Bonarda, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon is oaky and minty up front, with pencil lead and exotic blueberry aromas. In the mouth, this has a fast pulse, while flavors of Middle Eastern spices, cassis and blueberry finish briny but short.",87,Don Miguel Gascón 2011 Colosal Red (Mendoza)
"It's great to return to an excellent honest-tasting fruit-driven wine that has very good balance, an appetizing texture thanks to fine-grained tannins and light spicy elements to complement the pure cherry and berry core. It's the kind of wine that doesn't get tiring, and will be ideal to stock up on.",90,Marietta Cellars NV Old Vine Red Lot 66 Red (California)
"An exciting flagship wine from one of the best producers in Piedmont, this is dark, inky and penetrating. It offers beautifully intense aromas of cassis, dried forest berry, ginger, cola, leather, and cedar. On the palate, it shows an incredibly silky and long quality. Hold for 10–20 years.",95,Michele Chiarlo 2006 Cerequio Riserva  (Barolo)
"Light, clean, fresh aromas of tropical fruits and lychee resemble those of a Torrontés. The palate is light and mild, while flavors of melon, lychee and citrus pith are forward but don't come with a lot of backing or complexity.",86,Mil Piedras 2013 Viognier (Vista Flores)
"You can smell a hint of ginger spice in the bouquet of this wine, presumably from the splash of Gewürz in this Chenin- and Chardonnay-dominant blend. Otherwise, notes of yellow peach, toasted brioche and ripe melon abound, with a good acidic lift to the close to keep things fresh.",86,Push Me to the Floor 2010 White (Coastal Region)
"Utilizing only ambient yeasts and bottled without fining or filtration, this is a showcase of winemaker Kim Engle's devotion to natural winemaking. Dry in style with savory apple, orange rind and a whiff of apple cider vinegar on the nose and palate, the finish is long with a pleasant orange pekoe tea note.",86,Bloomer Creek 2008 Dry Wild Yeast Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"This wine is big, very full bodied and very lush in texture. Super-ripe in flavor, it rides at the place where plum notes segue to prune, and black cherry to cherry syrup, which is a very tasty place to be. Plenty of fine tannins frame all that concentration, yet the mouthfeel stays soft.",89,Perry Creek 2012 Altitude 2401 Reserve Fair Play Farms Barbera (California)
"Cassis, bell pepper, toast, French oak and coconut lead the nose. The aromas carry over to the tightly wound palate along with raw red currant, powdered sage, licorice and a confectionery note. Close-grained tannins leave a rather astringent finish.",90,Tua Rita 2013 Redigaffi Merlot (Toscana)
"This deeply-colored wine has a bouquet of cherry, pomegranate and white chocolate. It has flavors of black cherry jam, anise, mocha and a touch of orange peel. Mouth-coating tannins provide a matrix for an interesting touch of spiciness that gives way to a final taste of pomegranate.",91,Recanati 2013 Special Reserve Red (Galilee)
"Intense aromas of savory spice and smoke lend a mysterious tone to flavors of pressed apple and pear in this dry, medium-bodied Riesling. The palate is bright with lemon-lime acidity, but finishes on a dusty mineral note.",85,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt 2012 Wiltinger Trocken Riesling (Mosel)
"Spicy and briary, suggesting wild forest berries, nettles, chamomile, bitter greens and black pepper. Drink this exotically dry, tannic wine with roast lamb prepared with garlic and rosemary.",89,Benessere 2006 BK Collins Old Vines Zinfandel (Napa Valley)
"This leads with plum, vanilla, barrel spice and herb aromas. The palate is soft and velvety, keeping the vineyard's often burly tannins well in check and providing a lot of textural appeal. Cocoa notes linger on the finish, delivering a yum factor that is hard to ignore.",90,Januik 2014 Klipsun Vineyard Merlot (Red Mountain)
"There's a cider-like tone to this spry semisweet wine. Bruised apple and pear flavors balance savory and sweet against a backdrop of zesty lemon. It's a rustic, yet refreshing, Riesling for everyday enjoyment.",85,Ventosa 2013 Semi Sweet Riesling (Seneca Lake)
"Smooth on the nose, this smells fruity, honest and whole. Dark flavors of blue fruits and peppery spices are a little shallow, while the finish shows mild Cafayate tannins and not much bite.",89,El Esteco 2013 Don David Reserve Malbec (Calchaquí Valley)
"This is tan in color, with a flat, murky nose of stone-fruit aromas and chemical harshness. A round, oily textured palate tastes of briny nectarine and pithy bitterness. In many ways, this is like sucking on a peach pit.",83,SignoSeis 2014 The Angel Oak Rosé (Valle de Uco)
"Easton's basic Zin offers plenty of delicious pleasure. It's a dry, smoothly tannic wine, packed with wild blackberry, mulberry, mocha and (believe it or not) ollallieberry flavors, which perhaps suggests a certain rural, old-fashioned quality. The wine is also superspicy in white pepper and nutmeg. Great value.",90,Easton 2006 Zinfandel (Amador County)
"While this dense wine has plenty of firm tannins, it also has fine, ripe fruit. Rich blackberry flavors and smoky aromas dominate. Drink from 2020.",91,Château Haut Dina 2015  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux
"With a deep amber color and luminous copper highlights, this Moscato-based dessert wine from central Italy boasts pretty aromas of caramel, chestnut honey, pinecone and candied orange. There are well-integrated toasted or nutty notes in the background. It's a full and sophisticated wine with a masculine, brooding personality and lightly candied fruit on the close.",91,Barberani 2005 Moscato Passito Villa Monticelli Moscato (Umbria)
"It hardly matters what varieties this white blend is made from. It's just fine for a ten buck wine, with sweet citrus fruit and vanilla flavors and a nice kick of acidity.",84,MommyJuice NV White (Central Coast)
"Soft and so easy to drink, this is a fresh and fruity wine with gentle red fruits and light acidity. Attractive, it's crisply ready to enjoy.",84,Les Maîtres Vignerons de la Presqu'île de Saint-Tropez 2014 Cep d'Or Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Definitely on the dry side, showing the tannic face of Pinot Noir. This is a serious wine that reflects its status as a premier cru, a powerful mix of cranberry fruits and dark tannins, but marked by a hot, hard aftertaste.",88,Louis Latour 2005 Les Chaillots Premier Cru  (Aloxe-Corton)
"Fragances of wild berries, bramble and honeysuckle pave the way for flavors of cherry cola, toffee and tangerine zest. This is soft and round in the mouth, with tannins that are almost imperceptible at first yet last through the finish, hand-in-hand with remarkably bright acidity.",90,Recanati 2010 David Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Galilee)
"Leathery blackberry, vanilla and tobacco aromas include a gritty burnt note that's not entirely welcome. This feels full and oaky, with good balance. Oak-based flavors of vanilla and mocha sit atop black-fruit notes, while this is balanced yet tannic on the finish, with a lingering flavor of vanilla. Drink from 2018–2023.",89,Emina 2014 Prestigio Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"Rich blackberry and chocolate form around chalky tannins and a juicy palate, with a waft of cigar in the distance. Medium bodied, round and soft, the finish is brushed in cherry and pomegranate.",90,Louis M. Martini 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Sugary sweet and simple, with pleasant pineapple, peach, pear, floral and vanilla flavors.",83,Domaine de la Terre Rouge 2006 Roussanne (Sierra Foothills)
"A tart, short, sharp entry leads into raspberry and strawberry flavors, underscored with a light earthiness. The youthful fruit and bright acidity suggests it will show improvement with further bottle age, as the tannins smooth out.",87,Bateaux Cellars 2011 Bon Vin Rouge Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"This opens with a delicate and enticing fragrance of white and yellow flowers, hay and beeswax. The palate delivers flavors of golden apple, peach and lemon, with an almond accent. The smooth, weightless texture is brightened by fresh acidity.",87,Conti di Buscareto 2012  Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi
"Jumpy, jammy aromas of foxy black fruits are slightly volatile. This has a narrow mouthfeel that's high in acidity. Blackened berry flavors are spicy and peppery, while this Tannat is toasty on a live-wire acidic finish.",86,Familia Deicas 2015 Valle de los Manantiales Vineyard Tannat
"This is a beautiful wine with opulent aromas of chocolate fudge, cherry, vanilla bean and bright berry fruit. Yet in the mouth, it's is very focused, with enough structure and acidity to promise a long future. The finish is silky and fine.",94,San Polo 2006 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Ripe honeydew and peach notes lend a welcome touch of richness to this dry, slightly stark Riesling. The midpalate bristles with acidity, finishing tart and citrusy.",86,Binz 2013 Nackenheimer Kabinett Trocken Riesling (Rheinhessen)
"Like all Alsace rosé, this wine is made from Pinot Noir. It's dry, with delicious, crisp acidity and a flavor of wild raspberry. A great summer apéritif.",85,Gustave Lorentz 2011 Le Rosé (Alsace)
"Wiry, slightly grassy aromas of raspberry and plum come with a touch of oaky vanilla. This Malbec feels downright hard and choppy due to tough gritty tannins. Plum and berry flavors come in blips rather than a harmonious whole, and this tastes of lactic oak and rubber on the finish.",87,Gimenez Riili 2013 Padres Dedicados Malbec (Mendoza)
"After starting out somewhat reduced, this becomes aromatic with notes of char, coffee grounds, toast, herbs and dark cherries. It's seamless, silky and rich in feel, with layered fruit and barrel flavors and a beguiling sense of texture.",91,J. Bookwalter 2012 Foreshadow Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Tender pure peach and fine spicy notions of grapefruit zest unite to create a very inviting nose. The leafiness of fragrant citrus foliage adds extra charm. All these notions continue to play on the very zesty, thoroughly aromatic palate. Citrus flesh and peel shimmers and swirls across mind and palate, creating a dreamy, heightened cloud of fragrant freshness. The palate is just off dry and lip-smackingly bright and fresh. A triumphantly long finish adds the allure of blood orange to this seductive, aromatic wine and makes it utterly irresistible. Drink 2017–2037.",96,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2015 Steingrubler Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"Fragrant and fruity, this very fresh wine has a strong mineral texture. The freshness gives way to a deeper, rich sense that brings out a more creamy character. It's ripe and rich at the end.",90,Casal Paço Padreiro 2013 Aphros Ten White (Vinho Verde)
"Classy aromas of pear, stone fruits and resiny but controlled oak lead to a pure, moderately woody and balanced palate that delivers ripe apple, melon and peach flavors along with oak backing. Vanilla and walnut flavors grace a nicely textured, creamy yet lively finish.",90,Salentein 2012 Plot N°2 Single Vineyard Chardonnay (Uco Valley)
"Ripe plum and berry aromas share the nose with heavy oak notes. This Tempranillo feels dry and tannic, while initially it tastes mostly like sawdust and oak. Deep digging and patience reveal briary berry and salty notes amid a lot of wood.",87,Martín Berdugo 2012 Barrica  (Ribera del Duero)
"Apple, pear and spice aromas lead to medium-bodied fruit flavors that manage to remain light on their feet. The finish seems a bit clipped but it still delivers enjoyment.",88,Pacific Crest 2015 Centennial Trail Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Here's a beautiful expression of Barolo with finely textured tannins, bright acidity, drying talc powder or mineral notes and tons of fresh berry and cherry intensity. This is a particularly refined and elegant wine that, when aged a few more years in the bottle, will pair with veal, pork or beef.",92,Palladino 2006 Serralunga  (Barolo)
"Mature, toasty aromas give this wine an immediate sophistication. It is full in the mouth, showing almonds, ripe toastiness, coffee and tight acidity. It's ripe and full-bodied while keeping a more nervy character that allows it to finish with a great lift. It's ready to drink.",93,Moët & Chandon 1999 Grand Vintage Collection Brut  (Champagne)
"Dark in style, with graham cracker, shoe polish, hard spice and blackberry aromas. It feels staunch and edgy, then tastes deep, with a blackberry flavor backed by rubber and chocolate. The finish is marked with cocoa powder and vanilla notes.",88,Sur de los Andes 2009 Gran Reserva Malbec (Mendoza)
"This opens with an enticing fragrance of rose, violet, dark berry and underbrush. The firm palate delivers juicy wild cherry, cinnamon and star anise alongside firm but fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2018–2028.",92,Tenuta San Giorgio 2010 Ugolforte  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Unripe, with strong lemongrass, green pea and feline spray flavors accompanying more pleasant lemons and limes. Acidity is strong, and the wine is totally dry.",84,Kissos 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"This is a big-boned, dusty varietal wine, aged in 50% new French oak. Oak spice scents enwrap its leathery blackberry and black currant flavors, finishing on a bittersweet taste of tobacco.",88,Keating 2012 Montecillo Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Moon Mountain District Sonoma County)
"You'll find an unusual note of freshly crushed black pepper in this Pinot Noir. Not overwhelming, but enough to vie with the cherries, cola and sandalwood. It's an excellent wine, dry and silky, although not on a par with the magnificent 2007.",90,Sequana 2008 Sundawg Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Green Valley)
"This Chambourcin has medium-intense aromas of chocolate-covered cherries, dill and caramel popcorn. The medium-bodied palate feels limp due to soft tannins and languid acids.",82,Les Bourgeois 2010 Collector's Series Chambourcin (Missouri)
"This is a very light expression of the grape from a San Francisco-based producer, with thyme, chaparral, cranberry, tart pomegranate juice and wet clay on the nose. The palate shows light, tangy cherry juice, fennel, crushed olive and peppery spice. It will work well for fans of this style, but there's not enough there to entertain the mainstream Pinot Noir fan.",90,Ryan Cochrane 2014 Fiddlestix Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Spicy, seductive and stemmy, this wine from the coveted vineyard site is a celebration of baked rhubarb and cranberry. Velvety on the palate and boldly ripe and rich, it offers highlights of spicy black tea and cardamom that complements and complicates the fruit.",94,Saintsbury 2015 Pratt Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"A darkly tannic wine, showing a dry side of Pinot Noir but still offering some good berry fruits and raspberry sweetness. The acidity needs to soften, though.",87,Domaine Jayer-Gilles 2007  Côte de Nuits-Villages
"Tropical fruit and citrus aromas turn toward air freshener and bath soap upon airing. This feels standard for Torrontés, maybe even a bit flabby, with lychee and melon flavors that finish chalky.",85,Trapiche 2012 Broquel Torrontés (Cafayate)
"Firmly tannic, this young, wood-aged wine is dark and brooding. It has a dense texture and the potential of ripe black fruits and powerful tannins. With a fine future ahead of it, the wine needs to age. Drink from 2018.",90,Cortes de Cima 2013 Trincadeira (Alentejano)
"Too acidic and tart in wintergreen flavors, a real disappointment from this well-regarded vineyard. On the plus side, it's bone dry and silky, and shows cherry and cola flavors accented with sweet, smoky oak. Ready to drink now.",85,Pali 2008 Keefer Ranch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Tender, fresh yeasty notes play among citrus, insinuating stones and ripe, yellow plums that unfold completely on the slender but ripe palate. Lemon blossom and fresh lemon juice keep a tight hold around the burgeoning plum fruit. Underneath it all is comforting and grounding earthiness. While its aromas soar, this wine keeps both its feet firmly on the ground.",94,Domäne Wachau 2013 Kellerberg Smaragd Riesling (Wachau)
"This second red wine from the estate was aged in wood for six months. That shows in the smooth character of the ripe Merlot that dominates the blend. The wine is ripe with black-currant jelly fruits that are lifted by the acidity. Drink the wine young, from 2018.",86,Château Alta Gaïa 2012 No. 2  (Bordeaux Supérieur)
"Here's a rich, ripe, opulent Syrah, all jammy blackberry, cherry and currant flavors, sprinkled with black pepper and housed in a structure of firm, strong tannins. It's a blend of some of the best vineyards in the county, including Bien Nacido, Larner and Ampelos. Drink now–2015.",92,Jaffurs 2010 Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"This is heavy and raisiny, with ripe earth and mineral aromas that are suggestive of Port. It feels loaded and scratchy, with licorice, prune and pepper flavors that finish short and with some heat. A bullish style to drink now.",87,Cyan 2010 8 Meses  (Toro)
"Aromas of freshly cut wood, pickling spices, vanilla dark cherry lead to plentiful black-fruit flavors, supported by lightly astringent tannins. There are good things underneath but the wood gets in the way.",87,Merry Cellars 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Dark fruit aromas lead a rustic, earthy, smoky bouquet towards a crisp, healthy palate with ample oak that creates a buttery taste to accent dry berry flavors, a light herbal character and pepper. Fresh, solid and well oaked.",88,Viña Bisquertt 2008 Ecos de Rulo Merlot (Colchagua Valley)
Forward aromas and flavors of vanilla and melted butter give a lot of richness to this medium-bodied wine. It has a candy-like quality and a creamy sweet-seeming finish.,87,Bliss 2016 Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Mendocino)
"An impressive mouthfeel is the standout characteristic of this full-bodied, balanced and elegant wine. It smells and tastes subtly delicious, with restrained rather than overripe cherry and plum flavors, but the way the velvety texture of tannins and acidity surround the fruit and carry it through to the finish is remarkable. The blend holds Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah.",92,Terre Rouge 2012 L'Autre Red (Sierra Foothills)
"A blend of Shiraz and Touriga Nacional, this pink-colored selection is bright, crisp and full of red fruit flavors. It is soft and a touch sweet, though it finishes with crisp acidity. Screwcap.",84,Falua 2011 Tagus Creek Rosé (Tejo)
"The top rosé from old vines at Grand Boise, this is a ripe, well-structured and balanced wine. The fruit is right up front, raspberries and red plums along with a lightly herbal element. The high-altitude vineyard (up to 2,000 feet) gives a cool, crisp aftertaste to this impressive wine.",93,Château Grand Boise 2015 Cuvée Jadis Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Pure and driving, but also acidic and woody in aromas and flavors. Can't say that this barrel fermented Viura-based white is Muga's best wine. It's crisp with green apple and pineapple, but also a little sour and simple. With 10% Malvasia.",84,Muga 2008 Barrel Fermented Viura (Rioja)
"Pale copper in color, this 100% varietal wine—all of which hails from Weinbau Vineyard—is lighter in style, with notes of cherry and spice. There's a viscous feel to the fruit flavors and a touch of sweetness.",87,Tamarack Cellars 2013 Rosé of Mourvèdre (Wahluke Slope)
"A great effort for the estate's inaugural white, this expertly restrained Viognier hails from a region where the grape tends toward overripeness. Crisp apple blossoms, daffodil, white peach and chalk aromas give way to a mellow palate of pear, apple, nectarine and jasmine-like flavors.",89,Record Family Wines 2016 Viognier (Paso Robles)
"The winemaker aged this wine for 20 months in 100% new French oak, resulting in an oak-dominated product that bears notes of buttered toast, butterscotch and caramel. Green apple and pear flavors can be found, but they're basically swamped.",84,Super Sonoman 2010 Chardonnay (Green Valley)
"The wine is light but it also has very fine fruitiness and great balanced acidity. With a creamy texture and touches of yellow fruit as well as citrus, the wine is refreshingly fruity with great final acidity in a ripe rounded context. Drink now.",87,Domaine du Tariquet 2016 Chardonnay (Côtes de Gascogne)
"92-94 Ripe blackcurrants, powerful fruit, with great acidity and enticing dusty tannins. The wine brings out juicy Merlot flavors, with a more concentrated element.",93,Château Palmer 2010 Barrel sample Alter Ego de Château Palmer  (Margaux)
"This vineyard selection captures the defining character of this tiny AVA—an underlying streak of gun metal, and an overall austerity that belies the complexity and subtle length of the wine. Tart cranberry fruit brings supporting acidity, and the wine rewards your attention with extra length and detail. Drink 2018 to 2028.",91,Raptor Ridge 2014 Meredith Mitchell Vineyard Pinot Noir (McMinnville)
"A true family effort—bottled with help of Jim Clendenen's kids, Knox and Isabelle—this deep, creamy and balanced wine shows honeyed almond, buttercream and Meyer lemon aromas. There's a grapefruit-skin freshness to the palate, rounded out with a warmth recalling toasted brioche and pecans that carries into the finish.",93,Clendenen Family 2012 Le Bon Climat Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"This beautiful vintage of Paleo (an oak-aged expression of Cabernet Franc) shows dark, inky intensity and loads of mature black fruit, spice, plum, prune and blackberry. It is extremely smooth and rich with a long-lasting fade that consists of fruit and clove-like flavors. Yet, the tannins are still firm, so put this wine aside in your cellar for at least five years.",96,Le Macchiole 2006 Paleo Cabernet Franc (Toscana)
"Made from 20% of each major red Bordeaux variety, this wine is rich with cedar, resin and a ripe plum notes. Tart acidity offsets the fruitier aspects, dotted with black pepper and leather flavors.",86,Soquel Vineyards 2014 Intreccio Library Selection Red (Napa Valley)
"This faint, elusive wine takes lightness and low alcohol to pronounced levels, offering intense lemon and Asian pear around a tight core of acidity. From the Pratt Vineyard, it spent time aging in both new air-dried Vosges oak barrels and small stainless steel.",88,Inman Family 2013 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Crushed violet petals, plum, roasty coffee and cocoa dusted black cherry aromas all welcome you on the bouquet of this wine. The round mouth is just as opulent and inviting, with more dark fruit and mocha notes backed by sweet spice. Tasty and easy to drink.",89,Beau Joubert 2007 Merlot (Stellenbosch)
"This is a remarkably detailed Cabernet that shows off everything Napa has to give in the way of flash and richness. It's dry, yet lush with ripe blackberry, blueberry and cassis flavors and plenty of toasty new oak. The tannins are as soft and complex as any in the world, making this wine beautiful to drink now.",92,Keating 2010 Beckstoffer Georges III Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"Heavy, generic cherry aromas are a touch volatile. This feels full and bouncy, with juicy acidity. Flavors of black fruits are ripe but lack complexity, while this is hot and raspy on the finish.",85,François Lurton 2015 Araucano Humo Blanco Edicion Limitada Pinot Noir (Lolol Valley)
"A ripe and perfumed wine, this is well structured with a touch of crisp minerality as well as melon and peach fruits. It is smooth, balanced and ready to drink.",87,Quinta da Alorna 2016 Verdelho (Tejo)
"From its cellar in Aÿ, this small négociant buys grapes from a range of villages. This signature wine is soft with a crisp background and delicate acidity. Rounded and full of white fruit on the finish, it's ready to drink.",88,Brimoncourt NV Brut Régence  (Champagne)
"Part of the Thienot Champagne group, Canard-Dûchene is only now getting distribution in this country. This top Blanc de Blancs is rich, full-bodied with some softness, but also retaining a good mineral, tight texture.",87,Canard-Duchêne NV Charles VII Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)
"In color and mouthfeel, this resembles Pinot Noir. It's moving quickly toward maturity, with soft, round flavors of strawberry pastry. The concentration and lingering finish are a plus. Drink up now through 2017.",88,Delfino 2011 Dolcetto (Umpqua Valley)
"BlackJack is sourced from the oldest block in the vineyard, planted in 1965. In this warm, ripe vintage it shows lovely blackberry and black cherry fruit, fully ripened and wreathed in streaks of smoke, ground coffee and dark chocolate.",91,David Hill 2012 Estate BlackJack Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Pink-grapefruit rind, sea salt, Meyer lemon and nectarine aromas show on the nose of this wine made by Santa Barbara-raised Steve Gerbac. The medium-bodied palate offers light touches of pan-seared apples, white peaches and tangerine peel with a deliciously salty edge to it all.",90,Rusack 2014 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County)
"Rubbery on the nose, then sharp in the mouth, with herbal, sour plum flavors and weird funk as well. Bitter, tart and hard on the finish.",80,Finca El Origen 2010 Syrah (Mendoza)
"Aromas of acacia flower, toasted nut and graphite lead the nose on this serious white. The structured palate offers mature yellow apple, honey, orange zest and almond alongside soft acidity. It closes on a lemon drop note.",89,Alessio Komjanc 2015 Friulano (Collio)
"This opens with subdued aromas that suggest cured meat, leather, menthol and tilled soil. The palate offers dried black cherry, dark baking spice and a hint of licorice alongside nervous acidity and assertive, tightly wound tannins.",88,Lecci e Brocchi 2013  Chianti Classico
"There's a strong, nutty character to this bubbly, with accents of Granny Smith apple, toast and lemon rind citrus on the nose and mouth. The rich mouth is full and satisfying, but the alcohol is a bit warming on the close.",85,Delmas 2007 Cuvée Berlène Brut Sparkling (Blanquette de Limoux)
"Always a powerful wine, this has the added benefit of being produced from a fine vintage, yielding a hugely dense and concentrated bottling. Power comes from the ripe blackberry and black currant fruit and from the dark, firm tannins. Age this wine at least five years.",93,Quinta do Portal 2009 Grande Reserva Red (Douro)
"This trocken (dry) Riesling comes across as slightly rounded, almost plump, in texture, yet retains strong acids. Poached pear, damp moss and citrus notes come together in a pleasingly harmonious fashion, finishing clean and crisp.",89,Melsheimer 2010 Trocken Riesling (Mosel)
"This blend of 60% Sangiovese 25% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon boasts enticing dark berry, menthol, new leather and dark spice notes. The taut palate doles out black cherry, cassis and licorice flavors, with a pleasant hint of game and fine-grained tannins. Drink 2019–2027.",92,Selvapiana 2012 Villa di Petrognano Red (Pomino)
"This shows the problems of overripe fruit that plagued many 2009s. It is soft, giving the impression of sweetness, with the structure vastly understated. Juicy and fruity, this is ready to drink now.",86,Château Clos de Sarpe 2009  Saint-Émilion
"This Barolo Riserva delivers loads of pleasure and good cheer thanks to those delicious aromas of melted chocolate, vanilla cream and bursting red cherry. Ethereal tones of spice, cola and licorice color the close and help give dimension to the wine's soft, velvety texture.",92,Franco Conterno 2005 Bussia Munie Riserva  (Barolo)
"A smooth, soft and full wine, rich in fruits and warm acidity. A touch of minerality expresses the chalk soil of the vineyard. Still dominated by young fruitiness, it will be better in 2015.",91,Domaine Cherrier et Fils 2013  Sancerre
"Tart white peach and plum notes are fresh and fragrant throughout this crisp, mineral-driven Chardonnay. It's satisfyingly plump in mouthfeel, yet vivacious and crisp on the finish. Drink now through 2016.",89,Pflüger 2013 Quarzit Chardonnay (Pfalz)
"A spritzy and effervescent selection, the carbonation helps to lift the inherent sweet fruit aromas and flavors of guava, peach and mushy pear. An ideal choice for a warm summer day by the pool, served very cold.",84,Makulu NV Sustainable Agriculture Perlè Moscato (Western Cape)
"Dusty tannins, ripe fruit and concentrated structure point to a wine that is going to age well. It also has great perfumes and juicy black-currant fruits that are going to be delicious as the wine ages. Drink this wine from 2026.",92,Barão de Vilar 2015 Feuerheerd Vintage  (Port)
"This is a full, ripe wine. It has red fruits, black currants and a rich seam of tannins. There is also a smoky character that adds attraction. With a ripe aftertaste, the wine is developing well and should be ready from 2018.",90,Château de Cornemps 2014 Cuvée Prestige  (Bordeaux Supérieur)
"This Bordeaux-style blend is 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 29% Petit Verdot and 9% Merlot. The PV shows through in the ripe, textural tannins. The concentrated berry and cassis fruit is annotated with barrel notes of vanilla, coffee and tobacco. This is a hand-crafted wine with distinctive, albeit somewhat rustic, appeal.",91,Ott & Murphy 2009 Intrépide Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Earthy aromas include notes of animal hide and leather along with herbal berry. This offers a good, round mouthfeel and bracing acidity, while flavors of berry and cassis are mildly green and herbal. A short finish is fresh in feel.",87,Viu Manent 2011 Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"Value and quality come with Faustino's 2007 rosé. Red licorice nibs, spice and cherry-raspberry aromas set it off in the right direction. The palate is wide, but good acidity keeps the nectarine and sweet grapefruit flavors on target. Dry, pithy and fleshy on the finish. It's the type of dry rosé that we want to drink.",88,Bodegas Faustino 2007 Faustino V Rosado Rosé (Rioja)
"This is very fresh, with light acidity and a touch of caramel. Its round character is contrasted with tangerine crispness.",87,Château Gassier 2011 Sables d'Azur Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"A deep gold color combines with ripe fruit aromas and assertive, seductive oak flavors like vanilla and nutmeg in this full-bodied, lush-textured, unapologetic California Chardonnay. A layer of the tasty oak flavors stays strong on the finish.",90,Alta 2012 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"This is an immediately attractive and approachable wine, with direct and intense aromas and flavors of black cherry, plum and boysenberry accented by notes of sweet smoke, mocha and pepper. Firm yet approachable, this is well-balanced with structured tannins and ample acidity. Drink from 2015-2018.",91,Gérard Bertrand 2011 Grand Terroir Tautavel Grenache-Syrah-Carignan Red (Côtes du Roussillon Villages Tautavel)
"This wine is lightly structured with tannins and shows red berry and cherry fruit, although with little varietal character. It's attractively juicy due to its acidity and perfumed aftertaste. Drink now.",84,Florent Descombe NV Pinot Noir (Vin de France)
"Tremendously sweet in blackberry, chocolate and vanilla oak flavors, with a fine bite of acidity. It's a satisfying dessert wine for drinking with chocolate, or try pecan pie, but it would score far higher if it were richer.",88,Prager 2006 Petite Sirah Port (California)
"This wine opens with ripe berry tones and light touches of moist earth and dried beef. It's simple but clean, and finishes with a bright cherry accent.",85,Natale Verga 2008 Il Poggio dei Vigneti  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo)
"From a site with elevation rising as high as 2,200 feet, this wine delivers tremendous complexity and minerality, the grapes from volcanic soils. Meaty, with a wisp of smoky char, it's ripe and full bodied in cherry and cassis, nuances of bay leaf and rocky tannin.",92,Jackson Estate 2012 Hawkeye Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Dry spice and minty aromas cover up mild berry fruit scents. This is clunky and jammy in feel, with stewed berry and saucy flavors. The finish is herbal in general, with a chunky weight to it.",85,Belasco de Baquedano 2011 Llama Old Vine Malbec (Luján de Cuyo)
"This Reserve somehow didn't show quite as well as  Pikes's regular bottling, though it's still a very good wine. It's a little viscous in the mouth, with straw, lemon rind and mineral flavors that flow through the finish.",88,Pikes 2001 Reserve Riesling (Clare Valley)
"Dry, mossy berry aromas carry punch, while this well-built Malbec feels concentrated but not heavy. Peppery, blackened berry flavors spill over with a black-coffee note on a slightly hot finish. Drink through 2020.",91,Don Manuel Villafañe 2013 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza)
"Notes of crushed berries on polished mahogany come to mind. This is elegant and classic, its strucure is firm but not imposing, the tone is one of subtlety and elegance. This stands straight and presents honest, dark fruit and leaves with a long, velvety train of spiced berry, more mahogany and a touch of forest floor Very alluring.",93,Gebeshuber 2013 Große Reserve Red (Thermenregion)
"Barolo Riva is a fantastic wine with enormous personality and charm. At the outset, the wine appears modern and bold with determined aromas of black fruit and spice. But wait a second and the wine will surprise you with its sassy complexity and finesse. Give it 10 more years of cellar aging. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers.",94,Claudio Alario 2006 Riva  (Barolo)
"This top wine from a major Cahors estate shows the potential of great Malbec. With its dense tannins, rich black fruit flavors, acidity and restrained power, it is a major force. Even with all its weight, it's stylish, complex and ageworthy wine. Drink from 2021.",95,Château du Cèdre 2014 GC Malbec (Cahors)
"Rich and rounded, it's full of ripe yellow fruits cut through with fresh acidity. Broad and well-balanced, it's ready to drink, but will be better at the end of 2014.",89,Domaine Perraud 2012  Mâcon La Roche Vineuse
"A blend of 80% Sangiovese, 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot, this wine begins with aromas of oak, vanilla, toast and espresso. The palate offers up ripe black cherry, black currant and coffee sweetened with vanilla. It finishes on a note of drying wood tannins.",87,La Castellina 2010 Tommaso Bojola Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"This undergoes a second fermentation in bottle that leaves a slight sediment at the bottom. Aromas recall delicate white flower, green apple, citrus and bread crust. The vibrant palate offers ripe Bartlett pear, nectarine and candied ginger accompanied by a creamy perlage. It's balanced with lively acidity.",87,Drusian 2013 Col Fondo  (Prosecco Treviso)
"This is a difficult wine to analyze: Even after some hours of breathing time, it seems resolutely shuttered, tart and actually a bit on the thin side. Given the track record of both the producer and the vineyard, it was unexpected. Another taste on the second day showed promise. With time, the score could improve.",90,Betz Family 2010 La Serenne Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"This is the winery's first Merlot. It's a simple, pleasant effort, fruit forward and lightly oaky. The usual flavors of berry are there, and the balance is fine; it just could use more concentration through the finish.",87,Dumas Station 2005 Estate Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This sunny, off-dry Scheurebe juxtaposes bright yellow-cherry and plum flavors against a backdrop of grapefruit acidity. Made from biodynamically grown grapes and fermented with indigenous yeasts, the finish is accented by curious hints of milk chocolate and vanilla.",88,Brüder Dr. Becker 2012 Kabinett Scheurebe (Rheinhessen)
"The top cuvée of Sauvignon Blanc from the Borgo Conventi estate, now owned by Ruffino but still run by the Vescovo family. This is a huge, rich, forward style of Sauvignon, very ripe and tropical. Yet it has a layer of crisp, grassy fruit that gives it balance and poise.",91,Borgo Conventi 2002 Sauvignon Blanc (Collio)
"Intense, enticing aromas of violet, rose and leather lead the nose along with an earthy whiff of game. The palate is still young and primary, but already offers red berry, licorice, white pepper and cinnamon. Tightly wound, assertive tannins and bright acidity provide balance. Drink after 2020.",92,Attilio Ghisolfi 2012 Bussia  (Barolo)
"This wine has a very direct appeal, with blueberry and boysenberry fruit, shot through with notes of earth and mushroom. The palate is juicy, smooth and reasonably crisp. Medium finish shows notes of forest floor and no tannin. Try with tuna in a bold sauce.",85,Messina Hof 2006 Private Reserve Double Barrel Shiraz (Texas)
"Based on the Roêda vineyard, this opulent, fruity wine is dense, beautifully ripe, a powerhouse of sweet fruit, figs and raisins, plum jelly and the roundest, most generous tannins. It's a wine that will show well in the next few years, but which should age magnificently.",93,Croft 2009 Vintage  (Port)
"Starting to show its age with a pale golden hue, this fumé is classy and restrained. Aromas of waxy lemon, pineapple and green bean mingle with base notes of butterscotch and smoke from the oak. The palate offers less excitement with the fruit disappearing some and searing acidity taking over. Nevertheless, this wine would be a versatile pairing for a variety of dishes.",89,Goose Bay 2014 Kosher Reserve Fumé Sauvignon Blanc (South Island)
"This light- to medium-bodied Shiraz is crisp and tart, yet also shows some dried-fruit character on the finish.",83,Andrew Peace 2009 Masterpeace Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)
"Dolcetto Vigna Costa Fiore opens with a dense, modern appearance and big aromas of ripe fruit and mature blackberry. There's also a touch of Band Aid or wet animal at the back that is barely perceptible now, but that may worsen with time. The wine is chewy and bright on the close.",86,Cascina Adelaide 2008 Vigna Costa Fiore  (Dolcetto di Diano d'Alba)
"This aromatic wine suggests green apple, tangerine and flowers. It drinks dry with stone fruit and citrus flavors that have a fleshy feel.",88,Kennedy Shah 2012 Reserve DuBrul Vineyard Riesling (Yakima Valley)
"Acidity and tannins give this dry Cabernet a fine structure, providing the architecture for proper varietal flavors of blackberry and tobacco. It's a nice wine for drinking now.",87,Proverbial 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Very ripe and soft, this has blackberry, plum and chocolate flavors that veer toward prune and raisin territory. It's dry, spicy and a little hot, but is a great example of a warm-climate Zin at the highest level.",90,Zahtila 2008 Oat Hill Estate Zinfandel (Calistoga)
Stone fruit and slightly funky yet natural aromas get this organic and biodynamic varietal Xarello off to a good start. A standard mouthfeel along with apple and banana flavors finish clean but nothing more. From 67-year-old vines.,88,Albet I Noya 2014 El Fanio Organic Xarel-lo (Penedès)
"Subtle notions of ripe peach circle above a compact, bundled palate of peach and spice: perhaps vanilla, perhaps pepper. The distinct but subtle sweetness on the palate is countered by a firm, focussed freshness which in turn contrasts with pleasant warmth. The dramatic palate draws you so far into its quicksand-like depth that you almost forget to notice the more ethereal, scented clouds of peach. Pure joy.",94,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Goldert Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Gifford Hirlinger's Stateline Red is perhaps the least-known best-value wine in the Walla Walla AVA. The blend changes radically from year to year—this is 83% Cabernet with splashes of Malbec, Tinta Cão, Tempranillo and Petit Verdot. Focused and concentrated, it has a streak of orange and cherry liqueur, and yummy highlights of coffee cake.",91,Gifford Hirlinger 2009 Stateline Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Ripe aromas of dark fruit, crème de cassis and cherry liqueur. The wine is thick, juicy and chewy, with a touch of tightness or astringency on the close.",90,Terre Nere 2006 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Roussanne (58%) takes the lead on this wine, with the balance Viognier. White flowers, peach and lees aromas lead to lightly styled stone-fruit flavors that display a sense of elegance. It all seems a bit faint but provides appeal.",88,Ardor 2016 Lawrence Vineyard White (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Floral-based aromas of violet and blueberry announce this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot that also smells of hickory and campfire. A choppy, drawn-in palate is herbal and savory, with blatant oak accenting earthy berry flavors. A roasted finish with hard tannins calls for more aging or decanting. Drink through 2023.",91,Finca Constancia 2014 Altos de la Finca Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"This wine from the Geneseo district offers aromas of sour plums and just enough cigar box to tempt the nose. The flavors are a bit flat at first, then the acidity and tension of sour cherries emerges in the midpalate, bolstered by some black licorice.",87,Bianchi 2011 Signature Selection Merlot (Paso Robles)
"Delicately scented, this opens with aromas of white spring flower, orchard fruit and a whiff of Mediterranean herb. On the creamy palate, an energizing mineral vein underscores golden apple, juicy white and peach and nectarine.",92,Tenuta Roveglia 2015 Wighel  (Lugana)
"A blend of Sangiovese, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot, this offers aromas recalling red currant, blue flower, espresso and a whiff of baking spice. On the soft, accessible palate, notes of sage and toast accent a core of dried cherry. Drink through 2016.",87,Lamole di Lamole 2012 Blue Label  (Chianti Classico)
"This exotic, spicy wine's wood flavors give it a lively character. This is a medium-bodied wine, not heavy in any sense, its fruitiness and attractive acidity producing a wine that will soon be ready to drink.",89,Château Larose-Trintaudon 2011  Haut-Médoc
"Medium bodied and restrained on the palate, this wine offers a mix of caramelized lemon and Gravenstein apple. It ends lengthy with tastes of ginger and lemongrass that leave a refreshing finish.",90,Mahoney 2014 Gavin Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Soft and fruity with some sweetness, this red-fruit-flavored wine is rounded and warm, crispened by acidity.",84,Barton & Guestier 2011 Bistro Pinot Noir (Ile de Beauté)
"Il Drappo is a pure expression of Nero d'Avola that has been aged carefully in oak to produce a soft, rich mouthfeel and lively notes of bright berry and savory spice. There's a touch of toasted pistachio nut as well.",90,Benanti 2008 Il Drappo Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"This has a vivid, ripe, black cherry flavor, with fresh sweetness and bursting acidity. It makes for a gorgeous, generous character buoyed up by firm tannins, a lively texture and finish, and no noticeable oak. A great find from a small, ambitious Lake County winery that loves Italian varietals.",91,Rosa d'Oro 2012 Barbera (Clear Lake)
"This wine is a blend of Syrah (64%) and Cabernet Sauvignon. It opens with aromas of freshly brewed coffee and blueberries that lead to plump, silky fruit flavors that linger.",90,William Church 2013 2 Spires Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A full year of maceration on the skins has transformed primary fruit flavors into a kaleidoscope of savory tea leaf, bramble and earth tones here. This is a curious, deeply complex wine augmented by bold tannins and bristling acidity. Dry in style, it has a firm savory finish.",87,Shaw 2014 Vin Rustique White (Finger Lakes)
"This manages to combine instant drinkability with Napa complexity, resulting in a really nice wine. Although it's not an ager, it rises to the occasion with sweetly ripe raspberries, cherries and blackberries, plush, polished tannins and a lovely coating of smoky oak.",88,Martin Ray 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A blend of 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Franc and 10% Petit Verdot, this shows ripe black plum, toast and roasted coffee on the nose. The robust palate tastes of prune, graphite and espresso, dusted with tannin. An alcoholic heat is also evident. Enjoy soon to catch the remaining fruit.",89,Donne Fittipaldi 2013  Bolgheri Superiore
"Strawberry cream on the nose and a subtle touch of lemon blended in with strawberry flavors gives this rosé a pretty balance of sweet and crisp. Fun, but with substance, it could be paired with everything from a light seafood salad to a heartier poultry dish.",86,Macari 2007 Rosé (North Fork of Long Island)
"Dryish and very fruity, this Roussanne has pleasant flavors of oranges, pineapples, orange honey, roasted hazelnuts and smoky oak. Crisp acidity makes it taste bright and clean.",86,Curtis 2007 Roussanne (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Inky dark and compressed, this is a concentrated expression of juicy black fruit and licorice. With sizable, powerful tannin, it needs time to decompress, a leathery texture requiring patience to soften. Cellar through 2020.",90,Covenant 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"So what does ten bucks buy in Pinot Noir? A light-bodied wine with tart, green strawberry, cola and cranberry flavors, plenty of crisp acids and smooth tannins.",84,Monthaven 2000 Pinot Noir (California)
"A blend of Aragon and Trincadeira, this is a fresh wine that hones on in crisp black-currant and red-berry fruits. The acidity is present, giving a vibrant, juicy character to the finish. Drink now.",84,Monte da Ravasqueira 2013 Fonte da Serrana Red (Alentejano)
"Just one barrel was produced from this nine-acre site in the heart of the AVA. This is picture perfect, refined and textural, with flavors that roll from rose petals to strawberries to Bing cherries. A well-framed touch of oak (noted as neutral, yet detectable) contributes to an elongated finish that begs for the next glass. Still young and compact, this should drink its best from 2018 through 2028.",93,Elizabeth Chambers 2014 Lone Madrone Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
Flinty notes of smoke with glints of ripe yellow stone fruit and mandarin peel make for an appetizing opening. The palate is rounder and fleshier but toned by citric freshness and enticing spice. An unusual Sauvignon Blanc that enriches the varietal genre.,91,Esterházy 2014 Estoras Sauvignon Blanc (Burgenland)
"Sawdust and toast aromas lead the nose. The palate offers oak extract, licorice and bitter powdered sage but not much fruit richness. Raspy tannins generate an astringent finish.",86,Sarotto 2010 Currà Riserva  (Barbaresco)
The alcohol is overwhelming here in an otherwise fragrant wine with strong aromas of cola spice. This Petit Verdot is medium-bodied and very much happy to display its 18 months spent in new American oak.,85,Cuda Ridge Wines 2009 Petit Verdot (Livermore Valley)
"Aromas recall a closed cellar, leafy underbrush and raisin. The lean palate offers stewed prune, nutmeg, cedar and black pepper alongside firm tannins.",85,Villa S. Anna 2011  Rosso di Montepulciano
"Enticing scents of honeysuckle, jasmine and orchard fruit mingle together while the bone-dry savory palate offers apple, pear and tangerine. An elegant perlage and vibrant acidity lend finesse and freshness while a hint of thyme closes the crisp finish.",91,La Tordera 2016 Oltreval Rive di Guia Zero  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"This is a seductive style of Pomerol. It may not have great weight, but what it does have is rich, juicy berry fruit flavors, an open structure and tannins just holding all this ripeness together.",89,Château La Grave à Pomerol 2006  Pomerol
"This well-structured wine offers flavors of preserved lemon and grilled pineapple, while floral nuttiness and a cheese-like impression give it a hint of funk. It shows some barrel reduction, which blows off as it opens up.",88,Grgich Hills 2014 Miljenko's Selection Chardonnay (Carneros)
"This wine could be the poster boy for Australian Chardonnay. The nectarine and peach aromas and flavors are coddled by a touch of vanilla and the entire package is soft, juicy and easy to drink. It's nothing fancy, just yummy weekday wine.",86,Stonehaven 2001 Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia)
"While this is the most tannic of Envy's wines, it's also made in the house style of soft, fruity approachability. Forward and lush with blackberry jam, currant and spice flavors, it shows an impeccable balance. Wonderful now and over the next 3–4 years.",92,Envy 2010 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Calistoga)
"If any wine can blow away the thought that Merlot is a thin, wimpy, nondescript red, this is the wine. From the iconic Champoux Vineyard, it has magic and muscle, a broad and deep display of black fruits, coffee, licorice, dark chocolate, baking spices and beautifully built tannins. Explore and enjoy.",94,Sineann 2009 Champoux Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Always one of the top performers in Margaux, this dense and concentrated wine has a bold, ripe character from the plum and berry fruits. It has the weight to develop. Drink from 2020.",93,Château Rauzan-Ségla 2013  Margaux
"Soft, dry and simple, with modest peach, pineapple, lemon and vanilla flavors. Drink now.",85,Luna 2008 Pinot Grigio (Napa Valley)
"Made with 85% Merlot blended with varying amounts of Petit Verdot, Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of truffle, underbrush, baked plum and dark cooking spice. The palate delivers licorice, roasted coffee bean and blueberry extract alongside astringent tannins that dry out the palate. While the tannins are still aggressive, the fruit richness is starting to dry out.",87,Poggioventoso 2010 Fuochi Red (Toscana)
"Ripe stone-fruit, pineapple and tangerine flavors are marked by streaks of lime and lemon acidity on this irresistibly vibrant semi-dry Riesling. Touches of berry lend a sweet, summery warmth that lingers on the finish. Enjoy now for it's fragrant, fruity exuberance.",90,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch) 2012 Riesling (Mosel)
"From the famous Westside Road-adjacent vineyard, this Chardonnay shows a proclivity toward lush roundness of texture and tropical flourish in flavor. Vanilla nuttiness is complemented by pineapple, green apple and caramel, lasting long into the finish.",90,E16 2014 Bacigalupi Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"What a great success. Oozes with blackcurrant jam and cassis and a dash of black pepper. Flamboyant oak adds a perfume of vanilla and smoke. Fleshy, long and full, this beautiful wine is not a monster, but it coats the palate with spicy flavors that epitomize class and style.",95,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 1998 Cask 23 Red (Napa Valley)
"Lots of exuberant fruit in this stylish blend of Petite Sirah, Zin, Cab Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. With its cherry candy and sweet oak flavors, it carefully treads the line between rustic and chic. Drink now. From Hunnicutt.",87,CUTT 2008 Fearless Red Red (Napa Valley)
"Initially dense and brooding, this wine reveals lightly etched layers of cherry and strawberry on the palate. Just the right accent of earthy dirt and stone round out the finish.",88,Kastania 2012 Estate Grown Proprietor's Reserve Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"A blend of fruit drawn from the Awatere and Brancott subregions, this is a lively, fresh example of Marlborough Pinot Noir. Judiciously applied notes of vanilla and cinnamon accent flavors of cherry and herb that finish long, while the medium- to full-bodied wine's tannins are ripe and impart a creamy texture. Drink now and over the next couple of years.",90,Jules Taylor 2010 Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
"This assertive, dry wine has wet stone and cured meat aromas and tart, mouth-cleansing grapefruit and pineapple flavors. It will make a fine foil for rich foods like fettucine alfredo or fried chicken.",86,Ironstone 2015 Pinot Grigio (Lodi)
"A dry, lively, raspberry-flavored wine, with a light mousse. Fruity, fresh and streaked with lemon-zest acidity, it has just the right texture and balance.",88,Bründlmayer NV Brut Rosé Sparkling (Österreichischer Sekt)
"Slightly reduced aromas of red and black fruits are rustic and come with a whiff of animal hide. This Malbec-led blend is a touch shallow in feel, with candied berry flavors that suggest wild herbs and garrigue. A light, jumpy, fruity finish eschews weight for freshness.",87,Zuccardi 2011 Brazos de los Andes Red (Mendoza)
"Black plum and cherry aromas pick up an undergrowth hint. This is a succulent, juicy wine with a finish that tastes earthy and feels structured.",86,8 Chains North 2010 Furnace Mountain Dry Red (Virginia)

"Aromas of aged cheese, leather, latex and medicinal cherry and plum lead to a juicy, acid-driven palate with buttery oak as the offset. Flavors of oak-related butter, popcorn and saline push this creamy red toward the finish line, but all the while fruit is secondary to oak. Drink through 2018.",88,Alta Alella 2012 PS-Xtrem Organic Red (Alella)
"Dusty apple and a clean lightness define this basic, totally enjoyable white blend that is based on the pedestrian Airén grape but features 30% Macabeo. The palate is fresh and easy, with apple, citrus and white pepper flavors. Finishes crisp.",86,Dominio de Eguren 2009 Protocolo Blanco White (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"Peppery herbs lead the nose on this bottling, with sagebrush, bay leaf and rust giving depth to the light cranberry and raspberry fruit. The palate is earthy with juniper and turned-loam flavors, plus more bay leaf, iron cranberry and some rhubarb.",91,Blair 2013 Delfina's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco)
"Freshly buttered toast with a thin coating of marmalade comes to mind when sniffing this wine that also shows a touch of cinnamon and Meyer-lemon juice on the nose. The riper, rounded palate offers yellow apples dipped in caramel, sea salt and cinnamon, which pops again on the back end.",92,Brophy Clark 2014 Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"Distinct aromas of sour plum and dried pomegranate meet with damp tobacco, forest floor, green olive and Greek spice on the nose of this clonal study. It's herbal on the palate, with oregano, marjoram and green cardamom notes, alongside cranberry and red cherry fruit in the midpalate. Altogether, it's a light, bright and highly seasoned wine.",92,Fess Parker 2013 Clone 115 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"It may be 22 years old, but this wine is still so young.

"There's a charred note here that resembles cured meat or bresaola backed by Indian spice and freshly crushed clove. The tannins are firm, sour and still need time to soften with two or three more years of cellar aging.",87,Antico Borgo di Sugame 2006 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"This deliciously crisp estate-produced wine is full of the freshest strawberry fruits. It dances with its acidity and light touch of spice. From one of the largest private vineyards in France (2,300 acres), the wine is ready to drink.",86,Domaine du Tariquet 2014 Rosé de Pressée Rosé (Côtes de Gascogne)
"This is really mature Muscadet, yet it's certainly not too old. It is toasty, with almond, spice and vanilla flavors plus the concentration that comes from old vines. It is a fascinating wine, ripe and with considerable depths. The wine is, of course, ready to drink.",91,Domaine des Cognettes 2005 Tentation Sélection Vieilles Vignes  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"A really nice wine, refreshing and light, with delicate lemon-grapefruit flavors complexed with creamy lees. The acidity is very crisp and assertive. No discernible oak at all, and with this pretty fruit and structure, it doesn't need any.",87,Oak Knoll 2000 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"This wood-aged wine has a ripe fruitiness about it. The tannins give some structure while not taking away from the generous blackberry fruits. It's rich and warm, just hinting at pepper on the finish. Drink now.",86,Casa Santos Lima 2013 Lab Reserva Red (Lisboa)
"This is a soft, well-crafted wine from the eastern side of St. Helena that's both classic in its dried herb, tobacco and tea aromas and fruity with red currant and cranberry notes.",90,Sequum 2013 Four Soil Mélange Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)

"Powerful, mouthwatering, concentrated black-cherry and blackberry flavors form the core of this full-bodied, full-flavored and well-balanced wine.

"With vibrant acidity and a keen taste of mineral—like a lick of cold steel—this Sauvignon Blanc is also rich in citrus and tropical fruit flavors. A touch of oak and lees aging imparts a creamy, smoky yeastiness. More importantly, it has a seemingly sweet finish, so pair accordingly with appropriate fare.",87,Duckhorn 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Made with 90% Nasco and 10% Malvasia, this full-bodied dessert wine opens with intense aromas of tangerine zest, dried fruit and a whiff of baking spice.

"This is a sweet style of Prosecco with a luminous appearance and grassy-herbal notes followed by white peach, honey and jasmine. More herbal flavors appear on the close and the wine is fresh and simple in the mouth.",85,Pizzolato NV  Prosecco del Veneto
"It's the rare NZ Riesling we see in this country that's from Martinborough, but Nga Waka's 2001 makes a strong case for the continued production of Riesling in an area that's better known for Burgundian varieties. Floral on the nose, with bright citrusy fruit on the palate and almost ephemerally light, this is an ideal aperitif wine.",87,Nga Waka 2001 Riesling (Martinborough)
"This opens with an alluring fragrance of Spanish broom, wild flowers and a whiff of sea breeze. The palate delivers creamy white peach, juicy pineapple and lemon accented by hints of saline and mineral. It's still fresh and should develop more complexity. Drink now through 2015.",89,Accadia 2011 Cantorì  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore)
"Salvo Foti is a winemaker to watch. A foremost expert and advocate of Sicily's Etna terroir, he has shaped a delicate and feminine wine with a Burgundian style. The wine is very floral with blue violets and lavender and polished aromas of cinnamon and crisp apple.",90,I Vigneri 2004 Vinupetra  (Etna)

"Wet slate, cinnamon and allspice notes meet with red cherry, baked black cherry and bramble on the nose of this bottling from a popular single-vineyard source.

"This weirdly named wine is a blend of 95% Cabernet Franc and 5% Merlot. It's a bit soft and melted in texture, like liquid licorice, with flavors of cherries, red currants, mocha, anise and smoky oak, and the finish is dry. Notable for the elegance and purity of its tannin structure.",90,Jarvis 2008 Will Jarvis' Science Project Red (Napa Valley)
"A good contrast between weighty, rich fruit and a steely structure. White fruits and acidity offer freshness, while the more austere edge gives the wine a serious, solid character. For aging.",91,Domaine Michel Bouzereau 2008 Le Limosin  (Meursault)
"Bold lychee, honeydew and stone-fruit perfume adorns this varietally classic Gewürztraminer. Its tastes just a shade off dry, its hibiscus-nectar sweetness accenting sunny tangerine and peach flavors. Sunny acidity and integrated alcohol tie the package together smartly. Drink now through 2020.",90,Dr. Konstantin Frank 2015 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes)
"The producer's most popular and widely made Zin has a loyal following, and this vintage merits further admiration, offering soft, plummy juiciness on the palate. Not over-oaked, it sparks with black pepper, finishing with elegance.",91,Robert Biale 2013 Black Chicken Zinfandel (Napa Valley)
"This plump, creamy-textured Riesling shows plenty of flattering peach and lime fruit, but also enough mint and slate that it avoids being simply fruity. Balanced toward the dry side of the Riesling spectrum, so it should prove versatile at the table.",86,Grans-Fassian 2007 Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer)
"Done in a bracing, sappy style, this is a concentrated wine with lush flavors of lemon drop, orange candy and Key lime. It's ripe and juicy, with a suggestion of beeswax in the mouth.",90,Novelty Hill 2012 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This clean, dry white begins with aromas of spicy lemon and orange, leading in to flavors of lemon, orange rind and pepper. Light and mild, it's a simple but versatile food wine. Think grilled seafood, elegant cheeses.",85,Disznókö 2006 Dry Furmint (Tokaj)
"Earthy, mossy, cedary aromas of berry fruits come with spice and coffee notes. This is fairly high in tartaric acid, so it scrapes across the palate. Quick-passing flavors of wild berry fruits and plum are toasty and lightly herbal, while the finish on this Cabernet Sauvignon blend is tight, spicy and grating in feel. Drink through 2022.",91,Valentin Bianchi 2012 Enzo Bianchi Red
"Brooding dark fruit and luxurious French oak spices intermingle on the aromas. The palate is seamless with pitch-black fruit flavors. Not a shy wine, it's an exhibition of power.",92,Gorman 2014 The Pixie Syrah (Red Mountain)
"The ripe fruit of this Shiraz and Touriga Nacional blend exude a character of richness and sophistication. Dusty tannins provide the framework for red fruit flavors and the generous structure. From José Luís Santos Lima Oliveira da Silva's range, the wine would be best after 2015.",90,Casa Santos Lima 2012 Cigarra Reserva Shiraz-Touriga Nacional Red (Lisboa)
"This wine is ripe, full of fruitiness and already well balanced. Solid tannins are integrated into crisp cherry fruits that go with the fragrant acidity. All the elements are neatly there to give a wine that's ready to drink.",89,Domaine de Bel Air 2013 Les Granits Bleu  (Beaujolais-Villages)
"The sour tang of green gooseberry immediately brings New Zealand to mind in this dry, tart Sauvignon Blanc. It's relieved by rich California notes of pineapples, pears and honey. Modern Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese and Thai foods come to mind as ideal pairings.",88,Longboard 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley)
"This is a gorgeous wine with loads of intensity and fruit. You can expect the wine to age many years in the cellar thanks to the integrity of the cherry, blackberry and plum flavors. In the mouth, the wine is soft, round and smooth although the tannins could use a few more years to soften.",92,Citille di Sopra 2005  Brunello di Montalcino
"Dominated by wood, this toasty wine is just beginning to hint at blackberry and cherry flavors. It will develop well over the next five years, as the wood softens into the juicy fruit.",88,Château Haut Condissas 2008 Prestige  (Médoc)
"Punchy raspberry and strawberry aromas mingle with darker shades of blueberry, with tarragon and anise in the background. Soft and silken on the palate, the flavors mimic the nose, supported by a gentle dusting of tannins. This is a perfect light-bodied summer red, great alongside grilled fare.",87,Spicewood 2014 Mourvèdre (Texas High Plains)
"Fresh pomegranate, smoked green olives and pencil shavings make for an intriguing nose on this county blend from Ernst Storm. Tart raspberry fruit and fresh sage show on the palate, but it's quite retrained and mineral driven, proving a bit bitter.",89,Storm 2013 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
Touches of autumn leaves and dried herbs lend a savory feel to this dry and tightly composed Riesling. Bracing acidity and savory apple and pear flavors mark the palate.,87,Mathern 2014 Gutsriesling Dry Riesling (Nahe)
"Red berry, chopped herb, toast and a whiff of French oak are some of the aromas that take shape in the glass. The palate is taut but elegant, offering bright wild cherry, licorice and vanilla flavors, while tightly wound, fine-grained tannins leave a firm finish. Give this time to unwind and fully develop.",91,Poliziano 2013 Asinone  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano)
"The producer's flagship wine, this is sourced from several Green Valley sites, including Amber Ridge and Manna. Both contribute a full-bodied wealth of packed-earth flavor in a generously layered, rich explosion of dark cherry, plum and pomegranate. Along the way, streaks of citrus and black tea provide exotic interludes.",93,EnRoute 2014 Les Pommiers Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Young and fresh in citrusy acidity, with forward fruit flavors of cherries, raspberries, pomegranates, cola, bacon and sweet oak. Good and dry and silky, but immature.",90,James Family Cellars 2007 Stony Point Vineyards Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This wine's smoke, seaweed, black pepper, orange peel and purple fruit aromas pop. The palate features easy-drinking fruit flavors, with gritty tannins to back them up.",86,Maryhill 2015 Winemaker's Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Quite tart, in a bracing, food friendly way, this foot-stomped rosé brings pretty notes of crushed roses and sweet cherries to the fore. There's impressive body and length, with a lick of citrus extending the finish.",90,Vinum Ferus 2015 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This 100% varietal wine, which saw 30 months of oak aging, is lightly aromatic with notes of cherry, anise, berry, vanilla and woodspice. It's quite restrained in feel—a very pretty wine—with elegant, sumptuous cherry flavors and a lingering finish.",90,Wautoma 2011 Wautoma Springs Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Stiff at first, the Stoller puts on more interesting layers after an hour or two of breathing time. Pomegranate, peach skin, mineral and smoke components weave together, with slightly bitter phenolics wrapping up the finish.",90,Purple Hands 2013 Stoller Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Dry and sophisticated, this delivers aromas of dried fruit, ginger, spice and cola. There's a hint of Christmas spice that gives the wine a touch of softness and warm succulence on the finish.",90,Grimaldi Bruna 2008 Camilla  (Barolo)
"Very particular yet still very Riesling. Oily, tight aromas signal intensity, which is delivered on the peach-like palate that turns creamy toward the finish as banana and papaya take over. There's a bitterness throughout, and at points it's interesting while at others it's too much. Also in abundance is the taste of pepper. A unique wine with attitude.",85,Cousiño-Macul 2000 Dona Isidora Riesling (Maipo Valley)
"Light, clean, gently spicy pear and apple fruit flavors are set in a crisp white wine with fine acidity. The hints of white pepper give it detail and interest; the fresh acidity encourages that second and third glass. Drink this chilled.",87,Mercer 2009 Pinot Gris (Yakima Valley)
"Kirsten's 2014 Rieslings each share a core of minerality that prevails over primary fruit, but this dry bottling is particularly savory in style. It's refreshingly spry with layers of smoke and chalk notes meandering amidst sheer streaks of fresh, white grapefruit and apple. The finish is brisk and clean.",89,Kirsten 2014 Trocken Riesling (Mosel)
"A simple Merlot, soft and sweet in raspberries, cherries and red licorice. At this price, it's perfectly fine for casual fare and big parties.",84,McManis 2009 Merlot (California)
"The bouquet on this Priorat is raisiny, with tobacco and schisty aromas. The palate is one part jumpy and another part stewy and clumsy, with baked berry flavors that come with a tangy citric edge. The finish is long, with tobacco, stewed fruit and hard tannins. Drink now through 2015.",88,Pinord 2007 +7 Red (Priorat)
"This desirable appellation wine hails from several well-farmed vineyards, including the producer's hillside Wildcat Mountain site in the Petaluma Gap. Apple blossom aromas lead to a taut body of ripe, balanced fruit—an exploration of pineapple and mango that's food-friendly, with high-toned acidity.",90,MacRostie 2015 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"Sweet, floral aromas of plum, candied berry and sugar beet are friendlier than the palate, which is a bit piercing and high in acidity. Cherry and tart plum flavors finish with choppy, bright acids and citric flavors.",85,Lurra 2013 Garnacha (Navarra)
"This is a limited-production line from this venerable winery. It's a very dense, focused Cab, a little too tightly wound to pop the cork quite yet. There's a sharp pine or balsam zinginess that's a combination of smoky oak and deeply ripe cassis, fresh and zesty and dry. The wine needs time for all this to mellow. Best after 2008, and for a decade beyond.",92,Alexander Valley Vineyards 2004 Alexander School Top of the Crop Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Made in an off-dry style, the Villa Wolf 2007 Gewürz boasts classic musky aromas of lychee and spice and even develops some rose-like notes on the palate. It's medium-bodied, finishing soft and mellow.",87,Villa Wolf 2007 Gewürztraminer (Pfalz)
"Although it is not entirely laced together, this substantial wine makes a good impression with its ripe purple fruits and strong vanilla and coffee and coconut barrel notes. Big flavors and firm tannins create an impression of strength and weight; what the wine lacks in finesse it makes up for in muscle. It's chunky and rough-hewn, but carries plenty of flavor. Screwcap.",88,Benton-Lane 2005 First Class Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This is a shade off-dry, with ample crispness, a bright, prickly lightness and delicate texture. It's a great apéritif style, with its soft edge and easygoing freshness, that's ready to drink now.",86,Casa de Vilacetinho 2012 Vilacetinho White (Vinho Verde)
"Spicy, minty, wood-aged wine that shows more wood than fruit. It does have a rich character from black plum and berry flavors so the wine will become better integrated. So wait for 2–3 years.",87,Château de Calavon 2009 La Réserve Red (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence)
"Pleasantly spicy, yet soft in the mouth, this is a medium-bodied Syrah to drink over the near term. Hints of anise, cracked pepper and cedar accent cherry fruit.",86,Maimai 2011 Syrah (Hawke's Bay)
"Enhanced by an attractive bottle and packaging, Belcanto Extra Dry delivers the goods on the inside of the bottle as well. This fresh Prosecco is redolent of peach, citrus and honey.",87,Bellussi NV Belcanto Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Reminiscent of the 2000, this wine has a crisp, linear character that emphasizes minerals rather than the overt tropical fruits the vineyard shows in warmer vintages. It's a fine, dry, acidic Chardonnay whose oak-infused lemon and lime flavors will complement sourdough bread and cracked crab.",90,Chateau St. Jean 2006 Belle Terre Vineyard Chardonnay (Alexander Valley)
"Well-made and creatively blended from Zinfandel, Syrah and Petite Sirah, this is a big, tannic wine, formidable in sweet blackberry, cherry, licorice and spice flavors. It's not subtle, but it is authentic. Drink now.",87,JR Wine 2009 The Devious Woman Red (Napa Valley)
"Lots of dynamics play on the nose of this wine, from chamomile flowers and daffodils to chalk, pink lemonade, cotton candy and tropical fruits. The palate is framed by a tense minerality, seasoned with flavors of lemonade, browned butter and guava.",91,Talley 2013 Rincon Vineyard Chardonnay (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"This wine is packed with tannins, less packed with fruit. That gives it a tough character, very dry and not fruity enough. The estate is owned by the Perrin family of Château Carbonnieux.",85,Château Lafont Menaut 2013  Pessac-Léognan
"Clean and crisp, with classic flavors of lemons, limes and gooseberries, softened with a touch of buttercream and vanilla. The finish is fine and has a touch of sweet honeysuckle. A good value.",88,Kendall-Jackson 2008 Vintner's Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (California)
"Toasty and creamy, with just a touch of earthy mustiness on the nose; this is like a star just starting to do an elegant fade. There’s tangy fruit with a touch of oxidized maturity, a full texture, but a very faint bead. Good elements abound here and the wine still displays class, but it seems like it might have been brighter before",88,Roederer Estate 1994 L'Ermitage  (Anderson Valley)
This Alliance Bourg wine is dry and firm with its concentrated tannins. Too much extraction has left a bitter character. It will remain a wine that is tough.,84,Château Haut Millet 2014  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux
"Ripe and spicy, this is an opulent wine, showing great swathes of tropical fruits as well as pepper and just the right amount of acidity. The wine is rich, intense, concentrated and needs to age. Drink from 2016.",90,Jean-Marc Bernhard 2011 Cuvée Particulière Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"This bottling from a vineyard owned by the Fess Parker family is extremely gamy out of the gates, with raw lamb aromas lifted up by peppercorns and laid atop elderberry fruit. The lighter-bodied palate is framed by zesty acidity and a zippy pepper spice, with flavors of black currant and wild chaparral herbs.",93,Barbieri 2013 Rodney's Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"Aromas of baked plum, underbrush, grilled herb and mocha lead the nose on this dense, soft wine. The concentrated palate delivers blackberry, black cherry, vanilla, clove and black pepper notes alongside velvety tannins.",92,Santa Sofia 2007 Gioè  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"Here's an easy Grechetto from central Italy that offers sun-denched aromas of apricot, honeysuckle, white mineral and a touch of tangy, sweet spice. This native Italian grape pairs beautifully with white meat, fish or salad.",85,Fongoli 2009 Grechetto (Colli Martani)
"Mostly Syrah, with just a dash of Petite Sirah (2%) and Petit Verdot (1%), this red from Sawtooth and Skyline vineyards brings light notes of smoked meat, chocolate, and flowers. The enjoyment here is mainly focused on mouthfeel, which is voluptuous and rich, leading to an open finish.",87,Coiled 2009 Sidewinder Red
"This soft wine is ripe and creamy. With fruit mainly from the southern Burgundy, it offers warm apricot and spice flavors. As a contrast, the zesty texture adds a crisp aftertaste. Drink now.",87,Boutinot 2015 Domaine des Terreaux  (Bourgogne)
"This is a largely extracted, puckering wine, rich and full-flavored in blackberry and vanilla. The tannins make it difficult to discern beyond its density and grip. A majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, it also employs Malbec, Petit Verdot, Merlot and Cabernet Franc.",84,White Oak 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This ruby-hued blend of Nerello Mascalese and Nerello Cappuccio conveys aromas of bright berry, intense mint and a whiff of baking spice. The vibrant palate offers sour cherry, mineral and cinnamon flavors alongside fresh acidity.",88,Antichi Vinai 1877 2013 Pietralava Red (Etna)
"Minty berry aromas settle well and hold up to airing. This everyday Merlot is more than competent on the palate. Berry and spice flavors finish chewy, with standard ripeness and follow through.",86,Cuyen 2016 Merlot (Central Valley)
"Though it makes up only a fifth of the wine, Cabernet Sauvignon seems to win out in this largely Bordeaux-style blend with notes of mixed herbs, mint and green tea. Lighter in style, it offers a fresh feel, slightly chalky tannins, and little obvious new oak influence. It adds up to a low-alcohol wine that goes down easy.",87,Kyra 2011 Garnet Red (Wahluke Slope)
"This combines Merlot from Minnick Hills and Birch Creek vineyards in the Walla Walla Valley and Candy Mountain in the larger Columbia Valley with smaller amounts of Malbec from StoneTree and Petit Verdot from Dionysus. It's generous in aroma, with with plentiful coffee, raspberry, bittersweet chocolate, flower and graphite notes. The palate displays a lot of elegance, with tart acidity providing support. It's a very pretty expression of the variety that should show especially well at the dinner table.",91,Forgeron 2013 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Plump soft aromas of berry fruits, raisin and prune hint at ripeness. This feels dense and chewy, with integrated tannins. Saucy savory berry and plum flavors suggest tomato sauce, while this tastes lightly oaky and minty on the finish.",87,Dominio de la Vega 2012 Paraje Tornel Bobal (Utiel-Requena)
"This is a very good dry Gewürztraminer that's laden in jasmine and honey, extremely perfumed on the nose, and light and crisp on the palate. With a suggestion of vanilla on the finish, it's a balanced white, ready to be enjoyed with a salad dressed with figs and goat cheese.",90,V. Sattui 2012 Dry Gewurztraminer (Anderson Valley)
"Aromas of underbrush, ripe plum, baking spice and a whiff of leather take center stage. The round, savory palate offers mature black cherry, raspberry, ground pepper and a smoky note while firm, dusty tannins lend support. Drink 2018–2013.",92,Montesole 2008 Vigna Vinieri  (Taurasi)
"Tiny amounts of Zinfandel and Malbec are added to this wine, which otherwise delivers varietally appropriate notes of tart cranberry and black currant. From there, leather comes onto the palate, bolstering an already heady mix of tannin and oak, finishing rich in tobacco and dark chocolate.",89,Napa Cellars 2013 Classic Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"The red cherry flavor is bright and concentrated, marked by savory tones of roasted beet, spice and a hint of pencil shaving. It's medium-bodied, with a brisk, easy-drinking mouthfeel.",85,Seneca Shore NV Amulet Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes)
"This inexpensive white wine does a good job of being dry and ultracrisp in acidity, which gets the mouth watering. It offers pleasant flavors of Lifesaver candy pineapples and lemons, with a hint of vanilla.",85,Tamás 2008 Pinot Grigio (Central Coast)
"Still quite young, this 100% Cabernet Franc shows great promise with more cellar aging. It's respectful of what that grape can do, with smoky overtones amid layers of green olive, cedar and pepper. The finish has a bite of minty cocoa.",88,Andis 2010 Bill's Block Cabernet Franc (Sierra Foothills)
"Aromas of dark-skinned berry, French oak, wild rose and a whiff of Alpine herb lift out of the glass. Linear and tense, the taut palate offers dried cherry, cranberry, clove and a hint of espresso alongside a backbone of firm fine-grained tannins and bracing acidity. Drink 2017–2020.",89,Nino Negri 2013 Sassella Le Tense  (Valtellina Superiore)
"Like most Lanson wines, this nonvintage cuvée is a blend dominated by red grapes (Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier). Ripe while also crisp and stylish, it has weight and richness while remaining well to the dry side of Brut. The bottling is ready to drink.",90,Lanson NV Black Label Brut  (Champagne)
"A fabulous bottling from one of West Paso's most beautiful vineyards, this blend of 54% Grenache, 22% Mourvèdre, 18% Syrah and 6% Tannat shows aromas of fresh black cherry, dried mint and fudge on the well-integrated nose. Black plum, soy, pencil lead, condensed teriyaki, lilac and violet flavors unfold on the delicious palate.",92,Halter Ranch 2013 CDP Estate Bottled Grenache-Mourvèdre-Syrah-Tannat Red (Adelaida District)
"Creaminess and stone are all that is signalled on the nose. The palate opens with a generous spirit that unites green apple crispness, lemon freshness, shortbread richness and chalky depth. There is an undertow of lemon oil and lasting length. There is something generous and rounded about this wine that does not stem from dosage. Intriguing, wonderfully dry, grown-up and totally lasting. This is still taut and will gain from bottle age.",93,Gusbourne Estate 2011 Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (England)
"Crisp and taut, this Lobre family wine is on a tight rope. It balances between intense citrus acidity and riper apricot and pear favors. It will be better from late 2017.",87,Château de l'Aubrade 2016  Bordeaux Blanc
"Aromas of perfumed berry, violet, leather, pipe tobacco and baking spice take shape in the glass. The smooth, structured palate delivers layers of ripe black cherry, juicy raspberry, clove, white pepper and mineral alongside firm, fine-grained tannins.",91,Librandi 2011 Duca Sanfelice  (Cirò)
"Rich texture, full body and ripe, mellow flavors of pear, almond and fig make this wine a mouthful. It also has freshness and smooth acidity that last through the finish.",88,Ca' Momi 2014 Bianco di Ca' Momi White (California)
"Prunotto's Barolo from the Bussia cru delivers ripe and jammy tones of strawberry preserves and blackberry pie that sit heavy over Nebbiolo's characteristically ethereal aromas. This wine will appeal to those who enjoy a bigger, bolder style of Barolo that finishes with rich, succulent fruit.",89,Prunotto 2006 Bussia  (Barolo)
"This Premier Cru vineyard lies north of the Grand Crus, with a west-facing exposure. It has yielded a wine with soft, generous floral character, ripe yellow fruit and a crisp, mineral edge. Finely sculpted and ageworthy, it will be best from 2019.",93,La Chablisienne 2014 Fourchaume Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"This presents a rounded style, but still fresh with red fruits and soft acidity. It is light and fruity, with a bite of spice in the aftertaste.",87,Moncigale 2014 Frais et Fruité Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This wine is a blend of McKinley Springs and Alder Ridge fruit. Coffee and cherry aromas lead to restrained cranberry flavors, with the tannins bringing some dryness and grit.",87,Maryhill 2013 Vineyard Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills)
"The high quality of the 2010 harvest is on display here. Enchanting aromas of mocha, toast and black fruits are complex and crafty. This feels fresh, with a hint of tannic scratch. Flavors of spiced cherry, currant and mocha finish with tobacco notes. Given that 100,000 cases of this Reserva were made, the end result is impressive. Drink through 2020.",91,Baron De Ley 2010 Reserva  (Rioja)
"This is a crisp, dry wine that exibits delicious acidity, along with fresh citrus and green-apple flavors. It's bright and fruity, but has a textured undertow that promises good bottle aging. Ready to drink now, but could also benefit by cellaring for a year.",88,Philippe Fontaine NV Réserve Brut  (Champagne)
"This Riserva Syrah exhibits aged aromas of spice, old leather and dried pipe tobacco. Tertiary aromas (the tones that develop as the wine ages) are already showing, so you'd better drink up now. The finale is marked by loads of succulent black currant and plum.",90,Caruso & Minini 2006 Delia Nivolelli Riserva Syrah (Sicilia)
"Blended with 19% Merlot and 3% Malbec, this Cabernet Franc is richly round and structured, offering a length and breadth of bright flavor and complexity. Black cherry, leather and white pepper compete with classic notions of dried herb and violet, the layers intertwining on the lengthy finish. While it's enjoyable now, it will cellar well through 2024–2030.",94,Aperture 2014 Nomad Cabernet Franc (Alexander Valley)
"The lively mousse carries this sophisticated wine, which is the perfect partner to the Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs. Everything is in its place, well integrated and with great precision. This trends to the sweeter side of Brut but with bottle age this has brought fine secondary flavors that are ripe and rich. The wine will age further, drink until 2020.",94,Taittinger 2006 Comtes de Champagne Brut Rosé  (Champagne)
"High acidity and modest alcohol combine to make this dry wine crisp and elegant. It's not particularly rich, but has just enough pear and peach flavors to get by.",85,Handley 2006 Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Anderson Valley)
"This soft, high-toned wine is more than a little sweet— either a stuck fermentation or intentional residual sugar. Strawberry candy, cracker, and a hint of sweat in the finish.",83,Tagaris 2006 Red Roan Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A terrific Cabernet Sauvignon, dramatically structured in smooth mountain tannins, with lush, complex blackberry, cassis and dark chocolate flavors. Satisfies on every level you could ask of Napa Valley. Good as it is, it will age over a decade.",94,Pestoni Family 2007 Estate Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain)
"Richness (of both flavor and texture) marks this deeply colored, full-bodied Syrah. Aromas of ripe blackberry and licorice coupled with flavors of clove and blackberry jam make it luscious yet not overly big. It has the firm tannins and good balance for aging through 2019.",91,Michael David 2012 6th Sense Syrah (Lodi)
"Sangiovese (with 10% Merlot) forms a solid base for bright aromas of red cherry, cola, leather, tobacco and rum cake in this blend. These two varieties work well together to produce a soft, velvety feel with a touch of ripe fruit on the finish.",88,Castelvecchio 2009 Il Castelvecchio  (Chianti Colli Fiorentini)
"Very pure and totally appetizing notes of ripe pear and juicy Golden Delicious Apple fill the nose. The same insistent lively fruitiness pervades the taut, dry and very juicy palate alongside a blazing vein of lemon freshness. This is full of fruit, life and freshness. The finish has a lifted touch of conifer and is totally refreshing and whistle clean.",93,Cave du Roi Dagobert 2015 Racines & Terroirs Riesling (Alsace)
"ZD's reserve Chard is from Napa Valley. This California bottling is from Napa, Sonoma, Monterey and Santa Barbara. It's very ripe, with upfront pineapple jam, vanilla cream and butterscotch flavors. A crisp streak of cool-climate acidity permeates throughout.",87,ZD 2006 Chardonnay (California)
"Rosés are an extreme rarity from this appellation, let alone 100% varietal Tempranillo. Pale peach in color, aromas of strawberry hard candy, bubblegum and spice lead to dry well-measured fruit flavors. It delivers enjoyment.",88,Tertulia 2016 Estate Tempranillo Rosé (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Aromas of lees, apricot, vanilla and wheat lead to full-bodied fruit and cinnamon flavors. It's fleshy in feel but the flavor concentration isn't all there.",84,Hudson Shah 2012 Viognier (Red Mountain)
"Dark and sweet smelling, with marzipan, coconut, licorice and black fruit aromas. Surprisingly clacky and tartaric feeling, with oak-slathered berry flavors that are both baked and racy. Shows flashes of quality flavors, but the mouthfeel and overall balance are just o.k.",87,Finca Sophenia 2009 Synthesis Malbec (Tupungato)
"One of the labels from the Bonnet vineyard of André Lurton, this red follows the approachable, fruity style of these wines. Red berry fruits and soft tannins make it already drinkable.",86,Château Tour de Bonnet 2010  Bordeaux
"Dry yet lusciously mouth filling, this is subtly floral, with a hefty dose of fresh apple flavor. It's straightforward but pleasantly quaffable. Drink now.",86,Goose Watch 2011 Pinot Grigio (Finger Lakes)
"This unique wine offers light aromas of white pepper, bay leaf, coffee and dried leaves. The cherry flavors are elegant with a creamy feel and a tart finish, seeming a big compact at present but developing over time.",90,Rasa 2013 Vox Poluli Mourvèdre (Walla Walla Valley (OR))
"A subtle mix of pear and pepper plays on the nose. A seam of clean, fresh acidity leads to a concentrated, peppery palate where zestiness reigns, made more interesting by the aromatic pungence of lovage and arugula.",90,Jurtschitsch 2013 Stein Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"Smells nice enough, with rich custardy aromas, freshly baked sweetened piecrust, and peaches and vanilla. It tastes much drier than you'd think, given the opening. Delicate peach and hazelnut flavors are offset by decent, not great, acidity. In fact, if the acids were higher, the wine would be better. —S.H.",86,Repolusk 2000 Gelber Muskateller (Austria)
"Ripe plum and berry aromas are on the soft and cuddly side, but have some spunk. The palate on this classic Garnacha-Craignan-Syrah blend is adequately juicy and fresh, with a basket's worth of berry flavor. And the finish is complementary and offers some chocolate as an aftertaste. Drink now and over the next two years.",88,Torres 2003 Gran Sangre de Toro Red (Catalunya)
This is a stylish wine with a touch of minerality as well as acidity. It is light in character with a tangy texture and fine pure fruits. The wine is ripe while never excessive. The bitter coffee flavor will surely pass as the wine matures. Drink from 2024.,90,Château Pavie 2014 Arômes de Pavie  (Saint-Émilion)
"The wine is refreshing and unoaked, allowing pure fruit flavors to star, and the brisk acidity is just about perfect. A splash of Muscat Canelli brings a rich orange-honey note to Sauvignon's typical lemon and lime flavors.",90,Imagery 2011 Wow Oui Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County)
"Delicious and delicate in structure and tannins, with a classic, silky mouthfeel that caresses the palate. Red and black cherry, raspberry, tangerine peel, cola, sweet rhubard, rose hip tea and oaky notes of smoke and vanilla contribute intricate detail.",89,Cuvaison 2001 Pinot Noir (Carneros)
The limestone soil gives this juicy fruity wine a fine tight line of minerality. That contrasts with the apricot and lemon flavors that shine out from this generous wine. It is ready to drink now.,88,Château de Parnay 2014 Chemin des Murs  (Saumur)
"Ripe and sweet in apricot, pear, coconut macaroon, vanilla and Asian spice flavors, this Chard benefits from crisp acidity. It's not really dry, but has many interesting tastes.",83,Mountain View 2006 Chardonnay (Monterey County)
"Chunky pithy stone-fruit and citrus aromas are sketchy, while the palate is tangy and none too pleasant. Flavors of mealy citrus fruits and a finish with the consistency of orange juice do nothing to help this along.",82,Altos de Cristimil 2015 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"A very oaky nose leads into a tough, tannic wine. There's good fruit under all the wood and tannin, and the tight, rugged finish should smooth out in time.",85,Windsor 1997 Private Reserve Zinfandel (Mendocino)
"This tastes bone dry, and it offers acidity that's so clean and racy, it makes your mouth feel like it's shining. The flavors of limes, lemons, hay, white pepper and vanilla are delightful.",90,Geyser Peak 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (California)
"Built for immediate enjoyment, this brings a tasty mix of berries and cherries, rounded off with 15 months in one-year-old barrels. The delicious burst of mocha around the fruit is what propels this wine, and invites the second glass as soon as the first is finished.",91,Tendril 2014 Extrovert Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"The blend is Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. The Brut X designation refers to the winery's driest sparkler, but the wine retains plenty of sweet, ripe strawberries, raspberries, limes, vanilla and honey. It's very good, but a minor critique is a certain roughness of texture. Drink now.",88,Iron Horse 2008 Brut X Sparkling (Green Valley)
"For an '04 reserva, this wine is more edgy, grabby and high in acid than expected. The nose shows old world leather, spearmint and smoked meat more than vibrant fruit, yet the palate is tangy, citric and tastes of red raspberry and plum. Slightly more creamy on the finish, but still it remains scratchy.",85,Vallobera 2004 Reserva  (Rioja)
"plush wine, it's made from 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Merlot. It starts off with aromas of black berries, plum and stewed prunes along with a whiff of cedar. The warm, low-acid palate delivers mature black cherry, black currants, tobacco and black pepper alongside big, ripe tannins and the warmth of the noticeable alcohol. Drink through 2020. Lyra Wine, The Shepherd Company.",93,Giovanni Chiappini 2010 Guado de' Gemoli  (Bolgheri Superiore)
"Made from 100% Cab, this wine is boldly fruity with flavors of black cherries and currants, along with toasted, caramelized marshmallows. The tannins are refined and there's good acidity for balance.",87,Mi Sueño 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Ripe and savory, this frothy dessert wine boasts heady aromas of yellow stone fruit, citrus zest, aromatic herb and a whiff of honey. The rich palate doles out ripe apricot, yellow peach and candied lemon drop alongside an elegant, soft mousse.",89,Marenco 2015 Scrapona  (Moscato d'Asti)
"This richly fruity wine has poise and elegance as well as a powerful structure. A light herbal character brings out the juicy fruits as well as a mint flavor. The wine is ripe although with its serious tannic element, it does need to age. Drink from 2017.",93,Herdade da Malhadinha Nova 2011 Malhadinha Tinto Red (Alentejano)
"This is a tight, crisp rendering of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. Struck flint aromas add nuance, while the bright lemon-lime flavors whirl together into a citrus sorbet of refreshment.",91,Nautilus 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Defines Carneros in its rich, nuanced aromas of fig, ripe peach, tangerine, nutmeg and oaky vanilla. Winemaker-induced complexities from barrel fermentation and lees aging. Tremendous depth of flavor, it just sings on the palate and is so rich and spicy. The ultralong finish is sweet and satisfying.",93,Schug 1998 Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Freshly pressed apple and pear are brightened by squirts of lemon and lime in this refreshing dry Riesling. Zesty and spry, it's a thirst-quenching wine for everyday drinking now through 2018.",87,Hans Lang 2013 Gutswein Trocken Riesling (Rheingau)
"Intensely concentrated red cherry aromas are accented with a delicate leafiness in this rich, robust Cab Franc. It's a powerful, juicy, boldly textured wine with a bit of heat on the finish, but stays fresh on the palate thanks to a vibrant spray of acidity.",87,Jamesport 2007 Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island)
"Marked by substantial fruit, this Zin offers a burst of ripe blackberries, blueberries and black cherries, spiced with cinnamon and cloves, and clothed in smoky, sweetly toasted oak. Mountain tannins give it a thick, astringent mouthfeel. A very fine Zinfandel that's a little high in alcohol, but it doesn't feel hot.",90,Schulz 2008 Lampryidae Vineyard Zinfandel (Mount Veeder)
"A straightforward wine with notes of plum, currant and herbs. The flavors are lighter in style supported by firm tannins.",86,Wild Meadows 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a new wine from the Lurton brothers, and it's got good weight, color and integrity. It also shows a lot of hickory and pickle from the oak and some wayward vanilla on the juicy, jumpy palate. Not a refined wine but pretty good for size and zip.",86,J. & F. Lurton 2006 Hacienda Araucano Pinot Noir (Central Valley)
"There's a highly stemmy quality to this interesting wine from one of the appellation's multi-generation families. The nose shows funky herbs, papilla chile and raspberry extract, leading into a very spicy, savory palate of marjoram, Indian spices and green olive laid across pungent cranberry fruits. It's a winner for fans of stem inclusion.",91,Manzoni 2012 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Best of show at Torii Mor in 2010, the Olson Estate bottling is full-bodied with brambly berry fruit at its core. Notes of pepper, poppy seed and tangy citrus are threaded throughout, and the wine has medium-term aging potential.",90,Torii Mor 2010 Olson Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Ripe, spicy tropical fruits give this wine a rich feel. There is a touch of caramel along with pineapple and apricot flavors. It is full bodied and structured, with a finish that shows acidity and a streak of nutmeg.",88,Château de Lugagnac 2010  Bordeaux Blanc
"The nose on this bottling leans slightly sweet and simple, with aromas of ripe poached pears and lemon syrup. A decent sizzle of acidity on the tip of the sip leads to yellow-apple flavors that show clean and crisp. A riper apple-cream element marks the finish.",87,Sisters Forever 2015 Un-oaked Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"Pretty and floral, juicy and substantial, this wine delivers in flavor and texture, conveying caramel, baked pear and pineapple. Notable oak wraps around the fruit, ending with hazelnut and nutmeg.",90,La Crema 2015 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This wine is a great example of why Riesling is so increasingly popular. Despite the “dry” title on the label, it's actually a bit off-dry and crisp in acidity, with clean, savory flavors of limes, kiwi fruits, honey and vanilla. So easy to like, and the alcohol is relatively low.",88,V. Sattui 2010 Dry Riesling (Napa Valley)
"Aromas of candied berries, cinnamon, nutmeg and compost are present on the nose. An edgy, tannic mouthfell and baked, oaky flavors of stewed berry fruits and spice finish hard and tannic.",81,Bocopa 2009 Alcanta Gran Reserva Red (Alicante)
"The partly volcanic nature of amphibolite soil gives this wine a natural ripe fruitiness. Apple skin and fresh Rocha pears convey a fruit-forward character, bright and crisp. It's a young wine, although it can be drunk now for its exuberant outward-looking character.",90,Domaines Landron 2013 Amphibolite Nature  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"Dry and smoothly tannic, this wine is packed with complex blackberry-pie, currant, anise, herb and cedar flavors. This is nearly as good as the winery's more costly Walking Tree Vineyard Block Collection Cabernet, but it's just a little less concentrated.",89,Geyser Peak 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"This young Chardonnay still shows plenty of yeasty scents and flavors, turning it almost beer-like. Light lemon and tea flavors, with a dash of baking spices, complete the picture.",86,Charles & Charles 2012 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A serious, fairly rich wine with grippy tannins and typical Maipo aromas of herbs, tobacco and olive that meet at eucalyptus. Hails from low-production old vines in Macul and Buin; the wine is round and full in the mouth, with lightly roasted berry flavors and touches of sweet caramel and chocolate on the finish.",88,Cousiño-Macul 2008 Finis Terrae Red (Maipo Valley)
"Made with biodynamically grown Moscato grapes, this fragrant white wine opens with honey, white flower and stone fruit aromas. The mouthfeel is creamy and rich, with a touch of sweetness on the finish.",87,Cefalicchio 2011 Jalal Moscato (Puglia)
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot has produced a fruity wine, full of red fruits and with a touch of caramel. It is stylish, crisp and with fine bright acidity. Drink now.",85,Domaine Guillaman 2016 Rosé de Pressée Rosé (Côtes de Gascogne)
"This Cabernet equivalent to Grange has exploded in price (I remember tasting the 1996 on release when it was $25 per bottle), but there's no questioning the quality. A deep, intense nose of cassis, earth, menthol and cedar is followed by a full, rich palate that's supple without being soft. Brighter notes of red fruit emerge on the lengthy finish, which is dominated by sweet fruit and creamy lactones. Drink 2020–2030, and probably well beyond.",95,Penfolds 2014 Bin 707 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia)
"From the north of the Margaux appellation, this is a wine that has tense, acidic, black berry fruits, soft tannins and a light, juicy character. Not for long-term aging.",86,Château Grand Tayac 2008  Margaux
"Earthy plum and cherry aromas score points for being clear and direct. The palate on this varietal Mencía is round, smooth and just right. Lightly briny, earthy plum and cherry flavors hold steady on the finish, with a dash of saltiness.",90,Don Bernardino 2012 Amandi Mencía (Ribeira Sacra)
"The wine made good use of wood, giving mint flavors while not overtaking the black-currant fruitiness. Structured behind the fruit, it is balanced with an attractive burst of acidity at the end. Drink from 2018.",88,Médeville Collection 2015 8 Generation  (Bordeaux)
"This is a clean and compact Sauvignon (in a screwcap bottle) with floral-like aromas of white flower, honeysuckle and jasmine backed by sweet exotic fruit. The wine is thin and compact in the mouth with a tart citrusy finish.",84,Bastianich 2008 B Sauvignon (Venezia Giulia)
"Crushed stones and citrus blossoms perfume this fresh, primary Pinot Blanc. It's a bit puckery on the palate, but balanced nicely by sweet-tart peach and apple flavors. Ready to drink now, it's a value wine with a refreshing, widely appealing style.",90,Villa Wolf 2014 Pinot Blanc (Pfalz)
"This is a firm and structured wine that is not yet ready to drink. With surprising tannins and a tight texture, it needs time for the fruit to come through. Drink starting from 2017.",86,Pardon et Fils 2015 Cuvée de l'Ermitage  (Beaujolais-Villages)
"For a wine with such a large volume (over half a million cases were imported to the U.S.), the quality is admirable. Passion fruit and grapefruit elements dominate, while some grassier notes emerge as the wine sits in the glass, resulting in a pleasant blend of tropical and herbal notes. It's plump on the midpalate, then gains focus on the lengthy, mouthwatering finish.",88,Kim Crawford 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Toast and caramel notes mingle with mocha and dark plum flavors, resulting in a sleek wine with soft yet palpable tannins. As it opens up, soft plum and cherry fruit is revealed. The concentrated midpalate also signals that this will age and develop well.",90,Netzl 2011 Anna-Christina Red (Carnuntum)
"Begins with muddled, murky, syrupy aromas of caramel and berries. The palate is more high-toned, with lemony accents to tomato, baked fruit and savory flavors. Finishes solid albeit lightly damp and bitter. Comes around with time but always seems a bit murky.",86,Bodegas Palacio 2006 Glorioso Crianza  (Rioja)
"From a very cool vintage, this wine takes full advantage of the flavors the year delivered. Bracing and fresh, with a lively mix of lime and citrus fruits, its vivid acidity and a wash of wet rock, give it life and length across the palate. Complex and textural, this is a lovely wine.",91,L'Ecole No. 41 2010 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This second wine of Château Montrose is ripe and structured. In 2012, it formed 29% of total production at Montrose. It opens with severe tannins that transform into ripe blackberry as the wine opens out. Solidly structured and darkly tannic, it needs to age. Drink from 2018.",92,Château Montrose 2012 La Dame de Montrose  (Saint-Estèphe)
"Piercing lime notes hit a staccato beat against ripe, luscious white grapefruit in this spry, zesty Riesling. A shade off dry, it's vibrant yet satisfyingly easy drinking. Enjoy now for its youthful exuberance.",88,Thirsty Owl Wine Company 2014 Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Aromas of herbs and desert brush blend with raisiny berry scents. This feels grabby and tannic, while jammy, herbal berry flavors flatten out with airing. A loamy tasting finish loses some intensity and spirit as this settles.",89,Salentein 2014 Reserve Malbec (Valle de Uco)
"Underbrush, singed earth, mature dark-skinned fruit and a balsamic note emerge in the glass. The ripe, firm palate shows mocha, black raspberry and licorice as well as a slightly green note of raw sage. A backbone of bracing tannins provides the tight framework.",88,Boasso 2012 Margheria  (Barolo)
"Very light in appearance, this sprightly bottling offers tart yet warm aromas of wild cherry, cranberry, sweet oregano, sandalwood and wet earth. Pomegranate, strawberry, slate and cedar notes show on the palate, which showcases ripeness in a restrained fashion. Drink now–2035.",94,Chanin 2015 Los Alamos Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
"Front-loaded with black cherry and blackberry jam flavors, this Merlot has thick tannins and good acidity. It's a simple wine, but easy to drink with everyday fare, like burgers and tacos.",84,Bota Box 2012 Merlot (California)
"A senior version of Purple, this wood-aged wine is smooth, soft and generous, with attractive mint perfumes along with toast. Big black plum fruits are generous and warm, while still solid with tannins. The wine is drinkable, although it will be better in 2017.",88,Château Lagrézette 2012 Purple Réserve Malbec (Cahors)
"This is a clear, light wine, aged lightly in oak, only 30% of it new. Wild brush and burnt orange dominate in taste and aroma, with additional characteristics of rhubarb, red cherry and lovely rose.",91,R2 2013 Guidici Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Shows the beautiful acidity and dry crispness that this bottling invariably displays. But this cool, unbalanced vintage has taken its toll, with a green unripeness to the citrus fruit that even the winemaker admits was significantly cooler than average.",85,Robert Mondavi 2006 To Kalon Vineyard Reserve Fumé Blanc (Oakville)
"Generous in aromas of leather and chocolate-covered fig, this wine gets mushy in the middle. Thin with an earthy edge and a finish that's slightly herbal.",83,Spenker 2011 Estate Bottled Zinfandel (Lodi)
"Old vines planted in the 1950s by a neighbor named Ovide form this complex wine. Aged for eight months on lees, it is a concentrated wine, tight with acidity and with nutty flavors that add complexity and give the wine depth. This beautiful wine needs to age. Drink from 2018.",93,Pierre Morin 2014 Ovide  (Sancerre)
"Dried porcini and herb notes give breadth to the principal blackberry scent. It feels fluid and lithe, with a medium amount of sinewy tannins that lend the palate some traction. It's floral and peppery on the finish.",87,Ryker's Cellars 2011 R Red (America)
"The nose isn't very expressive but it eventually reveals delicate whiffs of white spring flower and green apple that carry over to the palate along with a hint of citrus. Racy acidity gives it a crisp, clean finish.",86,Subida di Monte 2014 Pinot Grigio (Collio)
"A beautifully structured Bordeaux blend from one of Washington's great vineyards. This spent about 18 months in French oak, and another 9–10 months in bottle. It is sleek and somewhat austere at first, but sculpted and evocative, with subtle, mixed fruits and impressions of steel and gunpowder. As the fruit comes up it shows some pretty blackberry and black cherry character, nicely balanced and set to evolve over the next decade or more.",90,Seven Hills 2005 Ciel du Cheval Red Red (Red Mountain)
"This attractive, light and fruity wine is made from grapes from different vineyards. It has the freshest fruit and a light, open texture that offers pleasant acidity and raspberry flavors. Drink now.",84,Ravoire et Fils 2014 Florette Rosé (Coteaux Varois en Provence)
"It show the vintage's weakness, with a vegetal edge to the cherries and oak.",84,Gary Farrell 2011 Russian River Selection Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"With its ripe fruits, rich texture and layers of toast, this is a great wine. It shows the quality of the great 2002 vintage brilliantly. It's complex and concentrated with an array of mature fruit flavors that combine to a structured whole. It will improve with age, so drink this great Champagne through 2025 and perhaps longer.",96,Billecart-Salmon 2002 Cuvée Nicolas François Billecart Brut  (Champagne)
"Coming from the popular vineyard owned by the Chumash tribe, this delivers aromas of ripe raspberries and sanguine, earthy elements of iron-rich dirts. It's fairly mellow on the palate, with flavors of wild berry, lifting anise and a dank sense of tree roots.",88,Comartin 2012 Camp Four Vineyard Grenache (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Craig has struggled to move this Paso Robles Syrah off-center and into the end zone for years. The fight continues. The wine is just too soft and simple in structure, although it does show pretty pepper-sprinkled black and blue berries and stone fruits.",85,Robert Craig 2004 Syrah (Central Coast)
"Aromas of spiced berry, coffee and balsam wood start slow and pick up intensity. This is powerful but focused from front to back, with hard but honest tannins that will soften with time. Pure, potent flavors of cherry, berry and chocolate come with tons of spicy, peppery oak and all sorts of textural depth. Drink from 2015–2028.",95,Cepa 21 2010 Malabrigo  (Ribera del Duero)
"Aromas of wood spice, plum and herb lead to black-fruit flavors and chalky, dry tannins that make it hard to access.",87,Three Rivers 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
Earthy notes of pollen accent robust yellow peach and quince in this medium-sweet Kabinett. Fine brisk texture and scintillating acidity lend a lacy fragile feel to the palate. The finish lingers sweetly.,89,Bastgen 2015 Kestener Paulinsberg Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"The king of New York State Riesling pulls it off again. This wine opens with a gorgeous blend of mineral and fruit. The vibrant flavors follow through in the mouth with wet stones, apricot, pear and just a touch of slate. The long, elegant finish justifies every penny of the $18 price tag.",89,Dr. Konstantin Frank 2007 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"A pickle-barrel aroma hits the nose first, before the notes of red berries, rose petals and bitter papaya seeds surface. The wine feels soft initially, but the acids gain some lift on the midpalate. The papaya seed note becomes more concentrated with time.",82,Rosemont 2011 Rosé (Virginia)
"This blend of Castelão and Touriga Nacional is well balanced. Spice from wood aging for nine months mingles with the ripe black-currant fruits. A firm wine with rich fruitiness, it's ready to drink.",91,Caves Velhas 2013 Cabeça de Toiro Reserva Red (Tejo)
"Dominated by Touriga Nacional, this impressive and concentrated wine has a powerful structure, dark tannins, black stone fruit and layered wood. With its dense character, it is made for aging, and should be cellared for 4–5 years.",92,Quinta de Ventozelo 2008 Grande Reserva Red (Douro)
"Dark strawberries, rose buds, black plums, sweet cedar, tangy herbs and oodles of dark fruit pour off the nose of this wine, which is leveled by 13% Syrah. Bursting acidity frames the palate alongside red currants, peppercorns, dill and black olive. It's slightly less dense in style than other Mourvèdres.",89,Mooney Family 2013 Mourvèdre (Paso Robles)
"The unusual aromas on this wine are a confounding mix of fusel oil and grass, much like a Sauvignon Blanc. The wine has noticeable residual sugar as well. This seems way out of any varietal norm for Oregon Pinot Gris, but other than that, it's perfectly quaffable.",86,Château Bianca 2012 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"Notes of grass, lime leaf and garrigue herbs lead the bouquet of this attractive wine, supported by fruity tones of white melon, green plum and citrus peel. The medium-weight mouthfeel is countered by ample acidity and pithy flavors that finish slightly astringent. Drink now.",86,Mas Belles Eaux 2015 Chardonnay (Pays d'Oc)
"From one of the largest private vineyards in France (2,300 acres), this wine epitomizes the light and fresh style that comes from Gascony in the hidden southwest of France. It is fruity, citrus-crisp with a touch of honey from the Gros Manseng in the blend. Drink now.",86,Domaine du Tariquet 2014 Classic White (Côtes de Gascogne)
"This very fine Cabernet wants a little time in the cellar. Right now, it's tight in tannins, with some acidic bitterness in the finish. The flavors are of black currants and smoky new oak. The Morisoli Vineyard has been home to very good, ageable bottlings from the likes of Sequoia Grove and Elyse, but in the last few years, Meander has expressed its terroir best. Try after 2012.This very fine Cabernet wants a little time in the cellar. Right now, it's tight in tannins, with some acidic bitterness in the finish.

"This smooth and creamy wood-aged wine brings a touch of spice to its rich and perfumed character. Ripe and rounded, this wine has apricot and sweet pear flavors.",90,Domaine l'Ancienne Cure 2010 L'Extase White (Bergerac Sec)
"This wine opens with notes of cedar, toast, black olive and smoke, with the Syrah showing prominently. The palate is quite restrained in style, with tart acids framing the fruit and savory flavors nicely. Floral and orange peel flavors round out the finish.",89,Telaya 2014 Turas Red
"Cranberry and currant dominate this restrained wine, wound up in tannins with a streak of sage accented by black pepper. On the finish expect deeper layers of chocolate and vanilla-caramel.",88,Clos du Val 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A red-berry-flavored wine, this has juicy acidity and a light touch of tannins. It's full of fresh fruit flavors, and the finish shows a red-cherry-like crispness.",85,Domaine Jessiaume 2010  Bourgogne
"A fine, everyday Merlot, soft and approachable, with ripe berry, cherry, cola and oak flavors. The tannins are pretty. Drink up.",85,Rexford 2009 Merlot (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Fresh cherry and berry aromas are easy to process and appealing. This has a full body that doesn't require much thought, while a lightly candied, peachy flavor profile ends in friendly, healthy fashion.",90,Llopart 2013 Leopardi Rosé Reserva Brut Sparkling (Cava)
"Underneath the oak is a modest, crisp Pinot Noir, dry and appealing in raspberry, cherry, cola and mushroom flavors. The oak is a little heavy-handed, though, making the wine feel heavy and finish sweet.",86,Bridlewood 2008 Pinot Noir (Monterey County)
"Made from vines planted in 1978 and 1983, this is a clean and fresh wine, a bit under-ripe with celery stalk, green apple and lemon flavors. Residual sugar is barely noticeable at 8g/L.",87,Airlie 2014 Two Vineyard Old Vines Dry Riesling (Willamette Valley)
"A little on the candied side, with pineapple and lemon-tart flavors accented with buttered toast notes from oak. The acidity is excellent.",87,Kenefick Ranch 2011 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Calistoga)
"Big, rowdy flavors like rhubarb and black cherries seem to fill this medium-bodied wine to the rim. Made from an unusual clone smuggled into the U.S. and whole cluster fermentation, it has richness, moderate tannins, and a broad mouthfeel, with little oak flavor showing through.",88,Balo 2014 Suitcase 828 Estate Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Tastes too sweet by far, with sugared black cherry, currant, prune and tobacco flavors. The sweetness may be partially attributed to high alcohol. With thick tannins, this Zin is just too rustic to merit a higher score.",86,Ridge 2009 Pagani Ranch Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley)
"Jammy, brambly aromas of grassy blueberry and balsamic vinegar make for a rough entry. This feels chunky, grabby and hard, while flavors of lactic oak and herbal blueberry are strained. A spicy, green-leaning finish comes with a final dose of hard tannins.",84,Kaiken 2014 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Here's a Syrah that will appeal to fans of fruit. It shows a burst of blackberries, cherries and raspberries, with an edge of dark chocolate, as well as Syrah's spice and pepper notes. Bone dry and fiercely tannic.",86,Ben Hogan 2008 Syrah (Paso Robles)
"Big, meaty and dense, with dampness, earth and size. This is your typical deep and chewy wine, but the structure and core qualities are just above average. Flavors of black cherry, plum and brown sugar are good, while the finish shows a creamy vanilla flavor and cola. Good but not great for the price.",87,Riglos 2006 Gran Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Despite some very ripe fruit flavors and ample (14.5%) alcohol, this full-bodied Shiraz isn't particularly lush. The tannins are rich and velvety, but the acids are elevated and tartness dominates the finish. Drink it over the next several years.",87,Yangarra Estate Vineyard 2007 Shiraz (McLaren Vale)
"With its high proportion of Cabernet Franc (45%), this is a finely perfumed rich wine. It has great tannins, a smoky character that comes from the wood. The tannins are quite marked, giving a tight firm edge to the wine that otherwise has generous fruitiness. This is a complex wine, impressive, and likely to age over many years. Drink from 2028.",96,Château Cheval Blanc 2014  Saint-Émilion
"Black cherry fruits sink even deeper into blackberry jam on this nose, which is leveled by vanilla and black licorice. It's chunky and sticky once sipped, with blueberry juice and chocolate-chip elements that are cut with anise-like herbs. Espresso shows on the finish, which is slightly sour and bitter.",87,HammerSky 2010 Red Handed Merlot (Paso Robles)
"Bright aromas of crushed strawberry, rose petal and alpine herb waft out of the glass. On the refined, savory palate, green tea, graphite and a mineral note add depth to the red-berry core. Balanced with fresh acidity and supple tannins, this wine is all about sheer elegance and enjoyment.",91,Abbazia di Novacella 2013 Pinot Nero (Alto Adige Valle Isarco)
"Made entirely with Nebbiolo from Alto Piemonte, this boasts alluring aromas of ripe black-skinned berries, dark cooking spices, cut roses, new leather and tilled earth. The taut, elegant palate is loaded with flavor and finesse, delivering mature black cherries, cranberries, licorice and tobacco framed in youthfully assertive but polished tannins. Fresh acidity provides balance. Drink 2019–2031.",93,Centovigne 2011 Castellengo Nebbiolo (Coste della Sesia)
"Peach, melon and citrus aromas are good but standard. This is edgy and sharp due to lean pointy acidity. As a result of that acidity, this is tart and citric in flavor, with little lees or yeasty richness to soften things up. A finish with stony, dry lime flavors is scouring.",88,Nora 2015 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
Arinto is the real local grape of the small city of Bucelas where this quinta is located. This fresh wine shows its light mineral and citrus character very well. It also brings out riper fruit flavors that fill it out and give it a rich character. The wine is ready to drink now.,87,Quinta da Romeira 2014 Prova Régia Arinto (Lisboa)
"The nose is a bit one-note, showing a generic Juicy Fruit gum aroma. Sharp acids frame a palate of canned fruit cocktail, leading to an astringent finish.",83,Ingleside 2014 Viognier (Virginia)
"A small percentage of Petit Verdot helps darken this wine, a touch of saddle and leather at the fore of the aroma. From there, inky blackberry and plum jockey for position against the solid oak and firm-grained tannin, a call out for steak clearly heard.",89,Stuhlmuller Vineyards 2012 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Simple and fruity yet lacking in acidity, this is a soft style of Cabernet Sauvignon. It's fruity, with strawberry jelly flavor, and should be drunk immediately.",84,Florent Descombe NV Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de France)
"This interpretation of Sangiovese Grosso is clean, polished, ripe and elegant. It opens with dark concentration and berry notes of cassis and candied cherry, and then rum cake, leather and tobacco show up on the finish, backed by firm tannins and bright acidity.",94,Gianni Brunelli 2006 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Muted aromas of blueberry and spice carry through into flavors that are equally tight-lipped. A charred-herb flavor imparts a bitter sensation, with bristly tannins framing the soft fruit core.",82,Boxwood 2009 Red (Virginia)
"Pepper, ollallieberry, roasted pork and a violet-flavored candy aroma comprise the nose on this wine from a vineyard north of the Santa Maria Valley. Zesty acidity on the palate cuts through the boysenberry, anise and game flavors, making for a lively wine.",89,Brander 2012 Colson Canyon Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"This is a lively, ripe wine. Peach and apricot fruits are laced with spice and acidity. Rich and fruity, it has a tropical, warm feel, a product of the ripe vintage. Drink now.",87,Domaine Saumaize-Michelin 2015 Creches  (Saint-Véran)
"Virtú is the winery's white blend, this vintage partnering 56% Sémillon with 44% Sauvignon Blanc. The combination is explosive, briny and flowery in the best ways, a taste of apple and fresh-squeezed lime vibrant on the palate, followed by savory herb and a nuanced taste of toasty oak. The aroma conveys a sense of fresh salt air.",90,St. Supéry 2012 Virtú Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"The restrained nose shows some white peach notes, lees and stony minerality. This is complex, layered and persistent across the palate, opening up to ample stone fruit flavors, earthy notes, dried herbs and spice. Crisp, with sweetness, moderately concentrated flavors and a rich texture all in balance, if a little loose knit on the finish.",89,Clusserath-Weiler 2008 Trittenheimer Apotheke Spätlese Riesling (Mosel)
A sourness of bitter black tea overtakes a shyness of fruit in this light-bodied wine that holds on to its tannin with tenacity.,85,Orsi Family Vineyards 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"A wish of smoke adds complexity and mystery to bright tangerine, white peach and floral notes on this dry-style Riesling. It's delicate in body, but vibrantly structured, with tart lemon-lime acidity that pierces through ripe stone-fruit flavors on the palate.",87,Lakewood 2011 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"It conveys a lightly floral, herbaceous fragrance. The palate is more restrained than exuberant, offering juicy pineapple, citrus, pink grapefruit and mineral accented with sage and rosemary.",89,Rocca del Principe 2011  Fiano di Avellino
"Fleshy, soft and honeyed on the nose, with spiced pear aromas. Feels sort of flabby, with soft acids and meaty, mustardy flavors of white fruits that finish blowsy. Flowery and fluffy now, but it seems to be fading.",84,Oveja Negra 2010 Reserva Chardonnay-Viognier (Maule Valley)
"Harsh red-berry aromas are strained. This feels flabby and clumsy, while weedy, medicinal berry flavors do nothing to elevate this shaky, hard-tannin Sangiovese.",81,Tercos 2015 Sangiovese (Mendoza)
Barrel aromas of vanilla and coconut are followed by fruit-forward cranberry and raspberry flavors and a vanilla-filled finish. The oak plays prominently.,88,Coeur d'Alene 2013 Merlot (Washington)
"Mid-gold in color, this has a pronounced classic Gewürztraminer nose of lychee, rose petals, spice and ripe stone fruit with notes of earthy minerality. Sweet and richly textured, round mouthfeel with moderately intense flavors similar to nose with an added note of stem ginger and smoky spice on the finish.",89,Fitz-Ritter 2008 Spätlese Gewürztraminer (Pfalz)
"From 60-year-old bush vines, this is rich, spicy and with a soft texture. Black fruits give a ripe character and a smooth texture that is beginning to bring in some secondary, earthy flavors. Drink this mature wine now.",88,Casa Cadaval 2012 Preta Vinhas Velhas Trincadeira (Tejo)
"With minerally, clean aromas of lemon-lime and seashell, this is ready for summer sipping. A tangy, citric palate offers pure orange, tangerine and lime flavors, with mango thrown in for moderate sweetness. A citrusy, cleansing palate is exactly as it should be.",88,Pedro Escudero 2013 Fuente Milano Verdejo-Viura (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)
This wine has mouth-puckering tannins that make it almost impenetrable. Its baked plum fruit meets a Dr. Pepper-type cola flavor.,84,Longboard 2014 Rhino Chaser Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"The Reserva version of Mural makes a powerful statement. Dark in color and packed with concentrated fruit, it is full of tannins as well as brooding black-plum flavors. Spice and juicy acidity complete the ensemble. It's a solid wine that needs to age to soften the tannic structure. Drink from 2017.",91,Quinta do Portal 2011 Mural Reserva Red (Douro)
"Aromas of green apple and white flowers prepare the palate for a wine that fills the mouth with soft fruit flavors, in particular apple, grapefruit and pineapple. The soft finish is marked by a note of Granny Smith apple.",87,Teliani Valley 2015 Tsolikouri
"Syrah takes the lead on this blend followed by a healthy dose of Mourvèdre. It's the latter that is initially evident, with generous white-pepper and meaty aromas followed by fresh flowers, raspberries and a touch of coffee. The red- and blue-fruit flavors show a fine sense of balance, with plenty of hang time on the finish.",89,Cloudlift Cellars 2013 Zephyr G-S-M (Columbia Valley (WA))
"In the same family since the 18th century, this estate has produced a soft, smooth and rounded wine. It has weight while the red fruits are ripe and full in the mouth. It does miss some crispness, although with its forward fruitiness it is generous and ready to drink.",88,Château de Pourcieux 2016 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
This is a lean wine that seems to be missing the fruit. It has an austere quality with a strongly tannic element and mineral acidity.,83,Château Roustaing 2012 Réserve Vieilles Vignes  (Bordeaux)
"This young and quite tart Pinot is subtly flecked with mineral, dried seaweed, and a dusty, saline character. It tastes much better than that may sound; it's complex, well structured, and unique.",90,Purple Hands 2011 Holstein Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"On the austere side, the tannins dry and firm. The fruit flavors echo the severe character, with red currant flavors and a slight vegetal edge.",85,Château Tour Saint-Joseph 2007  Haut-Médoc
"This wine carries aromas of white blossom in the dusk and freshly ripened stone fruit. The palate continues on this dreamy note, enveloping the tart-ripe freshness of red apples and a touch of citrus. The fruit is remarkably ripe and fresh for a wine from the 2012 vintage. The just off-dry palate hides nothing and just charms and entices. Lovely, dreamy, pure flavors from start to long, long finish. Drink 2017–2030.",94,Domaine Gresser 2012 Wiebelsberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"This clonal study leans into a quite tropical area, blending aromas of honeysuckle and other white flowers with guava fruit. There is good energy on the palate, with a sour apple-cider character midway, dried pears throughout, stony minerality and a bitter aftertaste.",87,Lafond 2013 Lafond Vineyard Musqué Clone Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"There's 5% Malbec in the blend, but the austere, scrapey tannins of the Franc still dominate the finish. The fruit is pretty, with blueberry character to burn. The wine hits the palate well in the beginning, but seems to sag a bit midpalate before heading into that astringent finish, enlivened by toasty new oak. If you like blueberries, you'll like this wine.",87,Three Rivers 2006 Weinbau Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope)
"90-92 Firmly structured, tough in character, a wine that has big fruit and big tannins. Dense and potentially powerful.",91,Château Duplessis 2010 Barrel sample  (Moulis-en-Médoc)
"Barrel aromas of vanilla, toast and woodspice are at the fore. The palate brings a full feel, with the wood taking over.",87,Airfield Estates 2014 Reserve Chardonnay (Yakima Valley)
"A relatively soft entry, tart plum fruit, simple berry flavors and a hint of burnt toast. There is a slight burn also in the finish, that reflects the near-15% alcohol. A little chocolaty film wraps the tannins.",85,Locati Cellars 2006 Barbera (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Lacking intensity, the nose exhibits mild notes of ripe red apple while the palate adds a touch of canteloupe. Fat and round with a fleeting finish, the wine never really makes a strong impression.",81,Fortant 2005 Kosher Chardonnay (Vin de Pays d'Oc)
"Intriguing due to its aromatic complexity, this wine offers up caramel, honey, citrus and brown sugar notes that slide into a crisp palate that has sweet flavors but little residual sugar. Medium, pear-accented finish. Drink now.",85,Keuka Spring 2008 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes)
"Rounded in baked and dried fruit aromas, this is a soft, gentle wine with tangy acidity and swathes of ripe apple and orange citrus. A backbone of subtle oak gives it structure and complexity, finishing lean and bright, with a darker, richer twist of vanilla and clove in the mix.",90,ZD 2013 45th Anniversary Reserve Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Jammy aromas of raisin and cassis include a green whiff and volatility. Flavors of plum and berry are herbal, then overripeness comes back into play. Given the region's high standards, this is just o.k.",84,Cellers Unió 2011 Señorio de Convey Grenache-Carignan (Priorat)
"A full-bodied, ripe wine, showing flavors of pepper and apricot. It feels rich and smooth, with a full texture and a good depth of green and yellow fruits. The finish has a fine lift of acidity. Screwcap.",89,Buchegger 2011 Gebling Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"Quite intense aromas of plum brandy and kirsch are boosted with scents of iron and black pepper on this bottling. The palate shows stewed cherries and strawberries, and there is both acidity and tannic grip, proving this to be a complete and solid wine.",88,Boëté 2012 Saunders Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Franc (Carmel Valley)
"The aromas are brooding, with notes of wood spice, incense, black fruit and graphite. The palate brings bold blackberry flavors backed by firm tannins. It needs time to unwind. Best after 2020.",91,Two Vintners 2014 Sal May's Discovery Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills)
"The oak jumps out a bit, with plenty of vanilla and a bit of dill, too. A medium-bodied Merlot, still young and tannic and not yet unwrapped. Additional cellar time will help. —P.G.",87,Columbia Winery 1999 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"With a fresh, jammy, blackberry flavor, this is a nice Syrah to drink now. It's a big wine, full bodied, tannic and bone dry. On its own, it's a bit tough, but pair it with rich, oily lamb, beef and game dishes and it will rise to the occasion.",86,Santa Barbara Winery 2009 Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Yes, that is the correct spelling, as shown on the wine's label. A blend of 10% Merlot, 56% Syrah, and 34% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is dark, plum-colored and dusty with scents of plum and prune. Soft and moving quickly into midlife, it drinks like an older wine, with soft tannins and a hint of supple leather.",86,Cathedral Ridge 2007 Bordheauxd Red Red (Columbia Valley (OR))
"With the normally more northern Alvarinho in the blend, this wine has considerable freshness. That is mitigated by the wood aging that has broadened the wine and brought out tropical and yellow fruit flavors. The wine is ready to drink.",88,Adega Cooperativa de Borba 2013 Branco Reserva White (Alenteo)
"This basic, inexpensive Pinot has Syrah and Viognier blended, but overall the wine is fairly generic, with a streak of smokiness in the background.",82,Peltier 2012 Hybrid Pinot Noir (Lodi)
"Showing a light whiff of funk, this seems a bit reductive at first, but opens gracefully with adequate aeration. Black cherry and dark chocolate flavors combine and thread into a medium finish with some of that same earthy character.",92,Archery Summit 2012 Red Hills Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Pure Merlot, ripe and fruity, this wine has only the lightest of tannic structure. That makes for a soft rounded wine from the area close to Lussac Saint-Émilion. Black plum and berry flavors are laced with acidity and finish with a smooth aftertaste. Drink now.",87,Château des Arnauds 2014  Bordeaux
"This is soft and lightly scented with citrus. Aromas of lemon peel precede light flavors of citrus and green apple. It's a simple, quaffable white wine, with a bit of Riesling and Viognier in the blend.",85,StoneCap 2012 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Dusty stone-fruit aromas suggest yeast and nectarine. This varietal Xarel-lo feels citrusy and spunky; flavors of melon, orange and nectarine are good but standard on the finish. Overall, this is linear and fairly basic for white wine.",87,Agustí Torelló Mata 2015 XIC Xarel-lo (Penedès)
"This is a fruit bomb supreme. Bright, effusive strawberry, raspberry and boysenberry aromas and flavors seem to spread out in all directions, first in the aroma, then repeating in the flavors and finish. With a sip or two some deeper black cherry notes emerge, and full body and gripping tannins become more apparent.",88,Peltier 2013 Hybrid Petite Sirah (Lodi)
"This is a very full, meaty, saturated blend, with a lightly stewed nose that carries aromas of tomato, bacon, mint and brambly berry. It feels grabby and punchy due to strong tannins, then tastes of medicinal black fruit, herb and coconut-tinged oak. Spicy and hard on the finish.",87,San Pedro 2009 1865 Limited Edition Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Cachapoal Valley)
"In just a few years 14 Hands Riesling production has jumped from around 15,000 to more than 700,000 cases. Clearly the brand is doing something that consumers love. This is a fairly dry style, with forward, fruity flavors of ripe orange, apple and apricot. The length and concentration are spot on.",88,14 Hands 2013 Riesling (Washington)
"Applesauce, lime and mineral aromas comprise the shy bouquet on this Cava. It feels round yet alive, with crisp apple and peach flavors. Citrus-driven acidity comes out on the finish.",88,Marqués de Gelida 2009 Brut Reserva Made with Organic Grapes Sparkling (Cava)
"An aromatic and fruit filled wine with notes of cherry cordial, raspberry, herb and barrel accents. It has sweet cherry flavors with firm tannins and well balanced acidity. Best after 2017.",90,Canoe Ridge 2011 Estate Grown Blocks 14 & 11 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Full and ripe, this is a rich wine. Its tannins are well cushioned by the ripe black fruits and generous texture. Fruity with balanced acidity, the wine is spicy and with an open aftertaste. Drink now.",87,Georges Vigouroux 2015 Gouleyant Malbec (Cahors)
"Ample blueberry and black cherry fruit is toned by fresh acidity and held in a concentrated body. Little by little the Zweigelt pepperiness creeps in and makes for a punchy, focused red with just the right amount of still perceptible tannins. Great clean finish.",90,Zantho 2013 Zweigelt (Burgenland)
"A 100% varietal wine, grown in an area called the Lower Mountaintop, this offers a compelling candied cherry and raspberry element, supported by complex accents of vanilla and cured meat. With plenty of body to stay fresh and vibrant on the palate, it never gets bogged down, finishing in richer components of dark chocolate and oak.",93,Pride Mountain 2012 Vintner Select Merlot (Sonoma County)
"Inviting raspberry and cherry aromas have a tiny level of volatility, while the palate is chunky, bold and edgy, with big berry flavors leading the way. Full on the finish, with some oak and vanilla to give it padding. Lively, full-bodied Cabernet that's pretty good in the long run.",86,Familia Cassone 2007 Finca La Florencia Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"This lacks a bit of midpalate richness, but otherwise offers fine drinking. Clove, cinnamon and leather complexities keep the cherry flavors interesting, while the finish is clean and crisp. Drink now.",87,Mills Reef 2012 Gimblett Gravels Reserve Merlot-Malbec (Hawke's Bay)
"A rich interpretation of the Castelão grape, the wine is opulent and generous. It has juicy black fruits that are lifted by acidity. The slight tannins are far in the background of this wine that will be ready to drink by the end of 2016.",89,Quinta de Chocapalha 2013 Castelão (Lisboa)
"Pressed white flowers and white orchard fruit aromas emerge on this racy sparkler. The palate offers white peach, kiwi, pear and apple alongside bright acidity and a vibrant perlage. An energizing saline note closes the finish.",89,La Farra 2014 Brut  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"This pure varietal bottling is compact and tannic. Blue and black fruits lean toward deep cassis flavors, with earth, pencil lead and peppery herb along for the ride. Chewy tannins and herbal flavors come up in the finish.",89,Burrowing Owl 2011 Cabernet Franc (Okanagan Valley)
"This is a darkly fruity and spicy wine from a site overlooking the Marin Coastal range, often shrouded in fog. Planted to five clones, the site provides plenty of cardamom, clove, forest floor and black tea while allowing for a wildness of plum tart and crusty bread. The oak imprint is light.",92,Boheme 2013 English Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Incredibly sweet, with caramelized brown sugar flavors of blackberries and chocolate, this dessert wine tastes a bit like an easy Port. It's made with traditional Port varieties, with California additions of Petite Sirah and Cabernet Sauvignon. Turns quick and simple on the finish, so drink now.",87,Prager 2009 Port (Napa Valley)
"Bramble, smoke and charred wood notes add rusticity to the subtle red-cherry and plum flavors. The full-bodied palate is earthy, with tones of dried mushroom and leaf that are marked by big, chunky tannins. It finishes surprisingly sweetly, with a bright red-raspberry note.",89,Sutor 2008 Pinot Noir (Vipavska Dolina)
"This shows a combination of deep fruit flavors and a firm, tight-grained texture that make it classic in style. Black cherry and black currant flavors are wonderfully accented by impressions of pine forest and dried mushrooms. Baxter matured this wine in 100% neutral French oak barrels, so the taste is all about the Langley grapes and not new oak.",93,Baxter 2012 Langley Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"With a perfumed nose of rose and toasted oak, this wine is thick in red fruit, dense oak and a welcome undercurrent of bright acidity that helps keep it fresh in the glass. Small amounts of Merlot, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec are all within.",90,Bell 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This wine is still so young but shows considerable potential. Its concentration and acidity are balanced by rich honey, dried fruit and bitter orange flavors that need time to come into balance, so wait until 2025 to open.",96,Château Nairac 2014  Barsac
"Tough and gritty for a Merlot, with sweet and sour cherry and blackberry flavors wrapped into stringy tannins. With its briary, peppery finish, it could almost be a Zinfandel.",86,Ballentine 2008 Pocai Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Sweet and oaky, and a little bit forced, but even so this is a natural, full-bodied Chardonnay with a chunky palate and tropical, sweet flavors. As it opens it goes more into the banana, vanilla and papaya field of play, and it finishes decidedly creamy and round. Very good stuff from Tamaya.",88,Tamaya 2009 Winemaker's Selection Single Vineyard Quebrada Seca Chardonnay (Limarí Valley)
"This Brut sparkler sees Chardonnay and Pinot Nero blended together to produce a fragrant and creamy whole. Aromas here include stone fruit, mineral and sourdough bread. It feel silky, rich and offers sharp, tonic perlage that keeps the palate refreshed.",91,Bellavista 2005 Gran Cuvée Brut Sparkling (Franciacorta)
"An impressively full wine, its ripe apricot flavors melding seamlessly into rich wood and concentrated flavors. The lemon acidity enlivens the ripe yellow fruits, leaving a rich final impression.",91,Domaine Leflaive 2008  Mâcon-Verze
"Basilicata, the “arch” of the boot of Italy, is one of the country's most fascinating and little-known regions. Insular, superstitious and rustic, it is also a territory deeply linked to its wine growing traditions. Here's an openly aromatic white with soapy floral notes and flavors of dried apricot and honey. You'd think it was a dessert wine, but its not.",86,Cantina di Venosa 2005 Terre di Orazio Dry Muscat (Basilicata)
"A blend of Sangiovese, with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this offers aromas of ripe blackberry, baking spice, toasted oak and a balsamic note. The round, savory palate offers black cherry, ground pepper, anise, espresso and tobacco alongside polished tannins.",91,Rocca delle Macìe 2012 Famiglia Zingarelli Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"A slight hint of petrol on the nose of this wine by veteran Kathy Joseph then ventures into delicate and soft aromas of preserved lemons and scratched grapefruit skin. It's edgy in style, treading a pithy line of tangelo, pomelo and yellow grapefruit, with racy and lingering lemon-spritz acidity.",91,Fiddlehead 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
"Delicate aromas of yellow flower, beeswax and orchard fruit lead the way. The palate is bright and straightforward while offering tastes of yellow apple skin, citrus and a hint of mineral carried by bright acidity.",87,Gigante 2013 Chardonnay (Friuli Colli Orientali)
"A blend of Pinot Bianco, Friulano, Sauvignon and Ribolla Gialla, this structured but elegant wine offers Golden apple, dried apricot, citrus and subtle oak along with a hint of butterscotch.",88,Russiz Superiore 2011 Col Disôre White (Collio)
"This Syrah is hard and tannic now, and it will always be hard and tannic, but it's quite an impressive wine. So dense and layered, it reveals tiers of complexity with every sip as it airs in the glass. The flavors are of pure, ripe wild blackberries, with currant, coffee and tobacco notes, and sprinkled with crushed black pepper. Drink now–2013.",92,Spotted Owl 2007 Alexandria's Cuvée Syrah (Mount Veeder)
"Cola and cranberry juice decorate the crushed asphalt and light peppercorn notes of the nose on this bottling by Adam Lazarre and company. The palate plays the slightly underripe card, with Kalamata olive and green-peppercorn notes spicing up the more standard cranberry and pomegranate flavors. It's quite vibrant and zesty.",87,Cycles Gladiator 2014 Pinot Noir (Central Coast)
"This ripe wine from Albin Roux's estate is generous and packed with rich apricot and pear fruits. There is a steely edge to the texture, giving a final bite to the acidity of this opulent wine.",88,Domaine Roux 2015  Quincy
"A 100% Sauvignon Blanc that was fermented in both stainless steel and neutral oak, this wine offers floral, nutty and deeply layered suggestions of structured oak. Medium to full-bodied, it's lengthy and impressive, with crispness to the finish.",90,Salvestrin 2013 LeBlanc Crystal Springs Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (St. Helena)
"Only their second vintage of Finger Lakes Riesling, Long Island's Macari Vineyards makes quite a splash with this beautifully honeyed yet dry and fruitful wine. Richly textured with notes of yellow freesia and preserved peach, it finishes elegantly on a subtly astringent black tea note.",89,Macari 2010 Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"A massive wine, decadent and splendid, and a worthy followup to the near-perfect 2008. Densely packed in fruit, it explodes in blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, minerals and sweet, toasty new oak. That richness is lifted to brilliance by the tannic structure, which is world class. So deliciously approachable, it's drinkable now, but it should develop over the next 6–8 years. Beyond that, all bets are off, because this modern style of soft, relatively high-alcohol wines has yet to prove itself over the long haul.",96,Venge 2009 Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Spicy red fruit and pepper lead on this Bordeaux blend from the Finger Lakes, and lively fruit flavors follow. Tannins, acid and oak are balanced and attractive, and the finish has length and structure. Overall, a wine with poise.",86,Swedish Hill 2005 Optimus Red (Finger Lakes)
"With a few years of age and three years in wood, this wine has become rich, full of concentration and delicious. It has weight and opulent black fruits to go with its fresh acidity. It's an elegant, smoothly textured wine, finishing with some dry tannins. Drink now.",91,Messias 2010 Clássico Garrafeira Baga (Bairrada)
"This lovely Dolcetto is delicious, fresh and utterly drinkable. It has a classic fragrance of strawberry, cherry and licorice, all of which carry over to the palate, along with earthy notes and a hint of almond. Made to be enjoyed young, this pairs perfectly with pasta dishes and pizza.",90,Pecchenino 2012 San Luigi  (Dogliani)
"This wine commands attention with its aromas of dark raspberries, milk chocolate and barrel spices. Flavors show plenty of richness and intensity with a supple texture that dazzles.",92,Novelty Hill 2012 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Long-time Cloudy Bay winemaker Kevin Judd has been out on his own for several vintages, and this is a fine effort. The characteristic herbal, grassy elements of Marlborough are present, but toned-down, making this wine an easier fit with a variety of foodstuffs. A pleasant plumpness to the mouthfeel turns dry and chalky on the long finish.",90,Greywacke 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Coming from one of the state's top Syrah sites, this wine starts out quite aromatically closed up, with notes of brambly blue fruit and herbs, along with whiffs of orange peel and smoked meat. The flavors, in contrast, pop with electric notes of dark plum and huckleberry and lingering undercurrents of smoked meat and orange rind. Give it some time to open up and it delivers.",92,William Church 2013 Red Willow Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"Camphor, espresso and black-skinned berry lead the nose while the delicious palate offers crushed black raspberry, orange peel, white pepper, chopped herb and a hint of star anise. It's tightly wound with youthfully firm but elegant tannins. Drink 2018–2024.",92,Paolo Scavino 2012 Monvigliero  (Barolo)
"Merlot makes up 58% of this blend, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon (33%) and Cabernet Franc. A blend of fruit from Anna Marie, Spring Valley, Loess, and Minnick Hills vineyards, the aromas are light, with notes of plum, raspberry, barrel toast and spice. The palate is soft and silky, gliding on the finish. It's all about delicacy.",91,Northstar 2014 Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"The bouquet of white peach and wet stones is fresh as can be. There's a rich texture to the palate, with flavors of cinnamon and spice accenting ripe pear. Finishes long and fairly full with some banana flavor.",87,La Diacceta 2000 Vernaccia (San Gimignano)
"Full-bodied and loaded with finesse, this wine opens with multifaceted aromas of ripe orchard fruit, candied citrus zest, pressed flower and mineral tones. The focused, elegant palate offers ripe apple, pear, tangy nectarine, lemon drop and flint. While enjoyable now, this will drink well through 2023.",92,Cantina Terlano 2013 Vorberg Riserva Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige Terlano)
"Lively but also narrow on the nose. The feel is very fresh and juicy due to firm, bracing acidity that gives a tangy, lemony character to the wine's dark-fruit core. Snappy, linear and crisp for a wine of magnitude and extraction. Some might say it's sheering and acidic; others might call it ageworthy.",89,Trivento 2007 Eolo Malbec (Luján de Cuyo)
"Ripe in oak, this Chardonnay has aromas of candied lemon and chiffon, and is crisp in acidity with a taste of wet stone and fresh peach. With layers and depth, the oak rears its head most prominently on the finish.",88,Judson Hale Winery 2012 Chardonnay (Yorkville Highlands)
"This wine is earthy, peppery and grippy. It is hard to penetrate in its mix of spicy clove and sour fruit.",84,Mario Perelli-Minetti 2013 Miriam Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak)
"Girlan's youthful and fragrant Pinot Bianco delivers aromas of honeydew melon and white rose. The wine is tonic and fresh in the mouth, yet has the staying power to pair with white meat or pork roasts.",87,Girlan 2007 Plattenriegl Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
"Aromas of smoke and sweet apple introduce an intensely flavored palate that's full of ripe yellow peach, waxy flower and fresh fennel. Off-dry and bold in structure, it finishes with a hint of lanolin and a lingering minerality.",88,Red Tail Ridge 2011 RTR Vineyard Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"A medium-bodied, dry Silvaner, with modestly earthy, minerally and grapefruity aromas and citrus and mineral flavors. It finishes clean and fresh, with only 11% alcohol. Serve as an apéritif, alone or with passed hors d'oeuvres.",86,Thüngersheim 2007 Thüngersheimer Ravensburg Kabinett Trocken Silvaner (Franken)
"This Nerello Mascalese has Mediterranean herb, dark spice and orange peel aromas. Its simple, rather unusual palate evokes strawberry, white pepper and lemon alongside bright acidity and loose-knit tannins. Drink soon.",86,Al-Cantàra 2015 Muddichi di Suli Nerello Mascalese (Terre Siciliane)
"Blended from a range of vineyards, this tasty, toasty wine cloaks its raspberry fruit in chocolate malt-like flavor. Its components are clearly defined, fresh and appealing, and it showcases the sophisticated house style in a more widely-distributed, less expensive offering.",91,Bergström 2014 Cumberland Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"From old vines planted on the Mayacamas Mountains, this Gewurz is pungent in lychee and grapefruit, a trace of pepper, ginger and clove hiding beneath the surface. Medium-bodied and dry, it offers a rich interplay between herb and spice plus freshness on the finish.",88,Gundlach Bundschu 2013 Estate Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Sonoma Coast)
"Starts out somewhat fiery, with a dose of aromatic horseradish. After airing out, this varietal Tempranillo is fresh, juicy and crisp on the tongue, with flavors of baking spices, tomato, roasted plum and earth. Feels juicy on the finish, maybe a bit lean, and overall it's cut from the classic cloth.",87,Viña Bujanda 2006 Reserva  (Rioja)
"Made from Clarksburg grapes, a small appellation near Lodi, this soft Merlot tastes a touch metallic and its blackberry and cherry notes finish a tad bitter.",84,Tortoise Creek 2009 Schoolhouse Cuvee Merlot (Clarksburg)
"This powerful Cabernet Sauvignon calls on 13% Malbec to further its brawn, the mix spending two years in entirely new French oak. Hugely muscular, it needs time to calm its masterfully ripe fruit and dark layers of clove spice, and to further soften its tannins and coax out the shy component of herb. The vineyard behind the wine is Bismark within the newly named Moon Mountain District.",90,Ram's Gate 2010 Winemaker's Cuvée Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley)
"Not much going on with this simple but drinkable Pinot Noir. It's light in body and softly crisp, with slightly sweet cherry pie and sweet oak flavors.",84,J. Lohr 2011 Falcon's Perch Pinot Noir (Monterey County)
"Dry and bitter, this Sangiovese is better than most California bottlings, but has its work cut out for it. It shows a good range of tart cherryskin flavors, with additional flavors of acidic things like espresso and tobacco.",85,D'Argenzio 2005 D'Alfonso Sangiovese (Sonoma Valley)
"This structured, mineral wine has a fine tension between tight acidity and zesty acidity that gives it a nervy, crisp character. It is still developing, with its steely structure still dominant; drink from 2017.",88,Domaine Carrette 2013 Les Crays  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
"This bold offering delivers nicely integrated red fruit and spice aromas. The close is polished and dry, showing tight tannins that need 10 years or more to evolve.",91,Negretti 2008 Bricco Ambrogio  (Barolo)
"From first sniff this exquisite wine grabs you and won't let go. Brambly berries, redolent with rich umami notes of spice and pine needle cascade into a wine densely packed with fruit and herbs. It lingers, opens and becomes more and more expressive, with soil-generated flavors of forest floor.",97,Ken Wright 2012 Abbott Claim Vineyard Pinot Noir
"Very Douro in its mineral texture and dry core, it also has a surround of ripe black fruits. It's concentrated and has some aging potential, although it can be drunk now.",87,Quinta de Porrais 2010 Porrais Red (Douro)
"Vibrant tropical fruit and citrus on the nose start this poised white from Greece. Pineapple, lemon and banana flavors are balanced by refreshing acidity and minerality. Overall, the wine is a delicious blend of fresh and fruity. A great find.",88,Domaine Costa Lazaridi 2009 Château Julia Chardonnay (Drama)
"Streamlined and bright, this offers the aromatic intensity and complexity one should expect from Roero. Aromas include chopped mint, cola and wild berry.",88,Matteo Correggia 2009  Roero
"This wine is marked by oak, baked vanilla and bacon, and is quite thick and syrupy, offering generic tones of berry and plum.",83,Stama 2012 Merlot (Lodi)
"Blakeslee brings a wine with pinpoint aromas of beet root, ripe strawberries and accents of Dr Pepper and clove. Young and tart, it remains compact but shows an elegant profile, with the promise of further development. Drink now through 2030.",92,Blakeslee 2012 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"This offers aromas of mature black fruit and raisin. The palate delivers a vibrant black-cherry core, layered with accents of black pepper and Asian spice. It also has fresh acidity for the vintage, and will pair well with buttery dishes or cured meats.",88,Montecariano 2009  Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso
"The price is right, but the wine is a little vegetal despite some cherry and currant flavors. Will do in a pinch, if your guests aren't particular.",82,Big House NV Red (California)
"A small vineyard of just over 10 acres in the north of the Margaux appellation, Bellevue de Tayac obviously received serious attention from then-owner Jean-Luc Thunevin of Château Valandraud in Saint-Émilion. You can taste that in the vanilla flavors from the wood aging and the smooth texture. It's a micro-cuvée that shows great richness and potential. Drink from 2018.",90,Château Bellevue de Tayac 2012  Margaux
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Carmenère is the best wine from Santa Alicia I've come across. The nose is spicy, dry and delivers earthy cherry and plum aromas. It feels right and tastes of spicy raspberry and plum, with a fruity, complex finish. A good wine for food with nice acidity; drink now–2015.",91,Santa Alicia 2008 Millantu Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc-Carmenère Red (Maipo Valley)
"This is the winery's first Chard with a Sonoma Coast appellation, and it's drier and more acidic and minerally than past bottlings. That's a good thing. It makes the wine a standout partner for food. With subtle lime, green apple, green pea and smoky oak flavors, it's a crisp, versatile wine across a vast range of fare.",88,Valley of the Moon 2007 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"No oak on this wine, just free run juice, offering a pure expression of the vineyard. The flavors are of pineapple, lemons, limes and green apples, accented with crisp acidity. The finish is sugary sweet.",87,Brander 2010 Purisima Mountain Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Pale pink in the glass, this has a rather fragrant nose that combines strawberry and citrus. The palate is ultralight and very fizzy, exuberant and fresh while remaining dry and full-flavored. Yeasty autolysis provides backbone and structure, while the creamy citrus elements make for complete refreshment.",90,Dopff & Irion NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Alsace)
"Not showing much succulence right now, but firm and sturdy, in keeping with the relatively cool vintage. There's green, minty taste alongside the berry, cherry and anise flavors. Could develop and soften with a year or so in the bottle.",85,Eden Canyon 2005 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"One of the producer's top wines, this wine is named both for Francis Ford Coppola's uncle and for the famous mathematician of ancient Greece. It does the men proud in its structured and refined components marked by black pepper, cinnamon and clove, as well as precision of tannin and grip, a powerful wine that's also sleekly smart.",91,Archimedes 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"The grapes for this Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot blend were grown in the Chiles Valley section of Napa. The wine in its youth is extremely tannic and dry, making it unsuitable for drinking anytime soon. But it's exceptionally balanced and has a deep, attractive core of black currant and cedar flavors. There's no reason why it should not age well. Try after 2011.",90,Volker Eisele Family Estate 2005 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Chiles Valley)
"Made with 50% Sangiovese and a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this vibrant red opens with lovely aromas of dark-skinned berry, plum and cake spice. The smooth, vibrant palate doles out black cherries, crushed blackberries, dusty cocoa and aniseed. It's nicely balanced with racy acidity and polished tannins. Drink through 2018.",91,Tua Rita 2013 Rosso di Notri Red (Toscana)
"Showing impeccable elegance, this is totally dry and tart in acidity, with a quietly tannic astringency that suggests pairing with lamb or steak. While it's not an ager, the cola, pomegranate, cherry and mushroom flavors are classic and complex.",92,Williams Selyem 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Ripe berry aromas are heady. In the mouth, this hard-edged Cabernet is gritty and smacking. Ripe plum and blackberry flavors are backed by hefty but pulling tannins, and overall the texture is quite rough.",88,Awning 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Apalta)
"This fruity Pinot is loaded with ripe strawberry preserves, mixed in with tomato leaf and slightly resiny flavors that are typical in Oregon. It's an interesting mix, both ripe and herbal at the same time, but not yet entirely melded together. It will be fun to see where it goes in the next five years.",88,Boedecker Cellars 2005 Stewart Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This wine's nose begins very steely, with fresh cracked chalk aromas, then allows soft caramel candy, pound cake and white flowers to emerge. The very inviting flavors include apple flesh and skins, fresh cut pineapple and slated nuts, all clinging to a very pithy element that cuts the entire palate.",89,Consilience 2013 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County)
"Firm tannins and ripe-to-overripe fruit marks this dry young wine. The blackberry, raisin, dark chocolate and anise flavors are strong. It's a Rhône-style blend, based on Syrah and containing Cabernet Sauvignon.",86,Millésimé 2007 Scoprire Red (Santa Ynez Valley)
"A good, ripe Zinfandel that really needs food to wake it up. By itself, it's a little aloof, with firm tannins and acids hiding black currant, pepper and tobacco flavors. Better with cheeses, barbecue, pizza.",86,Parkers Estate 2005 Dillon Springs Road Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
"A bright golden color and generous, intricate aromas make this dry wine tempting even before sipping. Schramsberg says it has the least residual sugar of any wine they've made in 50 years. It offers light citrus, ginger and honey aromas, then a soft mouthfilling mousse and tangy lemon-lime flavors. Concentrated but steely and nicely bone-dry in texture, the wine will be fantastic with caviar.",94,Schramsberg 2008 Extra Brut Sparkling (California)
"This is Furthermore's fruitiest, most accessible '09 Pinot Noir. If you love fruit, you'll savor the endless flavors of raspberries, cherries and persimmons that are brightened with a squeeze of zesty, lime-like acidity and enriched with the smoky creaminess of oak.",91,Furthermore 2009 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Owned by the Cuveliers who also own Léoville Poyferré in Saint-Julien, Le Crock in 2012 is a powerhouse of ripe tannins and juicy acidity. It's a wine that demands aging with its tannins and still-youthful fruitiness. Drink from 2019.",93,Château Le Crock 2012  Saint-Estèphe
"Powdered sugar and lifted lemon scents mark this blend of traditional Georgian white grapes. The off-dry, charmat method produced wine is a bit more aggressive on the palate than Bagrationi's méthode Champenoise counterparts, but a value alternative to Prosecco.",83,Bagrationi 1882 NV Classic Extra Dry Sparkling (Georgia)
"Bright and fresh, a great mouthful of lemongrass spices, lime and tight, young flavors of grapefruit. The acidity suffuses the wine, lifting it, giving the fruit a vivid character. There is a clean, mineral aftertaste.",88,Casa de Vila Verde 2007 Alvarinho (Vinho Verde)
"This opens with subtle aromas evoking yellow pear, Mediterranean brush and a rather unusual whiff suggesting warm hay. The linear rather lean palate shows mature apricot, citrus and a hint of bitter almond alongside bright acidity and a tangy saline note.",87,Capolino Perlingieri 2015 Vento Greco (Sannio)
"Here's a ripe, slightly jammy Primitivo that should pair with grilled sausage or zucchini stuffed with minced meat. There's a soft, lush quality to this wine that is followed by flavors of blackberry, strawberry, tobacco and spice.",87,Vita Italia 2009 Il Trullo  (Primitivo del Salento)
Here's a beautifully fragrant expression from northern Italy with bright aromas of sweet peach and honeysuckle. Gruppo La-Vis dedicates careful study and focus to Müller Thurgau and this pretty wine shows the impressive results that can be achieved.,87,La Vis 2009 Ritratti Müller-Thurgau (Trentino)
"In 2001, Aliénor and Alexandre de Malet Roquefort bought this property which is 15 minutes southeast of their Château La Gaffelière. From 8.5 acres of Sauvignon Blanc, Sémillon and Muscadelle, this is a rounded, soft wine that promises well. It is going towards the tropical fruit area with its apricot and pineapple flavors. Behind, the acidity is tangy and crisp with a tight, nervy aftertaste.",88,Château Chapelle d'Aliénor 2015  Bordeaux Blanc
"Opens with sharpness along with red-fruit notes and a hint of vinegar. The palate holds onto that acid-driven feel, and there's saucy, herbal berry and cherry flavors. Finishes on the shallow side, with a pinch of bitterness.",84,Alberti 154 2009 Malbec (Mendoza)
"Half of the grapes in this wine were fermented on the skins for almost a month and aged in old barrels, offering something completely different from the producer's standard wine from this varietal. Indeed orange in color, it veers metallic on the palate, before relaxing into a mix of honey and preserved lemon—the texture somewhat unctuous despite a restrained level of alcohol.",90,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2014 Catie's Corner Cuvée Orange Grenache Blanc (Russian River Valley)
"With patience, the appellation's seminal vineyard reveals layer after aromatic layer of of damp wood, hot raspberry syrup laced with cardamom cream, and a bit of anise. Fresh cranberry hits the palate first, then picks up tobacco ash in the mid palate along with recently plucked oregano, thyme and marjoram.",92,Sanford 2011 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
This opulent wine is full of ripe fruit and has a generous texture. Apricot and pear flavors give richness that is cut by acidity that gives the wine tremendous lift. The toast adds the lightest touch at the end. Drink from 2019.,94,Philippe Colin 2014 Les Vergers Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet)
"This is tropical, boisterous rendition of the grape, with heavy tuberose, white lily, peach and apple-blossom aromas. The palate combines honeysuckle, ripe apple flesh and pineapple-guava flavors.",88,Zinke 2013 Viognier (Santa Barbara County)
"Somewhat light in color, this wine offers pleasing notes of flowers, milk chocolate, vanilla extract, herbs and carob. It's light and silky in feel with abundant milk chocolate and cherry flavors that linger.",91,Cloudlift Cellars 2012 Ascent Cabernet Franc (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Savory and structured, it has a supple layering of allspice that dances on the palate, with floral violet tones. Black cherry and earth make up the soul of this wine; it's both classy and hearty.",91,Rochioli 2012 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Chemical resiny aromas stand out more than fruit. This Viura-led blend feels tight, tangy and acidic. Salty flavors of persimmon lack fruitiness. This 12% ABV wine from a cold vintage tastes salty on a finish that's living off acidity.",85,Alberto Orte 2013 La Antigua Clásico White (Rioja)
"Consistent in every way with the previous vintage, this barrel-fermented Sauvignon Blanc includes 9% Sémillon, both of which were sourced from 15-year-old vines. It's aromatic with scents of sweet herb and citrus, and it tastes of Meyer lemon and grapefruit, plus a hint of brioche.",88,Upland Estates 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Snipes Mountain)
"A blend of Klipsun and Ciel du Cheval vineyards aged in 50% new French oak, this wine brings brooding notes of blackberry bramble, blueberry, mineral, herbs and potpourri. The palate-coating blue-fruit flavors are exceptionally dense, rich and sweet and lead to a hyper-extended finish.",94,Gorman 2012 The Pixie Syrah (Red Mountain)
"This is overripe, with a pruny flavor along with notes of blackberry, mocha and spice. The alcohol is high, giving the wine some heat, but the finish is thoroughly dry.",85,Optima 2009 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"The so-called Northern Whites are Gewürztraminer, Müller-Thurgau, Pinot Gris and Riesling. They make a comfortable blend, with floral aromas and plump peach and apple fruit. Though finished dry, it has appealing fruit sweetness.",87,Montinore 2015 Borealis The Northern Whites White (Willamette Valley)
"Fragrant purple flower, aromatic herb, wild berry and Asian spice aromas take center stage. The racy palate offers sour cherry, cranberry and sage accompanied by brisk acidity. Firm, close-grained tannins leave a drying finish.",87,Querce Bettina 2013  Rosso di Montalcino
This wine is rich and gently textured with acidity under the red-berry fruits. Hints of fruit tannins balance the essentially juicy character of the wine. Drink from the end of 2015. Most of the Les Merrains grapes come from the Ferraud family estate in Vaux en Beaujolais.,87,Ferraud et Fils 2014 Les Merrains  (Beaujolais-Villages)
"Co-fermented with 3% Viognier, this has a nice peppery lift. The fruit flavors seem less forward, with the herbal components much more front and center. It's made from a clone specific to the Cougar Hill Vineyard, showing cool climate flavors with subtle grace. Given a full 24 hours of breathing time, it opens further into a dazzling, rich mix of cherry and cassis that's soaked in an herbal broth.",94,K Vintners 2009 The Beautiful Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This wine has an attractive salmon-pink color followed by ripe caramel and spice flavors. The fruit and acidity don't feature as strongly, so the end result is a wine that is fat.",83,Château de Cornemps 2015 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
"Dark ruby to the eye, this wine has a nose of raspberry and birch root. Flavors of blackberry, black cherry, smoked meat, vanilla custard and anise move across the palate, with fruit and smoke notes rising and receding in rhythm. Zesty cherry notes linger on the tongue despite strong but pleasant tannins.",91,Shiloh Winery 2014 Secret Reserve Merlot (Judean Hills)
Pressed apple and dusty mineral notes scent the nose of this subdued slightly savory Riesling. Juicy tangerine and Meyer lemon flavors lend sweetness to the midpalate. The moderately long finish is accented by dustings of pollen and saffron.,86,Leonard Kreusch 2015 Bernkasteler Kurfürstlay Spätlese Riesling (Mosel)
"Steve Clifton makes this wine pop with a wet river-stone minerality on the fresh olallieberry fruit-laden nose. The palate offers spiced plums, a bit of blood and turned-earth flavors.",87,Palmina 2011 Barbera (Santa Barbara County)
"Certainly a bigger, denser wine than the Carneros Pinot. The plummy-berry flavors are wrapped in sturdy, rich tannins, with extra notes of earth and herbs. Feels weighty on the palate, a wine of importance, not to mention elegance. The density suggests meats on the bone.",91,Robert Mondavi 2001 Reserve Pinot Noir (Napa Valley)
"Young, bright and easy, this offers pretty aromas of forest fruit and white cherry. The finish is characterized by a bitter almond note.",85,Scriani 2011  Valpolicella Classico
"This refreshing sparkling wine made mostly from Pinot Noir grapes has a light-gold color and slightly toasted or earthy aromas. It feels lively and frothy in texture, nicely crisp in balance, and medium bodied. Ripe apple and peach flavors emerge with each sip.",88,Schramsberg 2011 Blanc de Noirs Brut Sparkling (North Coast)
"Produced from selected parcels, this wine is solid with rich tannins and dark fruit. It has the flavors of new oak aging well integrated into the ripe texture and juicy acidity. Still firm, with tannins well in place, it needs to age a little longer. Drink from 2018.",91,Monte da Ravasqueira 2013 Reserva Red (Alentejano)
"Toasted hazelnut, charred earth, underbrush, stewed prune and roasted coffee bean aromas all carry over to robust, one-dimensional palate along with mocha and a confectionary note. Solid tannins provide the robust framework.",88,La Colombina 2011  Brunello di Montalcino
"With an extra-deep color and intensely concentrated fruit and spice flavors, this wine is impressive. It has many layers of dark fruit, plus nuances of dark chocolate and baking spices like clove and nutmeg. These enhance the generous, ripe fruit that is the essence of this wine, filling the mouth and lingering on the taste buds long after each sip. It will be best after 2019.",94,Boatique 2014 Malbec (Red Hills Lake County)
"Lean and wiry in style, this pale Pinot Noir stands out as being different from most Marlborough bottlings. Modest strawberry and cranberry flavors are accented by leather and dark chocolate notes.",83,Wairau River 2010 Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
"Ripe blackberry and cola aromas comes across as foresty and nice as a whole. This saturated, dense Malbec shows brutish, choppy tannins along with flavors of blackberry, exotic spices and fig. The finish remains rough and turns hot. Drink through 2021.",89,Belasco de Baquedano 2011 AR Guentota Old Vine Malbec (Luján de Cuyo)
"Aromas of toasted white bread and baked apple are yeasty. This feels good on the palate, with mature flavors of apple that steer clear of being too snappy or citric. On the finish this is like the nose: bready and tasting like baked apple.",89,Muga 2011 Conde de Haro Brut Sparkling (Cava)
"Mild and approachable up front, with apple, banana and tropical fruit aromas. Feels fresh and about average, with sweet, candied flavors of mango and melon. Turns slightly bitter and pithy on the finish.",85,Cousiño-Macul 2010 Chardonnay (Maipo Valley)
"An estate-grown wine from an Oakville-based producer, this is an opaque, concentrated expression of black fig and gunpowder, girded by sturdy tannin and a richness of black cherry and berry. It reveals the power of the appellation well, and a ripeness of the vintage.",92,Turnbull 2013 Black Label Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"Elegant and tightly wound kirsch, crème de cassis, charred beef and toffee aromas show on the nose of this blend of 55% Merlot and 45% Cabernet Sauvignon. Its toffee flavor is laced with chocolate and charcoal on the palate, and its sticky tannins need time to smooth out. Drink 2019–2029.",94,Daou 2014 Micho Red (Adelaida District)
"This is a soft, fresh wine, with attractive red-berry fruits. It has little character, simply fresh fruit and acidity. Drink now.",84,Dona Maria-Júlio Bastos 2014 Dona Maria Rosé (Alentejano)
"French oak-aging has resulted in a wine that's both smooth and fruity. With summer blossom aromas, attractive acidity and a toasty edge, it's stylish, elegant and ready to drink now.",90,Companhia das Quintas 2014 Quinta do Cardo Reserva Branco Siria (Beira Interior)
"This elegant, savory red opens with aromas of wild berry, baking spice and a whiff of toast. The supple palate offers sour cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper and a hint of cinnamon alongside silky tannins. Enjoy through 2016.",88,Bottega Vinai 2013 Pinot Nero (Trentino)
"Sirica is a newly discovered grape variety that is said to have genetic ties to Teroldego, Syrah and Refosco Friulano. How it ended up in Campania is anyone's guess. Besides the beauty and purity of its cherry aroma, this bold red wine has been carefully embellished by spicy oak and chocolate tones. The finish is long, fresh and rich.",92,Feudi di San Gregorio 2008 Sirica Red (Campania)
"This soft, simple Cabernet will go just fine with everyday fare. It's dry, full-bodied and tannic, with proper varietal flavors of blackberries, currants and smoky oak.",84,Maddalena 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"A slightly rubbery note on the nose is really the only quibble with this wine, but a quick decanting should help clear it up. Beyond that, it displays cocoa and coffee notes layered over a core of black cherry fruit. It's medium to full in body, with a slightly creamy texture and a long, softly dusty finish. Drink now–2020.",89,Louis Bernard 2010 Red (Vacqueyras)
"Coming from one of the state's premier Syrah vineyards, this wine brings aromas of iron and huckleberry pie. The blueberry and earth flavors are quite ripe, lingering on the finish.",91,JM Cellars 2013 Boushey Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"Wild bilberries abound on nose and palate and scent the entire drinking experience. The palate is fresh and vivid, as befits the slender red vintage of 2014. This has been handled with great care and turned out into a wine of elegance with poised, pure fruit and gentle structure.",91,Jalits 2014 Blaufränkisch (Eisenberg)
"After a leafy, somewhat burnt opening that seems muddled, things fall into place. The palate has a chewy, tannic, staunch feel that frames earthy berry, mocha, brown sugar and stewed plum flavors. It gets better and better as it unfolds, with prune and kirsch notes on the finish.",90,Telmo Rodríguez 2006 M2 de Matallana  (Ribera del Duero)
"There is a mere hint of fresh grapefruit on the nose but the palate follows with rounded, fresh but spice-edged mirabelle plums and more gentle citrus. There also are glimpses of fragrant citrus foliage with white pepper breaking through. This is ripe but light, rounded but delicate. A wonderfully zesty lemony finish just lasts and lasts.",93,Markus Huber 2015 Berg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Traisental)
"An impressively dark, powerfully structured and deeply flavored wine, this Malbec brims with explosive blackberry, black currant, crushed peppercorn and leather flavors. With its big-time tannins and dry, balanced mouthfeel, it's a great wine for steak.",88,Toogood 2005 Buchert Vineyard Malbec (El Dorado)
"Roasted red berry and tangy woodsy notes on both the nose and on the palate. Finishes with more oak, plus a tart metallic-herbal note that is softened by chalky tannins.",84,Caliterra 2000 Syrah (Central Valley)
"Chunky cherry and earthy tea aromas lead to a supremely tannic and overbearing body, leaving a residue as it transitions to the finish. Flavors along the way include oak, vanilla, syrupy berry, plastic and creamy chocolate.",81,Manos Negras 2011 Pinot Noir (Patagonia)
"Packs more flavor than any other two wines put together. This fruit bomb explodes on the palate with limes, tangerines,  peaches and the sweetest green apples and papayas, and it's all creamy and spicy. It feels dryish until you swallow, when a peacock's tail of sugar fans out on the way down. —S.H.",86,Raymond 2000 Estates Chardonnay (Monterey)
"Fermented in stainless steel, this medium-bodied wine is supple in nutty pear and fig, as well as viscous in honey. Serve chilled with chicken-lemongrass banh mi.",86,Wattle Creek 2012 Viognier (Alexander Valley)
"Crisply herbal in nature, this is a citrus fruit flavored wine. It's full of refreshing acidity, giving it a lively, bright character and an aftertaste that reinforces that laser focus.",86,Bougrier 2016 Alain de la Treille Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de France)
"Rustic in character, this wine shows a bit too much alcohol, manifested by burnt and pepper notes. The acidity works hard to bring balance but ultimately is overpowered by the weight of the wine.",84,Herdade do Rocim 2011 Touriga Nacional (Alentejano)
"Fruity and juicy, this is an immediately attractive cru wine. With its ripe berry fruits and soft tannins, it has a good depth of flavor that gives it richness. The wine, with its crisp fruitiness, is ready to drink.",88,Domaine de la Combe au Loup 2015  Régnié
"Based on Petite Sirah, with small amounts of Syrah and Grenache, this is a huge, fruity, extracted wine. It's explosive in raspberry and cherry jam flavor that's so ripe and pure, yet the finish is dry. The tannins are big and firm, making this wine perfect for a deliciously grilled steak, maybe finished with a Gorgonzola cheese sauce.",90,MCV 2011 1105 Red (Paso Robles)
"A brittle, peppery and ultimately disappointing wine, this 100% varietal lacks the smoothness and cherry-herb complexities you expect from a fine Rutherford Cab. Finishes sharp and dry.",82,Conn Creek 2004 Conn Creek Estate Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"This Vin Santo from Italy's northern Trentino region is made with the little-known Nosiola grape and offers outstanding complexity and intensity of aromas. Almond skin, apricot, dried fruit, caramel, butterscotch and honey come forward layer after layer. This is a distinctive wine with round, opulent nuances and excellent length.",94,Cavit 1997 Arèle Vino Santo Nosiola (Trentino)
Cool rooty grassy aromas are up front. This feels wiry and tannic. Herbal green-leaning plum and currant flavors finish with a distinct flavor of minty green along with rough tannins.,84,Burgo Viejo 2015  Rioja
"Pure black berry juice, ripe and solid, this is a chunky, fresh wine. The wood edge is a major factor; there is a final stalky, mineral element. Drink now.",86,Château du Cèdre 2008 Chatons du Cèdre Malbec (Cahors)
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this offers a beautiful bouquet that's redolent of sweet cherry, candied fruit, Christmas spice and potpourri. The palate shows a soft richness that's balanced and lively without being cloying or heavy.",92,Castello del Terriccio 2006 Lupicaia Red (Toscana)
"Made with 85% Sangiovese, 10% Alicante Bouschet and 5% Merlot, this savory red delivers aromas and flavors of underbrush, black cherry, licorice and a hint of Mediterranean herb. It's easy drinking and balanced with lithe tannins.",88,Erik Banti 2012  Morellino di Scansano
"Bellini's easygoing Chianti opens with dried spice, white pepper and red fruit, following to the palate with fresh acidity and a lean consistency. Pair this wine with a heaping plate of pasta and tomato sauce.",84,Bellini 2010  Chianti
"The thin diluted fruit suggests rhubarb and raspberry. There's an abundance of acid, which will help to pair this with creamy sauces. Drink up.",85,Cerulean 2012 Acadia Vineyards Tempranillo (Columbia Gorge (WA))
"Named for the address of the vineyard on Live Oak Road, this blend of 30% Grenache, 24% Syrah, 20% Mourvèdre, 13% Cinsault, 10% Counoise and 3% Viognier shows powerful licorice, cola, caramel, baked plum and thyme on the nose. The tannins are extremely soft on the sip, where lavish but not overripe purple flowers and black fruit compete for attention.",93,Derby 2013 Fifteen 10 Red Derby Vineyard Red (Paso Robles)
"A wood- aged wine that is ripe and smooth. It has only the barest hint of toastiness, the wood serving more to fill out the rich fruitiness. It does need to age, so drink from 2017.",88,Poças 2014 Reserva Branco White (Douro)
"The potential of Mourvèdre in Bandol is amply shown in this generous, ripe, spicy wine, the fourth vintage from Damien Roux at this estate. It has dark tannins and dense black plum fruits along with a powerful, brooding mineral character that will allow this impressive wine to age. Drink from 2018.",92,Domaine Marie Berenice 2013 Mourvèdre (Bandol)
"A bit unripe, with herb and mint flavors side by side with blackberry and cassis. Shows classic Napa mountain structure of tannins and acids, but the mint reprises on the sharp finish. Not an ager.",85,Reverie 2005 Merlot (Diamond Mountain District)
"This is a fat wine with ripe fruits and a strawberry flavors. The palate is dry, with a soft texture. Drink now.",81,Adega Vila Real 2016 Colheita Rosé (Douro)
"Full of tannins and with the potential of ripe fruit, this wine is young, concentrated and powerful. The alcohol does show as a burn of pepper at the end, spoiling an otherwise well-balanced wine. Produced from a 200-acre vineyard in the Douro Superior, the wine should be ready from 2019.",89,Quinta das Bandeiras 2014 Passagem Red (Douro)
"From Michael Mondavi's portfolio, this affordable Cabernet is concentrated in red berry and savory leather, a nod to the small amounts of Syrah and Petite Sirah that are included in the blend. French oak provides a hint of vanilla and cardamom, while the medium-bodied palate and attractive finish is washed in coffee.",90,Oberon 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa County)
"This is a well-balanced and rich wine, with its tannins and acids giving it a sense of structure. With its black cherry and plum skin flavors, this is firm and smooth.",87,Domaine Dupré 2011 Haute Ronze  (Régnié)
"This grippy Cab exhibits the power of the 10% Petit Verdot in the blend, softened by 6% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc. Cassis and raspberry provide a fruity core around lush, tight tannins and a black pepper-seasoned finish. Full bodied, it remains elegant in the glass.",91,Spring Mountain Vineyard 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This simple white has subdued aromas of white spring flower and white stone fruit. The no-fuss, rather diluted palate offers hints of white peach, green apple and a whisper of white almond.",85,Signano 2015  Vernaccia di San Gimignano
"Light aromas of the barnyard don't impede the impression of pretty strawberry-pastry fruit flavors. The aging in 20% new French oak adds streaks of vanilla, cocoa and mocha to the finish.",88,Vista Hills 2011 Marylhurst Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"In recent years, Villa's Chardonnays have dominated the New Zealand show circuit, but this is a reminder that the company can make some darn good Sauvignon at a darn good price. Tomato leaf and white grapefruit aromas and flavors are the order of the day, easing into a long, mouthwatering finish. Rock solid.",89,Villa Maria 2013 Private Bin Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Made entirely with the Corvina grape, this brawny wine conveys aromas of blackberry, mocha and baking spices. The smooth, dense palate offers up blueberry extract, grilled herbs, chocolate, vanilla and licorice alongside velvety, enveloping tannins. Enjoy through 2018.",93,Zenato 2008 Cresasso Corvina (Veronese)
"This savory Verdicchio offers freshness and fleshy fruit flavors of creamy white peach, lemon and tropical fruit, all accented by mineral notes. The round structure is brightened by crisp acidity that leaves a cleansing finish.",90,Cantina Ma.Ri.Ca. 2009 Riserva Aurato  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico)
"There's a ton of Cabernet flavor here. The California sunshine of this warm appellation ripened the grapes to cassis and black cherry perfection. The oak and tannin structure is polished and fine, but acidity is a little low, so it's not an ager. Drink now through 2009 for its sheer lusciousness.",87,Bucklin 2005 Old Hill Ranch Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley)
"Long skin contact has given this wine both its name and its richness. It is packed with ripe apple and green pear flavors that are filled out even more by the tannic, tangy texture that comes from the grape skins. The wine is still young, a rare Vinho Verde that needs aging. Drink from 2017.",92,Anselmo Mendes 2015 Contacto Alvarinho (Vinho Verde)
"Floral aromas of violet, carnation and rose water open the bouquet of this wine, framing the core of muddled black berries and cherries. The texture is tighter and more restrained than anticipated, with astringent tannins and prominent acidity lending a young, firm impression to the palate. Notes of leather and bramble carry the medium-length finish. Try after 2016.",88,Radford Dale 2012 Frankenstein Pinotage (Stellenbosch)
"Yeasty citrus notes dominate the nose while the palate is savory with chervil, sage and more yeast. A vein of crisp citrus acidity pulls it all together. The aftertaste lingers long with lemon zest.",90,Tegernseerhof 2013 Höhereck Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"This oaky blend of Merlot (60%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (40%) sees 10 months of barrique for extra intense notes of spice, cinnamon, clove and general woodshop. There is black fruit, cola and blackberry pie as well, but the wine needs a few more years of aging to find balance.",88,Fornacelle 2008 Zizzolo  (Bolgheri)
"A rounded perfumed wine with just a hint of sweetness. It is rich, with flavors of honey and peach. Acidity gives the right balance and adds to the structure. Screwcap.",88,Haut Marin 2010 Gros Manseng (Côtes de Gascogne)
"This is a simple, cherry-dominated fruity quaff at a realistic price. It's only light to medium in body, with crisp acids and a bit of tannic astringency on the finish.",83,Redbank 2007 The Long Paddock Shiraz (Victoria)
"Our first taste of the 2011 Chards from the Finger Lakes, Knapp's Barrel Reserve is wonderfully crisp and refreshing with an abundance of fresh pear and lemon flavor. Subtly oaked with just a hint of vanilla and cream that lingers on the palate. Drink now.",88,Knapp 2011 Barrel Reserve Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"“The Affair” refers to the relationship between the French and Italian varieties in the blend. Sadly, this isn't the hottest affair, with the strong game, red currant, strawberry hull, milk chocolate and smoky dried salami notes all downplayed by the lean mouth and waxy finish.",84,La Vierge 2008 Temptation The Affair Red (Walker Bay)
"This leads with mocha, herb and leather aromas. The palate is still tight and closed but offers red berry, clove and sage hints with some air. Clenched tannins grip the close.",87,Francesco Rinaldi 2014  Barbaresco
"Root beer and slate show on the very restrained nose of this wine that combines fruit from Monterey County (66%) and Santa Barbara Counry (34%). The palate is light and slightly metallic, with iron as well as eucalyptus and shreds of cranberry and raspberry fruit.",85,Kendall-Jackson 2013 Grand Reserve Pinot Noir (Central Coast)
"A beautiful wine that needs to age, this Basarin cru selection shows thick layers of berry fruit, cedar wood, almond and dark licorice. The oak element is strong, but the wine is still young and all its many elements will surely come into focus in 10 years or more.",93,Moccagatta 2008 Basarin  (Barbaresco)
"This wine shows a tough unripeness that makes it hard to appreciate. There's a green peppercorn edge to the raspberries and cherries that accentuates the dryness and acids, and makes the tannins feel metallic. Still, it does display Bien Nacido elegance. Hard to see this wine aging, so drink soon.",86,Longoria 2011 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"This Brunello offers bright aromas with lively cherry, cola, humus, dark spice and pipe tobacco, as well as savory tones of beef bresaola and even a touch of white peppercorn. Impressive complexity. Elegant and streamlined on the close.",94,Fornacina 2007  Brunello di Montalcino
"Light in color and texture, this wine at first is muted and shy, getting spicier and earthier as it goes, with a baked strawberry-compote flavor at its core.",88,Calstar Cellars 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"An opening of toasty caramel gives this wine a full-bodied weightiness and inviting richness on the nose and palate, offering a roundness of vanilla and peach along the way. Full and ripe, it finishes in a lift of balanced acidity.",88,Black Stallion 2013 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"This is a pretty, luminous straw-colored sparkler with subtle shadings of honey, stone fruit, white flower and mineral. The wine is crisp and drying in the mouth but it also imparts a slight sensation of sweetness in the form of peach flavors.",86,Zonin NV Olive Garden Brut  (Prosecco del Veneto)
"Very ripe, with earthy aromas of black plum, berry liqueur and bitter chocolate. The mouthfeel is meaty and muscular, but not hard. A wall of moderate tannins builds after a few sips, but the overall feel is still soft. The finish is medium in length, with adequate depth.",88,Le Miccine 1998 Riserva - Don Alberto  (Chianti Classico)
"An easy-drinking wine, it conveys aromas of tropical fruit, Bartlett pear and a hint of saline. The palate offers green apple, banana and almond alongside crisp acidity.",86,Fraccaroli 2013 Pansere  (Lugana)
"This muscular, stout Monastrell sweet wine is all aces. Blackberry, cassis and fine oak aromas precede a sensationally smooth palate that's full of toffee, chocolate, coffee, pepper, blackberry and cassis flavors. A long, warm, impeccably balanced finish is pure and delicious. Drink through 2025.",94,Bodegas Gutiérrez de la Vega 2013 Recóndita Armonía Dulce Monastrell (Spain)
"This wine shows growing intensity the longer it stays in the glass and a very silky, polished feel in the mouth. Aromas include red fruit, spice and rosemary: this is a beautiful, balanced wine that will have a long life in your cellar.",97,Tenuta dell'Ornellaia 2006 Masseto Merlot (Toscana)
"This all-Sangiovese Chianti opens with black-skinned fruit, allspice and new leather aromas. Polished tannins lend structure to the dried black cherry, licorice and a tobacco flavors on the palate. Drink through 2022.",89,Tenuta di Capraia 2012 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"This densely textured, deeply flavored wine showcases the beauty of old vines in Amador terroir. It has an opaque color, opulent clove, blackberry and cassis aromas, and ripe, jammy flavors that drench the palate yet are supported by tannins firm enough to keep it balanced and appetizing. Best after 2020.",92,Renwood 2014 Grandpère Special Reserve Zinfandel (Amador County)
"From Tasmania, this is a fine example of that island's aromatic whites. Crisp acidity imparts a tense, mineral-like quality to the melon and fennel aromas, and while there's enough flesh in the mouth to satisfy, there's also mouthwatering focus and purity. Drink now–2010.",88,Tamar Ridge 2006 Pinot Gris (Tasmania)
"This 50–50 blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon offers impressive balance. It delivers a medley of red fruit, spice, leather, chocolate and tobacco notes. The palate is soft and rich on the finish.",88,Renzo Masi 2008 Red (Rosso di Toscana)
Simple black cherry and earth flavors in a medium-weight wine that finishes with more than a hint of citrus.,84,Piccini 2001  Chianti Superiore
"Lots of rich, savory Pinot flavors in this silky wine. It's kind of generic, and not showing much sense of terroir, but it is a properly grown coastal wine whose brisk acidity highlights cola, pomegranate and persimmon flavors. Drink up.",88,MacMurray Ranch 2011 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"El Coto has gotten its game in gear in recent years. The brand's value-priced wines like this Viura are clean and proper. In this case, opening aromas of stone and lime yield to green fruits and cucumber. The wine is easy and fresh, with a juicy, simple mouthfeel.",86,El Coto 2007 Viura (Rioja)
"The wine, that has been a major player in the success of Provence rosé, epitomizes the style. Fresh with red currants and red berries, it is lively and intensely fruity with just a hint of herbs at the end. This is an immediately drinkable wine, just ready for the summer.",88,Château d'Esclans 2016 Whispering Angel Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"White flower, orchard fruit and banana aromas lead the nose while the vibrant palate doles out white peach, Bartlett pear, citrus and saline flavors. Tangy acidity provides loads of freshness.",88,Tenuta Rapitalà 2016 Grillo (Sicilia)
"Firm and savory, this opens with aromas of ripe berry, clove and graphite. On the palate, notes of clove and black pepper add depth to ripe Morello cherry and crushed raspberry flavors.  Supple tannins offer support.",89,Cantele 2011 Riserva Negroamaro (Salice Salentino)
"Tender, friendly hints of juicy pear beckon. The palate follows with more oomph and lots of lemon freshness. There is a lovely textural element to the crisp midpalate and edges of peppery herbs everywhere that haunt you long after the lip-smacking finish.",90,Sohm & Kracher 2015 Lion Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"Fresh and vibrant, this Cinsault bottling is completely oak-free, which means that the juicy, fruit-forward nature of the varietal is front and center. Ultraripe blueberry and raspberry notes mingle with specks of black pepper on the soft and mildly grippy palate. The is light bodied and easily quaffable.",86,McPherson 2014 Cinsault (Texas)
Both the aromas and the flavors show considerable wood-aging notes that need time to integrate. The wine will begin to show its fruity black-currant and red plum flavors in a year. It has the richness and ripeness for aging over several years.,87,Château de Macard 2010  Bordeaux Supérieur
"Concentrated raspberry and cassis flavors, almost liqueurish in their intensity, open this pure and delicious wine. It combines the sweet appeal of the best California Pinots with the structure and steely underpinnings of Oregon fruit. Youthful and firm, its best years are surely ahead.",90,De Ponte Cellars 2006 Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Made from Rosenmuskateller (a pink-tinted grape), this wonderfully perfumed wine is such a curiosity that it can only legally be table wine, a super Austrian. There are flavors of rosehip, ginger and a wondrous freshness.",92,Kracher NV Zwischen den Seen Nummer 3 Kollektion L08A Rosenmuskateller (Austria)
"Aromas of ripe berry, underbrush and exotic spice waft from the glass. The structured palate offers juicy black cherry, vanilla, espresso and aniseed alongside hearty but fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2021.",91,Tenute del Cerro 2011 Antica Chiusina  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano)
"While this could be considered the equivalent of a second wine for the Château Pech de Jammes estate, it is in a modern, fruity style, which sets it apart from the Château wine. Bold, ripe and generous fruits give blackberry flavors alongside a lively, perfumed character. The wine is ready to drink.",87,Georges Vigouroux 2015 Petit Jammes Malbec (Cahors)
"This wine is a study of how to make Pinot Noir both extremely light and yet powerfully flavorful. Underripe black raspberry meets with white pepper and dill on the nose. The bright and lively palate dances across the tongue with thyme, rosemary and pine flavors against tart red fruit. It's easy to guzzle.",95,Big Basin 2014 Coast Grade Vineyard Pinot Noir (Ben Lomond Mountain)
"Rubbery, sulfuric aromas of scrambled eggs are gaseous and difficult to penetrate. This blend of 60% Giró and 40% Monastrell feels choppy, grabby and high in acidity. Flavors of rubbery plum and berry are tart and eggy, while the tannins are fierce on the finish.",85,Bodegas Gutiérrez de la Vega 2012 Ulises Red (Spain)
"There's a substantial earthiness to this Chardonnay, grown in a relatively cool estate vineyard. Vibrant on the palate in ripe apple and lemon, it offers medium weight and body, with a crispness to the finish and a food-friendly nature.",88,Grgich Hills 2012 Miljenko's Selection Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Made from fruit grown at a high elevation and in volcanic soil, this is a leathery, full-bodied tannic Syrah. A taste of roasted coffee marks the finish.",85,Gregory Graham 2008 Crimson Hill Vineyard Estate Syrah (Red Hills Lake County)
"Josef Mantler's estate produces Rieslings from some of the best local vineyards in eastern Kremstal. This is a rich, soft wine, with exotic flavors of lychees and apricots. The aftertaste is just off-dry, but still has a good steely backbone.",89,Mantlerhof 2001 Wieland Riesling (Kremstal)
"Lifted heady notes of Damask rose rise from the glass alongside lemony tang. The palate brims with the same rose petal notes but also holds plenty of spice: sandalwood and ginger, white pepper and the merest touch of vanilla. The palate is concentrated and rounded with gentle sweetness, countered by fresh lemon acidity. The persistence of flavors on the palate is incredible. Serve this either with fruity spicy Asian fare or runny, soft and very ripe cheeses.",94,Domaine Schoffit 2011 Clos Saint-Théobald Grand Cru Rangen Vendanges Tardives Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Voluptuous and expansive in texture, this wine offers a wealth of honey-apple and margarita-lime flavor accented by a streak of stone. The richness is balanced by juicy acidity that lifts the experience all along to the finish.",92,Covenant 2014 Lavan Chardonnay (Sonoma Mountain)
Ceretto's pristine Dolcetto d'Alba offers an interesting medley of fruit and almond aromas. Marzipan and almond paste also appear in the mouth and the wine ends with silky softness. Pair it with oven-cooked pasta.,87,Ceretto 2007 Rossana  (Dolcetto d'Alba)
"Guava-glazed beef ribs, smoky teriyaki, black peppercorns and black cherry fruit swirl into a luxurious nose on this lush wine by Michael Mooney. Very silky in texture, the palate shows pencil lead, concentrated elderberry, black pepper and light, varietally correct flashes of bell pepper, dried oregano and thyme.",93,Chateau Margene 2012 Cask 7 Cabernet Franc (Paso Robles)
"A whiff of smoked nuts lends savory complexity to bright tangerine, pineapple and white floral aromas in this gorgeously steel-toned wine. Dry and minera, yet silken in texture, it hits the palate with staccato notes of crunchy stone fruit, lemon and lime. It's bracing and brisk now but should meld beautifully over the next decade.",93,Fritz Haag 2015 Brauneberger Juffer Trocken GG Riesling (Mosel)
"This mix of Petit Verdot and four other red grapes is dark, slightly raisiny and jammy on the nose. In the mouth, it is ripe and ripped, with depth and density along with soft tannins. Flavors of prune, baked berry, licorice and peppery spice finish with overt herb, tobacco and chocolaty flavors. Drink this powerful, weighty blend through 2018.",91,Santa Carolina 2010 VSC Red (Cachapoal Valley)
"Very rich, this perfumed wine has considerable weight. It is powerful, perhaps too powerful, and its dense fruits and structure don't fit the norm of Provence rosés.",86,Château Roubine 2013 Inspire Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This medium-bodied wine has personality. It smells like pencil shavings, black tea and plums, and tastes like prunes and pomegranate juice, finishing with that same spicy, tea-like character. The texture is smooth and the balance is good.",86,Ripken 2013 Under the Sea Malbec (Lodi)
This is a blend of the unusual Egiodola (a disease-resistant cross of native vines) and Syrah. This rosé version of two naturally tannic grapes turns out to be fruity and juicy. It is lively with crisp acidity and a lightly turned texture. The wine is ready to drink.,85,Domaine de Millet 2016 Rosé (Côtes de Gascogne)
"A fruity Port, with plum and spice character, very jammy and sweet. Touches of tannin and acidity give balance to make the wine ripe, soft and full in the mouth.",86,Quinta do Passadouro NV Ruby Reserva  (Port)
"Dark tannins are sustained by juicy blackberry fruit flavors. While the wine is very dry and firm at this stage, it has a good, if long-term, future.",88,Château Côte Montpezat 2010 Cuvée Compostelle  (Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux)
"Pascal Sirat named this wine for his father and his son. Bright and fruity, it is already deliciously light, refreshing and bright. Acidity jumps out of the glass, giving a crisp, fresh character. The aftertaste is more taut and tense. Drink now.",86,Château Panchille 2016 Blanc de Fernand  (Bordeaux Blanc)
"Soft, velvety, with sweet chocolate flavors from new wood and tannins that are gently wrapped in red berry fruits. It is developing quickly, the wood opening up. It will be very enjoyable in 2–3 years.",89,Château Siran 2006  Margaux
"New wood dominates this soft wine. The fruit is round and smoky, featuring notes of black cherries and red plums that fall behind a toasty caramel sweetness. It needs several months for the wood influence to integrate.",86,Château Bois Noir 2009  Bordeaux Supérieur
"A full, loamy bouquet with minerally blackberry and cassis aromas is modern in style despite this coming from old Maule vines. A generous palate deals woody, toasty flavors of baked black plum and blackberry, while peppery spice and a hint of clove are prominent on an oak-driven finish. Drink through 2021.",90,Altamana 2014 Grande Reserve Malbec (Maule Valley)
"This is thin and acidic, with flavors of sour cherry candy and spice.",82,Hahn 2011 Nicky Hahn G-S-M (Central Coast)
"This fragrant Gewürztraminer from one of the best producers in northern Italy offers aromas of jasmine and honeysuckle, with background tones of apricot and candied exotic fruit. It's creamy and rich on the finish.",90,Colterenzio 2010 Atisis Cornell Gewürztraminer (Alto Adige)
"Scurati is a balanced and firm wine with a bright, almost crunchy quality to the fruit and easy notes of leather and spice on the close. Pair it with barbecued grilled sausages or hamburgers.",87,Ceuso 2008 Scurati Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"Fragrant and structured, this offers enticing scents of rose, violet, menthol, underbrush and a whiff of leather. The juicy palate offers layers of crushed raspberry, fleshy black cherry, cinnamon, clove, tobacco and a hint of anise alongside velvety tannins. It's already accessible. Drink through 2022.",91,Fontanafredda 2012 Serralunga d'Alba  (Barolo)
"Pungent, yeasty, almost sweaty notes of onion and garlic blend with oak-infused cider and citrus aromas. This is round, fresh and not too heavy on the palate, while its oaky, smoky barrel and baked-apple flavors end with overt woodiness and mounting bitterness.",87,Terrazas de Los Andes 2014 Reserva Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"Heavily oaked and loaded down with butter and resin, this is a wine for those infatuated with the obscure. The blend is 90% Callet and 10% Fogoneu, and don't ask us to give you the history of these Mallorcan grapes. Suffice it to say that this wine is broad, a bit stewy and very different. It's not heavy like an anchor but it has its chunky shoulder pads to deal with. Only 25 cases made.",88,Ànima Negra 2004 Son Negre Red (Vi de la Terra Illes Balears)
"Organically grown grapes go into this very fine wine. Its structure and balance confirm that it's still young, bursting with juicy ripe berry fruit and with firm background tannins. Its great fruitiness is contrasted with the strength of those tannins and with its concentration. Drink from 2020.",94,Château du Cèdre 2014 Le Cèdre Malbec (Cahors)
"The aromas are super spicy, with cinnamon-glazed sour cherries proving most dominant. On the palate, black cherry and beet juice pair up with black tea, before culminating in a remarkably long and tantalizing spice-driving finish.",92,Walt 2012 Clos Pepe Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Baked apple and pressed white flower aromas take center stage on this structured white. The apple sensation follows through to the palate, along with nectarine, Mediterranean herb and a hint of nut. Bright acidity adds freshness.",88,Il Colombaio di Santa Chiara 2012 Campo della Pieve  (Vernaccia di San Gimignano)
"Fun and refreshing, this lightly sparkling dessert wine offers aromas and flavors of ripe yellow peach, candied tangerine zest and a hint of aromatic herb. Modest acidity stops it from being cloying.",86,Villa San Giovanni 2015  Moscato d'Asti
"Feels harsh and tart in the mouth, with sharp acidity that gives the oaky-cherry flavors the taste of Chinese sweet-and-sour sauce.",82,DeLorimier 2005 Crazy Creek Vineyard Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Light and ephemeral, Winery Block comes from one vineyard planted to three clones (Swan, Dijon 114 and Mt. Eden). The Swan predominates, prompting pretty floral aromas of rose and violet before a bright line of cherry-rhubarb kicks in and earthiness rounds out the middle and end.",88,Balletto 2012 Winery Block Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Smoky and meaty, with decadent bacon notes, this wine is hugely built and concentrated, its black fruit deeply etched with cigar box and clove accents.",86,The Calling 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"This Amador Zin has Lodi producer Michael David's signature bacon and oak, its 17 months in American oak having no place to hide. The wine's blackberry fruit tastes full, its tannins chewy. High-alcohol California mountain Zin at its most intense concentration.",85,Michael David 2009 Gluttony Old Vine Zinfandel Zinfandel (Amador County)
"A little unbalanced, with some overripe, pruny flavors and heat from high alcohol. The lack of fruity richness accentuates the tannins. Drink up.",84,Provenance Vineyards 2005 Beckstoffer Las Amigas Vineyard Merlot (Carneros)
"Perfumed with notes of white flowers, melon and peach, this off-dry wine is delicate on the palate with sweet stone-fruit flavors offset by brisk lemon acidity. It's straightforward in style but bright and fresh with a hint of honey that lingers.",86,Martha Clara 2012 Estate Reserve Riesling (North Fork of Long Island)
"Made from vines planted several decades ago, this wine shows its worldly sophistication with pungent, smoky earth and gravelly texture. The overall impression is sensual and seductive, enriched by bright blackberry and raspberry flavors and appreciable acidity.",95,Limerick Lane 2015 Headpruned Block Syrah (Russian River Valley)
"This is a fine Pinot for drinking now. It's dry and brisk with coastal acidity, firm tannins and elaborate raspberry, cherry and persimmon flavors, touched by sweet, smoky oak.",89,Failla 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Aromas of ripe red berry, scorched earth, leather, spice and balsamic notes lead the nose on this robust wine. The youthful palate is still closed but reveals mature black cherry, clove, black pepper and a hint of espresso alongside brooding tannins.",88,Cascina Morassino 2011  Barbaresco
"Sweet and soft, like melted jam, this Barbera has plush blackberry, cherry and raspberry flavors. Given its tannins and acids, it will probably age for a long time.",84,VJB 2006 Barbera (Mendocino County)
"Juicy, sweet fruited wine, with a ripe, jammy character allied to fresh acidity and soft tannins. With enticing raspberry flavors, the wine is for easy and early drinking.",86,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2007 Espirito Tinto Red (Tejo)
"The warm Fourchaume vineyard has produced a ripe, full wine that could almost come from further south in Burgundy. Just a touch of minerality keeps anchors it in Chablis. A refreshing white fruit flavor follows through into the finish. Drink from 2018.",92,Simonnet-Febvre 2015 Fourchaume Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"Underbrush, ripe berry, menthol, Asian spice and a whiff of aromatic herb come together in the glass. The straightforward palate offers dried wild cherry, cranberry, chopped mint and anise alongside polished tannins.",88,Tenuta Monte Gorna 2012 Rosso  (Etna)
"What a wonderful Cabernet this is for the price. It's producer, Delicato, is one of the few wineries with wide enough access to fruit to be able to produce something this good and affordable. It's softly gentle in black cherries, cola, mocha and dusty tannins, finishing with a long, sweet spiciness.",88,HandCraft 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"This wine has aromas of black plum and black raspberry, with flavors of tart cherry and ripe plum on the palate. The tannins have a bit of grip and the finish is persistent.",87,Domaine Boyar 2015 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Thracian Valley)
"While this wine has wood aromas, the palate also shows plenty of fruit. That combination gives it weight, spice and red-currant flavors along with juiciness. The wine has plenty of development ahead. Drink from 2019.",89,Château Mouton Rothschild 2013 Le Petit Mouton  (Pauillac)
"This opens with a blast of bell pepper and leafy berry aromas. The palate is juicy but scratchy, while flavors of plum, raspberry and herbs finish tart, with no evolution.",83,Santa Ema 2011 Select Terroir Merlot (Cachapoal Valley)
"Aromas of lemon, white flower and white stone fruit lead the nose while the bright, juicy bright palate offers pear, peach and nectarine zest. A note of white almond caps off the finish.",87,Corte Mainente 2015 Cengelle  (Soave)
Fleshy red cherry notes dominate this wine's nose and palate. An edge of smoke adds aroamtic complexity to the fluid and fresh flavors. It's juicy and generous with a welcome counterpoint of supple tannins that lend structure to all the cherry fruit.,91,Rosenhof 2015 Reserve St. Laurent (Burgenland)
"Along with ripe fruit and structure, this wine has a core of tannins that form the base for fresh fruitiness. The acidity becomes intense as it opens, with the tannins remaining at the core. Drink from 2019.",88,Château Fourcas-Borie 2013  Listrac-Médoc
"A blend of two grapes native to Georgia, this wine offers aromas of blueberry, clove and anisette. Its subtle sweetness provides a palate for flavors of blackberry, licorice, blueberry, cinnamon and nutmeg. Tannins seem soft from first sip to finish, yet a sense of chalkiness remains on the post palate, even outlasting closing notes of mint and tart cherry.",88,Wine Man 2013 Khvanchkara Semi-Sweet Red (Kakheti)
"This wine is a bombast of sweet liqueur and vanilla-infused candy, dusty with a sour finish.",81,Montoliva 2010 Aglianico (Sierra Foothills)
"A full-bodied, complex and supple-textured wine, this offers plump, ripe black-cherry aromas shaded by hints of forest floor and sautéed mushrooms, along with mild plum and cherry flavors. While soft and soothing on the palate, a fine layer of tannins wraps it up and keeps it appetizing.",92,MacPhail 2013 Toulouse Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
Plump lusciously ripe black plum and cherry flavors are offset by a tantalizing edge of acidity and fine penetrating tannins in this neatly composed Malbec. It's supple and full in body yet refreshing and brisk. Drinks well already but should continue to improve through 2021.,90,Harbes Family Vineyard 2014 Malbec (North Fork of Long Island)
"Here's a brilliant Inzolia that is enhanced by sophisticated aromas of peach cobbler, creamy vanilla and yellow rose. The wine is fragrant and layered with a rich composition and a supple texture in the mouth.",87,Cantine Barbera 2008 Inzolia (Sicilia)
"Aromatically complex with hints of dusty compost, peat moss and coffee grounds, this moves gracefully into a lively palate. Orange and lemon peel, black tea and juicy acids highlight a red berry core. This is a totally gulpable and thoroughly delicious young Pinot.",90,Acrobat 2015 Pinot Noir (Oregon)
"Fresh and fruity, this is a bright wine, full of almost shocking acidity and red-currant fruits. Its tannins are there, although more of an afterthought to the fruit. Drink this light fresh wine from 2017.",87,Château Jean Faux 2014  Bordeaux Supérieur
"This is a perfumed ripe wine, packed with generous tannins that still give a style and elegance that is a remove from the older overripe style of Pavie. It is balanced, complex and with great potential. The wood and the tannins are in harmony with the black fruits. With its structure, it will certainly age well. Drink from 2027.",95,Château Pavie 2014  Saint-Émilion
"From husband-and-wife team in California redwood country, comes this interesting Syrah, sourced from dry-farmed estate vines. Smelling of cedar pine and red fruit, it's very savory, full of pepper and leather, dark coffee and espresso. Lay it down another year or so to tame its wild soul.",86,Cabot Vineyards 2007 Syrah (Humboldt County)
"Perhaps less intense than some wines from this appellation, this is still a sweet, honeyed wine that is shot through with lemon acidity. It is poised and very stylish with yellow fruits and orange marmalade that are caught in a web of botrytis. Drink this wine from 2020.",91,Vignobles Laffourcade 2014 Château de l'Echarderie  (Quarts de Chaume)
"This straightforward wine shows lime flower, chalk, and confectioner's sugar on the nose. The flavors of lime zest and white grapefruit carry to the finish. This wine is fresh and simple with a spine of good acidity.",85,De Wetshof 2002 Rhine Riesling Riesling (Robertson)
"This delightfully pure expression of the Syrah grape seduces from the first sniff, which sails along on a flying carpet of blue and purple fruits, licorice, clove and tobacco. The beguiling aromas continue in the mouth, where the wine assumes a seamless, plump and powerful presence. Ciel du Cheval Syrah is every bit as good as the Bordeaux grapes for which the vineyard is most famous.",94,Januik 2011 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Syrah (Red Mountain)
"This is a Cabernet prototype from an up-and-coming vineyard. The brooding aromas of anise, cassis and barrel spice seem quite locked up at present. The black cherry and fine grained, highly structured tannins show an exquisite sense of balance that persists through the finish.",91,Two Vintners 2013 Sal May's Discovery Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Still stark and taut, this dry, delicately framed Riesling has beauty within its subtleties. Hints of lemon, lime, honey and blossom flutter on the palate against a backdrop of steely minerals and piercing acidity. It's subdued in its elegance, but should become more profound by holding until 2020–2022 for maturation.",90,Fritz Haag 2013 Juffer Trocken GG Riesling (Mosel)
"White flowers and almonds give fragrance to this Chardonnay-dominant Champagne. It is a concentrated wine, full of ripe white fruits, with a tight core of acidity. Named after the producer's owner, it is a flagship wine, intense and just ready to drink.",94,Thiénot 2007 Cuvée Alain Thiénot  (Champagne)
"Surprisingly unripe for an Amador County Zinfandel. Smells like dried twigs, turns obscure and heavy in the mouth, with sweet cherry pie and prune flavors, framed in hard, green tannins.",82,Ministry of the Vinterior 2009 The Messenger Old Vine Zinfandel (Amador County)
"Solid from front to back. The nose is your normal mix of cassis, blackberry, latex glove and licorice nibs, while the palate runs hard and condensed, with ripe black fruit flavors. A little clacky and tough on the tongue and cheeks, but true as you can ask for from a Colchagua Cabernet.",89,La Playa 2007 Axel Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"The aromas of cinnamon, kelp, and dried fruit are unusual and don't seem in harmony. The gamy flavors bring some appeal but don't entirely come together.",83,Barnard Griffin 2013 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Dark berry aromas are calm and oaky. This blend of 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon feels full and blocky, although bold acidity helps. Minty, oaky flavors of plum, cassis and tomato are salty and spicy, while this runs long on a finish that boasts a ripe-fruit base.",89,Inurrieta 2011 Cuatrocientos Crianza Red (Navarra)
"This fragrant blend of Nero d'Avola and Frappato boasts alluring blue flower, black-skinned berry and leather aromas. The balanced, savory palate doles out ripe black cherry, clove and licorice flavors, with round, polished tannins that give it a smooth texture. Enjoy through 2021.",91,Paolo Calì 2011 Forfice  (Cerasuolo di Vittoria Classico)
"Though the nose is a bit muted, assertive juicy black plum and muddled mulberry unfold in the round mouth. Firm tannins follow through to the dry, waxy finish. Try in another year or two, or give it a good long decant before drinking now.",86,Remhoogte 2008 Aigle Noir Red (Simonsberg-Stellenbosch)
"This well-aged Brunello shows a brownish hue in its ruby coloring and exhibits aromas of dried currants, licorice, cola, balsam and ground white pepper. This expression has more heft and determination in the mouth (compared to other Brunellos from the 2005 vintage) and lasts long on the palate.",89,SassodiSole 2005  Brunello di Montalcino
"Extreme elegance and balance characterize Gianfranco Bovio's Barolo Rocchettevino. The wine is studied and sophisticated with a clean presentation of fruit, spice and ethereal balsam or herbal aromas. It's a toned and carefully structured wine that will last many long years in the cellar.",92,Gianfranco Bovio 2006 Rocchettevino  (Barolo)
"Smooth and light, it's all about fruitiness, crisp apples and a squeeze of lemon juice that perks up the soft texture. It's fresh and ready to drink.",86,DFJ Vinhos 2013 Coreto Branco White (Lisboa)
"Peach and other stone-fruit aromas show a note of chlorinated pool water. This is fairly full in body and creamy in feel. Flavors of melon, honey and creamy oak lean toward sweet, while the finish offers tropical fruit flavors and some excess weight. Drink immediately.",87,Loma Larga 2012 Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)
"Grenache makes up 70% of this wine with the rest equal parts Mourvèdre and Syrah. The aromas of raspberry and spice are brooding while the raspberry, cranberry and floral flavors are tart and lithe, with a finish that lingers.",88,Almquist 2013 Kira's Cuvee Red (Washington)
"For a Dolcetto, the Pio Cesare is a strong, fairly extracted wine. The fruit is here, but the wine is marked more by its power than its friendliness.",84,Pio Cesare 2005  Dolcetto d'Alba
"This wine, made by Native American descendent Tara Gomez from the Chumash tribe, is dynamic on the nose. It shows both ripeness and minerality, with aromas of crystallized white peach, dewy herbs, green apples and a hint of guava. It's tight, steely and chalky once sipped, opening toward ripe pome fruit and cut grass, ever-evolving in the glass without going overripe.",92,Kitá 2013 Camp 4 Vineyard Grenache Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Dusty, earthy berry aromas are solid and pure. This is a juicy, lively organic wine with good weight and balance. Spicy, peppery flavors of oak and berry fruits finish with mild heat and dry spice notes.",87,Osoti 2012 Organic Joven  (Rioja)
"Named after the quail that inhabit the vineyard, this intensely fruity wine is ripe and full-bodied. Flavors of truffles, spice as well as black plums and berries abound. This is a serious wine for aging; keep for at least seven years, although with its great fruit it could be deliciously drinkable sooner.",93,Jean-Luc Baldès 2010 Clos Triguedina Petites Cailles Malbec (Cahors)
"When a Bordeaux wine gets into a heavy bottle, it has something to prove. As here, when the wine has way too much wood and lacks fruit. It could balance out, but that is a long shot.",84,Château la Croizille 2009  Saint-Estèphe
"Showing the ripe 2015 vintage, this is a soft rounded wine. It has attractive acidity to lift the ripe yellow fruit and add a shot of citrus. The wine needs another few months to settle in, so wait until summer 2017.",87,Etienne Boileau 2015  Chablis
"This fruity wine, free from any oak aging, revels in its attractive tropical flavors. It's as ripe and rich as the vintage suggests, with light, balanced acidity. The aftertaste is soft, keeping up the fruitiness. Drink now.",85,Labouré-Roi 2015  Mâcon-Villages
"Leathery and horsey on the nose, with cherry fruit and warmth. The palate has some edge and bite to it, with lean tannins in support of generic raspberry and standard herbal flavors. Quick and cleansing on the finish, with another wave of herbal flavor.",84,Undurraga 2008 Aliwen Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Rapel Valley)
"Light, subtle pink color echoes this wine's subdued nature on the palate, which reveals whispers of orange peel, strawberry and rose as it opens.",90,C R Graybehl 2016 Grenache Rosé (Sonoma Valley)
"Classic Gewürztraminer aromas of fresh lychee, pink grapefruit and roses abound on Dr. Frank's lovely bargain Salmon Run. Although full bodied with a plush, broad profile, it's spritzed with a gentle lemon acidity and bitter lime pith and rose potpourri finish. Would pair beautifully with spicy, herbacious Thai dishes, but might be hard to resist savoring on its own.",87,Dr. Konstantin Frank 2008 Salmon Run Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes)
A smooth and rich wine that has a good mix between wood aging and ripe plum flavors. Tannins present a judicious support for the full fruits. Drink from the end of 2014.,88,Fiuza 2012 Red (Tejo)
"This might be one of the best values on the market, given the quality. Equal parts pretty and funky, it's a tightly wound, savory, fruity wine that's elegant and compelling. The tannins and oak are lightly imprinted around strawberry-rhubarb and fresh-cut rose, and the texture seductively silky. This is a delicious treat of a wine that should also age.",95,Gary Farrell 2013 Russian River Selection Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Sweet and simple, like a blend of lemonade, limeade and grapefruit juice, with a squeeze of peaches. Good, if you like your white wines this ripe.",84,Wellington 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Valley)
"This Gaillac-like blend of Braucol, Duras and Syrah gives rich fruitiness and soft tannins. The wine is juicy, full of red berry and spice and an attractive light touch. It's ready to drink.",85,Domaine D'en Ségur 2010 Le Rouge Red (Côtes du Tarn)
"There's an exotic touch of Indian spice and teriyaki sauce upfront that later segues to bright cherry fruit, leather and tobacco. The fruit feels ripe and soft, and the mouthfeel is firmly structured, polished and tight. Drink after 2015.",92,Innocenti 2007 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Pale in color, this oak-aged wine is soft, with juicy red fruit. It offers cinnamon and nutmeg flavors, as well as a smoky character from the wood. It finishes with intense, juicy acidity. Drink from 2018.",89,Domaine Dugois 2016 La Sombarde Poulsard (Arbois)
"Very true to the variety, with ample servings of cedar, tobacco and cassis, plenty of weight and a firm structure that bodes well for aging. Best from 2010-2020.",91,D'Arenberg 2006 The Coppermine Road Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)
"This wine opens with aromas of vanilla and baking spices that are followed by broad, silky-feeling fruit and barrel flavors, finishing on a somewhat bitter note. The oak holds a prominent role but still plays its part well.",87,Claar 2011 Estate Grown and Bottled Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A good Merlot that shows fine Napa tannins, yet there are some divots. Despite ripe cherries, cola and oak, there's a certain one-dimensionality. Ready now.",85,Freemark Abbey 2006 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"An interesting and even somewhat eccentric wine. There are notes of green tea and herbs, but enough pure orange fruit to make it rich. Lots of zingy acidity, too.",88,Fontes & Phillips 2009 Sierra Madre Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"Known for its seemingly unlimited stocks of aged tawnies and white Ports released in small quantities, this firm's 20-year-old white is a beautifully smooth wine. It shows its maturity in old wood character and deep gold fruit flavors. Maintaining its juicy acidity, it's a superb sipping wine. Drink now.",94,Kopke NV 20 Years Old White  (Port)
"The cool Côte de Lechet, facing north, produces a classically steely Chablis. This is still young, very tight and nervy, its acidity prominent even though the texture is ripe. Aging will bring balance between the crisp character and the richer green and white fruits. Drink from 2018.",91,La Chablisienne 2012 Côte de Lechet Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"A massively constructed Chardonnay that's opulent and concentrated and bursts in the mouth with pineapple, lemon drop candy, Asian pear and white peach flavors of enormous ripeness. The entire production of 108 cases was aged in new oak, so there's a lavish veneer of sweet, smoky buttered toast. Sur lie aging is evident in the creaminess and ever so slight sourdough tartness that adds a piquant touch. This impressive Chard is at its best now in its flashy, flamboyant youth.",95,Freestone 2007 Pastorale Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"While the nose has a persistent apple cider quality, the palate brings a bit more nuance, with unripe peach and sweet-and-sour lemon flavors.",83,Good Harbor 2011 Riesling (Leelanau Peninsula)
"Dusty strawberry and cherry aromas are hollow but easy. The palate is plump but short on edge and framing. Flavors of strawberry and raspberry roll awkwardly into a low-acid, soft finish.",84,Jardín de Lúculo 2013 Los Bohemios Garnacha Rosé (Navarra)
"This is a prototypical Washington Cabernet, with aromas of cherry meats, black currant, coffee and whiffs of herb. Though far from over the top, the flavors show intensity and texture with a pleasing acidic lift. It offers a lot of subtlety and elegance for a wine at this price.",89,City Limits 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This seemingly forward Hermitage boasts bold notes of lime, pineapple and melon, wrapped in a soft blanket of toastiness and restrained oak. It's round in the mouth and ample in body, with a long finish faintly suggestive of coffee. Drink now.",92,Fayolle Fils & Fille 2009 Les Dionnières White (Hermitage)
"Fruity, lightly yeasty and with a caramel touch, this wine is rich and smooth. It has a generous red-fruit character as well as the right balanced acidity. The wine will be better from late 2017.",89,Château Trocard 2016 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
"Summers has been quietly perfecting Cabernet under the radar. The '04 continues a string of successful vintages. It's riper and more accessible than previous years, and rewards for expressive black currant flavors enhanced with lots of fine, smoky new oak. The tannins are so gentle, you can drink this wine now, but it should hold for a good six years.",91,Summers 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Made by David Ramey, this blend of 80% Zinfandel, 11% Alicante and 9% Petite Sirah impresses in its fruit-forward approachability and all-around likability. Earthy, it teases in dark cherry, vanilla and milk-chocolate flavors, the texture smoothly etched in fine leather.",90,Sidebar 2015 Red Field Red (Russian River Valley)
"A slightly earthy aroma leads to lean citrus aromas, attractive kiwi and apple flavors and a somewhat tangy texture. Overall it is light-bodied and modest in flavor.",84,McFadden 2014 Blue Quail Sauvignon Blanc (Potter Valley)
"Firm and structured, this is a dark still-young wine. With a strong tannic core, it is concentrated, the black fruits are firmly in the throes of the tannins. Give this impressively serious second wine of Haut-Brion time. Drink from 2022.",92,Château Haut-Brion 2014 Le Clarence de Haut-Brion  (Pessac-Léognan)
"With an electric pink color and candied aromas of watermelon and cherry, this is a spunky rosé that's juicy, lively and pleasant. Flavors of raspberry and plum come and go quickly, and the finish is just acidic and crisp enough.",86,Príncipe de Viana 2012 Rosado Garnacha (Navarra)
"This wine all comes from Oasis Vineyard. The aromas are light, with notes of citrus peel, herb and guava, showing some reduction. The palate is sleekly styled with nervy acids that keep the interest up.",88,Sparkman 2016 Pearl Sauvignon Blanc (Yakima Valley)
"With the few years of bottle age, the wine is showing ripe fruits, the tannins well integrated. The combination of juicy acidity and ripe fruit, with the dry core, are bringing the development of the wine on well.",88,Château Franc-Cardinal 2006  Bordeaux Côtes de Francs 
"With the first hints of maturity on the nose, this is already a rounded and steely wine. The fruit shows as spiced apples and black currants, cut with intense citrus. But the fruit is giving way to a very precise, crisp and nervy wine that could still age further. For its best, drink from 2018.",93,Domaine Zinck 2010 Eichberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"Creamy and leesy, with a complex mix of mineral, fresh herb, citrus rind and pungent botanicals, this is an interesting and refreshing style of Pinot Gris. Give it a good chill and watch it open as it warms.",91,Spindrift Cellars 2011 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"Ripe dark-skinned berry, forest floor and cooking spice aromas lead the nose along with a whiff of new leather. The chewy palate offers fleshy black cherry, cinnamon, vanilla and a hint of tobacco while polished tannins provide the framework. This is already accessible so no need to cellar it for years. Best through 2021.",90,Brunelli Martoccia 2011  Brunello di Montalcino
"Toasty oak and black pepper hit first on the palate and nose, followed by savory, dry tannin, black cherry and vanilla. Restrained and in balance, the Cabernet is supported by 12% Petit Verdot, which adds girth and intensity without becoming extreme.",90,Renteria 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder)
"Hints of burnt sugar and spice accentuate honeyed peach, tangerine and melon in this deeply fruity auslese. It's lip-smacking sweet and ethereal in texture, filling the palate with crystalline shards of citrus, salt and mineral. Delicious and complex already, but sure to improve further through at least 2030.",94,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt 2014 Scharzhofberger Auslese #19 Grosse Lage Riesling (Mosel)
"Sleek green pear-scented ripeness is married to tender creaminess. Underneath the fruit, subtle yeast notes appear. Slender but flavorsome and easy, the wine offers lovely Grüner typicity and perfect balance.",90,R&A; Pfaffl 2014 Zeiseneck Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel)
"Rounded and plush, with a subdued mélange of pear and apple fruit and a lovely, rescuing streak of tart apple freshness, this comes together in the end. The opening is broad, rich and medium-sweet, but the finish is illuminated by lemony acid.",89,François Baur 2014 Herrenweg Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"A distant touch of volatility opens the wine, giving it a bright aromatic lift or buoyancy. Although those apple skin aromas could worsen with time, the wine tastes pretty good now thanks to the fresh acidity and its lively, almost nervous personality. Drink immediately.",86,Barbi 2009 Il Ruspo Sangiovese (Umbria)
"The wine from this estate, controlled by Jean-Luc Thunevin of Château Valandraud, is serious with dark tannins and concentrated fruit. It is complex with layers of black fruit and a sweet ripe structure. Serious, intense and with fine acidity as a balance, it will be ready from 2023.",92,Château Bel-Air Ouÿ 2014  Saint-Émilion
"This full-bodied, quite ripe red has a classical edge in its grip of pencil led, black currant and dense blackberry fruit. Despite its heft and youthful tannins, it shows promise of aging in its backbone of structure and subtle grace. Enjoy best 2023 through 2028.",92,Michel-Schlumberger 2013 Platinum Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley)
"This is a medium- to full-bodied wine, a bit chunky and edgy at first, but these characters should mellow with another few months in the bottle. It's boldly flavored, with black cherry and beet notes upfront, while subtle mocha and vanilla shadings emerge on the finish.",90,Spy Valley 2013 Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
"Soft and thick, this Syrah has simple, sugary flavors of blackberries, cherries and chocolate. Drink now.",82,Opolo 2005 Syrah (Paso Robles)
"Anyone who doesn't like barnyard smells will want to steer clear of this funky example from Iowa. The crisp palate shows some cherry notes and little tannin. Finishes with some oily, ashy notes.",81,Jasper 2006 Roy's Vineyard at Cherry Creek Chancellor (Iowa)
"Based on Cercial, here is a rounded, smooth wine with a delicious perfume. Warm, ripe and delicious, this shows wood hints, peaches and green herbs. Keep for a year.",90,Campolargo 2009 Branco White (Bairrada)
"Waxy aromas of lanolin, dried apple and cheese set up a plump well-balanced palate, with plenty of body weight and adequate acidity. Peach, apple and melon flavors are moderately stony and minerally, while this varietal Garnacha Blanca finishes with good length.",88,Edetària 2013 Selecció Grenache Blanc (Terra Alta)
"On the nose, this has a high-toned tang that distracts slightly from its other scents of vanilla and raspberry. On the full-bodied palate, a crunchy mix of red and black fruit comes to the fore, but deep, savory notes of espresso and black olive emerge on the finish.",91,Kilikanoon 2010 Green's Vineyard Shiraz (Barossa Valley)
"This is and properly dry, with smooth tannins and high acidity that lends some sting to the palate. The berry and earth flavors lack some intensity. Drink now.",85,Vina Robles 2009 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Jindalee's 2007 is a medium-bodied Shiraz with slightly candied fruit and a sensation of sweetness on the short, soft finish.",81,Jindalee 2007 Circle Collection Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)
"Aromas of wild cherry, leather and truffle are quintessential Barolo. On the palate, rich black cherry, raspberry, vanilla, cocoa, balsamic herbs, sage and black pepper all come together supported by brooding tannins and brisk acidity. Best after 2020.",94,Rivetto 2010 del Comune di Serralunga d'Alba  (Barolo)
"The wine is smoky, with black currant-fruits and a core of dry tannins. Those tannins are probably not going anywhere much, so while the fruit and acidity will soften, the wine will always be dry.",84,Château La Fleur Poitou 2013  Lussac Saint-Émilion
"Savory in style with notes of smoke and black tea leaves on the nose, this full-bodied dry Welschriesling is vibrant on the palate with fresh apples and herbs. Strikingly high in acidity but finishes on a pleasantly tart apple skin note.",85,Podrumi Belje 2009 Graševina Welschriesling (Podunavlje)
"Oaky and robust, this wine takes on a confectionery route to tropical flavor and high-octane concentration, offering a thickness of texture and body. Stainless-steel fermented, it unveils secondary flavors of lime and white peach on the finish.",86,Napa Cellars 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Glaring oak on the nose results in notes of clove, chocolate and spice to go with generic but ripe black-fruit scents. This blend of Monastrell, Syrah and Petit Verdot feels heavy and syrupy, while flavors of maple, toasted oak, chocolate and clove finish ripe, but also sweet and candied.",87,Ego Bodegas 2014 Gorú Red (Jumilla)
"What a wonderful wine to pair with spaghetti alle vongole or calamari fritti. Made from Grechetto grapes and aged only in stainless steel, this is fresh, youthful, tangy and crisp, with aromas of citrus, kiwi, honeydew and peach.",88,Arnaldo Caprai 2011 Grecante Grechetto (Colli Martani)
"Semi-sweet and tasting like cherry-flavored cough medicine, this Merlot leaves a lot to be desired. But it's serviceable.",81,Black Box 2008 Merlot (California)
"A little over half Syrah with a balance of Merlot, barrel fermented in French and American oak—20% new—it shows notes of clove, dusty spice, and blackberry. The palate is medium bodied and flavorful with slightly astringent tannins with tart cherry and cranberry notes on the finish.",88,Apex 2012 The Catalyst Red (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Straw-colored in the glass, this wine has aromas of white and yellow peach, with flavors of passion fruit and pineapple. It's amazing that it is more than 10 years old. The wine has good mouthfeel and is well balanced with a crisp, clean finish. Drink now or hold for a few years.",87,Lion-Gri 2006 Golden Land Dry Chardonnay (Moldova)
"The wine is rich and spicy with layers of dried raisin and prune flavors along with a light touch of acidity. Its ripe fruit is tempered by the bite of spirit that gives the wine a lift as well as adding extra richness. On the dry side of Ports, it is made to be drunk now.",91,Quinta de la Rosa 2012 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port)
"Tight and packed with acidity, this is a very fruity wine dominated by herbaceous Sauvignon flavors that need to soften. It seems one-dimensional, just herbaceous and citrus.",85,Producta Vignobles 2014 Mission Saint-Vincent  (Bordeaux Blanc)
"A good value and a consistent Pinot from Chile. Starts with spicy berry aromas and leather, and next up there's lively raspberry flavors along with oaky chocolate and pepper. Finishes that way, too, with vanilla as well. A little hot on the finish.",87,J. & F. Lurton 2008 Hacienda Araucano Pinot Noir (Central Valley)
"A stellar performer year after year, Uccelliera's confident delivery is characterized by intensity, purity and personality. This Montalcino favorite also delivers plush softness with thick texture and a focused point of bright acidity.",94,Uccelliera 2006  Brunello di Montalcino
"From old vines and only produced in top vintages, this ripe perfumed wine is impressive. Rich with tropical fruits, layers of vanilla and acidity, it is full, up-front and packed with concentrated flavors and textures. Like many wines from this appellation, it can age and will be better from 2019.",92,Domaine Chatelain 2015 Prestige  (Pouilly-Fumé)
"Typical Beaune in its round, soft character. If the tannins are not particularly powerful, it still shows a generous nature, with super-ripe fruits supported by some dryness. The finish is jammy, ripe, a salad of red berries.",89,Bouchard Aîné & Fils 2005 Les Marconnets Premier Cru  (Beaune)
"While a bit restrained in style, this dry easy-going Riesling offers delicate shades of tangerine and yellow-apple flavor augmented by zesty lime and lemon acidity. Crisp texture and a soft bristle of lime zest lend a vibe to the finish.",87,Whitecliff Vineyard 2015 Reserve Riesling (New York)
"Tight while fruity, this is going to be an attractive wine from the Gadras family, who have owned the property since the early 19th century. With its layers of citrus acidity and richer pear and apples, it is packed with fruit that's given added interest by spice. Drink from late 2017.",88,Château Roc de Minvielle 2016  Bordeaux Blanc
"Foursquare, almost chunky, the tannins dominate black fruits, dark chocolate and spice flavors. There is considerable concentration here, along with initial high acidity. Straight from bottling, the fruit is subdued. The weight of the wine, though, confirms that this is going to be a powerhouse.",93,Louis Latour 2008  Echézeaux
"This red blends Xinomavro, the “acid black” grape found most in Macedonia, and Syrah. The Xinomavro gives the wine its tannic, slightly spiky edge, while Syrah rounds the character out with juicy fruit and softer spices. Overall, an assertive, ageworthy red that will pair well with grilled lamb or beef.",86,Pavlou-Kagas 2005 Kappa P62 Red (Macedonia)
"Though not labeled as such, this is truly a Red Mountain wine with all of the fruit coming from Ciel du Cheval and Taptiel vineyards. A blend of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, it shows a mixture of fruit and barrel. Flavors of herbs, plum, oak spices and black currant offer impressive density and finish with a tart lick of acidity.",92,Cana's Feast 2012 Mountain Cuvée Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is an earthy Pinot Noir with prominent mushroom notes. It's crisp and dry, with some unripe flavors that compromise the otherwise ripe, red fruit. Drink now.",84,Boekenoogen 2011 Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Dominated by minerality, this is a flinty and steel textured wine. It has some richness while remaining straight and narrow. With its structured character, it will need to age for over several years.",91,Henri Bourgeois 2010 La Demoiselle de Bourgeois  (Pouilly-Fumé)
"You get what you pay for in this crisp, savory Sauvignon Blanc. It's tart and clean, with fruity flavors of pineapple, lemon and lime juices that finish a little sweet.",84,TWODOG 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Coast)
"This wine opens with aromas of black plum, grilled bell peppers, cedar and spice. The dense palate offers black cherry, espresso, chocolate and black pepper alongside firm but fleeting tannins.",89,Tenuta di Nozzole 2010 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"This barrel-fermented Chardonnay offers subtle layers of flavor, weaving hints of leafy green herb, lemon skin and oil, together with suggestions of white peach. It's structured for drinking now and through 2021, with an elegant frame and modest proportions.",89,Foxtrot 2014 Four Shadows Chardonnay (Okanagan Valley)
"Lutum is a project from Santa Barbara vintner Gavin Chanin. The brand sources fruit from well-known vineyards, in this case Rinconada, situated in a favorable terroir in the southern part of the appellation. The wine is quite pale and the alcohol level is low, giving it great delicacy. But it's potent in raspberry, red currant, spicy red licorice and softened cola flavors. Delicious now, it will age well until at least 2022.",92,Lutum 2011 La Rinconada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"This is bright and crisp, with aromas of hay, passion fruit and citrus. The tangy palate shows classic varietal flavors, including grapefruit, kiwi, honeydew melon and mineral alongside lively acidity.",88,Kössler 2014 Sauvignon (Alto Adige)
"This very limited block selection is too thin, herbal and green to offer much pleasure. Tannins are stemmy and overtake the fruit.",85,Coeur de Terre 2011 Tallulah's Run Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Rough and earthy, it has some well-developed berry-fruit flavors. High acidity scours the mouth. A serviceable wine, dry and austere, with rasping tannins that aren't likely to soften with age.",83,Paradise Ridge 1999 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"Aromas of tilled earth, leather, ripe black-skinned fruit and a gamey note set the stage for this funky wine. The overripe palate displays fleshy black plum, dried blue flowers and bitter barnyard sensations set against a backdrop of soft acidity. Drying, astringent tannins cut the finish short.",85,La Cignozza 2009 Riserva  (Chianti)
"88-90 Barrel sample. Very apply wine, with light botrytis character, some spice and very fresh fruit. It is bright and almost crisp.",89,Château Bastor-Lamontagne 2009 Barrel sample  (Sauternes)
"The red plum and cassis aromas are meaty and oak-laden and carry to the smoky palate. This simple wine shows firm tannins and good acids, finishing with a toasty herbal note.",84,Meinert 2000 Cabernet Sauvignon (Devon Valley)
"From the appellation that is at a summit of Loire sweet wines, this golden wine balances intense acidity with intense botrytis and honey flavors. Ripe peaches and pineapples dominate the fruit profile of this concentrated, beautiful wine. It is just approaching its peak, so wait a little longer, until 2018.",95,Château de Fesles 2011 Vin Rare  (Bonnezeaux)
"Somehow, in a stellar 2014 lineup, this vineyard designate stands out, as the 2012 did when it was the Wine Enthusiast 2015 wine of the year. Power and precision work in tandem here. The fruit blend conjures up melon, berry, cherry and more, and the oak has the gentlest touch to its presence. There's tremendous midpalate concentration, and the clear sense that this could age for decades. Let's just say drink 2018 through 2030.",96,Ken Wright 2014 Abbott Claim Vineyard Pinot Noir
Aromas like cedar and marascino cherries are followed by good red and black cherry flavors. A firm and tannic texture gives this medium-bodied wine a rustic touch.,86,Brutocao 2013 Bliss Vineyard Estate Bottled Merlot (Mendocino)
"90-92 Firm, concentrated, dry wine. It seems to be all structure, until the sweet juicy plum fruits show through.",91,Château Fourcas Dupré 2010 Barrel sample  (Listrac-Médoc)
"Gritty aromas of road tar share space on the nose with black cherry and dark plum scents. This feels hard and abrasive, even by Ribera del Duero standards. Plum, berry and integrated oak flavors finish savory and with a lasting note of dry oak. Drink through 2023.",90,Bracamonte 2011 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"Barrel fermented, soft and ripe with bright fruits, especially banana, but also pear, apricot, peach and citrus. Rich and creamy, it combines sweet barrel toast with a hint of honey. Lush through the finish, which adds caramel and cinnamon toast.",90,àMaurice 2006 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is dark in color, with pushy aromas of wild field, prune and vinegar. Wide, chunky and heavy, it has flavors of black fruit, mint and green herb. It's full but soft on the finish, with pruny accents.",84,Lelia 2010 Garnacha (Cariñena)
"Initial notes of dust and earth blow off to reveal a luscious, sunny spectrum of yellow peaches and nectarines. It's a curious, enticing wine, honeyed and ripe, yet delicate and dancing in mouthfeel. Hints of fennel and spice add complexity to a long, lingering finish.",89,Atwater 2013 North Block Seven Riesling (Seneca Lake)
"Structured and dark, this wine's warm fruits are enmeshed in the firm tannins. It has richness and weight, with good sweet berry fruit flavors, and a juicy plum note on the finish.",87,Caves Velhas 2010 Romeira Colheita Seleccionada Red (Alentejano)
"Attractive berry aromas are candied and a tiny bit leafy. Tartaric acidity is front and center on the palate, but there's enough tasty yet generic berry flavors along with notes of clove and chocolate to handle forced acidity.",88,Zolo 2016 Sustainably Farmed Estate Grown and Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"This has a delicate citrus character and a tangy, minerally texture. The ripe fruits are balanced by acidity.",89,Simon Bize 2010 Les Champlains  (Bourgogne)
"California winemaker Nick Goldschmidt reaches back to his New Zealand roots for this bottling. It's a finely balanced mélange of grapefruit, cut grass and fig notes carried by medium body and a soft, appealing finish.",88,Forefathers 2014 Wax Eye Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Castello Banfi's Tavernelle is a wine that has shown a very nice evolution over the years. It's a Cabernet Sauvignon that boasts the ripe, concentrated qualities of sunny Tuscany with the elegance and firmness of the variety.",91,Castello Banfi 2006 Tavernelle Cabernet Sauvignon (Toscana)
"Stylish wine, balanced, intensely elegant. It has freshness and also weight, encased in a structure that is poised, beautifully integrating black currant fruit and chocolate flavors.",94,Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande 2008  Pauillac
"This 100% estate-grown Cabernet carries some of the identifying aromas of the Rocks, a part of Walla Walla where vineyards are planted on a dry river bed. Hints of earth, clay and chocolate make a lively introduction to a wine loaded with cherry and currant fruit flavors. The wine spent 20 months in French oak, but the barrel scents and flavors are handled lightly; the fruit is the star of this show. A fine debut.",91,Riverhaven 2007 Riverrock Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (OR))
"Balance and intensity are two of the main characteristics that distinguish this bottling. The central thrust of the wine is carried forward by youthful berry and cherry aromas, with pretty background notes of leather and sweet spice.",89,Remo Farina 2010 Montecorna  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
It's almost worth buying this bottling just for the extravagant medieval label design. Luckily the wine is lives up to the heraldic billing. It is rich while also well structured. Juicy berry fruits and fresh black currant acidity show well against a still-tannic structure. The wine comes from the Moreaud family. Drink from 2017.,90,Château Cormeil-Figeac 2012  Saint-Émilion
"Wilson's red wines tend to be simple and forward in sweet, sugary fruit, and so is this wine. It shows jammy or pie-filling flavors of raspberries, cherries and currants.",84,Wilson 2005 Ellie's Vineyard Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley)
"As its name implies, this wine comes from chalk soil, giving both a strongly mineral character and ripe tropical fruit flavors. It's rich, full in the mouth, dry but with such a ripe character there seems to be some sweetness. It's impressively full and ready to drink now.",92,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2012 Calcaire Riesling (Alsace)
"Earthy plum and cherry aromas score points for being clear and direct. The palate on this varietal Mencía is round, smooth and just right. Lightly briny, earthy plum and cherry flavors hold steady on the finish, with a dash of saltiness.",90,Don Bernardino 2012 Amandi Mencía (Ribeira Sacra)
"Lovely floral aromas of white spring flower meld together with scents of an orchard in bloom and a whiff of bread crust. The creamy palate doles out apple, yellow peach, toasted nut and a hint of honey alongside a persistent perlage.",90,Dubl NV Dublesse Dosaggio Zero Metodo Classico Greco (Vino Spumante)
"A rare wine for Portugal, a 100% Merlot, this is dense, very rich and spicy. Plenty of juicy black fruits are still developing along with the concentrated tannins. It's a wine that is close to being too concentrated, saved by the fresher fruity end. Drink from 2018.",90,Wines & Winemakers 2012 Companhia das Lezírias Tyto Alba Vinhas Protegidas Merlot (Tejo)
"Acidity and bitterness mark blackberry and raisin flavors in this wine, along with a hit of oak and tannins. It's already throwing some sediment and isn't likely to be an ager.",83,Kenwood 2009 Artist Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"While it was not a generally declared vintage, this year has produced some fine single-quinta vintages. This wine has a fine tannic structure behind the rich damson and dried fruit flavors. Spice and acidity add to the complexity of this dense wine that will certainly need to age. Drink from 2023.",91,Borges 2012 Soalheira Vintage  (Port)
"This is rich, full-bodied Chardonnay, rounded out with peaches and spiced apricots. The wood is evident here, giving an extra softness as well as bringing out rich honey. A wine that opens beautifully in the mouth, ready to drink but also ageworthy.",92,La Chablisienne 2006 Montée de Tonnerre Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"This is full of steely acidity as well as complex fruit. It is rich, full of toast and spice that show up the generous swathes of yellow fruits that are just beginning to show their glory. It will develop over many years. Drink from 2017.",93,Olivier Leflaive 2012 Charmes Premier Cru  (Meursault)
Enticing aromas of raspberry and cherry cordial open up this crisp Merlot from the North Fork. There's a decent level of intensity in the mouth and medium body. Coffee and sawdust dominate the short-to-medium finish. Drink now to two years.,86,Martha Clara 2007 Merlot (North Fork of Long Island)
"A soft, drinkable red with hints of sweet smoke and cured meat adding character to the mulberry and blackberry fruit flavors. Medium weight with low tannins and an easy finish. Drink now.",85,Beau Joubert 2009 Oak Lane Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch)
"Standard-issue berry and plum aromas turn warm and leathery with airing. The palate on this Malbec-Bonarda-Syrah blend is juicy, but it comes with a choppy feel. Tastes brambly and wild, with red berry fruit and a briary, leathery finish.",86,La Posta 2009 Cocina Tinto Red (Mendoza)
"This is a rich, full-bodied, medium-sweet wine full of generous fruits and ripe spice. There's no need to wait to drink this lively wine with its light touch of acidity at the end.",87,Kuentz-Bas 2013 Collection Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Practically opaque, this Bordeaux-style red blend shows rich dark cherry, blackberry syrup, star anise and tobacco on the nose. The full palate is heavy with ripe dark fruit, leading to a warm baking-spice kick on the finish.",86,Canyon Wind 2012 IV Red (Grand Valley)
"Here's a cheerful, bright Morellino di Scansano, with jammy fruit notes of blackberry and cherry. The quality of the fruit is plump and round, and the mouthfeel feels chewy and seemingly slightly sweet.",87,Rocca delle Macìe 2010 Campomaccione  (Morellino di Scansano)
"Bright in cherry and cranberry, this classically styled Nebbiolo is light red in color and buoyant in acidity. A sanguine back layer brings the earthier elements of the wine to life. With not much Nebbiolo to try in California, this one is worth a taste to savor the possibilities.",89,Rosa d'Oro 2012 Nebbiolo (Yolo County)
"Rich with gooey marshmallow, crème brûlée and cotton candy aromas, this is an unabashed classic California Chardonnay from Austin Hope. Unctuous marzipan and sea salt caramel flavors make for a creamy mouthfeel, and yet firm acidity leaves the midpalate feeling clean, allowing butterscotch tones to linger on the finish.",90,Treana 2015 Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"The cherry and cinnamon aromas are true and inviting, and they stand up to the oak that's been thrown at this Pinot. The flavor profile deals raspberry and cherry amid oaky shadings. The finish is toasty and warm, with some coffee popping up late in the game. Fresh, fruity and true.",85,Viña Casas del Bosque 2001 Reserve Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)
"This blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Shiraz, 5% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc, 5% Malbec and 5% Petit Verdot opens with aromas of church incense, brambly berry, cherry cola and fruit cake. The palate shows a bit more restraint, offering flavors of small red berries and cherries that are dusted with baking spices. Structured tannins lend ample grip to the medium-weight palate, while moderate acidity lifts the red fruit flavors through the close. Drink now–2021.",90,Ernie Els 2014 Proprietor's Red (Stellenbosch)
"Charming overtones of citrus herald the freshness of the 2014 vintage, while the palate shows richer fruit: golden Mirabelle plums and baked apricot with occasional swirls of rose blossom. The dry finish beautifully accentuates the freshness and is rather moreish.",90,Joseph Cattin 2014 Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"This is a ripe, smooth blend of Alvarinho and Chardonnay. The two complement each other well with yellow fruits touched by a more citrus edge and a rich character. It is fruity, full-bodied and ready to drink.",88,DFJ Vinhos 2015 Point West White (Lisboa)
"This release is always among my favorite Aussie Rieslings. Not only is the quality consistent, the price for a nearing-maturity wine makes it a winning value. It is smoky and toasty on the nose, showing off those developed aromas to good effect against a background of bergamot-tinged fruit. The round patina of age is balanced by great acid drive and a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2020.",93,Pewsey Vale 2010 The Contours Museum Reserve Riesling (Eden Valley)
"This lacy, fine-tuned Grenache displays superb aromatics that are still a bit raw. One gets the feeling that as good as the juicy, young grape and berry flavors are, this wine has more complexity lurking below the surface. Berry, mineral and bright spices elevate the finish, much like a youthful Montsant.",94,Maison Bleue 2010 La Montagnette Upland Vineyard Grenache (Snipes Mountain)
"Roasted beef, black cherry, rainbow peppercorn, dried lavender and a touch of rosemary arise on the nose of this blend of 51% Grenache, 39% Syrah and 10% Petite Sirah. There is lots of pizzaz to the palate, where rose petals, ripe plums, rosewater and aromatic spices show on the sip.",93,Refugio Ranch 2013 Escondrijo Red (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Although it's not indicated on the label, this is a Blanc de Blancs from Chardonnay. It is warm and ripe, with a soft texture allied to fresh acidity. Orange and lemon zest give a great lift to this rounded wine.",92,Larmandier-Bernier NV Latitude Extra Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)
"This blended trocken offers plenty of Pfalz character at a reasonable price. Brined peaches and honey show the warmth and minerality of the region in a flattering light, carried by a rich texture and a long finish.",90,Geh. Rat Dr. von Bassermann-Jordan 2008 Trocken Riesling (Pfalz)
This densely structured wine has firm tannins and concentration. The juicy black fruits are still developing to fill out the wine even further. Drink from 2018.,85,Château Jamin 2015  Bordeaux
"Supple and seamless, this lightly spicy wine is a good all-purpose white. The clean, crisp fruit touches on kiwi, pear and a hint of green banana. Vinified in stainless steel, it's a refreshing wine that should be enjoyed soon.",88,Rainstorm 2016 Pinot Gris (Oregon)
"Mike Sinor's lighter take on Syrah from his new coastal vineyard is refreshing though not quite as inviting as the Black Label. Black cherry, white sage and spearmint notes entice the nose, before the palate breathes in tart elderberries and black pepper, presented with tight tannins and brisk acidity.",89,Sinor-LaVallee 2013 White Label Bassi VIneyard Syrah (San Luis Obispo County)
"From 100% estate-grown Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot grown in the heart of the Stags Leap District, this earthy red offers black tea and coffee aromas and flavors, suggestions of wild sage and black pepper enveloping the nose. Medium to full-bodied, elegant and well-composed, the tannins are soft and structured, the wine able to age, drinking well now through 2020.",91,Clos du Val 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District)
"A refreshing nose of menthol, cloves, spice and cherry lead this alluring red. Soft, integrated flavors of cherry, vanilla, forest berries and pepper follow. Gentle tannins and an overall classic character add to its pretty appeal. An elegant sip.",87,Haggipavlu 2006 Agiorgitiko (Nemea)
"Rooty aromas come with a caustic side, something akin to Pine Sol or ammonia. Feels narrow and restricted, with limited berry flavors, juniper and other weird elements. An intense wine, but not in the right way.",82,Viña Ijalba 2007  Rioja
"This barrel selection is the winery's reserve. Dense and detailed, it moves gracefully from lime-inflected citrus through peach and papaya. Though modest in alcohol, it has a warm kick to the finish, along with a light kiss of barrel toast.",93,Bethel Heights 2015 Casteel Chardonnay (Eola-Amity Hills)
"This fails to overcome its thin, unripe fruit. Strong scents of smoke and oak carry into the flavors, bringing a bitter end to the finish.",85,Plaisance Ranch 2012 Merlot (Applegate Valley)
"This Cab doesn't pretend to be anything but what it is: dry, full-bodied and characteristically Cabernet. Grab a burger or beef taco and enjoy.",84,Round Hill 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Here is a dark, smoky, meaty Syrah, smooth in the mouth and showing plenty of black cherry fruit. The silkiness plays nicely against flavors that are dark with olive, espresso and cacao, and highlighted with hints of orange peel and pepper.",92,Sparkman 2010 Untamed Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"This is a great example of the power that can come a Grand Cru vineyard. It's opulent and dense, but more than that it has intense energy and drive. Although the wine is marked as medium sweet, the spice and pepper give it a dry, tight, nervy edge. The wine is still young and will be best from 2017.",93,Domaine Zinck 2012 Goldert Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"This is a wine that is obviously made for the long term. At this stage is dry and firm, serious and solid. The aftertaste reveals its enormous potential with the generous black fruits and acidity. The estate, in the heart of the Margaux vineyards, is impressive. Drink from 2025.",94,Château Durfort-Vivens 2014  Margaux
"This ripe, juicy wine offers blackberry flavors and young acidity. It is developing balance, fresh fruits and supporting tannins. The structure is integrating into the fruit, which will dominate if you wait to drink until 2017. The blend is 70% Merlot and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon.",87,VIgnobles Roux 2014 Château La Fôret  (Bordeaux Supérieur)
"This is a Cabernet to serve at parties and satisfy people who are looking for something red, dry and full bodied. It's definitely rustic, but has some nice berry, cherry, currant and spice flavors.",85,Q 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"This is an exotic wine with aromas of graham cracker, blueberry, violet petal and pastry. It feels lush, grabby, chewy and tannic, with heavy flavors of clove, black licorice, savory berry and baked plum. The finish is dominated by oak, with clove and resiny barrel notes that compete with the wine's fresher dark-fruit component.",87,Senda 66 2010 Tempranillo (La Mancha)
"Plum and berry aromas are a bit grassy on the nose. This is plump and full in body, with herbal notes held in check by ripe black-cherry and black-plum flavors. On the finish, the flavors are mild and easy.",87,Carmen 2012 Gran Reserva Apalta Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"Opens with orange peel aromas. This wine from the Pansa Blanca grape is balanced and easygoing, with sweet but friendly flavors of citrus, melon and mango. Mild and controlled from front to back. Drink well chilled.",87,Marqués de Alella 2010 Pansa Blanca (Alella)
"This is a juicy, perfect melding of citrus and light tropical fruit flavors. With impeccable balance and poise, this thrilling, entirely stainless-steel-fermented Viognier persists well onto the graceful finish.",92,Nefarious 2011 Defiance Vineyard Viognier (Lake Chelan)
"Fixin, the northernmost red wines on the Côte de Nuits, generally produces light wines. This is no exception; the wine is bright, very fresh, with hints of berry fruits.",86,Derey Frères 2008 Vieilles Vignes  (Fixin)
"This Malbec's high-toned floral aromas of plum and blueberry come in front of a raw, abrasive palate. This tastes like pickled cranberry, while a citric finish is an enamel-peeler.",81,Luis Segundo Correas 2015 El Cipres Malbec (Mendoza)
"This easygoing sparkler opens with delicate scents of spring flower and a whiff of ripe orchard fruit. The lively palate shows peach, banana and pineapple alongside brisk acidity and a vigorous perlage.",86,Cantina Progettidivini NV Brut  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"This is the least expensive of the winery's four new 2010 Syrahs, and it's the most approachable. With fine, supple tannins and a dry finish, it shows flavors of rich blackberry jam, black currant, dark chocolate, anise and pepper, which are enhanced with sweet oak. Only 122 cases were produced, but it's worth a search.",92,MacLaren 2010 Syrah (Russian River Valley)
"The alluring perfume of Traminer leads on this pretty wine, whose subtle and refreshing lemon/citrus flavors are delivered with a touch of flowers. Though a bit lean, the wine has a nice fruit profile and will pair well with spicy cuisine such as Indian or Thai.",84,Protopapas 2007 Traminer (Greece)
"Hazelnut, butterscotch praline and vanilla aromas are followed by a mellow interplay of nut, honey, candied ginger and cinnamon. Not overly complex, but certainly appealing.",86,Hermes NV Red Dessert  (Mavrodaphne of Patras)
"This is an oaky, seemingly sweet, blackberry- and strawberry-tinged blend of 65% Zinfandel, 30% Sangiovese and 5% Syrah. With an earthy note of sage running through, this is a food friendly wine that'll require a hearty meal to tame it down.",85,Naggiar 2010 Mistero Red (Sierra Foothills)
"Made from the Coda di Volpe grape, this polished white from southern Italy opens with aromas of peach, citrus and yellow flowers with a whiff of flint. The palate blossoms with time in the glass, showing ripe yellow peach, pear and lemon drop along with mineral notes.",89,Mastroberardino 2012 Bianco Coda di Volpe (Lacryma Christi del Vesuvio)
"Golden liquid, a piercing nose, utter musk: these are the first impressions of this fragrant, botrytised win. A topnote of candied lemon hovers above the core flavor of beeswax, while bright, juicily luscious acidity makes the mouth water. This is a concentrated high-wire act, dancing between bundled sweetness and the piercing, enlivening freshness of Riesling acidity. Nothing is cloying; everything bathes in the freshness of the balancing acidity that sharpens the flavors. It's gorgous now, but will last well through 2040.",96,Salomon-Undhof 2009 Bienenfeld Beerenauslese Riesling (Niederösterreich)
"This fruity fizz majors on the aroma of freshly cut Golden Delicious apples, while the body is very light, slightly tart and pleasantly dry. The mousse is rather frothy but if refreshment is what you are after, this is your ticket.",87,Willm NV Prestige Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"This medium- to full-bodied white features a richly textured mouthfeel to go with its toasty aromas and melon fruit. There's a touch of creamed-corn character, and the finish could be longer, but it's still a plump, satisfying wine to pair with chicken or fish.",87,D'Arenberg 2006 The Hermit Crab Viognier-Marsanne White (McLaren Vale)
"Here's a compact, focused Amarone that shows detailed aromas of wild berry, mesquite, bramble, cola and Spanish cedar. It's lean in terms of extraction and intensity, making this wine a good pairing partner to white meat or honey-roasted ham.",88,Le Bertarole 2005 Podere Cariano  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"This is an elegant wine, blended with 13% Merlot and just a splash of Carmenère adding some peppery spice. Surprising citrus highlights suggest tangerine juice and rind, and the tart pomegranate and wild cherry fruit slides gracefully into sleek tannins.",92,Walla Walla Vintners 2011 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This appellation blend shows buttered toast with lemon marmalade on the nose, with a growing sense of tropicality. The palate is plush and smoky, with vanilla and cream flavors cut by just enough citrusy tang to keep it serious.",88,Comartin 2013 Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"The aromas are all high toned, with barrel notes of exotic spice, vanilla and medicine cabinet. The red-fruit flavors bring a sense of elegance and distinction.",87,Ambassador Vineyard 2014 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"Crisp green apple, lime and vanilla wafer mingle on the palate of this 100% Chardonnay, méthode champenoise sparkler from the Bazzano Vineyard. It drips with minerality, lively and tangy with a medium to light body that picks up depth and breadth on the finish.",91,Paradise Ridge 2012 Blanc de Blanc Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This wine has a dairy note to the nose; i.e., cheese, custard and yogurt. Lemony flavors are accented by dried baking spices, while the back palate is a touch chalky, offering some good and welcome grip. Overall, the wine seems a bit heavy. If it were pushing amps, it would be a high-power machine.",87,Quivira 1999 Fig Tree Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley)
"Plenty of ripe fruit and big texture on this intense wine, which hasn't shown half its potential yet. The pear and white peach fruits are edged with minerality and a closed-in texture. The wood gives an unfortunate burnt edge that needs to soften out. Age for at least five years.",93,Albert Bichot 2007 Domaine du Pavillon  (Corton-Charlemagne)
"Everything about this elegant Chardonnay says balance and proportion. The tropical fruit shadings are carried by a solid acid backbone and accented smartly by mineral notes. A subtle yet rich perfume provides unexpected pleasure, and this wine has structure, reserve and depth. Can last two to five years.",90,Waterford 1999 Chardonnay (Stellenbosch)
"Ripe, raisiny aromas of earthy berry fruits, chocolate and vanilla introduce a choppy palate with oaky flavors of dried cheese and cream. This also shows dried plum and berry flavors on a full, scratchy palate. End notes of foresty berry fruits, earth, licorice and hard spices are impressively solid. Drink through 2020.",90,Alvarez de Toledo 2012 Marqués de Toro Finca la Moura Mencía (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)
"Unripe and green, with acidic gooseberry, menthol and green peppercorn aromas and flavors.",82,Bernardus 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey County)
"Thick in sandpapery tannins, this Petite Sirah shows very ripe, sweet flavors of blackberry jam, currants, chocolate, raisins and pepper. It's rustic now, and likely to remain so over a long lifespan.",84,Perry Creek 2006 Altitude 2401 Fair Play Farms Petite Sirah (El Dorado)
"San Polo's Rosso di Montalcino offers classic aromas of cherry, black fruit and spice. But it also adds an extra layer of vanilla and sweet spice that makes for a very nice ensemble. It's smooth, rich and spicy on the close.",88,San Polo 2007  Rosso di Montalcino
"This is a soft, earthy wine, with dried herb and currant flavors. It comes down on the subtle side, with a bit of oak influence adding richness to the wine's otherwise dry texture. Drink soon.",87,Faust 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Bright and fruity, this is a ripe, red-fruit-flavored wine. The youthful tannins will soften quickly to give a rounded wine, rich but with crisp acidity at the end. Drink now.",87,Casa Santos Lima 2015 Reserva do Monte Red (Lisboa)
"Firm and solid tannins with a dry core offers a dark character and density. Along with this, the wine has a ripe, fruity character that's packed with acidity and layered with wood.",91,Château Haut-Simard 2010  Saint-Émilion
"The nose here is flat as a board, offering next to nothing. Simple green apple and underripe pear flavors fail to rescue the wine, while a finish lacking definition and length seals its fate. For a producer that largely succeeds with Shiraz, the cute name of this wine is unfortunately the best thing that it has to offer.",82,D'Arenberg 2001 The Broken Fishplate Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills)
"This is jammy and reduced throughout, especially on the nose, which offers a dense blueberry aroma. Saturated and solid on the palate, it features ripe flavors of black plum, blackberry and caramel. A potent, fruity, modern type of Tempranillo that's long on fruit and short on complexity.",89,Finca Torremilanos 2009 Los Cantos  (Ribera del Duero)
"This elegant sparkler has a lot going for it, from the complex aromas of bread dough and thyme to flavors of lemon and lime. Made from organically grown Pinot Noir and Chardonnay grapes, it offers a very clean and fresh personality and crisp and tangy texture.",88,McFadden NV Cuvée Brut Sparkling (Potter Valley)
"Lees, yeast and pickled cabbage aromas are hardly inviting. This seems out of shape and globular. Yeasty, briny, bitter flavors of citrus and melon end green, with an onion note.",82,Finca Antigua 2014 El Palomar Viura (La Mancha)
"Made with 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Petit Verdot and 15% Cabernet Franc, this opens with aromas of bell pepper, violet and a whiff of graphite. The concentrated palate gives raspberry and black olive alongside teeth-coating tannins.",88,Tenuta degli Dei 2013 Cavalli Red (Toscana)
"Starts off tight on the nose, offering up only struck flint and citrusy notes, but broadens out on the palate to reveal flavors of melon and white pepper. Citrus and spice linger nicely on the finish. Drink now.",87,Yalumba 2009 Organic Viognier (South Australia)
"A terrific Chardonnay at a great price. The ripe orange, pineapple, tropical fruit and vanilla-cream flavors are enriched with butter and oak. What's best of all is the acidity. It's so bright and zesty, it balances all the richness, making it worth repeated sips.",90,Raymond 2011 Reserve Selection Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"A rich, sweet wine, showing the great improvements to this chateau in recent vintages. It boasts ripe black currants, a firm, solid structure and offers great aging potential. This is now a château to follow.",91,Château Petit-Village 2006  Pomerol
"Some vegetal notes mix into flavors of raspberries and cherries, detracting from the full enjoyment of this Pinot Noir. Other than that, it's dry, briskly acidic and full bodied. Drink up.",87,Two Sisters 2010 Lindsay's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Rose, blue flower, perfumed berry and mint aromas set the tone on this vibrant red. Elegant and linear, the luminous palate delivers cherry, pomegranate, white pepper and clove. Firm refined tannins provide structure and poise. It's youthfully austere but already balanced, with bright acidity. Drink 2023–2038.",93,Giacomo Fenocchio 2013 Cannubi  (Barolo)
"Very opulent, almost too much so, with a flood of Key lime pie, pineapple jam, orange, butterscotch and buttered toast flavors that overwhelm in richness. The saving grace is a fine structure of acidity and minerals and a finish that strives to be dry. Drink now with shellfish, roast pork, or all alone as an apéritif.",90,Kunde 2010 Reserve Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley)
"Aromas of smoke, charred earth, dark spice and black-skinned berry lift out of the glass. The concentrated firmly structured palate offers dried black cherry, blackberry extract, ground pepper and a hint of tobacco framed in fine-grained tannins. Drink 2019–2029.",93,Guastaferro 2011 Primum Riserva  (Taurasi)
"Feels harsh and sharp in the mouth, with cherry-berry flavors. Pretty rustic drinking, with a bitter finish.",82,Wild Coyote 2009 Prankster Merlot (Paso Robles)
"Aromas of white spring flower, oak-driven vanilla and a whiff of white stone fruit lead the nose. The oak sensations follow through the somewhat lean palate, along with pear and a confectionery note. It closes on a note of bitter almond.",87,La Mormoraia 2014 Riserva  (Vernaccia di San Gimignano)
"Oily, slightly harsh aromas are sketchy. This barrel-fermented Viura feels a bit heavy and stale, as if it's already on the way down. Bitter flavors of peach pits and citrus peel finish low on vibrancy.",84,Finca Nueva 2014 Fementado en Barrica Viura (Rioja)
"Full-bodied, velvety and rich, this is a big Hermitage for a big occasion. Espresso and dark chocolate notes lead the way, buoyed by baking spices, vanilla and plum. It's approachable now, but certain to go another decade in a cool cellar.",93,Ferraton Pere et Fils 2013 Les Dionnières  (Hermitage)
"At this stage, the wine is showing way too much wood aging. It is toasty and spicy with the fruit obscured beneath. It should integrate in a few years, although the wood is always likely to be prominent. Drink from 2017.",91,Château Lascombes 2011  Margaux
"Still gritty in tannins at nearly four years of age, but very rich in fruit, showing concentrated blackberry, currant, cassis and mineral flavors, accented with sweet, smoky cedar wood. The mouthfeel is elegant on this dry, complex wine, which should be decanted.",89,William Hill Estate 2007 Bench Blend Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Decent, everyday Pinot, with good varietal character, if not especially complex. The wine is dry, silky and crisp, with modest cherry and cola flavors.",85,Mountain View 2007 Pinot Noir (Central Coast)
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah is the best of the three new releases from Mannina. It simply has better focus, more concentration and is a well-balanced wine with a pretty mocha/toasty finish. Why is this the cheap wine? Who knows, but it is clearly the best overall value as well.",88,Mannina Cellars 2006 Cali Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Fragrant and savory, this opens with attractive aromas of crushed violet, iris, perfumed berry and a whiff of tilled soil. The bright, linear palate doles out black cherry, ripe plum, white pepper and clove while polished tannins and fresh acidity provide the lithe, easy-drinking framework. There's not much complexity but it will makes fine drinking over the next few years.",90,Le Bocce 2012  Chianti Classico
"Aromas of pressed blue flowers, ripe plum, dark berry, anise, coffee and nutmeg lead the nose. The lively palate delivers juicy black Morello cherry, milk chocolate, orange zest and a hint of baking spice alongside bright acidity and supple tannins. Made to be drunk young so enjoy now.",88,Tenuta Pierazzuoli 2013  Chianti Montalbano
"Here's a 2004 Chianti Classico (with a 15% component of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon for extra structure and smoothness) that delivers aromas of wet earth, white mushroom, blackberry, tobacco and leather. Drink it with stewed meats or game dishes.",87,Castello di Monastero 2004  Chianti Classico
"Creamy and delicious, this elegant off-dry sparkler doles out layers of sweet white peach, yellow apple, pear and a tangy note of candied lemon drop. A silky perlage gives it a smooth polished texture while bright acidity lifts the rich flavors.",92,Nino Franco 2016  Prosecco Superiore di Cartizze
"Made with wild yeasts, this gorgeous, unfiltered wine delivers intense flavors of ripe pear, juicy green apple, mineral, wild fennel and thyme. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy texture.",93,Pala 2014 Stellato Nature  (Vermentino di Sardegna)
"A solid wine for the price, this begins with honeydew and lime aromas. Flavors start with a spicy cinnamon apple before diving into buttered squash, melon and fresh lime, with a dash of salt.",91,Castoro Cellars 2012 Estate Chardonnay (Paso Robles)
"A big, burly, juicy wine, focusing on powerful red fruits and layers of acidity. The tannins are dense, but the fruit is more dominant. There are smoky flavors, spiked with licorice and blueberries. Caladoc is a cross between Malbec and Grenache, developed in France, rarely planted.",87,DFJ Vinhos 2005 Caladoc-Alicante Boushet Red (Estremadura)
"Solid and firmly tannic, this is a wine with forward red-fruit flavors, a dry core and dense texture. The structure of this balanced wine along with its concentration promise aging. Drink from 2016.",90,Mas de la Dame 2011 Cuvée Gourmande Red (Les Baux de Provence)
"Citrus and apple aromas are straightforward. This feels mostly good on the palate, with some flab and grab. Citric-leaning flavors of grapefruit and orange are softened by nectarine notes, while the finish is clampy like the palate.",88,La Val 2013 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"A 100% varietal wine blended from three vineyard sites, this has fantastic aromatics, floral and meaty in all the best ways. Sanguine, it flirts in black peppercorn, game and a density of black licorice, remaining sturdy and firm on the palate in leathery grace. Drinkable now, it has years to go, through 2022.",92,Eric Kent 2012 Kalen's Big Boy Blend Syrah (Sonoma County)
"Dense, spicy wine, showing its alcohol with a hot pepper character. The fruit, though, does offer rich compensation, with black plum skins, bitter coffee flavors and dark, dry tannins.",89,Poças 2008 Reserva Red (Douro)
"Underbrush, oak, wild berry, herb and balsamic notes lead the nose of this Brunello. Tightly wound, fine-grained tannins frame cranberry, red cherry, orange zest and white pepper flavors on the palate. A hint of star anise signals the close. Drink 2020–2027.",91,Podere Brizio 2012  Brunello di Montalcino
"Honeydew, white peach, honeysuckle, sea salt and toast make for a fairly exuberant nose on this bottling by Gavin Chanin from the region's iconic property. There is a savory salt character right away on the sip, then come rounded flavors of nectarine, red apple and Asian pear. A bright electric acidity enlivens the full mouthfeel.",94,Chanin 2015 Sanford & Benedict Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"The aromas pop, with notes of fresh blueberry pie, sweet herb, dark-roasted coffee and spice. The palate doesn't quite deliver on all those aromas, seeming a bit less bold than the nose suggests. Still, this wine is enjoyable, especially after it has time to open up.",89,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2013 Ethos Reserve Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Fruity and crisp, this bright wine offers flavors of lemon and fresh apple juice. A tangy lemon-zest texture gives great acidity and a refreshing aftertaste. Drink now.",86,Cave des Vignerons de Mancey 2013 Domaie Touzot  (Mâcon-Villages)
"A bit herbal and brambly, with baked, earthy red fruit aromas. Modest raspberry flavors are mostly what you get off the narrow palate, and the finish follows suit as it fades out with a tight, herbal character. Rudimentary Cabernet.",84,Avenue 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"This soft and rounded wine has attractive lemon, peach and almond flavors. It's crisp while showing touches of honey that give a riper feel. It's ready to drink",85,Domaine du Petit Coteau 2013 Sec  (Vouvray)
This blend of Inzolia and Chardonnay has subdued aromas of orchard fruit and nut. The extremely simple palate offers suggestions of lime and citrus zest alongside brisk acidity.,84,Case del Feudo 2015 Barone Beneventano del Bosco White (Sicilia)
"Spicy and substantial, this authoritative Riesling snaps into tight focus around apple and melon flavors. Hints of clove and ginger add complexity.",90,Sawtooth 2011 Riesling
"This wine is all varietal, coming from one of the state's top sites. Despite the warm vintage and site, it opens with aromas of herbs along with barrel spice and tightly wound dark fruit. The black fruit flavors are fresh and lively, showing elegance and persistence with a tight core of fine grained tannins.",92,Fidelitas 2013 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"In terms of opulence and complexity, this is the least of Lynmar's 2011 Pinot Noirs. But it's all relative, because this is a fantastic wine. Its hallmarks are dryness, moderate alcohol, tart acidity and a silky texture. The sour-cherry candy and persimmon flavors have a mushroomy edge that suggests wild mushroom risotto.",90,Lynmar 2011 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Luxuriously textured, this wine combines Petite Sirah, the son, with Syrah, its father. The two get along famously, showing a balance of powerfully soft blue fruit, garrigue and a ring of smoke. Its meatiness will impress, spiced as it is in dried herb and anise.",94,Robert Biale 2013 Like Father Like Son Syrah-Petite Sirah (Napa Valley)
"Unlike many an Australian Shiraz, this one sees only French oak barrels for aging. The result is a dense, blueberry-filled wine, supported by hints of toast and espresso. It's full-bodied but not tiring to drink, thanks to an enlivening burst of black pepper on the finish. Best Buy. —J.C.",88,Petaluma 1999 Bridgewater Mill Shiraz (Australia)
"Roughly half of the blend is made from fruit that comes from 30-year-old vines. An addition of 6% Muscat adds a scent of tree fruit, and the lovely citrus and stone fruit flavors are enhanced by a fresh-baked bread note. It has excellent concentration and impeccable balance, plus a long, satisfying finish.",92,Forgeron 2011 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The warm climate of the Barossa is reflected in the heavy, sweet fruit flavors. The melon, guava and honey aromas and flavors lack zip and definition but certainly don't lack for ripeness.",83,Hamilton's Ewell Vineyard 2000 Railway Chardonnay (Barossa Valley)
"This wine is half Cabernet Sauvignon, with the balance Merlot and Cabernet Franc. It draws you into the glass with light, high-toned aromas of herbs, flowers and assorted spices. The palate brings a medley of black and red-fruit flavors, with herbal accents that display deftness, elegance and length. It's drinking well now but should only improve with additional time in the bottle. Best after 2018.",91,àMaurice 2012 William Ivey Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
Resiny oak scents on top of standard apple and pear aromas describe the bouquet on this solid but woody Chardonnay. Oak-dominated flavors of pear and banana finish with medium acidity and lasting flavors of banana and wood resin.,85,Santa Ema 2012 Reserve Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)
"This is fresh and juicy while also having structure; a mineral edge to the texture gives power. Acidity and juiciness both contribute to the ripe, full-bodied mix. The wood-aging is too dominant at this stage, so give the wine several years. Drink from 2017.",90,Companhia das Quintas 2011 Quinta da Fronteira Selecção do Enólogo Red (Douro)
"Elegant mineral, citrus and spice aromas lead into complex layers of sea salt and lemon flavors. Overall this is balanced, but with a bracing edge that's refreshing and refined.",91,Argyros 2010 Estate Argyros Assyrtico (Santorini)
"Rich and spicy, this lusty Zin shows how well the variety does in Russian River Valley. Aged in American oak, it's deep and long in cherry, cranberry, licorice, cola, cinnamon and paprika spice flavors. Best now, with rich meat dishes and hard cheeses.",87,Balletto 2005 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"Dry and medium in body, this Cab from a warm vintage is simple but friendly, with nice cassis and raspberry aromas. Juicy and lively on the palate, it holds red-fruit flavors accented by spice and herbs, particularly mint. A mild finish makes it an easy drinker.",88,Familia Schroeder 2009 Saurus Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Patagonia)
"Laudun is considered one of the top communes for white varieties in the Southern Rhône. This cuvée, from the region's cooperative cellar, is a vibrant, refreshing wine that combines modest pineapple fruit, with hints of wet stone and honey. Drink now.",87,Laudun Chusclan 2013 Cinq Cépages White (Côtes du Rhône)
"The smells of wet pebbles and very faint apple fruit characterize this slender, refreshing and easygoing Pinot Blanc. On the palate there is even more yellow and green apple flavor. Drink soon while the fruit is fresh and appetizing.",88,Höpler 2014 Pinot Blanc (Burgenland)
"Winemaker Matt Crafton embraces the winery's longstanding tradition of elegant Napa Valley Cabernet in this estate wine—a beautiful expression of exotic, savory characteristics wrapped in a seamless texture. Tomato leaf, meat and soy notes underscore deep layers of black pepper, black cherry and cassis, with grippy, dense tannins. Enjoy 2023–2033.",94,Chateau Montelena 2013 The Montelena Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Calistoga)
"This plump, succulent spätlese starts off with apple and citrus aromas, then delivers intensely mineral flavors reminiscent of crushed vitamins and green apples. Crisp and citrusy on the finish, with a fine sense of poise and balance.",91,Prinz Salm 2007 Prinz Salm Spätlese Riesling (Nahe)
"Luminous is an apt word to describe this sun-kissed, blossomy wine chock full of plump yellow peach, mango and pineapple flavors. There's so much more beyond fruit here though. A strike of lemon-lime acidity cuts through the palate, lending balance and vibe. The finish is long, accompanied by a delightfully astringent kick of lime zest. Drinks well now but should mature well through 2020.",91,Anthony Nappa 2013 Luminous Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"A powerful mix of Cabernet with 10% Petit Verdot, this soft, approachable wine reveals tightly wound layers of cassis, herb and sour cranberry. Dry tannins dominate on the palate and finish, suggesting a decant or airing beforehand.",89,Kenefick Ranch 2010 Chris's Cuvée Cabernet Sauvignon (Calistoga)
"This is the first reserve Malbec from Seven Hills, the winery that first introduced this as a varietal wine in the Walla Walla Valley. Inviting aromas of pepper, coffee, vanilla and cream introduce a dark and sappy wine, with concentrated raspberry and blackberry fruit at its core. Superb ripeness and lift from the juicy acidity mark this as indeed reserve-level in quality.",92,Seven Hills 2012 McClellan Estate Vineyard Reserve Malbec (Walla Walla Valley (OR))
"This is rich and surprisingly warm for the normally cool appellation of Pernand Vergelesses. It makes for an attractive, ripe and creamy wine that's been given a wood aging. But it doesn't have a sense of place.",85,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2012  Pernand-Vergelesses
"An unusual version of Pearl, this includes 9% Grenache Blanc and 5% Roussanne in the blend. Though it's labeled Sauvignon Blanc, those other grapes seem to command center stage, and the wine might as well be thought of as a creative white blend rather than a single variety. Pungent and herbal, it has well-knit and balanced green and yellow fruit flavors, with notes of caraway seed and grass.",88,Sparkman 2013 Pearl Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Feral aromas of leather, Middle Eastern spices and roasted berry fruits give way to a chunky, tannic yet somewhat flat palate. Flavors of jammy berry fruits are infiltrated by a green-herb note, while the finish holds onto the wine's funky, herbal character.",86,Ferré I Catasús 2012 Cap de Trons Red (Penedès)
"This is a bit thin, and mixes in a strong herbal dimension with the tart red fruit. The acids are proportionate, and the tannins carry some bitterness into the finish.",85,Wind Rose 2012 Harvest Moon Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley)
"A mellow, slightly herbal character pervades this plush-feeling and generous-tasting wine. Smelling ripe and fruity it is accented by savory spice aromas, and delivers warm plum and berry flavors.",86,Josh Cellars 2013 Legacy Red (California)
"Aromas of ripe black fruit, spicy plum, graphite and a whiff of brine lead the nose of this robust wine. The round, savory palate doles out juicy blackberry, blueberry, licorice and ground black pepper alongside brawny tannins. It ends on a bitter prune note.",88,Cantine Menhir 2011 Quota 31 Primitivo (Salento)
"Powerful tea and bergamot notes are fresh and orangey, balancing deeper, richer notes of toffee and honey. Long on the finish, and not overly sweet.",89,Stanton & Killeen NV Classic Tokay (Rutherglen)
"This wine opens with aromas of earthy funk, steak tartare, potpourri, pepper and earth, showing outrageously minerality. The flavors are dense and textured, leaning hard into the savory with abundant flower and fire pit notes that linger effortlessly. It's a very cerebral wine but with no shortage of hedonism.",95,Horsepower 2013 Sur Echalas Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Grenache is a terribly hard variety to make on its own. It's better used as a blender, which this wine proves. It's dry and silky, with one-dimensional cherry, blueberry and oak flavors. Drink now.",85,Unti 2007 Grenache (Dry Creek Valley)
"Rustic smelling at first, this is showing a fair amount of animal and leather on the nose. In the mouth, this is wiry and pointed, with crisp acidity. Angular currant and red plum flavors finish clean and juicy.",86,Bodega Calle 2012 Alberti Malbec (Luján de Cuyo)
"Dominated by 60% Cabernet Franc, with 37% Merlot and 3% Petit Verdot, this is a demonstration of elegance married with ripeness, offering rich, round, luxurious plum flavors alongside savory teases of clove, cigar and leather. Lengthy and smooth on the palate, it's a wine for the table, with length and breadth developing in the glass as it goes.",94,Young Inglewood 2012 Right Bank Blend Red (St. Helena)
"Antão Vaz and Arinto, two classic white varieties of Alentejo, are blended into this simple, fruity wine. Its acidity and citrus fruitiness have been given weight by lees stirring. The wine is crisp and lively, ready to drink now.",86,Monte da Ravasqueira 2016 Fonte da Serrana Branco White (Alentejano)
"This richly textured wine boasts incredible freshness, as well as complexity of flavor. Apple and citrus flavors show hints of development— secondary notes of toast and cookies. The acidity is still very present—a crisp reminder of its age worthiness. Drink through 2022",90,Nicolas Feuillatte 2006 Brut Millesimé  (Champagne)
"The grapes to make this rich, ripe wine were sourced from vines that were planted in the 1980s. The vineyard, which is located next to Bonnes Mares, yields wines that have an open, generous style, plus elements of structure that lend aging potential. Ready to drink in two years, but it should age well for many more.",92,Domaine Bruno Clair 2010 Les Véroilles  (Chambolle-Musigny)
"A youthful, bold Brunello with exotic spice, dark vanilla bean, leather, toasted oak and chestnut. Background tones include bramble, wild berry, blueberry and cola. Bright and firm on the finish.",90,La Palazzetta 2007  Brunello di Montalcino
"Compact and sturdy, this robust blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Merlot is relatively simple, yet satisfying. Bold cassis fruit joins with earthy, tobacco notes and hints of vanilla to finish with dry intensity and promising length. Drink 2015–2020.",90,Moss Wood 2010 Amy's Red (Margaret River)
This California-made Oregon Pinot captures a sense of the particular terroir of Chehalem Mountains fruit. Wild strawberries are laced with peppery spice and a streak of cola. Good penetration and texture.,88,Siduri 2008 Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"This fresh, enjoyable white has passion fruit, citrus and saline aromas and flavors. It's simple, with a clean, fresh finish.",85,Assuli 2015 Fiordiligi Grillo (Terre Siciliane)
"This opens with earthy aromas of leather, overripe black fruit, meat juice and a whiff of barnyard. The palate delivers mature plum, black cherry, loam and game alongside astringent tannins.",87,Lanciola 2011 Le Masse di Greve Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico)
"89-91 Barrel sample. A firm dry wine, its character dominated by its dense structure. The fruit is just one of the many elements in this concentrated wine.",90,Château de Rayne Vigneau 2008 Barrel sample  (Sauternes)
"This is a very slender, taut, fresh and citrus-focused Crémant with aromatic overtones of aloe vera, green apple and citrus foliage. Showing wonderful precision and balance, the slendern and fresh characters combine to make for a very invigorating, delicious drink.",90,Henri Schoenheitz 2011 Auxerrois (Crémant d'Alsace)
"This wine is made from grapes grown in the Lake Balaton region and has aromas of lemon blossom, vanilla and lemon curd, which lead the way to well-combined flavors of green apple, pear and pineapple. It is medium bodied on the palate with a clean finish.",89,St. Donat 2015 Márga Furmint
"The fruit of this Pinot Noir is fantastically ripe, a testament to the California sun and the long growing season of the Santa Lucia Highlands. The wine is enormous in raspberries and cherries that are jammy, yet finish dry. The acidity also is notable, cutting the richness with citrusy tartness that may limit ageability. Drink now–2016.",88,Furthermore 2010 Sierra Mar Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Aromas of new leather and menthol segue into the brooding palate along with dried cherry and a note of medicinal herb. It's tightly tannic, with a lean astringent finish.",86,Viberti 2015  Dolcetto d'Alba Superiore
This is a ripe and juicy wine that is full of fresh white fruit tones on the nose. It has ripe yellow fruits along with crisp lemon and a touch of minerality. The wine is ready to drink.,86,Quinta dos Murças 2014 Assobio Branco White (Douro)
"This unusual Walla Walla Valley-designated Sangiovese offers notes of vanilla, coffee and cranberry. It brings a rich, textured mouthfeel full of sweet cherry and plum flavors backed by a light grip of tannins. It doesn't seem varietally correct but it's undeniably delicious.",88,Genoa 2012 Danger Buoy Sangiovese (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Sweet spices and fresh raspberry flavors combine with a lightly tannic and lively texture in this medium-bodied wine. It's lighter, fresher and a touch more crisp and tangy than a typical Merlot or Cabernet.",87,McManis 2015 Petit Verdot (California)
"This alluring rosé sparkler has a heady fragrance of wild flowers and pressed, white roses. The palate is focused and precise, delivering creamy strawberry, white cherry and pink grapefruit flavors, along with a fine perlage.",90,Le Marchesine 2008 Rosé Millesimato Sparkling (Franciacorta)
"This wine is 73% Cabernet Sauvignon and a whopping 27% Petit Verdot, with the fruit coming from Yellow Bird and Tokar vineyards. Brooding aromas of freshly tilled soil, dried flowers, herbs and cherry lead to a richly flavored but well-balanced palate. It should age well.",91,Tulpen 2010 Coalescence Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Good, deep flavors of blackberries, currants and spices mark this dry wine. It has a coating of smoky new oak. The texture is a bit harsh, which is really its only minus. Otherwise, it's a nice Merlot to drink now.",87,Starmont 2009 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Herb and citrus aromas lead to lightly spritzy, just off-dry tropical fruit flavors that linger.",87,Ancestry 2014 Réjouissant Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Slight smoke surrounds the citric acidity, the palate comes together in a pairing of bright acidity and pleasingly bitter phenolics, yet there is nothing heavy - despite some alcoholic heat. This wears its sophistication very lightly and will age beautifully.",92,Felsner 2013 Alte Reben DAC Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"Gassy, bready apple aromas are dull and unfocused. This is flat in texture, with a low bubble bead. Flavors of yellow mustard, rhubarb and apple finish briny.",82,Torre Oria NV Brut Nature Vintage Sparkling (Cava)
"A wine made entirely from Pinot Meunier is unusual. This perfumed wine with its soft acidity and open fruitiness suggests there should be more. It's an easy, apple and ripe pear flavored wine with acidity that gives everything an attractive lift.",89,H. Blin NV Blanc de Noirs Brut Pinot Meunier (Champagne)
"The aromas bring light notes of corn husk and apple. This wine is broad in feel, with a lightly creamy texture full of roasted-corn flavors.",86,Desert Wind 2016 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Wahluke Slope)
"This wine is an interesting journey from sniff to sip. Aromas of condensed pomegranate, hibiscus and red plum are lifted by crushed slate, light clove, marjoram and a whiff of smoke. Full flavors of red plum and cranberry start the palate, then come waves of herbaceous oregano, thyme and pepper, before the red fruit returns toward the finish.",92,McIntyre Vineyards 2014 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Made from grapes grown in a coastal, cool-climate vineyard, this Chardonnay is gracefully minerally and acidic. It has all the tart, wet-stone tang you could want, along with intense quince, golden mango and Asian pear fruitiness. This lovely wine is worth every cent of its price.",93,Fort Ross 2011 Fort Ross Vineyard Chardonnay (Fort Ross-Seaview)
"This is a blend of two-thirds Merlot topped off with Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot. Mocha, raspberry and high-toned herb and spice aromas lead to elegant yet rich and well-balanced fruit flavors. It's a delight.",91,Brian Carter Cellars 2011 Le Coursier Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Aromas of freshly picked roses, vanilla and peach entice you into this Moldovan sparkling wine made from Muscat. There are flavors of dried apricot and honeydew melon with a slightly sweet finish.",83,Lion-Gri 2015 Château d'Or Sparkling White Muscat (Moldova)
"Very ripe, in the manner of this spectacular vintage, showing a blast of cherry pie filling, black raspberry tart, cola and smoky oak flavors. The acidity is firm and clean. Feels juvenile, with a jamminess that a few years in the cellar should resolve.",89,Freeman 2007 Akiko's Cuvée Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"A fine Chardonnay, creamy, flavorful and complex. It's as soft as buttercream, yet a vital streak of acidity brightens the tropical fruit and vanilla richness. Showcases the Santa Rita Hills in a good, cool vintage.",90,Lincourt 2009 Courtney's Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Gentle notes of Damask rose and honeysuckle shimmer teasingly above a balanced, just off-dry palate that features orange peel, juicy yellow peach and nectarine. This wine offers a charming but not overpowering and nicely balanced rendition of this grape.",90,Paul Blanck 2015 Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"The aromas are attractively fresh, while the palate is more towards full, fat fruits. So the green perfume gives way to melon and pear only just touched by citrus acidity. Treat this as a food wine, not an apèritif. This wine was formerly sold under the Cockburn Port brand.",84,Symington Family Estates 2007 Tuella White (Douro)
"Anise, barrel spice, clove, vanilla and plum scents lead to full-bodied fruit and barrel flavors in this wine. It shows some warmth on the finish, with lingering purple fruit and pepper notes.",88,Milbrandt 2014 Ravenscliff Vineyard Malbec (Wahluke Slope)
"This wine is 67% Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest equal parts Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. It's aromatic and fruit-forward, offering red plum, herbs, milk chocolate and floral accents. The fruit flavors are rich and focused, showing great depth and intensity with a palate-coating feel.",93,Sparkman 2012 Stella Mae Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This tight, focused wine offers strawberry and raspberry fruit, aged in one-third new French oak. The oak is barely evident, but the fruit-centric wine shows good structure and medium concentration.",90,Lange 2014 Yamhill-Carlton Assemblage Pinot Noir
"This rich, structured wine is made from 100% Niellucciu (Sangiovese) from a nine acre estate. Its black cherry flavors are bolstered by plenty of firm tannins and concentration, and its richness and density are now at peak maturity, so drink now.",90,Clos Alivu 2015 Nielluciu (Patrimonio)
"This blend of 60% Gamay, 28% Cabernet Franc and 12% Pinot Noir, sourced from widely separate vineyards throughout Oregon, is a surprising success. The flavors are ripe, recalling sweet mulberry and blackberry, and the polished tannins wrap it up nicely. Drink up.",90,Sidecar 2015 G-Force Red (Oregon)
"This Chardonnay wants time to warm and breathe in the glass, so don't pour it right from the fridge. After a little while it develops considerably in generosity, offering waves of tropical fruits, peaches and pears. The oak is pretty strong, even jarring. Give it a few years in the cellars to let everything knit together.",87,B Cellars 2011 Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"With juicy acidity and tart flavors of cranberries and sour-cherry candy, this is a Pinot Noir to drink now. It's dry and a little austere, but rich beef and lamb dishes will coax out the fruit.",88,Seagrape 2010 Jump Up Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Blocky and tart, this shows little of the flower or delicate citrus notes that many Oregon Rieslings convey. The clean apple flavor makes it good for summer picnics.",85,Foris 2010 Riesling (Rogue Valley)
"Enticing aromas of chopped herbs, wild flowers and white stone fruit float out of the glass. The refined, focused palate offers white peach, pear, grapefruit and pineapple alongside zesty acidity and tiny, persistent bubbles.",90,Bortolin Angelo 2014 Sommaval Rive di Guia  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"This opens with muted aromas that recall blackberry, violet, dark spice and leather. The chewy palate offers ripe plum, espresso and almond accompanied by robust tannins. Drink through 2018.",88,Baron di Pauli 2011 Carano Riserva Lagrein (Alto Adige)
"Ripe yet understated notes of white current, golden fig, apricot and graham cracker prove this Chardonnay's discernable depth. Medium to full bodied, this wine feels luscious, and its toasty flavor and energetic acidity will match grilled arctic char.",88,The Williamsburg Winery 2010 Vintage Reserve Chardonnay (Virginia)
"Juicy currant, cherry and a thickness of toffee makes for a full-bodied, densely rich and ripe reserve wine, dusty and fully extracted.",88,DeLorimier 2013 Crazy Creek Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"This is surprisingly tough and tannic for a wine that incorporates 8% of a white variety. But those mouth-drying tannins give shape to the cassis, cranberry and black olive notes. Take a chance by cellaring this rather austere wine for five years or so and see how it develops.",90,D'Arenberg 2009 The Wild Pixie Shiraz-Roussanne (McLaren Vale)
"Elusive aromatically, this wine begins to show hints of violet and rose as it opens, comforting whiffs that ride over powerfully, pillowy tannins. Savory in style, and fairly light bodied, it's a round, soft wine with a lot of juicy red cherry.",86,Virginia Dare 2014 American Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"A powerful specimen that plows straight ahead on the bouquet, dealing out whiffs of rubber, smoke and hickory along the way. Meaty feeling and deep, with roasted blackberry, woodspice and bitter chocolate flavors. Dark and chocolaty on the finish, with a note of bacon.",88,Pagos del Moncayo 2009 Garnacha (Campo de Borja)
"This totally fresh wine has benefited from the quality of whites in 2007 Bordeaux. It is lemony with pink grapefruit flavors giving an intense lift. There is some herbaceousness, with green herbs and juicy fruits. To drink now.",85,Yvon Mau 2007 Premius Bordeaux Sauvignon  (Bordeaux Blanc)
"Starts off fine, with rich blackberry and black currant aromas and flavors. But once you take a sip, the wine turns sharp and unbalanced. Still, it's a perfectly decent sipper for everyday fare.",84,Shenanigans 2007 Fine Irish Cab Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi)
"Really delicious, a sweet, spicy, fruity wine that's like biting into a raspberry, roasted almond, vanilla and cinnamon granola candy bar. That's no insult. The wine is dry and wonderfully rich in smooth tannins, and enormously complex. Worthy of very fine steak, lamb, tuna and salmon entrees.",93,Testarossa 2009 Sierra Madre Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"The nose is rich with Red Delicious apple notes. The palate adds lemon freshness and a tangy, slightly bitter but appetizing streak of zestiness. The finish is restrained, just dry and clean.",89,Domaine G. Metz 2015 Cuvée Melody Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"A touch of reduction still clings to the citrus and pear notes of this clean-cut wine. The palate fill out with notes of citrus and green, freshly cut Conference pear—it has juicy concentration and provides a lip-smacking finish.",90,Forstreiter 2015 Kremser Kogl Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"With five years' bottle aging, this Champagne is just beginning to show some attractive signs of maturity. The toasty aroma is followed through on the palate and this toastiness has softened the tight mineral texture of the wine. Drink this balanced wine now.",91,Joseph Perrier NV Cuvée Royale Brut Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (Champagne)
"From 100-plus-year-old Carignane vines, with splashes of Grenache, too, this is a refreshing wine for spring and summer. Stony in grapefruit and peach, it's balanced, light and dry with a fruity kick.",90,McCay Cellars 2012 Rosé (Lodi)
"Initial woody aromas evolve in the glass to show perfume, raisiny ripeness and spice notes. In the mouth, this delivers a crunchy, tannic feel and vibrant acidity. Plum, raspberry, baking spice and earthy flavors end with oaky vanilla notes offset by baked berry, cassis and rooty flavors. Drink through 2020.",91,Garage Wine Co. 2011 Lot #36 Maipo Alto Cabernet Franc (Maipo Valley)
"A quirky blend of six wildly-different white grapes, this has some sweet fruit, some bitter phenolics, and a noticeable honeyed character, suggesting that there was some botrytis in the mix. Rich and loaded with flavors of lemon curd, apricot and ripe peaches, it's a creative, interesting wine, worth exploring at this price.",88,Patterson 2012 Forbidden White (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Stainless-steel fermented and the color of wheat, this still white wine is stylish and compelling. If you've wondered why anyone would bother to make a white Pinot Noir, this is the answer. It's fragrant with sweet grass and melon, then the flavors follow along with grapefruit and kiwi.",91,Ghost Hill 2011 Bayliss-Bower Vineyard Blanc Pinot Noir
"Rujari is a hearty blend of Nero d'Avola, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon that opens with a dark, inky appearance and heavy aromas of ripe blackberry, cherry jam, cola and black licorice. The wine imparts a thick but slightly sour feel on the close.",87,Cantine Rallo 2008 Rujari Red (Sicilia)
"On the nose, layers range from fragrant and floral jasmine to mango sorbet, and ripe nectarine to oven-fresh croissants. The mouthfeel is creamy, with stone fruit and banana flavors. Zingy acidity powers a long finish.",92,Windstream 2012 Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"The aromas are light, with notes of toast, char, apple, lees and spice. The palate is on the lighter side of medium bodied with a lightly creamy feel. It's a straightforward easy drinker where the variety is unmistakable.",87,Guardian 2015 Newsprint Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Aromas of coconut, espresso and spiced plum steeped in spirits lead the nose on this full-bodied red. The bold palate delivers oak extract, dried black cherry, sweet vanilla and roasted coffee bean, with bracing tannins.",88,Tormaresca 2010 Bocca di Lupo Aglianico (Castel del Monte)
"Brambly, lightly herbal aromas of berry fruit, sugar beet and a touch of chemical precede a wiry, narrow palate with briary flavors of herbal berry and cassis. A tannic, crimped finish is rugged and houses cherry flavors and heat.",85,Tierras Guindas 2011  Toro
"This vineyard was planted specifically for the No Girls project. The wine is fresh, fragrant and intensely floral, with a mix of rosewater and orange zest. Elegant, with a delicate, lacy texture, the flavors are savory and salty, braced with stiff, lightly peppery tannins. Notes of funk and mushroom come into play as it finishes gracefully and with unexpected length.",95,No Girls 2011 La Paciencia Vineyard Grenache (Walla Walla Valley (OR))
"Ripe pear, peach and a wild-thyme-scented edge play on nose. They continue on the slender, focused palate into a long trajectory of flavor that remains dry and refreshing throughout.",92,Proidl 2012 Senftenberger Ehrenfels Reserve Riesling (Kremstal)
"Aromas of hay, tomato leaf and medicinal herb lead the nose and follow over to the racy palate together with grapefruit, lemon drop and mineral. It's linear, with bracing acidity.",87,Borgo Conventi 2014 Sauvignon (Collio)
"Gritty, tarry aromas are front and center on a hard bouquet. This Crianza feels brutally tannic. Gritty flavors of burnt berry and road tar reflect the nose, while this tastes like blackened creosote on a rough finish.",85,Val de Los Frailes 2010 Crianza Tempranillo (Cigales)
"From one of the best producers in the little-traveled region of Molise on Italy's Adriatic flank, this wine shows the far reaches of the Aglianico grape in southern Italy. This expression shows bright fruit tones of blackberry and cherry, backed by velvety tannins.",88,Di Majo Norante 2010 Contado Riserva Aglianico (Molise)
"There's a ton of inviting baking spices on the nose of this bottling, from crushed clove to nutmeg, as well as lushly stewed strawberries, bacon fat and purple flowers. It's rich and thick once sipped, certainly not a dainty wine, with baked black cherry and mace spice flavors proving hearty and delicious.",91,House Family Vineyards 2013 Pinot Noir (Monterey County)
This zesty wine opens with aromas of peach and exotic fruit with a whiff of mineral. The palate offers sweet tropical fruit and nectarine with a hint of spice alongside racy acidity.,87,Cantina Valle Isarco 2012 Aristos Kerner (Alto Adige Valle Isarco)
"Saffredi is a beautiful wine, worthy of membership in an elite class of super Tuscan wines from Italy. The blend is Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Alicante and a tiny percentage of Syrah and the overall result is that of plushness, softness and intensity. Aromas include spice, chocolate, blackberry and cherry.",94,Fattoria Le Pupille 2005 Saffredi  (Maremma)
"This is classic Washington Merlot, with flesh and a full-bodied middle. It offers a generous palate of cherries and berries, trailing into light tannins with a streak of green tea and coffee. The wine is balanced and bright, with lightly lifted aromas and a solid midpalate.",88,Camaraderie 2003 Merlot (Washington)
"Made entirely from organically grown Sangiovese, this opens with red plum, new leather and underbrush aromas. The full-bodied palate delivers crushed raspberry, black cherry, pipe tobacco and a hint of black pepper, with polished tannins providing backbone. Drink through 2022.",92,I Veroni 2013 Riserva  (Chianti Rufina)
"Smooth and ripe, this is a warm Grüner. It has white fruits, a delicious creamy texture, and a citrus finish. The wine is ready to drink, but could improve after a year. Screwcap.",88,Laurenz V. 2012 Charming Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"This single-vineyard Zin is a considerable improvement over the ‘04. The alcohol in the ‘05 is far lower, almost a full percent, yielding a more balanced and harmonious wine. But it's hardly shy. It's powerful in wild blackberry, cassis, raspberry, root beer, tangerine, chocolate and sweet thyme, while the tannic structure is rich enough to warrant bottle aging for a decade.",92,Williams Selyem 2005 Forchini Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"Chevalier's second white wine reflects some of the glory of the first. It has a Sauvignon-dominated flavor, certainly with herbaceousness. But the fruit is ripe, full in the mouth, a teasing combination of green fruits, kiwi fruit and wonderful juiciness. With its edge of minerality, it could age for 2–3 years.",91,Domaine de Chevalier 2007 L'Esprit de Chevalier  (Pessac-Léognan)
"87-89 Barrel sample. Minty aromas give lifted smooth fruit, with an edge of caramel toast. That sweetness seems to cut through the fruit, leaving the fresh acidity behind.",88,Château Haut-Sarpe 2008 Barrel sample  (Saint-Émilion)
"In the southern section of the Haut-Médoc, close to Margaux, this estate has produced a fresh, fruity wine. A high proportion (11%) of Petit Verdot gives it color and also a ripe juicy character. Blackberries and young tannins dominate at the moment. Drink from 2018.",87,Château Meyre 2013  Haut-Médoc
"Black fruit aromas feature a touch of licorice. Feels lively and alert, with edgy acids and juicy, forward flavors of plum and wild berry. Toasty, integrated and spicy on the finish, with pinches of green and black pepper.",87,Terrazas de Los Andes 2009 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza)
"This is a dark, drily tannic young Syrah whose blackberry, currant and pepper flavors are compromised by less ripe, minty tastes. It's so close to being a really nice wine, until that greenness kicks in. Drink now.",84,Myriad Cellars 2006 Las Madres Vineyard Syrah (Carneros)
"Searching for New World Chardonnay that's restrained, crisp and only 12% abv? Steve Webber at De Bortoli is your man. This medium-bodied Chardonnay displays a hint of custard to its texture, while the flavors are citrus driven and refreshing.",87,De Bortoli 2008 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Yarra Valley)
This opens with a delicate fragrance of white flower and tropical fruit. The easygoing palate offers green apple and Bartlett pear alongside crisp acidity.,86,Santa Sofia 2014  Lugana
"Lemon balm, peppery arugula and yeasty savoriness combine into a sleek, streamlined wine that goes down all too easily—notwithstanding its wonderful layers and length. The lemony finish lasts and refreshes.",90,Dürnberg 2013 Tradition Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"This new offering from the sparkling wine producer reveals strongly crafted layers of creamy apple pie, crème brûlée and toasty oak flavors. Made in a full-bodied, concentrated style, it doesn't hold back on its spicy acidity and lemony finish.",90,WindVane 2015 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Carneros)
"A blend of fruit from three Rogue Valley sites, this is a fine example of the style of Pinot made in Southern Oregon. The estate vineyard sits at 2,100 feet on a steep, east-facing slope, with densely planted vines. It's a big, blocky, full-bodied wine, loaded with flavors of black cherry, black coffee and barrel toast. Tannins are substantial, but the flavors are full and forward. What it lacks in elegance it makes up for in immediate likeability.",89,Irvine Family Vineyards 2012 Pinot Noir (Oregon)
"Heavy new wood influence gives a creamy, toasty palate, the fruit lying under this smooth surface. It is juicy, packed with firm tannins. It will take several years for the wine to properly integrate.",91,Château Troplong Mondot 2008  Saint-Émilion
"Aromas of blackberries are set against freshly milled cedar, dried flowers, chopped herbs and a bit of iron. Oregano and thyme lead the palate, with slightly sour boysenberry fruit as well as espresso, dark chocolate and camphor, leaning on herbs more than ripe fruit.",92,Martin Ranch 2011 J.D. Hurley Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Made with 70% Pinot Nero and 30% Chardonnay, this salmon-colored sparkler opens with aromas of woodland berries, pastry cream and baking spices. The palate offers mature yellow apple, grapefruit and white pepper alongside a fine perlage and bright acidity.",90,Il Mosnel 2008 Parosé Sparkling (Franciacorta)
"Still very young and austere, this should blossom into a beauty. Aromas of leather, red berry, licorice, menthol and a balsamic note carry through to the vibrant, structured palate along with intense mineral. Assertive, fine-grained tannins and brisk acidity provide an age-worthy framework. Don't even attempt this before 2020. Giuliana Imports, PDX Wine.",93,Antoniolo 2010 Osso San Grato  (Gattinara)
"This blend of 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 17% Syrah, 8% Petit Verdot and 3% Cabernet Franc offers plummy chocolate and leather notes and dense, layered tannins. Toasty oak adds to the concentration and body, before a lift of acidity closes out the finish. This wine is available in three Halloween-themed labels all created for Flora Springs by CD-cover artist Wes Freed.",91,Flora Springs 2013 Ghost Winery Red (Napa Valley)
"On the sweet side, this light and fresh wine hails from a single vineyard. It has spice and attractive apple acidity, plus a crisp side at the end. This is a bright wine to drink now.",85,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2013 Pfleck Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Le Ellere is a straightforward Chianti Classico that shows characteristic Sangiovese aromas of wild berry, wet earth and blue flower backed by subtle touches of spice, Spanish cedar and tobacco. The mouthfeel is bright and compact with balanced acidity on the close.",88,Castello d'Albola 2009 Le Ellere  (Chianti Classico)
"From a vineyard at 1,100 feet elevation in the southern part of the appellation, this bottling shows light and lively raspberry, plum, white pepper, fennel and damp herb aromas. The palate abounds with red fruit, well-woven acidity and layers of herbs. A raspberry jam note pops on the finish.",94,Comartin 2015 R-Bar-R Ranch Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"The beauty of Krug's rosé is the sense of bottle age, of that extra richness. That means the wine is not just the sum of its delicious red berry fruits. It's also the way the wine is rounded out, filled with secondary flavors, toast and almonds and a taut minerality. The aftertaste is taut, dry, seamless, complex.",94,Krug NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne)
"Fresh and light in aroma, crisp and delicate in flavor, this wine is light-bodied, well-balanced and attractively restrained in character. Because of all that it will be extremely versatile with food—everything from shucked oysters to Thai food to smoked salmon.",90,Oak Farm 2015 Mohr-Fry Ranches Sauvignon Blanc (Lodi)
"Seems heavy on the American oak, displaying lactic, dill-laden aromatics that partially mute the berry fruit underneath. Still, the tart berries come through on the finish—a good sign for the future. Give it a couple of years in the cellar to come together. —J.C.",87,Wynns Coonawarra Estate 2000 Shiraz (Coonawarra)
"Light orange-pink in color, this wine is boosted by 2% Syrah, 1% Mourvèdre and 1% Grenache Blanc. It shows squeezed lime and pressed watermelon on the nose, proving quite Provencal in style. The cotton-candy palate is lifted by citrus pith, proving tightly wound while quite mouthwatering.",89,J. Lohr 2013 Gesture Rosé of Grenache (Paso Robles)
"Smoked meats, concentrated blackberrry and blueberry and a heavily peppered spice character shows on the nose of this bottling, with some dark chocolate for good measure. The tasty smoke invades the palate too, but there's also gingerbread cake, baked black plum, cocoa and baking spices. It offers solid acidity and decent structure too.",91,Ancient Peaks 2013 Zinfandel (Santa Margarita Ranch)
"This is an expressive Barossa Shiraz, combining ripe raspberry fruit and a lush, creamy texture with herbal, savory notes and crisp acidity. Turns a bit zingy on the finish, with cranberry overtones. Drink now–2015.",90,Butting Heads 2005 Shiraz (Barossa Valley)
"Vanilla, baking spice, cranberry and cherry aromas lead to soft, medium-bodied fruit flavors with an elegant styling. It's a very pretty representation of the vintage with good balance.",89,Market Vineyards 2011 Arbitrage Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This Merlot smells rooty, with licorice and mint to boot. A wide, sort of flabby palate is, at its base, oaky as can be; there's also stewed plum and herbal blackberry flavors in front of a blocky, chunky finish.",86,Montes 2011 Alpha Merlot (Colchagua Valley)
"Zesty lime skins meld with sweet honey and yellow florals on the nose of this semisweet Riesling. It's gorgeously concentrated yet elegant with a sheer, minerally midpalate and a hint of spice on the finish.",87,Red Newt Cellars 2009 Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Friendly, earthy scents of buttercups and dandelions make appearances here. The palate follows with brisk, clean freshness and zingy, lemony appeal. It finishes dry, shot through with zesty freshness.",89,Koenig 2014 Riesling (Alsace)
"Like the label says, this Gewürz is off-dry, with sugary flavors of pineapples, apricots, green apples, papayas and Asian spices. It's uncomplicated and clean.",85,Stein Family 2009 Semi-Dry Gewürztraminer (Carneros)
"An herbal Sauvignon that is fresh and on the lean side. The flavors are of crisp green apples, very fruity, with a structure of lime zest and vivid acidity on the finish. Screwcap.",86,Domaine du Tariquet 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de Pays des Côtes de Gascogne)
"Bread and lemon, rather than primary fruit, denotes the scent. The dry and restrained palate is serious and values yeasty autolytic notes above fruit. There is lemon freshness among the yeast and bread flavors and a dry, almost severe finish.",88,Arthur Metz NV Brut Prestige Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"This easygoing white starts with a fresh nose of grapefruit, fig and flowers and leads into zesty but complex flavors of tropical fruit and citrus. Approachable and balanced, the wine will pair well with seafood and chicken dishes.",88,Rietvallei Estate Wine 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Robertson)
"Focused and bright, this northern Italian Pinot Bianco shows intense aromas of stone fruit and white rose. The mouthfeel, however, is what sets it apart thanks to the beautiful balance between its crisp acidity and that touch of sweet softness at the back.",88,Andriano 2011 Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
"This is a concentrated wine that is packed with black fruits. The tannins are a support to the rich juicy flavor and the fine acidity. Coming from vineyards on the plateau to the north of the Douro river, the wine has a cool edge of freshness at the end.",92,Secret Spot Wines 2013 Vale da Poupa Reserva Field Blend Red (Douro)
"This plush, rich expression of Pinot Grigio from northeast Italy would pair with white meat, seafood risotto or spicy dishes from the Far East. The mouthfeel is smooth, rich and long-lasting.",90,Lis Neris 2008 Gris Pinot Grigio (Friuli Isonzo)
"This is a solid Verdejo with stony aromas of citrus fruits, grapefruit in particular. A palate with citric acidity creates a fresh platform for orange and grapefruit flavors. A round plump finish with briny citrus flavors is a good ending.",87,Marqués de Irún 2014 Verdejo (Rueda)
"The 2010 Select is a step ahead of Torii Mor's single vineyard offerings, but holds to the common thread of hard, tart, tight wines with little flesh on their bones. Here the raspberry and strawberry fruit pokes through the herbs and tannins enough to warrant drinking sooner while waiting for the others to (possibly) soften up.",87,Torii Mor 2010 Dundee Hills Select Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
Simaens has produced a ripe style of wine here. Apple and rich citrus flavors add a delicious touch to tropical fruit flavors. This wine is fit for drinking in the next few months.,87,Borges 2011 Quinta de Simaens White (Vinho Verde)
"This selection is from Terravant Wine Company, a custom-crush facility in Santa Barbara County. Dry and tannic, it shows classic Cabernet Sauvignon character. It has a smoothness often associated with Napa Valley wines and flavors of blackberry, black currant and oak.",90,Barrel Ranch 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Aromas of mature plum, blackberry, toasted oak and vanilla carry over to the palate along with coffee and espresso. Raspy wood tannins give an astringent finish.",87,Moccagatta 2011 Basarin  (Barbaresco)
"From one of the most esteemed vineyards in the denomination, this features aromas of oak, toast, black berry and a whiff of rubber. The palate offers plum, black cherry, roasted coffee bean, spearmint and vanilla alongside bracing tannins.",89,Ceretto 2011 Asili  (Barbaresco)
"This Nero d'Avola opens with aromas of burned rubber and ripe black fruit. The palate shows dense blackberry extract along with espresso, toasted flavors and very evident alcohol. It finishes on an astringent, drying note of wood.",85,Morgante 2011 Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"A rich wine that takes time to show its structure, starting with blackberry fruits, then revealing firm, closed tannins. The wine is a blend of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz, giving off power and complexity.",90,Quinta da Nespereira 2008 Vineaticu Red (Dão)
"This brooding red opens with aromas of dried plum, espresso, toast and dark spice. The palate shows the heat of the vintage, offering dried black cherry, fig and a licorice note alongside bracing tannins. Give the tannins another year or two to soften then drink up to capture the remaining fruit.",88,Re Manfredi 2011  Aglianico del Vulture
"Ripe grapefruit aromas take care of the nose, while the palate shows smooth-edged citrus and grapefruit flavors. For a warm-vintage wine, this one is holding in pretty well; it has a plump body but enough liveliness to do what it should with food. Drink now; it's not getting any better.",87,Aura 2006 Verdejo (Rueda)
"Plump and aromatically subdued with a touch of residual sweetness (halbtrocken), this shows some midpalate concentration and provides some citrusy refreshment.",85,Lenikus 2012 Der Reisenberg Halbtrocken Riesling (Vienna)
"Fresh apple, pear and lemon-skin notes mark this pleasantly perfumed dry Silvaner. It's dry and lushly textured, with delicate flavors of green apple, lemon and lime along, with a distinctly dusty minerality that lingers on the finish.",87,Castell 2012 Schloss Trocken Silvaner (Franken)
"A very rich wine, spicy and complex. Dark fruits, rich tannins and layers of berries, exuding power and density. There is a sense of fine tannin as well, suspended in the texture of the wine. Firm and solid and with a great aging potential. Drink from 2019.",93,Château de Chambert 2010 Grand Vin Malbec (Cahors)
"Soft and tenderly fragrant fruit hovers above a palate dominated by Golden Delicious apple flavors and an almost soy-like, savory edge that makes you want to drink more. A seam of lemony freshness brightens up everything and lasts well after the last sip. This is a truly lovely, understated Riesling.",91,Henri Schoenheitz 2014 Riesling (Alsace)
"Blue flower, tilled soil, leather, blackberry, licorice and black pepper sensations all come together in this vibrant, straightforward Aglianico. The dense, juicy palate is framed by tightly woven, brooding tannins and a vein of mineral.",89,Taverna 2010  Aglianico del Vulture
"This copper-colored wine, the result of extended contact between the just-pressed juice and the grape skins, opens with pretty aromas of wildflower, stone fruit and an herbal note. The savory palate delivers juicy apple, peach, pink grapefruit and a mineral accent alongside zesty acidity.",89,Attems 2013 Ramato Pinot Grigio (Venezia Giulia)
"Delicate blossom and fresh apple notes are pretty on the nose. The palate is a bit bracing by comparison, offering tart lemon-lime flavors and a touch of earthiness on the finish. Drink now.",85,J.R. Dill 2016 Dry Riesling (Seneca Lake)
"Sharp and simple, with a great big burst of fruit and a hot, Porty mouthfeel. A rustic blend of several varieties.",82,Adastra 2008 Ed's Red Red (California)
"Initially this smells toasty to the point of charred, but with airing the nose settles on oak, black fruit and lightly stemmy red-berry scents. This feels full and good, with resolved tannins that don't bite. Flavors of black fruits and coconut oak finish strong and deep. This can last until 2025, maybe longer.",90,Bodegas Corral 2008 Altos de Corral Barrel Fermented  (Rioja)
"Ripe, soft and creamy smooth, this Chard has polished flavors of pineapple jam, vanilla, pears, apple butter, honey and cinnamon.",86,Matanzas Creek 2006 Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley)
"Leather, raisin, earth and lightly baked berry aromas precede a woody, vanilla-infused palate with blackberry and spicecake flavors. Balanced and lively on the tongue, with a dry, barrel-spiced finish. Solid and appealing, but a little oaky.",88,Errazuriz 2009 Single Vineyard Don Maximiano Estate Carmenère (Aconcagua Valley)
"This brawny blend of 90% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot offers subdued aromas of raisin, black currant, bell pepper and a whiff of menthol. The evolved palate offers toast, coffee and hints of dried black fruit alongside the warmth of evident alcohol.",87,Campo al Mare 2011 Baia al Vento  (Bolgheri Superiore)
"An off-dry, organically farmed, 100%-varietal wine, this tiny production offering comes from an appellation better known for other varieties, but that shows finesse here. Fruity and balanced, the sweetness comes mostly in aromatic form, with a bouquet of pungent white flowers. Medium bodied, it shows an abundance of lithe fruit, finishing with a powerful kick of minerality.",88,Casa Nuestra 2014 Old Vines Riesling (St. Helena)
"Rose petals, iron, turned earth, slate, hot dirt and black plums show on the nose of this bottling by Kathy Joseph. Thick flavors of black cherry paste, rose hips, rose water and a floral potpourri blend into turned soil, black tea and juniper notes. Firm tannins indicate this will age well, but still needs a little time to reach full potential.",91,Fiddlehead 2012 Seven Twenty Eight Fiddlestix Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"With waves of raspberry, cherry, honeyed cream, cinnamon and caramelized oak flavors, this defines the word delicious. The richness is balanced by crisp acidity and delicate tannins. Just superb to drink now; try pairing it with lamb that's been salted and peppered, seasoned with a hint of rosemary.",93,Davis Family 2009 Starr Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Made by Aaron Pott from a 600-foot elevation site, this is a crisp and quite floral wine. It's rich and concentrated on the palate, with a lemony overlay of zesty acidity. Nutmeg and vanilla pierce the finish, providing a warmth to the wine.",91,Maisonry 2013 Scopus Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Mountain)
"This variety is still a rarity in the state. Barrel aromas are out front, with notes of vanilla and coffee followed by herbs. The flavors are elegant, with a tart lick of acidity, but bring a stewed element that distracts.",86,Bunnell 2011 Souzao (Snipes Mountain)
"Claiming, with some pride, to have the longest chateau name in Bordeaux, this estate on the plateau of Saint-Émilion, close to Château Figeac, has given a 2014 that is dense, juicy and with great fruit. The tannins and the fruit are balanced with the blackberry flavors supported by the dry core. Drink from 2022.",92,Château Grand Barrail Lamarzelle Figeac 2014  Saint-Émilion
"Scents of apple blossom, pear and honeycomb waft from this aromatic Pinot Blanc. Medium bodied in style, it's refreshingly tart with tangerine acidity balanced by fresh apple and pear flavors. Effortlessly quaffable.",87,Heron Hill 2011 Morris Vineyard Pinot Blanc (Finger Lakes)
"Always the standout in a crowd, Punset (organic and biodynamic growers in Barbaresco) presents an elegant and austere Riserva. Aromas here include wet stone and green herbs, rosemary or wild sage, followed by taut density and tight tannins. Let this wine age 5–10 more years.",91,Punset 2006 Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"Barrel notes of toast, butterscotch and spice are at the fore along with melted butter and peach on this 100% Canyon Vineyard Ranch wine. It's full bodied with a rich, creamy feel, wanting a bit more concentration and acidity to keep it together.",87,Waterbrook 2012 Reserve Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A lovely, aromatic nose of flowers, fresh white fruits and citrus leads this delicate white. Crisp acidity and a touch of richness give the wine both complexity and a food-friendly edge. Pair with richer seafood dishes or enjoy this one alone.",87,Tsantali 2008 Kanenas Maronia Vineyards White (Ismarikos)
"A spicy, ripe wine that is part of the second line from Quinta de la Rosa. With its rich tannins, fine layers of acidity and sweet berry fruit, it is already drinkable. Give it 2–3 years and it will develop beyond its just fruity stage.",88,Quinta de la Rosa 2011 DouRosa Red (Douro)
"This Bordeaux-style blend is bone dry and scented strongly with dried leaves, earth and herbs. The lightly-ripened fruit suggests pomegranate and rhubarb.",86,Cairdeas 2011 Consonance Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Made entirely from Sangiovese, this displays a floral fragrance that recalls violet and iris accompanied by notes of crushed red berries. The straightforward palate offers juicy black cherry and chocolate notes alongside firm tannins. The Marchetto Company, Imports Inc., Pio Imports.",88,Villa Calcinaia 2010 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"Zippy and fruity, bursting with bright, palate-cleansing grapefruit and citrus, this excellent effort is further bolstered by bracing minerality and a barely perceptible hint of sweetness. All in all a thrilling ride on the Oregon Pinot Gris roller coaster.",91,Soléna 2010 Pinot Gris (Oregon)
"For those who love a big, oaky Chardonnay, this is for you. It's raw, blocky and rough, but there is plenty of fresh oak flavor, and time should integrate the wood into the clean and straightforward green apple flavor.",87,Three Rivers 2010 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a fluid, fruit-laden, well-balanced blend. Spicy and herbal purple fruits are highlighted with cayenne pepper, chocolate and a pleasing hint of violets.",91,Board Track Racer 2012 The Chief Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Soft, sweet, with the flavors of currants and dried sultanas, this is a relatively delicate wine, not intensely rich. It has an edge of botrytis along with a noticeable mineral character, giving a fresh acidity to finish.",87,Höpler NV Beerenauslese White (Burgenland)
"This '06 is the winery's regular bottling, not the reserve, and Chard lovers will find it a little lacking in richness. Still, it's a dry, crisp, elegantly structured wine, with mineral-infused pear and pineapple flavors.",86,Clos du Val 2006 Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Light, earthy and thin, this doesn't bring much in the way of either fruit or pleasure. Tannins are substantial, which may be a plus if you want to pair it with a burger.",84,A to Z 2013 Pinot Noir (Oregon)
"The aromas of earth, char and dark berries are alluring. The flavors are rich but never lose their deftness.",90,Telaya 2013 Syrah
"Earthy, roasted aromas of dry berry and leathery spice are alluring. The wine feels mature but forward, with a mild, resiny oak note driving the roasted red-berry, tobacco, spice and lemon flavors. It feels smooth and plush on the finish, with structure and spine. Drink now–2018.",92,Viñedos de Paganos 2005 El Puntido Gran Reserva  (Rioja)
"A perennial value, this year's edition boasts plenty of smoky blackberry aromas tinged with slight game notes. Medium-bodied—verging on full—there's loads of fruit and flavor packed into an easily accessible format. Ready to enjoy now and should continue to drink well for a few more years.",89,Domaine Borie de Maurel 1999 Syrah (Minervois)
"Lots of flashy blackberry and cassis flavors in this Cabernet. Easy to drink, but feels way too soft to earn a higher score. Drink up.",84,Wattle Creek 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"A spicy blend of 44% Grenache, 32% Syrah and 24% Tempranillo, all grown in Fair Play, an increasingly interesting place for Rhône varieties. With soft swirls of fruity plum amid masculine tobacco and leather, there's a lusciousness to the finish that's appealing but could use a bit more of a kick.",86,Baiocchi Wines 2011 G minor Red (Fair Play)
"This is a blend mainly of the local Loin de l'Oeil with a touch of Sauvignon. Together they give a rich, while balanced wine, allowing acidity to keep the luscious peach, pear and honey flavors crisp and fragrant. Drink now, but the wine will age well.",91,Domaine Rotier 2011 Les Gravels White (Gaillac Doux)
"This blend of 80% Clairette and 20% Bourboulenc seems to be fading a little, losing its freshness in favor of greater palate breadth. The flavors are largely neutral, but hint at oranges. Drink up.",84,Bourgeois Family 2009 In Fine White (Ventoux)
"Aromas of red fruit, vanilla and cigarbox start this Cabernet Sauvignon from Greece. Its flavors are rich but balanced—cinnamon, cedar, cherry and savory spice—and the wine finishes clean and dry. Elegant with ageable potential.",91,Hatzimichalis 2008 Kapnias Vineyard Zygos Cabernet Sauvignon (Atalanti Valley)
"Shows the clean, citrus acid juiciness and silky texture of the appellation and is totally dry. But you'll find ripe cherry, currant, pomegranate, peppermint tea, mineral and smoky oak flavors that finish complex and satisfying. Brilliant and versatile at the table.",91,Pali 2006 Fiddlestix Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"A mix of melon, tropical fruit and passion fruit aromas lead to a tight palate with just enough body weight to not be austere. Flavors of white pepper, citrus and celery are modest on the finish, which tastes briny.",86,Tres Palacios 2017 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Maipo Valley)
"This is a rich, inviting wine with characteristics of dried cranberry and red currant, replete with dusty, spicy tannins and spicy, spiked vanilla. Lush, the tannins are soft and supple, a tad smoky, and the secondary elements darker in smoke, black licorice and espresso. Burly, it's balanced and refined.",92,Ehlers Estate 2012 Estate Merlot (St. Helena)
"This is a beautifully fresh wine, as crisp as possible. It is light in character while still bright with red berry fruits. The acidity and the general fruitiness give a refreshing aftertaste. These are young vines so we will see what the future brings.",87,Domaine des Marrans 2014 Gamay (Beaujolais Rosé)
"Fragrant and young, this Cab bursts with juicy berry fruit flavors. Brambly raspberry, a whiff of mint, plenty of cassis and a dusting of spice all combine in a well-structured wine ready for the table. Firm and supported with mineral-soaked acids, this has the texture, tannins and push-through to age gracefully, though it's perfectly ready right now.",92,Amavi 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Roasted, gritty aromas of bacon and spicy oak are burnt on the surface. This is fleshy and full in body, with moderate acidity. Herbal, minty, lightly green berry flavors have a rooty accent and oaky makeup. Finishing flavors of mint and raw oak blend into herbal berry leftovers.",88,Valentin Bianchi 2014 Famiglia Bianchi Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Reduced on the nose, this wine's petrol-like aromas dissipate as it opens, unveiling a sharp take on preserved lemon, Gravenstein apple and subtle oak flavors, its acidity reasonably sharp.",88,Buena Vista 2014 Jovita's Selection Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"Intense red berry and cherry notes shine through this Cabernet Franc rosé. Brisk acidity refreshes, but eight months of barrel aging and lees stirring lend an unusually lactic feel to the palate.",85,Domaine LeSeurre 2013 Cabernet Franc Barrel Select Rosé (Finger Lakes)
"This entry-level wine of the Saint André de Figuière range is pretty impressive in itself. It has a rounded, smooth character that is lifted by attractive red berry acidity and a nervy, mineral texture. Balanced acidity completes the picture.",90,Domaine Saint-André de Figuière 2014 Cuvée Signature Magali Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This is peachy and a bit oily on the nose, but not harsh or pointed. It feels full and fleshy, with sweet, ripe flavors of melon, citrus and lychee. Long and melony on the finish; drink now.",86,Salentein 2011 Killka Collection Torrontés (Uco Valley)
"Fresh, light aromas of raspberry and milk chocolate give the wine legitimacy, but for the most part it's simply a lean, sassy Pinot with racy red-fruit flavors, warmth and a touch of sweet oak. Rudimentary but varietally correct with few flaws or virtues. Good but wholly basic.",85,Chilcas 2007 Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Maule Valley)
"This wine is still young, reveling in its bright fruit and mineral texture. Drawn from Côte des Blancs vineyards, it's tight, tense and loaded with citrus fruit. With its finely crisp aftertaste, it's delicious now for its fruit but will also be great from 2020, once its toasty character develops more fully.",93,Deutz 2010 Blanc de Blancs Brut  (Champagne)
"This rich sparkling wine from northern Italy offers a layered fragrance of apple, nut and just-baked bread. The palate is smooth and creamy but weightless, with delicate and crisp bubbles.",90,Lorenz Martini 2008 Riserva Comitissa Brut White (Alto Adige)
"This red blend offers aromas of black cherry, dried plum and dried cherry. Flavors of red and black plums come with a touch of dark chocolate in the finish.",86,Bostavan 2015 Dor Rara Neagra-Cabernet Sauvignon Red (Moldova)
"Almost honeyed in its richness, this is a ripe and rounded wine. A touch of toastiness brings out the apricot and peach flavors along with the rich acidity and soft texture. It's a wine to age, with its fruit and structure still coming into balance. Drink from 2017.",91,Château de Fuissé 2013 Les Brûlés  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
"Spicy and full-bodied, this features aromas of blue flower, ground black pepper, plum cake and a whiff of scorched earth. The palate offers dried black cherry, mineral, clove and a nutmeg note alongside tightly knit but refined tannins. It's a fresher and more approachable expression of Sagrantino compared to many of the heartier versions out there. Drink through 2019.",89,Villa Mora 2009  Montefalco Sagrantino
"This wine has structure, with ripe red fruits and a good layer of tannin. Despite a difficult year in Bordeaux, the Queyrens family created a balanced wine with the acidity showing brightly through the firm, still-young texture. It could do with a few more months of aging so drink from 2016.",86,Château Pilet 2013 Les Hauts de Massonne du Château Pilet  (Bordeaux)
"Soft, fruity and off dry, this is a typically fresh and light-hearted Vinho Verde. Attractive apple and lemon flavors shine through the lightly prickly texture. Drink immediately.",85,Caves Aliança 2013 Aliança White (Vinho Verde)
"Aromas of ripe back-skinned fruit, violet and cocoa lead the nose. The round, juicy palate doles out wild cherry, crushed raspberry, fig and baking spice alongside smooth, polished tannins. It's savory and easy drinking, with a carob note on the finish.",88,Abbazia Santa Anastasia 2013 Bio Nero d'Avola (Terre Siciliane)
"A delicious though somewhat reserved wine with notes of lychee, honey, sugared pineapple and mint. It's rich in feel with abundant marmalade flavors, while staying well balanced and never going too over the top.",89,Henry of Pelham 2011 Icewine Vidal (Niagara Peninsula)
"Ripe black plum, leather and Mediterranean scrub aromas lead the nose. On the round palate, smooth tannins support blackberry jam, vanilla and sweet almond flavors. Enjoy through 2020.",88,Patria 2013 Stella di Corleone Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"Sweet-seeming aromas and flavors dominate this full-bodied, ripe-tasting wine—not unusual for a Rhône-style blend that leads with  Grenache. A spicy, smoky influence is delicious in its own right, but has a tasty component of fresh blackberry and boysenberry to back it up.",89,The Dancing Fox 2011 Côtes du Renard Red (Lodi)
"Demonstrating how this meandering region can express warmer-climate grapes from its inland corners, this bottling shows deep and precise aromas of black cherry, cola syrup and condensed violets. A firm structure restrains the ripe blueberry fruit, allowing the dark chocolate and mint elements to lift the palate.",92,McIntyre Vineyards 2013 Kimberly Vineyards Merlot (Arroyo Seco)
"Crisp sparkling Burgundy, laced with taut acidity and hints of nuts and toast. This is a wine under tension, with a strong mineral element, cool and fresh, best with food.",89,Simonnet-Febvre 2007  Crémant de Bourgogne
"This opens with aromas of toasted oak, roasted coffee bean and a whiff of sawdust. The bracing palate offers dried cherry, espresso and mocha alongside astringent tannins. Give the tannins another year or two to unwind then drink to capture the remaining fruit.",87,Diego Conterno 2012 Ginestra  (Barolo)
"Crushed boysenberry is foremost on the nose and palate, while a rounded, supple but defined structure makes this a winning choice for subtle foods. There is both elegance and length and a lovely, integrated touch of well-handled oaky vanilla.",90,Birgit Braunstein 2011 Goldberg Zweigelt (Burgenland)
"Pun alert. Matchless might suggest a peerless wine, but then you notice that the label has been burnt, as if in a fire. The blend is roughly two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon and one third Syrah, and the wine is broadly fruity in the Walla Walla style, with suggestions of cherry pie and berry jam. The finish has a rather chalky feel, with chewy tannins.",87,Otis Kenyon 2005 Matchless Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Brooding raspberry, tobacco, herb, cedar and barrel spice aromas are followed by ripe cherry flavors in this wine. It's enjoyable but lacks precision.",87,Stottle 2013 6 Prong Vineyard Sangiovese (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Aromas of yellow flower, beeswax and a whiff of tropical fruit guide the nose, while bright acidity supports the yellow peach and pineapple flavors. It closes on a note of bitter almond.",86,Palagetto 2013 Santa Chiara  (Vernaccia di San Gimignano)
"Made from organic grapes, Horse & Plow's Pinot Gris is earthy and austere, with finely honed acidity and lovely hints of apricot. Very balanced, dry, a tremendous version of this white wine.",91,Horse & Plow 2010 Filigreen Farm Pinot Gris (Anderson Valley)
"Fresh, ripe, green grapes and white summer blossom promise refreshment that the palate promptly delivers, a streamlined, concentrated but still rich wine with a layered, textured midpalate and notions of green apple, Amalfi lemon peel and green walnuts: simply delicious.",91,Weingut Mayer am Pfarrplatz 2012 Nussberg White (Wiener Gemischter Satz)
"A classic 10-year old tawny, hovering tantalizingly between wood-aged flavors and fruit. It comes down just on the side of the wood flavors, suggesting the blend has some older wines in it. It is a deliciously drinkable, not too dry, wine.",89,Quinta do Portal NV Ten Year Old Aged Tawny  (Port)
"Sizable tannins and oak make for a full-bodied experience that comes off closed and tight at first, the wine needing some time in the glass to unwind. With patience, it unpeels layers of soft, floral aromas and quiet notions of raspberry and strawberry.",91,Trombetta 2014 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This is a beautiful, ripe, full-bodied sparkler, balancing rich fruit with bottle age to produce a round, elegant character. It is delicious to drink now, although there is enough fruit to allow it to age for 2–3 years.",93,Veuve Doussot 2004 Cuvée Guy Joly Mémory Brut  (Champagne)
"The firm tannins of Saint-Estèphe are strongly in evidence in this wine that is dry, dense and only hinting at fruit. While there is some juicy acidity, it also has a bitter character that needs some time to soften. It will probably always be on the dry, structured side. Drink from 2019.",87,Château Clauzet 2013  Saint-Estèphe
"Powerful and concentrated, this has a dark red-plum flavor and solid tannins. It is dense, and it shows the structure of the vintage. This is worth aging, and it certainly needs food to show at its best.",89,Domaine des Nugues 2010  Beaujolais-Villages
"Intensely ripe gooseberry and white grapefruit flavors are cut by a razor's edge of acidity in this juicy, bracing Sauvingnon Blanc. Fermented using indigenous yeasts, it's brisk on the finish, ending on a distinctly saline, mineral tone.",89,Bedell 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (North Fork of Long Island)
"Fresh, crisp and uncomplicated, this offers aromas of honey and sliced peaches, with a lively texture and good balance. Medium-bodied, it makes a great wine for a picnic, before dinner or with seafood.",90,Toulouse 2013 Helluva Vineyard Pinot Gris (Anderson Valley)
"Made from Sangiovese and the classic Bordeaux grape varieties, this is a lusciously ripe but ultimately simple wine. With jam, currant, vanilla and toast flavors, it's nice for drinking now.",87,Windsor Oaks 2009 Super Tuscan Red (Chalk Hill)
"Dark-skinned berry, menthol toast and tilled soil aromas come together in the glass. Full-bodied, ripe, velvety tannins underscore flavors of mature black cherry, licorice, tobacco and clove. Drink 2018–2028.",92,Fattoria La Lecciaia 2010 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Masculine and brawny, this is tightly packed with bold aromas of cured meat, tobacco, blackberry jam and toasted oak. It's thickly extracted and modern, with a luscious, sweet, plush finish.",89,Domenico Fraccaroli 2007 Grotta del Ninfeo  (Amarone della Valpolicella)
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot starts off a bit murky and brooding but then displays raspberry and plum fruit, and some big-time heft. A tad oaky and simple, but with grilled meats it should more than do the trick. If you like 'em big and a touch funky, get tattooed.",87,Two Brothers 2001 Big Tattoo Red Red (Colchagua Valley)
"Te Awa's 2007 Syrah is a ripe, chunky example, with chocolate and plum notes leading the way, followed at some distance by hints of baking spices. It's firm and slightly dusty on the finish, yet mouthwatering at the same time.",89,Te Awa 2007 Syrah (Hawke's Bay)
"Leesy, yeasty aromas include saline but not much fruit. This is chunky but soft and low in acidity. Briny, pickled citrus flavors finish similarly.",82,Dominio de Eguren 2014 Protocolo White (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"Plump, fleshy black cherry and berry flavors command this ripe, lusciously textured wine. It's unabashedly forward in fruit, but is still an elegant, nuanced wine shaded by lingering tones of spice, crushed rock and smoke. Cranberry acidity extends through a long, persistent finish. Ready to drink now but should improve through 2021.",93,Meyer-Näkel 2013 S Spätburgunder (Ahr)
"Citrus freshness and frothy fizz make for an easygoing, feather-light and uncomplicated sparkler, perfect for informal gatherings. The finish is dry, clean and refreshing.",87,Erich & Walter Polz 2010 Brut Blanc Sparkling (Österreichischer Sekt)
"This entry-level red from this estate is aged in tank, preserving bright red fruits and a touch of stalky acidity. The 30% Cabernet Sauvignon gives a smoky flavor and a good sense of structure to go with the juicy Grenache fruits. The wine is ready to drink.",85,Commanderie de la Bargemone 2013 Red (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence)
"A sweet, fruity and lightly sparkling wine that has attractive acidity to go with its soft red fruits. It makes a delicious apéritif style.",83,Adega Cooperativa do Cartaxo NV Plexus Frisante Rosé Sparkling (Tejo)
"It's a bit simple and a bit soft, but this value-priced wine accomplishes its mission of bringing authentic Marlborough SB flavor to the U.S. at an affordable price. Gooseberry and lime flavors are touched with hints of honey and mint, finishing with a bit of sweetness.",85,Monkey Bay 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"This Rhône blend is scented with sharp-toned berry, spice, and menthol and it has an herbaceous note that is well-integrated and set against light tannins. Don't look for a lot of sweet fruit; this is more European, herbal and firm. A fine food wine.",88,Hollywood Hill 2008 DIst 83 Red (Horse Heaven Hills)
"This is a lightly structured wine with a soft juicy black-fruit character. It is smooth, rounded and with a crisp aftertaste from the acidity. It is ready to drink.",85,Adega Vila Real 2015 Colheita Red (Douro)
"Feels tight and dry and tannic now, and although the pedigree is clear, it's not showing generosity of spirit. There's a core of blackberries, black currants and minerals, yet it's hiding under a blanket of astringency. Will it age beyond the next few years? Hard to predict.",89,Monticello Vineyards 2007 Jefferson Cuvée Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Smoky and dark on the nose, with crusty black fruit aromas. It's short and tough in the mouth, with beaming acidity but only monoline red berry flavors. High acidity rears up again on the finish. Reflects the tough conditions of 2008.",86,Bodegas Muriel 2008 JME Selección  (Rioja)
"This is relatively light for Red Mountain Syrah—silky and tart with accents of orange peel and lemony acidity. The tight, tangy berry fruit shows a streak of chocolate, from time in 30% new French oak, and despite the cool vintage it finishes with some heat.",89,Force Majeure 2011 Collaboration Series II Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Syrah (Red Mountain)
"Sourced from three vineyard sites, this wine is named for the producer's wife and is his first attempt commercially with the variety. Smooth and silky in texture, it offers aromas that lean toward funky earth and dirt, with a touch of oak in the mix, too. Some soy and black tea finish things off.",88,MacLaren 2013 Heather Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Fresh and tangy, with little or no oak influence, this refreshing, crisp white wine will be very versatile with or without food. It has citrus aromas, green apple flavors and a nicely tart finish.",86,Douglas Green 2013 The Beachhouse Chardonnay (California)
"The vineyard is on typical steep slopes on the north bank of the Douro River with cooler corners for white wine. This wood-aged wine is in a bottle more suited to a liqueur and is impressively rich while preserving its cool feel. The mouthfeel has toastiness and ripe yellow fruits which are cut with a steely texture and pink grapefruit acidity. It's a wine to age, so drink from 2017.",92,Quinta Nova de Nossa Senhora do Carmo 2014 Mirabilis Grand Reserva Branco White (Douro)
"Aromas of cedar and black cherry syrup are sweet on the nose, but the black fruit character on the palate could use a boost of intensity and depth. Lean in profile, it's pleasantly brisk, but fades away a bit too fast.",84,Red Newt Cellars 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes)
"Quite mellow on the nose, this blend of 58% Grenache Blanc, 38% Roussanne and 4% Viognier offers very light marzipan and fresh white-peach aromas. It's a very easy to quaff wine on the sip, with lemon-peel and apricot flavors.",87,Eberle 2016 Côtes-du-Robles Blanc White (Paso Robles)
"Aromas of cherry, spiced meat and plum start off this masculine red. Flavors of smoke, spice and red fruit are balanced and easy to embrace, and the wine offers ageable structure to boot. This is an impressive selection that will pair well with hearty dishes, but it will also be enjoyable on its own.",87,Wine Art Estate 2008 Techni Alipiaç Dry Red (Drama)
"Forest floor, truffle, new leather, ripe berry and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find in this delicious red. The fresh, chewy palate doles out fleshy black cherry, chopped mint and white pepper notes, while big, round tannins provide structure. It's already enjoyable but will offer years of fine drinking. Enjoy 2018–2024.",93,Campogiovanni 2012  Brunello di Montalcino
"There's an earthy funkiness to this inexpensive Pinot, made at an unheard-of price point for the area. Dry tannins greet the entry followed up by burly oak and big brambly blackberry and cherry fruit, a touch of herb on the finish.",87,Taken Wine Co. 2013 Complicated Pinot Noir (Sonoma County)
"Firm tannins and a dry finish mark this wine. It has a wealth of blackberry, currant and sandalwood flavors as well as a salty, smoky umami taste that suggests grilled bacon. Drink now.",90,Summers 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Knights Valley)
"Easton's classic Sauvignon Blanc stands out year in and year out and this is no exception. Complex in texture and flavors of lime and tropical papaya, it's marked by minerality and a pronounced crispness. It calls out to be served as an apéritif or to enjoy while cooking.",90,Easton 2012 Monarch Mine Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Sierra Foothills)
"Strong in fruit and powerful in oak, made in the popular California style. Impresses with pineapple jam, buttered popcorn and vanilla flavors, in a creamy texture. Needs greater complexity and nuance.",87,Koehler 2009 Reserve Chardonnay (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Made entirely from Sangiovese, this wine features aromas of violet, ripe red berries and coffee. The juicy, straightforward palate offers mature black cherry and blackberry layered with espresso notes. The wine has firm tannins, but since it reflects the warm vintage, it isn't an ager. Enjoy soon.",87,Rocca delle Macìe 2011 Tenuta Sant'Alfonso  (Chianti Classico)
"All varietal coming from Candy Mountain Vineyard, the aromas of dark-roasted coffee bean, herb, vanilla and dark cherry provide appeal. Fruit and barrel flavors intertwine on the palate, tapering toward the finish.",89,Silvara 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Lean, largely neutral citrus aromas set up a palate with medium weight. Melon, pineapple and passion-fruit flavors are fresh but minimal. A bright finish makes this a good match for ceviche.",85,Zolo 2016 Sustainably Farmed Estate Grown and Bottled Sauvignon Blanc (Mendoza)
"A Bordeaux-style blend of 56% Merlot, 24% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Cabernet Franc, 4% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot, the Z is typically more immediately approachable than the Fusion V. The structure is still firm and supported by medium tannins, but the black-fruit core is the star all around, with lush notes of boysenberry, crème de cassis, blackberry, fig and damson plum throughout. Hints of cigar-box spice and leather add depth and intrigue.",90,De Toren 2009 Z Red (Stellenbosch)
"Made from 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 25% other varieties, this offers aromas of dark fruit, blue flowers, sweet spice, pipe tobacco and cedar. The mature palate shows raisin, licorice, mint, menthol, grilled herb and dark chocolate alongside smooth, polished tannins. While it's already accessible, this should hold well for another four or five years. Drink through 2020.",91,Castello del Terriccio 2008 Red (Toscana)
"Both tart and ripe red cherries characterize nose and palate. Ample, crunchy freshness gradually tips into juicy ripeness. The palate discloses lovely density, with overtones of licorice that create subtle, delicious resonance. The tannins are superfine and have a sexy little crunch. It's a totally balanced and beautiful red.",93,Stift Klosterneuburg 2015 St. Laurent (Thermenregion)
"Made with from organically grown grapes, this blend of 85% Sangiovese, 8% Canaiolo and 7% Merlot has aromas of pressed flower and sour berry. The fresh, simple palate offers sour cherry and raspberry alongside vibrant acidity. Drink soon.",85,Salcheto 2014  Rosso di Montepulciano
"Doughy bread, tart raspberry and citrus aromas mingle effortlessly in this nicely made wine, which offers a robust build and velvety texture. Its cherry, pomegranate and fig flavors are boldly defined.",91,Mario Perelli-Minetti 2015 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This wine is structured and concentrated with solid tannins. It has great ripe red fruits and plenty of berry flavors. It is going to be a fine wine, full of both fruit and structure as it develops. Drink from 2022.",92,Jaffelin 2015 Les Vergelesses Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune)
"A wood-laden bottling, produced from a selection of wines at Patache d'Aux. If the wood weren't currently so dominant, the blackberry fruits would have more of a chance. It obviously needs a year or two to smooth out and come into balance.",87,Château Patache d'Aux 2006 Cuvée Flora  (Médoc)
"This is potent in lime, sweet lemon, Asian pear and tropical fruit flavors, brightened with zesty acidity and enriched with notes of mineral and vanilla. Beautiful to drink, it will pair with everything from Thai food to risotto.",92,Cosa Obra 2011 Hummingbird Hill Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Coast)
"Tight and crisp, it has a mineral character. Nervy acidity combines with lemon and apple skin flavors, giving a fresh, textured wine. Drink from 2015.",86,Ferraud et Fils 2012 Le Chai des Platanes  (Mâcon-Villages)
"Named after the owner's daughter, this fairly priced wine offers steely aromas that are rounded by lime, honeysuckle, kiwi and apple flesh. It's sleek and minerally on the palate, with baking soda and lime flavors, as well as a bit of struck match smokiness.",89,Talbott 2013 Kali Hart Chardonnay (Monterey)
"There's something Chablis-like in the stony minerality that marks this Chardonnay. But at the same time, it's sweet in orange, peach, green apple and golden mango flavors. A rich, satisfying Chardonnay for drinking now. Production was 1,913 cases.",90,William Hill Estate 2010 Bench Blend Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"This winery is part of the Santa Carolina group, and the Cefiro Chardonnay is toasted and mildly buttery and baked, with spiced apple and mild citrus flavors. The palate is basic but controlled, with a toasty, vanilla-tinged finish. Standard and familiar, but well executed.",86,Viña Casablanca 2008 Cefiro Reserva Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)
"The reserve spends 18 months in French oak, and includes a portion of 30-year-old vines in the blend. Raspberry and cherry fruit carries a suggestion of earth, and the alcohol, though moderate, adds some heat to the finish.",87,Cardwell Hill 2012 Estate Bottled Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Soft and lightly fruity, this has an underlying chalkiness. That chalky sensation runs across the palate and seems to mute the other flavors, such as herb, which are on the light side.",85,Maryhill 2009 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Boysenberry, cracked rainbow peppercorns and dried rose petals show on the nose of this bottling, which plays to the lighter side of the grape. It's tart and brisk once sipped, with cranberry and pomegranate fruit given more complexity by a touch of wild fennel.",87,Le Vigne 2013 Di Ranchita Vista Cabernet Franc (Paso Robles)
"Aromas of green melon and pear are calm like a lake with no breeze. This feels mildly creamy, while leesy briny melon and peach flavors turn somewhat bitter prior to a soft easy finish that doesn't sing but doesn't fall off.",88,Pazo de Barrantes 2013 La Comtesse Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Cola spice dominates the nose of this thick, concentrated wine from the heart of Westside Road. Stemmy earth notes accompany its ripe red fruit, as toasted oak and vanilla flavors extend long into the finish.",90,EnRoute 2014 Hop Kiln Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This tastes and feels mellow and approachable, with gentle aromas of plums, dried herbs and tomato, and medium body with moderate tannins. It is supple and easy to drink.",86,Las Positas 2011 Estate Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley)
"The nose is lifted with bright spice and suggestions of pungent herbs. Black fruits carry a touch of mocha and lead into a crisp, moderately tannic finish. Balance and length are excellent.",89,Kaella 2011 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Sangiovese (Red Mountain)
"Dark and rich, there's a slightly liquorous sensation to the blackberry and cassis core. The medium-weight mouth offers lifting acidity, great balance and depth, with attractive notes of cigar spice, cocoa powder and roasted espresso grinds on the finish.",90,Shiloh Winery 2009 Secret Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Judean Hills)
"Produced from Aveleda's Quinta da Aguieira, this is a blend of typical Portuguese white grapes with a dash of Chardonnay. From old vines, it has concentration and a rich texture that is cut by fragrant acidity. There is a ripe feel to this impressive wine, generous and full of fruit. Drink now.",92,Aveleda 2014 Reserva da Familia White (Bairrada)
"Bright, crisp and fresh, as a 2009 Clare Riesling should be, this is a pretty wine, blooming on the nose with floral notes, apples and citrus fruit. The lime and green apple flavors are zesty on the finish, but not that long or intense. Probably best from now–2014, but could develop interesting nuances beyond that.",87,Koonowla 2009 Riesling (Clare Valley)
"A pleasant, easy drinker with notes of red apple, melon and jasmine. It's fleshy in feel with some residual sugar sweetening the finish.",85,Alexandria Nicole 2013 Destiny Ridge Vineyard Pinot Gris (Horse Heaven Hills)
"This is a smooth and generous wine. It is rich, full-bodied and packed with dark plum flavor, but it's the ripe, velvet character that is so appealing. It's almost ready to drink, although the firm tannins and minerality at the end suggest it will be better from 2016.",91,Quinta de la Rosa 2011 Red (Douro)
"This wine is simple and thin, with moderate notes of red cherry and plum, but it's solidly done and the winemaking is clean.",82,Caviro 2011 Tavernello Sangiovese (Romagna)
"Tightly wound, dry and acidic, this Pinot Noir offers direct and jammy flavors of cherry and persimmon. The structure is fine, with firm tannins and stony minerality. Once decanted, it can be consumed now, or it can be cellared for 3–5 years.",89,Mahoney 2010 Mahoney Ranch Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"Despite the relatively low alcohol, this wine is fleshy and unctuous, thick in tropical pineapple and mango with an undercurrent of caramel vanilla.",85,Owl Ridge 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley)
"This rich, rounded and full wine offers great red fruits that are embedded in the dry, dense tannins. Still young, it has a mineral texture that needs to soften and fill out. It's a wine to age; drink from 2017.",91,Laurent Gauthier 2014 Chatenay Vieilles Vignes  (Chiroubles)
"A bit less intense aromatically than other Adam Lee bottlings, this shows sour plum, smoked meat and a touch of garden herbs on the nose. Those elements come alive on the palate, where peppercorns, oregano, thyme and pencil lead decorate dark cranberry fruits.",90,Siduri 2013 Soberanes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"This opens with aromas recalling camphor, iris, cherry marinated in spirits and a whiff of coffee. The ripe, uncomplicated palate offers cherry pie, leather, star anise and white pepper alongside velvety tannins.",89,Borgogno F.lli Serio e Battista 2012 Cannubi  (Barolo)
"This robust wine is made from 62% Merlot, 37% Cabernet Sauvignon and 1% Petit Verdot. Herbal in personality, it retains a full-bodied ripeness of concentrated fruit, showcased in tobacco, leather and licorice. The tannins are sizable and grippy.",90,Pride Mountain 2013 Reserve Claret (Sonoma County-Napa County)
"An opaque color is a fair warning of what's to come: namely rubbery minerally black-fruit aromas that scream old vines. In the mouth, this blocky Carignan is flush and shows wall-to-wall saturation. Wild aromas of mountain herbs, blueberry and boysenberry finish sinewy and with spicy minerally black-fruit leftovers. Drink through 2023.",94,Ferrer Bobet 2011 Selecció Especial Vinyes Velles Carignan (Priorat)
"Jammy aromas, sweet-seeming baking spice flavors and a texture that's relatively soft for a red wine make this easy to drink and rich in flavor.",86,LangeTwins 2011 Midnight Reserve Red (Lodi)
"This opens with tropical fruit and white flower fragrance while the palate offers honeydew melon, ripe pear and citrus flavors. A hint of white almond leaves a pleasant bitter finish.",89,Villa Matilde 2016 Altavilla  (Greco di Tufo)
"Baked berry, coffee, molasses and horse hide are the aromas on this tight, rugged Malbec that shows a clipped, choppy mouthfeel in front of lightly herbal berry flavors. This is grabby and firm on the finish, without much cushion. Pour this with grilled meats and it will show best.",88,Denario 2009 Reserva Malbec (Patagonia)
"With 12 months in French oak, the Reserve Barrel Fermented Chardonnay is a rounder, more spice-infused Chard than Macari's regular Estate Bottled offering. As big as it is, the nose is somewhat muted with soft notes of pear and yellow flowers and the palate shows more as a result of the oak (spice, toast) than the fruit.",85,Macari 2007 Reserve Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island)
"This wine starts off with aromas that recall charred wood and meat juices; soon these waft away to reveal black fruit and spice. The dense palate reveals a black cherry punctuated with black pepper, nutmeg and cinnamon along with a note of tobacco. It's well-balanced with brooding tannins and will develop more depth over the next few years.",89,I Fabbri 2010 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"This vintage-dated expression of Chardonnay offers creamy aromas of peach and honey followed by dried sage, toasted almond and crushed mineral. Pair this luminous sparkling wine with rolled salmon canapés.",87,Castelveder 2005 Brut Millesimato Chardonnay (Franciacorta)
"Only produced in the best years, such as 2002, this is a 60-40 blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir from Grand Cru vineyards. This intense wine is well-balanced and packed with fruit tones, yet seems to be just approaching maturity. It is full, generous and tightly textured. Drink now and until 2025.",93,Thiénot 2002 Cuvée Alain Thiénot  (Champagne)
"Jaboulet's white Hermitage is named after the crusading knight who built and settled in the small chapel on the Hermitage hill. The wine itself is powerful, rich and concentrated, with heady perfumes of wild flowers and nuts. The palate combines a hint of wood, a full-bodied, oily texture and a stunning burst of acidity that leaves a crisp aftertaste.",94,Paul Jaboulet Aîné 1999 Chevalier de Sterimberg White (Hermitage)
"Buoyantly aromatic with notes of fresh wildflowers, preserved apricots and honey, this dry Riesling made from a tiny single-vineyard crop balances elegant crushed stone and stonefruit flavors with a focused acidity and stark orange peel astringency. Balanced and elegantly structured, it finishes on a long, meandering orange inflected note.",90,Bloomer Creek 2010 Tanzen Dame Auten Vineyard 1st Harvest Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Odd as it may sound, it smells like coconut cream pie with a baked meringue topping, all swimming in apricot purée. It’s sweet but not achingly so, at 7.1% residual sugar, with enough acidity to balance it. It has a luscious, creamy mouthfeel. It seems young and tight despite the opulence; probably it will improve with age in a cool cellar. Best Buy.",90,Navarro 1998 Late Harvest Gewürztraminer (Anderson Valley)
"Aged in steel, this vibrant wine shows Nebbiolo's more elegant and youthful side. It weaves together rose, violet, perfumed berries, bright cherry, crushed raspberry and sweet baking spices alongside supple tannins and fresh acidity. Enjoy it soon to capture the crunchy berry flavors.",92,Cascina delle Rose 2013 Nebbiolo (Langhe)
"Black loam and black cherry darkness are met with a minty lift, coffee grinds and cigar leaf on this blend of 57% Merlot, 27% Cabernet Franc, 12% Petit Verdot and 4% Cabernet Sauvignon. There are solid tannins and lots of vibrancy on the palate, followed by flavors of fresh red cherries, black peppery spice and dried meats on the finish.",93,Leoness 2011 Meritage (Temecula Valley)
"Sweet and oaky, with buttered toast, tangerine and apricot jam flavors. A simple and easy Chardonnay, in the modern style.",84,Kirkland Signature 2011 Chardonnay (California)
"Slightly granular and brambly on the nose, which never really opens up. The palate is round, sweet, a bit medicinal and healthy due to snappy acidity, firm tannins and decent overall structure. Truthfully, it's a straight-down-the-middle wine from a producer that always does this well or better.",85,Odfjell 2005 Armador Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"A hearty bottle of Chardonnay with the simplest label you could imagine, it emphasizes earthy, oaky, buttery flavors over fruit components. This is medium-bodied, dry, rich in texture and moderately tannic.",88,Bread & Butter 2012 Chardonnay (California)
"With 20% Semillon, this is a very rich wine, partly barrel-fermented and aged on the lees. It's packed with ripe, fruity peaches, pineapples, green apples, melons, figs and dates. It's a little sweet, but zesty acidity comes to the rescue to provide balance and elegance.",88,Duckhorn 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Oscar Quevedo is one member of a new generation of winemakers bringing a breath of fresh air to the Douro. His everyday wines, like this one, are friendly, fruity and delicious when consumed young. This is a great wine for barbecue.",87,Quevedo 2010 Oscar's Tinto Red (Douro)
The nose does not want to give away much. However the palate shows fresh apple notes livened by some freshness. Drink soon while aromas last.,85,Domaine Charles Frey 2014 Rayon de Lune Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
"This blend of Viognier, Roussane and Marsanne isn't typically Chilean but it doesn't smell or taste all that French, either. Tropical floral aromas are similar to bath oil, while this feels full, pulpy and oily. Peach and persimmon flavors finish distinctly salty, with an oily feel and flavor notes of citrus peel.",87,Undurraga 2016 Sibaris Gran Reserva Viognier-Roussane-Marsanne White (Maule Valley)
Aglianico and Piedirosso are blended here to create an easy wine with good fruit intensity and distant notes of spice and toast that add extra dimension. This is the kind of informal wine you should pair with take-out or pizza.,86,Cantina del Taburno 2007 Torlicoso Red (Beneventano)
"The entire flight of Prinz Salm's 2009 GG was something of a letdown, including this astronomically priced sample. It's good, but nothing more, combining subtle apple and citrus notes with hints of petrol. Feels lean and crisp despite the 13.5% abv, so perhaps it just needs more time to develop.",85,Prinz Salm 2009 Wallhausen Felseneck GG Trocken Riesling (Nahe)
"This dry wine offers light fruitiness and more in the way of caramel flavors and structure. It's textured, full in the mouth and very much set out for food.",84,Domaine du Penlois 2013 Rosé (Beaujolais Rosé)
"The three grape varieties (castas) are Arinto, Chardonnay and the rare Vital. The result is a light, bright wine dominated by rich acidity, an easy, open texture and just the right amount of crispness at the end. Drink now.",87,Fiuza 2016 3 Castas White (Tejo)
"Winemaker Randy Lewis made this wine, a showstopper in fleshy texture and supportive oak. Characteristics of charcuterie and spicy apple pie combine in a complex tension of savory and richly layered concentration, leaving a memorable impression as it traffics in nutmeg on the finish.",94,Lobo 2015 Wulff Vineyards Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Pale in color, it's bone dry and crisp in acidity. It shows subtle flavors of rosehip tea, orange peel and persimmons, with a scour of grape skin tannins. Perfect pairings include sausages and pâté.",88,Calera 2013 Vin Gris of Pinot Noir (Central Coast)
"This wine is a blend of Sangiovese (66%), Cabernet Sauvignon (20%) and Syrah. The aromas are brooding, with notes of earth, toast, red fruit and spice. The palate brings tart tangy cranberry flavors that linger on the finish.",90,Brian Carter Cellars 2012 Tuttorosso Red (Yakima Valley)
"Savory spice and smoke tones accent fresh lemon, grapefruit and quince notes on this delicate off-dry Riesling. Easy drinking and widely appealing, it's nicely concentrated on the palate with a brisk, blossomy finish.",87,Cupcake 2011 Riesling (Mosel)
"The Sichel family delivers a ripe, tropical-fruit flavored wine that is full bodied while also balanced. It has weight, with its apricot and mango flavors right up-front. The aftertaste continues the rich theme, a medley and yellow fruits with enough acidity to balance.",88,Maison Sichel 2015 Château Argadens  (Bordeaux Blanc)
"The lavors of candied red cherry and flower are pleasant, but dusty herb notes distract on the nose and palate. It's a big wine at 13.9% abv, but zesty acidity keeps it relatively balanced.",83,Korta Katarina 2010 Plavac Mali and Zinfandel Rosé (Peljesac)
"Soft and somewhat waxy in texture, this is a dry, muted Chardonnay. The flavors suggest sweet hay and light tree fruits, and the finish fades quickly.",85,Hedgeline 2011 Chardonnay (Washington)
"Good price for a semidry blush wine, crisp and clean in acidity, with such rich fruit. The raspberries and cherries have a minerally component that adds structural elegance.",86,Pedroncelli 2013 Signature Selection Dry Rosé of Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"A brick-like tint and dry dusty spicy aromas of dried red fruits and tomato form the opening of this Tannat-Cab Franc blend. Despite medium acidity, this comes across as creamy. Flavors of caramel and saucy red fruits finish soft and a touch flat. Drink through 2019.",89,Ariano Hermanos 2013 Don Adelio Reserve Tannat-Cabernet Franc (Canelones)
"This wine leans into the green side of the variety, with aromas of garden herbs, green pepper, dark chocolate and cherry. The palate brings abundant savory flavors along with chewy tannins.",88,Three Rivers 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Clos Saint Landelin is a portion of the Vorbourg Grand Cru vineyard wholly owned by Muré. This rich wine is comfortably excessive, very full of spice and lychee flavors. Medium dry in character with a dry core, it is still young and could age. Drink from 2017.",93,René Muré 2012 Clos Saint Landelin Vorbourg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"This opens with hard-capped aromas of crusty mineral and reedy berry. The flavors are gamy and roasted, with brandied plum and cherry accents. The finish is bright in feel and runs long with an herbal raspberry flavor.",84,Vinos Magbel 2009 Nebbiolo (Valle de Guadalupe)
"A beautiful Cabernet Franc, dry, soft and supple, with a silky texture that glides across the palate with such smoothness. It conveys pleasantly complex flavors of red cherry essence, with hints of nutmeg, anise and sweet sandalwood. Not an ager, but a fine wine to drink now—especially with steak.",90,Firestone 2009 Cabernet Franc (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Lots of briary wild blackberry, cherry and exotic spice flavors in this Zin, with cola, tobacco and mushu plum sauce complexities, and the finish is dry. Compromised by a hit of sharp acidity, but rich barbecue will help.",86,Darcie Kent Vineyards 2007 DeMayo Vineyard Zinfandel (Livermore Valley)
"Dense aromas of prunes, black plums, tobacco and vanilla bean mark the nose of this SoCal bottling. It's plump with rustic elderberry fruit at first sip, then tightens down around a black rock core, also showing smoked cedar and white pepper.",87,Robert Renzoni 2011 Montepulciano (Temecula Valley)
"Creamy apple and pear flavors give this wine a bright, while full-bodied style. Wood tastes and taut acidity combine easily with the fruit. Drink now.",86,Burmester 2010 Reserva Branco White (Douro)
"This opens with vibrant aromas of green olive, herbs and fresh asparagus along with dark cherry. Not shy, the full-bodied, tightly wound flavors bring a core of dark fruit and savory flavors that persist on the finish.",92,Gård 2013 Thunderstone Lawrence Vineyards Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a big, ripe, rich and oaky Chardonnay, the kind that will seduce lots of people with sheer dazzle, although only 135 cases were produced so it's likely to be hard to find. Dry and crisp, it's concentrated in pineapple tart and peach marmalade flavors, accented with plenty of sweet, smoky oak, and brightened with crisp Monterey acidity.",92,Mercy 2008 Zabala Vineyard Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco)
"With ammonia, green pea, gooseberry and pink grapefruit flavors, it defines a grapy, dry, acidic style. Tasted in January, the wine was still a little bubbly from the fermentation process.",86,Hanna 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley)
"Smells of honey and lychee fruit, but without the bold exuberance of Gewürztraminer. Pear flavors the midpalate, then turns citrusy on the finish.",86,La Vis 2000 Maso Roncador Müller-Thurgau (Trentino)
"Fresh apple, pear and lemon flavors have a crystalline edge in this just-off-dry example of Elbling, an unusual white variety grown in the Mosel. It's zesty and spry, finishing with a delicious murmur of lime-pith bitterness. Drink now.",89,Frieden-Berg 2014 Feinherb Elbling (Mosel)
"Jordan Fiorentini continues to knock socks off with powerful wines, even when led by Grenache, which comprises 55% of this blend along with 27% Mourvèdre and 18% Syrah. Dark raspberries, smashed strawberries, concentrated rose petals, soy and beef jerky lead into energetic flavors of olallieberry, black-slate minerality and blueberry-skin tannins.",94,Epoch Estate Wines 2012 Veracity G-S-M (Paso Robles)
"Lemon pith and ripe peach aromas are clouded under a distinctly medicinal tone of baby aspirin. While there is nice roundness to the palate and balanced acidity to boot, the flavors are mild showings of orchard fruit and lemon curd.",84,Wyncroft 2013 Wren Song Riesling (Lake Michigan Shore)
"Aromas of wisteria, white stone fruit and a hint of acacia lead the way. The crisp, quenching palate delivers yellow apple, juicy pear and a hint of mineral alongside firm acidity and a persistent perlage.",90,Bortolomiol 2014 Bandarossa 40th Anniversary Extra Dry  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"This rich Pinot Grigio sees some contact with oak barrel for a fuller, more generous mouthfeel. Aromas include honey, white almond, lemon zest and stone fruit.",87,Maso Poli 2010 Pinot Grigio (Trentino)
"Broad across the palate, the new vintage of Redhawk's estate bottling opens with mixed berry and watermelon flavors, and thins out quickly. The fruit is outweighed by the alcohol, which is strong enough to burn a bit in the finish.",86,Redhawk 2009 Estate Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Light, fresh and fruity, this is a lime and lemon flavored wine. It has a tangy, textured character that blends easily with the acidity. From a blend led by Grenache and Cinsault, it's a lively wine that will be a great apéritif.",89,Domaine Val d'Astier 2014 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Made with grapes sourced from both California and Washington states, this Pinot Gris delivers dry, concentrated Meyer lemon and lime flavors, accented with mouthwatering acidity. There's no oak at all, leaving the wine clean and vibrant.",90,Margerum 2012 Klickitat Pinot Gris (America)
"A silky, easy-drinking Pinot Noir, but one that retains Martinborough's savory profile, featuring hints of dark earth and mushrooms alongside black cherries. Drink now.",87,Margrain 2008 River's Edge Pinot Noir (Martinborough)
"An aromatic offering with notes of pear, melon and ripe banana. The oak (85% French, 15% stainless steel) adds vanilla accents. It drinks close to dry with abundant melon flavors and a textured feel.",88,Reustle 2013 Prayer Rock Vineyards Noah's & Jezreel Bloc Viognier (Umpqua Valley)
"A relatively new entrant to the American market, the 2016 from Glover Family offers subdued aromas of melon rind and fig, while the flavors most resemble white grapefruit. It's an easy-drinking wine with a crisp, tangy finish that just needs more complexity to reach the next level.",89,Glover Family 2016 Zephyr Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Notes of chopped star anise, sage, white spring flowers and Bartlett pear float out of the glass. The elegant palate offers yellow apple, white almond and citrus zest alongside a refined perlage. Bright acidity gives it a clean, quenching finish.",90,Foss Marai 2014 Guia Millesimato Brut  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"This cool-climate wine is crisp, steely and full of fruit. Its acidity and touch of saltiness add to its refreshing nature.",87,Auguste Bonhomme 2016 La Forcine Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de France)
"Simple and cola-like, it has bright flavors of strawberry and raspberry jam, with peppery, alcoholic heat, although it's basically dry. The weight is more like a rosé than a red, but it's pure and tasty.",85,Mirassou 1998 Harvest Reserve Merlot (Monterey County)
The wine is smoky and toasty. It is extracted with bitter coffee flavors that dominate the fruit. Too much burnt wood will leave little room for fruitiness.,83,Château Fleur Haut Gaussens 2014  Bordeaux Supérieur
"Thick, meaty and pure aromas of blackcurrant, crushed lavender and minty dark chocolate greet the nose on this special bottling from Iris Rideau. Black cherries wash onto the palate alongside an amazing array of spices, from Indian to Middle Eastern, showing allspice, mace and many dried herb components.",92,Rideau 2013 Siempre Happy Canyon Vineyard Malbec (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Velvety smooth and big-boned, this wine shows crisp red fruit wrapped in tart acidity and subtle oak. Bay laurel, spearmint and green tea add savory complexity.",88,Castle Rock 2014 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Tea, tomato, raspberry and spice aromas are typical for Leyda Pinot. The body is a bit light and hollow, but that also means it's not heavy. Raspberry and spiced tea flavors control the palate, while plum, spice and light herb flavors work the almost dilute finish.",87,Anakena 2011 Ona Special Reserve Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley)
"This fine-honed Chardonnay hews to the Eyrie house style. It may seem austere at first, but the green and yellow fruit flavors are ripe, not vegetal, and the firm acidity makes it a fine food match. Give it plenty of time to breathe before serving.",88,The Eyrie Vineyards 2011 Estate Chardonnay (Dundee Hills)
"A soft, clean, fruity wine, with spice and a fresh, aromatic character. The lemon and white fruit flavors are in an easy, apéritif style, with a lightly sweet aftertaste.",84,Dão Sul 2008 Cabriz Colheita Seleccionada White (Dão)
"This is the best value of the winery's spring lineup of seven 2012 Pinot Noirs. It's dry, delicate, modest in alcohol, tart and complex. Waves of raspberries and cherries, mushrooms, red currants, Dr. Pepper cola and exotic spices wash across the palate, delicious and flashy. It's ready to drink now.",93,Williams Selyem 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County)
"A Lake County blend of 45% Syrah, 41% Cabernet Sauvignon and 14% Merlot that starts sour before turning into a mouthful of caramel molasses.",82,Beaver Creek 2008 Fairytale Red (Lake County)
"Full-forced berry and cherry aromas are clean and fruity despite accents of leather and heat. The palate offers a good feel, healthy kick and tasty black fruit flavors touched up by hints of chocolate and pepper. Narrow on the finish, with espresso and spice. A solid, good wine from older vines.",87,Montgó 2007 Monastrell-Shiraz Red (Yecla)
"The 2005 Leonetti Reserve is all estate vineyard fruit—63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot and 20% Petit Verdot. It is saturated and dense. The fruit is dark, smoky, herbal, tight and loaded with licorice, tea leaf, black olive, hints of tar and graphite. Tannins are in perfect proportion, polished and ripe, with extra texture and weight. The finish is granular and detailed, but delicious accent flavors of almond candy and nougat keep piling into the extraordinary finish.",97,Leonetti Cellar 2005 Reserve Red Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"An easy-drinking wine offering plenty of Zinny pleasure. It's medium-bodied and velvety, with rich, ripe raspberry, cherry, tobacco, brown sugar and spice flavors.",86,Bump 2009 HB Family Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley)
"Intense and extracted but also well balanced and smooth, with minerality and asphalt on the nose. The palate mixes deep black fruit weight and flavors with snappy acids, and overall this is bright, bullish and full of berry and black cherry along with chocolate. A ripe, satisfying wine for the money.",89,Altos Las Hormigas 2009 Colonia Las Liebres Bonarda (Mendoza)
"A fine and rich blend of Chardonnay and Arinto, this wine has touches of spice and vanilla as well as crisp, bright fruit tones. Citrus and yellow fruit flavors show strongly through the lacy texture of this wine, which has a cool character from the proximity of the vines to the ocean. Drink now.",90,DFJ Vinhos 2013 Quinta do Rocio White (Lisboa)
"The first vintage at Nikolaihof from this vineyard, the wine is off dry. There is a lively fruit character and green apple skins, along with a creamy, fresh aftertaste.",89,Nikolaihof 2004 Schlossberg Jungfernlese Halbtrocken Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"Coming from Summit View Vineyard, this 100% varietal wine has aromas of espresso, toast and exotic spices, with the barrel notes primary. The palate has medium-weight dark fruit flavors, lightening in the midpalate, along with abundant coffee accents. Although the barrel influence is somewhat overt for the fruit that's in the glass, it still brings lots of enjoyment.",89,Barrister 2013 Malbec (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This is an excellent Fiano from an up-and-coming producer in Lazio. Organic fruit is utilized in this bright, fragrant and rich wine. In the mouth, it tastes thick and smooth, and you can taste a bit of that warm sunshine from Central Italy.",90,Le Rose 2011 Colle dei Marmi Fiano (Lazio)
"This oak-aged blend of Malvasia, Fernão Pires and Viosinho is soft with light green and citrus fruits. There is a creamy texture as well as a touch of spice from the wood. Drink this now.",84,Adega Vila Real 2016 Reserva White (Douro)
"This is a stylish attractive wine. It has an herbal touch although it is more about delicious bright fruit. Citrus and crisp apples dominate, laced with acidity. This refreshing wine is ready to drink now.",86,Paris-Simoneau 2016 Antoine Simoneau Sauvignon Blanc (Touraine)
"This pretty Cannonau-based wine opens with ripe aromas of blackberry, tobacco and dried spice. The mouthfeel is smooth, plush and dense.",87,Argiolas 2008 Costera Cannonau (Isola dei Nuraghi)
"A relatively neutral Chardonnay, one that shows some smooth red apple flavors, a light touch of vanilla and an open texture. Ready for drinking now.",87,Hans Moser 2008 Chardonnay (Burgenland)
"Briar spice, olive and asphalt aromas create a firm bouquet of black plum and blackberry at the core. This feels lively and serious, with black olive, herb, licorice, chocolate and dark-berry flavors. Herbal notes, blackened toast and mocha flavors on the finish are typical for Chile. Drink through 2019.",91,Arboleda 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Aconcagua Valley)
"Sweet and sugary, with flavors of pineapple, pear and apricot jam. Crisp acidity provides fresh balance.",83,Oak Grove 2008 Reserve Viognier (California)
"Light in color, this wine brings brooding aromas of red fruit, herb, spice and tire rubber. The red-fruit flavors are light and elegant, pulling up toward the finish.",89,Alleromb 2014 Corfu Crossing Vineyard Grenache (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This was my top Mexican white wine from a recent tasting. It's light and clean on the nose, with apple and just a touch of brininess. This shows off a good body with weight and acidic balance. Pear, papaya and dry melon are the key flavors, followed by vanilla and toast on the finish.",88,Cava Maciel 2012 Vino de Luna Chardonnay (Valle de Guadalupe)
"A mixture of Pepper Bridge and Seven Hills vineyards, this offers aromas of orange peel, flowers and assorted blue fruit. It shows good depth and concentration of flavors with a gritty feel to the tannins.",90,Reininger 2012 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This unoaked, tank-fermented, no-malolactic style delivers flavors as crisp and refreshing as a clear mountain stream. Steely and mineral-driven, its apple and pear flavors carry just a tongue-tickling hint of butter.",90,Chehalem 2010 INOX Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
"Intense notes of crushed stone and slate permeate this stately off-dry Riesling. Pert lemon and tangerine flavors are zippy and fresh, but the wine is more a showcase for its brisk, stony style.",87,Fox Run 2013 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"While the majority of the grapes for this wine are from Napa, small additions come from Lake, Sonoma and Solano counties. It holds a healthy dose of Merlot too. Simple in richness and ripeness, its flavors highlight bacon and charred oak, the tannins dusty and firm.",85,Educated Guess 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"There are plenty of dry tannins here, dominating light red berry and hedgerow fruits. It is never going to be a big wine, but the tannins should soften in a year to leave a fresh, fruity wine.",86,Domaine Jayer-Gilles 2007  Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Nuits
"The Celilo vineyard has contributed the fruit to many outstanding Chardonnays from a who's who list of winemakers, but none better than this. Intensely concentrated and deeply extracted, it explodes with marvelously pure fruit flavors—the full range of citrus, citrus peel and crisp tree fruits. A wine with perfect virtually balance, exceptional texture and amazing length.",95,Tranche 2008 Chardonnay (Columbia Gorge (WA))
"Smoky notes of roasted meat and white pepper spice up the plum skins and blackberry fruit that show on the nose of this bottling. The smoke is also prominent on the sip, where graphite minerality frames the blueberry and blackberry fruit. The character of slightly burnt balsamic reduction sauce also shows through.",88,Fess Parker 2013 Rodney's Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"Smoke and a refreshing minty note open this Casablanca Valley Pinot. Black cherry and plum flavors are backed by smoke and syrupy molasses notes. Mouthfeel is on the rich side; finishes with modest tannins and spicy, briary flavors.",85,Morandé 2001 Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)
"The nose on this clear-colored Godello is fresh, spunky and citrusy. The palate is spritzy in feel and juicy, but also kind of cloying and clumsy. Flavors of sweet apple, citrus, lychee and mango finish tropical and candied, with weight and flatness.",84,Gancedo 2011 Capricho Val de Paxariñas Godello (Bierzo)
"For affordable, everyday Pinot Noir, this fresh, tasty number does the job. Tomato and herbal aromas complement lighter red-fruit scents, while the palate feels airy and easy. The flavor profile is snappy, with notes of red plum and raspberry backed by oak-based caramel and milk chocolate.",86,Terrapura 2012 Pinot Noir (Aconcagua Valley)
"Ripe, rich aromas of black cherry preserves are offset by earthy, brambly tones on this Cab-Syrah blend. It's lush and full bodied on the palate with juicy black plum and cherry flavors, but finishes elegantly with a whisper of finely grained tannins.",88,Billsboro 2011 Cabernet-Syrah (Finger Lakes)
"Floral, oily aromas are offset by the scents of lychee and lime. The palate is tropical and tasty, with peach, lychee and persistent freshness. It's getting a little heavy and lazy at this point in its development, but it's an honest reflection of northern Argentinean Torrontés.",86,O. Fournier 2008 Urban Uco Torrontés (Cafayate)
"A penetrating whiff of wintergreen is the first impression of this aromatic young wine. The tightly-wound fruit brings cranberry and tart plum flavors into focus, followed by a lick of dark chocolate running through stiff tannins.",88,Roco 2012 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Aromas of charred earth, underbrush and roasted coffee beans lead the nose of this blend of 50% Sangiovese, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and 10% Petit Verdot. The palate offers dried black cherries, prunes, clove, anise and tobacco set in a framework of tightly woven tannins. Drink 2016–2021.",90,Cecchi 2011 Coevo Red (Toscana)
"Warm, ripe cherry flavors marry easily with fresh herbal notes to give this silky, medium-bodied wine ample complexity. Amid the dark cherry fruit lurk notes of cola and baking spices, all gliding to a long, elegant finish. Drink now–2020.",92,Fromm Winery 2012 Clayvin Vineyard Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
"From grapes grown predominantly in Oak Knoll, and blended with Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this Cab offers a richness of oak and coffee on the nose before a juicy midpalate delivers red currant and red cherry. It finishes dry in pronounced tannins.",86,Fortune 1621 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A wine that is showing signs of maturity, emphasizing the sweetness of the rich vintage. It offers juicy spice, firm but sweet tannins and flavors of licorice and dark chocolate. It is ready to drink.",89,Vieux Château Gaubert 2003  Graves
"This is a boldly expressive testament to the vineyard site from which it comes. A concentrated and lushly textured wine, it exudes lime and a hit of tropical papaya buoyed as it goes by bristling acidity and a hint of wild vanilla. Indicative of a ripe, warm vintage, it remains balanced and deliciously exuberant from start to finish.",93,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2013 Ritchie Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This oak-aged Vermentino is pristine and fresh in style, and the palate offers some heft. Nuances of exotic fruit, lemon zest, apricot and almond cream appear on the finish.",89,Collemassari 2011 Grattamacco Vermentino (Bolgheri)
"Light in color and in body, like a Pinot Noir, this Mourvèdre has forward, rich flavors of cherries and orange zest, accented with sweet, toasty oak. It's simple and rather sweet, like melted pie filling.",84,David Girard 2008 Estate Vineyard Mourvèdre (El Dorado)
"From a variety of coastal vineyard locations, this wine, an inaugural offering from the producer, opens in zesty lemon and tangerine, before developing into a fuller-bodied, unctuous experience on the palate. It offers tamped-down acidity and briny back note on the finish.",87,The Forager 2013 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"Crushed cloves, allspice and nutmeg are sprinkled across a ripe olallieberry base on this wine from a vineyard owned by the founder of Rabbit Ridge. It's thick and dense on the palate, perhaps too much so for some, with dried cherries, cranberries, lots of spice and even some tar elements.",89,Portalupi 2013 Russell Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Paso Robles)
"Ripe notes of yellow pear are rounded with creamy notes of yeast. There are overtones of dried hayflowers and fresh, green spring meadows. The palate comes together around a vein of zesty, enlivening lime freshness and leaves a clean, mouthwatering finish.",90,Domäne Wachau 2015 Liebenberg Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"San Polo offers a very unique interpretation of the 2008 vintage. Rather than focus on bold cherry and leather aromas, this Brunello shows tones of peppermint, chopped herb, cola, ginger and forest berry. The mouthfeel is compact, tight and shows some astringency that will soften with time.",91,San Polo 2008  Brunello di Montalcino
"Fragrant white flower and white stone fruit aromas leap out of the glass. On the creamy palate, a hint of crushed herb adds depth to white peach and golden apple. Fresh acidity and a foamy mousse set off the rich flavors while a suggestion of lemon drop marks the close.",89,Loredan Gasparini 2016  Asolo Prosecco Superiore
"This is a bright, expressive Albariño with fresh apple and peach aromas. A zesty palate brings some spritz, which is normal for a wine that macerates in whole clusters. Flavors of honeydew, apple and lime finish with minerally tightness.",89,Maior de Mendoza 2012 Maceración Carbónica Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Lovely aromas show sweet fruit, cherry candy flavors, along with some green tannins in a tart, tight finish.",86,Abacela 1999 Cabernet Franc (Umpqua Valley)
"This wine is light and fruity, poised between rich tropical and herbal-laced green fruits. It has a perfumed touch from the Sauvignon Gris in the blend and a crisp texture. Drink from early 2018.",85,Château Vrai Caillou 2016  Entre-Deux-Mers
"This is a Merlot-based, Bordeaux-style blend, with a leafy, herbal aspect that reflects the cooler vintage. It plays out broadly across the palate, with scents of violets and vanilla, and flavors of wild berry and light herb.",89,Sparkman 2010 Ruby Leigh Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"What a great improvement the '06 is over the '05. It's considerably lower in alcohol, and much more balanced and crisp. Yet the flavors are ripe and seductive, in peaches, pears, papayas, honeysuckle flowers and oak-influenced butter, honey and vanilla. Great with Thai food.",87,Orchid Hill 2006 Private Reserve Viognier (Paso Robles)
"Made only in the best years, this wine is a full and generous expression of Alicante Bouschet. It is structured while also ripe in blackberry fruit and dark plum-skin tannins. Rich and juicy, this is an opulent wine that can be drunk from 2016.",90,Herdade da Comporta 2010 Comporta Alicante Bouschet (Península de Setúbal)
"Soft and a little sweet in sugar and honey, yet shows Gewürz's spices, with abundantly ripe tropical fruit, citrus, vanilla and honeysuckle flavors.",85,Courtney Benham 2010 Gewürztraminer (Santa Barbara County)
"If you're tired of Zinfandels that are unabalanced and inelegant, try this one. Yes, the alcohol is high, but it folds perfectly into everything else. The vineyard is in the Olivet Road part of the valley, which in many ways represents the ideal terroir of the Russian River. You'll find brisk acidity and firm tannins in this wine, but also ripely appealing blackberry, cherry, cola and briary wild chamomile flavors. This seriously good wine will age until 2022.",92,Hartford Court 2011 Old Vine Jolene's Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"Initially a little rustic, the wine does open out. It is smoky, fruity with the acidity of the vintage.",84,Château Briot 2014  Bordeaux
"A bit crude in tannins and with some green flavors, but not bad for this price. Gives enough blackberry, licorice and cedar flavors to satisfy, and the finish is dry.",83,Pepperwood Grove 2007 Syrah (California)
"Stalky, roasted, horsey, baked-fruit aromas are mossy and muddled. Colomé always makes funky wines with true Salta character, but this one is soupy, thick and dense in feel, with herbal, savory, salty plum flavors. A dark, chunky, stewy finish concludes this unusual rendition of Malbec.",87,Colomé 2012 Estate Malbec (Salta)
"Distinctive and generous, this white Rhône-style wine is made from Sierra Foothills grapes by a seasoned Napa winemaker. It tastes like vanilla, hazelnuts and pears, has a creamy texture, feels layered with fruit and spice notes, and has good acidity balanced by richness of flavor.",91,Elyse 2012 L'Ingenue Naggiar Vineyard White (Sierra Foothills)
"In honor of the firm's 130th anniversary and made in limited quantities, this enticing sparkler offers ethereal scents of fragrant wild flower, apple and pear that follow through to the vibrant, focused palate, alongside a lemony note. It's clean and crisp, with a pristine bone-dry finish.",90,Mionetto NV Cuvée Anniversario Brut  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Concentrated, well structured and not too full bodied, this is an almost architectural wine in how it fills out the palate and clings to the taste buds. It has an appetizing texture due to fine-grained tannins, a sense of ripeness without overripeness, plus deep and layered fruit, coffee and black-pepper nuances.",92,Lynch Wines 2013 Strummer Syrah (Sierra Foothills)
"Bread crust and golden apple aromas lead the way and follow through to the lively palate along with citrus zest and toasted hazelnut. Bright acidity and brisk, persistent bubbles offset the rich flavors.",88,Monzio Compagnoni 2010 Satèn Brut Chardonnay (Franciacorta)
"There's a very good wine in here, with bright acidity, smooth tannins and complex flavors of raspberries, cherries and cola. Yet there's also a strange metallic taste that makes you wonder about the screwcap. It could just be the high acidity combined with minerality. Give it a good long decant before drinking.",88,Inman Family 2007 Thorn Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This well-made regional blend shows aromas of struck flint, sage notes accent white grapefruit aromas. The flavors follow in a similar vein, picking up hints of red currant and wet stone on the mouthwatering finish. Drink now.",88,Saint Clair 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"This single-vineyard Malbec proves once again that Achaval-Ferrer does not specialize in textbook wines. It's a terroir-driven hard-body with tight blueberry and cherry aromas and flavors. There's a lot of zest, drive and crispness to the palate, and the finish is tight, layered and long. Drinkable now through 2018.",91,Achaval-Ferrer 2008 Finca Mirador Malbec (Mendoza)
"A rather ordinary Merlot, dry and rugged, with jammy-fruity flavors of cherries, herbs and oak. Blended with Beckstoffer Cabernet Sauvignon, which gives it needed body and power.",86,Marilyn 2008 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"The color is light and the black and green olive, smoked meat and savory aromas are reserved. However, there's an elegant yet rich, captivating feel to the savory flavors that make this wine hard to resist.",92,Reynvaan Family Vineyards 2012 The Unnamed Estate Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Still young, this is going to be a ripe wine with a fine structure and rich fruitiness. It has a mineral edge and concentration from the old vines. The berry fruits have been smoothed by the wood aging to give a rich wine that will age further. Drink from 2017.",92,Château du Coudray Montpensier  2014 Le Grand Bouqueteau Réserve  (Chinon)
"Honeydew, crushed stone and hints of ground cinnamon and clove are appetizing upfront. This Viognier from the Southern Rhône is full and round on the palate, with ample weight and a trace of bitterness on the finish.",86,Alain Jaume et Fils 2016 Domaine Grand Veneur Blanc de Viognier (Côtes du Rhône)
"Made from 40% Syrah, 40% Grenache and 20% Mourvèdre, this rosé leads with herbal scents of garrigue herbs and peppercorn that dance atop fruity tones of ripe red cherry and plum skin. The soft, round palate offers richer tones of watermelon candy and peach preserves, while ample acidity lifts the finish and provides a clean close.",87,Domaine de Nizas 2016 Les Pierres Blanches Rosé (Languedoc)
"Here's a traditional Chianti Classico with pretty aromas of cherry cola, mesquite, almonds and violets. The wine is compact and elegant in the mouth and offers crisp berry flavors on the close.",87,Campomaggio 2005  Chianti Classico
"Ungainly, with stiff, puckery tannins giving a hard astringency, and unintegrated oak sticking out. Somewhere inbetween are modest cherry, anise and herb flavors. Pretty good, but not likely to go anywhere, so drink now.",86,Turnbull 2006 Estate Grown Merlot (Oakville)
"A light golden SB from Calaveras County with tons of tropical aromas, predominantly pineapple, that follow into the taste, which veers disproportionately sweet, with not enough acidity to balance it out.",84,Chatom Vineyards 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Calaveras County)
"A standout in this new vintage, Waterbrook's pure varietal bottling explodes into life with bright, spicy, pungent scents of recently mown lawn, herb, pine needle, citrus and melon. Fresh, clean, textural and persistent, it has a depth of flavor rarely found at this price.",91,Waterbrook 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Soft aromas of raisin and prune lack vitality and indicate what's to come. The wine feels flabby and awkward on the palate, with only light acidity pumping up generic flavors that include coffee, herbal berry and chocolate.",83,Carma 2010 Estate Grown Carmenère (Maule Valley)
"Subdued aromas of ripe dark berry, violet, spice and a whiff of Alpine herb come together on this. The lively, straightforward palate offers up black raspberry, blackberry and nutmeg alongside velvety tannins. Drink soon.",88,Girlan 2013 Lagrein (Alto Adige)
"While ripe on the nose and luscious in mouthfeel, this taut, nervy Bordeaux-style blend showcases sweet-tart pomegranate and cranberry flavors. It's a lean, but refreshing wine with a crisp finish.",85,Glenora 2013 Meritage (Finger Lakes)
"Full and weighty, this vineyard-designate is salty and floral, offering whiffs of orange blossom around lime zest and brine. The minerality shines through despite the size, making for a food-friendly, yet hedonistic wine.",88,Tamber Bey 2014 Mello Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Yountville)
"There is a bitter edge to this wine. Spice and tight acidity give a nervy, taut character. At the same time, fresh apple and citrus flavors come through. Give this wine until 2016 to soften.",87,Simonnet-Febvre 2008 Blanc de Blancs Brut  (Crémant de Bourgogne)
"This is a celebratory taste of blueberry pie that's silky smooth and additionally complex in vanilla, leather and dark chocolate. Luxuriously soft, it finds a way to mellow its tannins without sacrificing power or concentration.",92,Patel 2013 Malbec (Napa Valley)
"Big, ripe and fruity, this wine balances its rich fruits with firm tannins. A dry core gives shape to the blackberry fruit flavors, offering aging potential. Drink from 2016.",89,Château Lamothe-Vincent 2011 Héritage  (Bordeaux Supérieur)
"The Dion is a new entry in the long list of Erath single-vineyard wines. It doesn't show much in this difficult vintage. Short and intensely herbal, it has strong scents and flavors of tomato leaf, which override any hint of ripe fruit flavor.",85,Erath 2010 Dion Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"A perfumed wine, it has structured black fruits and a solid texture. It is rich, showing complexity through its tannins along with acidity and fruitiness. Still surprisingly young to taste, it should not be drunk until 2015.",91,Domaine de Leyre-Loup 2011 Réserve Louis Leyre-Loup  (Morgon)
"This Right Bank-styled blend includes 19% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot. Despite its high (15.3%) alcohol, it's a meaty, complex wine that drinks much lighter. The berry/cherry fruit flavors are woven into a tapestry of earth, herb and spice, smooth and detailed, and the wine has a mouth-pleasing seamless quality that invites another sip, and another.",91,Dumas Station 2007 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This is a beatifully balanced, not-too-full-bodied wine from vines grown at 2,400 feet in the Sierra range. It has classic black cherry, black olive and anise aromas, harmonious fruit flavors accented with light oak spiciness and a firm, fine-grained tannic structure.",90,Sierra Starr 2014 Rising Starr Estate Bottled Cabernet Franc (Nevada County)
"From old vines within the Fanucchi Wood Road Vineyard in the heart of the appellation, this is a rare bottling of a variety more commonly found in the Jura, but acquiring new fans in California, especially made at this high level. Creamy and round, it remains fresh on the palate in a lemon-swirled minerality that provides a savory edge of ginger.",93,Zeitgeist 2014 Trousseau Gris (Russian River Valley)
"Delicate cherry blossoms and green herbs lend freshness to tart red-cherry notes in this full-bodied yet brisk Cabernet Franc. It's a bit delicate in flavor concentration for it's bold body and alcohol content, but surprisingly refreshing and quaffable.",87,Keuka Lake Vineyards 2013 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes)
"So much is happening on the nose and palate of this bottling that it can hold one's attention for hours. Rich aromas of cola, cocoa, coffee, dred black cherry, oregano, black pepper, dried herbs and slow-roasted beef lead into a palate packed with peppercorn sauce, tangy dried berries and hints of ancho chile-chocolate. After wading through layers of herbs, the finish is minty.",94,Mattucci 2013 Bentley Ironworks Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Earthy and structured, this fragrant red opens with aromas of leather, underbrush, vineyard dust, blue flower, tilled soil, menthol and woodland berry. The full-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, fig, baking spice, grilled herb and truffle alongside robust, velvety tannins. Drink from 2018 through 2025.",93,Rizzi 2011 Boito Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"Made with organically-farmed fruit, Rasula opens with sharp and somewhat sour aromas of white cherry and bitter almond. It's a simple, no-fuss wine for informal occasions.",84,Maggiovini 2008 Rasula Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"Simply delicious, this Zin is well mannered and not too full bodied. Aromas of this dry and elegant wine are like cinnamon and cardamom, and flavors are a little smoky and full of cherries. The mouthfeel is good and gripping due to fine tannins and supportive acidity.",93,Chacewater 2013 Made with Organically Grown Grapes Zinfandel (Sierra Foothills)
"Velvety blueberry and blackberry notes highlight the moderate structure of this blend of 35% Grenache and 32% Syrah with smaller amounts of Petite Sirah, Carignane and Counoise. Lightly spiced with nutmeg and white pepper, it's balanced and food-friendly, with a soft, round texture.",90,Spicy Vines 2013 Edge Red (Sonoma County)
"Classic lychee and rose petal aromas perfume this ripe yet elegantly composed Gewürztraminer. Juicy and forward yet balanced and spry, it calibrates zesty tangerine acidity against a crystalline glaze of honey that lingers on the finish.",90,Dr. Konstantin Frank 2014 Reserve Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes)
"Barrel aromas are up front, with notes of wood spice alternating with game and dark fruit. The fruit, wood and game flavors mix in equal parts on the palate, not entirely in harmony.",86,Ambassador Vineyard 2014 Limited Varietal Selection Estate Grown Petit Verdot (Red Mountain)
"Made with organically grown grapes, this opens with aromas of ripe dark plum, crushed flower and a whiff of vanilla. The juicy palate offers black cherry, game and a licorice note alongside fine-grained tannins.",87,Mannucci Droandi 2012  Chianti Colli Aretini
"Smoke and tobacco aromas are immediately attractive, and with the delicious, but dry structure, here is a wine that shows both great potential and great elegance. There is power, as witnessed by the alcohol, but it is relatively muted, the berry fruits showing through the tannins, and then the acidity and velvet wood flavors finishing.",91,Dão Sul 2004 Quinta das Tecedeiras Reserva Red (Douro)
"Stale fruit and damp-earth aromas are a warning sign. In the mouth, this Cabernet Sauvignon is raw and acidic, with hard tannins. Lean plum flavors are oaky and resiny, while this feels scratchy on an intensely dry finish.",83,Casa Perini 2014 Fração Única Cabernet Sauvignon (Vale Trentino)
"Quite good, but some vegetal flavors mar this dessert wine, which is very sweet, with 18% residual sugar. Such sweetness is usually enough to satisfy on its own, but despite the apricot, tangerine and vanilla flavors, a stubborn green streak lowers the score.",87,Tres Vinicultores 2008 The Central Late Harvest Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
Subdued aromas of black cherry and Asian spice lead the nose while the straightforward palate offers up juicy plum and a hint of cocoa. Round tannins provide the easygoing framework.,87,Egger-Ramer 2013 Kristan Lagrein (Alto Adige)
"Pora Barbaresco offers an incredibly elegant and fine personality with beautiful accents of wild berry, dried ginger, cola, leather, spice and black licorice. The tannins are silky and very polished.",93,Musso 2009 Pora  (Barbaresco)
"This luminous and delicately pink sparkling wine from northern Italy delivers elegant notes of stone fruit, pink grapefruit, chopped almond and freshly baked bread. Zesty acidity is backed by creamy, persistent perlage.",90,Cesarini Sforza NV Tridentum Brut Rosé Pinot Nero (Trento)
"Fermented in all new French oak, this wine opens with an enchanting nose of floral beauty and freshness. Its sophistication follows through on the rich, balanced palate of caramel, papaya and crème brûlée, the lushness countered by a stony grit.",94,Hertelendy 2014 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Simple and jammy, this Zin shows fruity flavors of raspberries, cherries and oranges. It's a little sugary sweet.",83,Lava Cap 2007 Spring House Zinfandel (El Dorado)
"This has particularly ripe and concentrated fruit flavors and a feeling of alcoholic strength in the body and on the finish. Aromas and flavors resemble very ripe plums, dried cherries and blackberries. It's styled for fans of power and ripeness.",87,Woodenhead 2012 Mariah Vineyard Zinfandel (Mendocino Ridge)
"Violet, ripe berry and a whiff of sweet cake spice lead the nose on this straightforward red. The bright, easy-drinking palate offers crushed wild cherry, raspberry, white pepper and cinnamon. Fresh acidity and silky tannins give it an approachable, easygoing nature.",87,Mocali 2013  Morellino di Scansano
"Syrahs are plentiful in Washington, but not in such quantities. Inevitably, some of the nuances of site and vintage have been smoothed over. What remains is a textbook version of the grape as it shows across the varied Columbia Valley. Smooth and supple, its satiny mix of blueberry and vanilla cream offer a fine introduction to the style. The tannins have grip and a hint of green tea flavor.",87,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2011 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This dark cherry-red wine has aromas of red plums and dried black plums that flow to the palate. An easy drinking wine, with pleasantly tart cherry flavors.",88,Vini 2012 Veni Vidi Vici Pinot Noir (Thracian Valley)
"Winemaker and owner Chris Pittenger dips into his Campbell Ranch and Baranoff vineyard sources to make this fresh, light style of deliciousness, spiky in acidity and earthy in dark cherry. Additional hits of citrus compel on the palate and nose, before fresh-cut roses take their cue.",91,Gros Ventre 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Freshly crushed grape and blackberry aromas lead this wine's nose, along with a whiff of crushed herb. The aromas carry over to the light, rounded palate, along with dusty tannins and a light perlage.",87,Villa di Corlo NV  Lambrusco Grasparossa di Castelvetro
"Leather, tobacco and light Bresaola open the nose of this dark, masculine Barolo. But wait a few minutes and the wine starts to deliver elegant tones of rose, violet, tar and polished granite stone. The wine is not propped up by huge intensity, but it does offer a cool, streamlined feel.",91,Barale Fratelli 2007 Bussia  (Barolo)
"As with all Dusted Valley wines, the focus is on varietal purity, and the careful blending (an addition of 10% Merlot) enhances it, by expanding the midpalate and adding complexity. Green coffee and oak-driven coconut and vanilla custard flavors dominate, with dark fruits holding down center court.",90,Dusted Valley 2007 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a softly gentle wine, with a drop of Sémillon contributing an oily, cashew earthiness to Sauvignon's citrus and tropical fruit flavors.",86,Whitehall Lane 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Though not treating the grape with quite the same reverence as other varieties, Central Coast vintners are having fun with Merlot, making quaffable, easygoing bottlings like this one. It shows caramelized blueberry, black currant and asphalt touches on the nose. The graphite minerality also pops on the palate, giving a tension to the cassis flavors.",88,Brander 2015 Merlot
"The Lodge Hill Dry is a solid performer year-in and year-out. This vintage shows a hint of fuel oil alongside green apple, bergamot and clover notes. It's a fine, medium-bodied dry Riesling that broadens out just a little on the long finish.",91,Jim Barry 2012 The Lodge Hill Dry Riesling (Clare Valley)
"The berry flavors of this pink fizz are edged with the slightest bitterness. A dry palate brings bright, lemony freshness. Fruit tones are more evident than autolysis, making this for easy-drinking, apéritif fun.",87,Jean-Baptiste Adam NV Brut Rosé Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"Interest is stirred right away by tarry aromas of wild berry fruits and rooty spices. The solid palate is creamy while also showing its teeth. Toasty, spicy baked-berry flavors are integrated and finish long and dry, with a touch of latent oak. Drink at any point through 2032.",92,Coto de Imaz 2010 Gran Reserva  (Rioja)
"Labeled a “Super Tuscan-Style Blend” this is 36% Syrah, 45% Sangiovese and 18% Cabernet Sauvignon, all from Red Mountain vineyards. It opens gracefully with pretty raspberry and cherry fruit, then grounds itself in a base of mineral and earth, enlivened with natural acidity.",89,Genoa 2011 Flying Colors Red (Red Mountain)
"This grassy, aromatic wine is rich and fruity. With a year's age it has lost its puppy fruitiness and mellowed into a richer, more complex wine. White currants, gooseberries and a chalky texture give depth to this well-crafted wine that is ready to drink.",91,François Millet 2011 Tentation Blanc  (Sancerre)
"This vintage of the Darkness Syrah is framed in an elegant, acid-driven, vintage-specific style. There is plenty of fruit—dark and roasted, with a mix of berries, pepper, and a splash of citrus—but the overall flavor set is highlighted by its acidity, and supported by earthy tannins. A fine food wine, with some years of life ahead.",91,Sparkman 2008 Darkness Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"This wine has a lighter-than-usual color, fresh aromas like cucumbers and jicama, and clean, straightforward apple flavors backed by good, crisp acidity. It's simply good and refreshing.",85,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi 2014 Chardonnay (California)
"This youthful wine will benefit from further time in bottle, but its full-bodied concentration is heady for now, a punchy, temperamental mix of sweet peach, vanilla bean and medium acidity. Intense on the nose and palate, it displays a quite ripe personality.",87,Artesa 2014 Block 92 Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Ripe, smooth and balanced, this wine shows firm tannins and a solid, chunky build. With its rich black-plum fruit and opulent texture, it will be ready to drink in 2–3 years.",89,Château Ponzac 2009 Patiemment Malbec (Cahors)
"Cabernet Sauvignon (54%) takes the lead in this wine, followed by Merlot (31%) and Cabernet Franc (15%). The aromas are all high toned, including spice, dried dark fruit and herb notes. The black fruit shows depth, framed by lightly dry tannins and a gamy flavor that lingers on the finish.",88,:Nota Bene 2013 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red (Red Mountain)
"This is really one of the best values in Cabernet- on the market. It's so deliciously rich in blackberry, currant and chocolate, you'll want to drink the whole bottle right now. Kudos to winemaker Nick Goldschmidt for producing a wine this good at such a good price.",91,Katherine Goldschmidt 2010 Crazy Creek Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Light, fruity and clean, this was aged in all stainless steel, showing delicious tones of tangerine and lemon peel and a crisp, long finish, with a soft touch all around.",88,Bell 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County)
"Very dry, this wine is firmly tannic, with the potential for great swathes of juicy fruitiness. It's currently developing beyond its youthful dryness and just beginning to reveal black-currant fruit. Give it another 2–3 years.",88,Château La Rame 2011  Bordeaux
"This is rather shy on the nose while the racy palate offers juicy lemon, unripe stone fruit and bitter almond. The bracing acidity calls out for vegetarian appetizers or light first courses.",85,Tenuta La Vigna 2014  Vernaccia di San Gimignano
"Crisp, lightly herbal raspberry aromas are a touch reedy and green. This feels chewy and saturated, while herbal, candied, slightly syrupy flavors of sweet berries finish minty and hot.",84,Pascual Toso 2012 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"A blend of Malbec and Merlot, this is a rich, fruity wine. It has a tannic firmness and a stalky black currant juiciness, along with intense acidity. There is a rough, rustic aftertaste that spoils the general fruitiness.",84,Domaine les Hauts de Riquets 2012 Diablerie Red (Côtes de Duras)
"Girlan is a quality-minded producer from the extreme north of Italy with a beautifully crafted and intense expression of Chardonnay. You'll get aromas of peach blossom, freshly churned butter and almond nut over a smooth and supple mouthfeel.",88,Girlan 2006 Select Art Chardonnay (Alto Adige)
"A solid Pinot Noir, this is surprisingly good for the price. It shows a delicate texture and plenty of dry elegance, along with flavors of tobacco, pomegranate and sour cherry candy. It should be relatively easy to find, with 40,000 cases produced.",86,Angeline 2011 Pinot Noir (California)
"All types of tea, from black to nettle to Greek mountain to chamomile, show on this wine's herbally powered nose, with bits of sagebrush and wild berries thrown in for good measure. Tea elements also power the palate, along with cranberry fruit and raspberry leaf, held together with grippy tannins, at least for this grape",93,Siduri 2013 Cargasacchi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"This is nice and hints at greater things, but ultimately it's more modest and fluffy than substantive. Aromas of oak resin, baked apple and vanilla introduce a palate with mild acidity and not much structure. Vanilla, caramel, banana and honey- dew flavors finish soft.",88,Rutini 2014 Encuentro Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"KJ's Mendocino County Zin has both red and black berry fruit flavor and the spiciness one expects from dry-farmed Mendocino County vineyards, though the tannins stick around a bit longer than one might like. Cedar definitely shows up on the finish.",87,Kendall-Jackson 2009 Vintner's Reserve Zinfandel (Mendocino County)
"This riserva from one of Barolo's most celebrated vineyards doesn't disappoint, even in the scorching 2007 vintage. It delivers succulent black cherry, herb and spearmint sensations along with brooding tannins and just enough freshness.",90,Borgogno F.lli Serio e Battista 2007 Cannubi Riserva  (Barolo)
"A green, herbaceous wine that has some concentration from the old vines in the blend. It has grapefruit, intense acidity and a fresh, crisp aftertaste. Drink now.",86,Quinta de Porrais 2012 White (Douro)
"This medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc showcases some of the leafy, nettle-like character the Awatere is known for, but balances that with ample grapefruit and even a hint of red berries. It's clean and refreshing on the finish, a fine representation of grape variety and site.",90,Foxes Island 2013 Belsham Awatere Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Good price for a Petite Sirah that is perfect for drinking now with roasts, barbecue, Mexican food. It's dry and rustic in tannins, with strong blackberry, coffee and red currant flavors.",85,Pedroncelli 2008 Family Vineyards Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley)
"To judge by the cork, this bottling has some age, giving it a toasty as well as fruity character that adds complexity to this baked-apple and citrus-flavored wine. It also means that it needs no further aging and is delicious to drink now.",92,Louis Roederer NV Brut Premier  (Champagne)
"The tannins on this vineyard designate, where two clones of Cab are grown (337 and 191) are still dry and thick and the wine is well made, with an herbal, baked bread and rich red fruit quality and barrels of smoky oak on the finish.",89,Nottingham Cellars 2009 Wisner Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley)
This wine is ripe with generous strawberry flavors and perfumed acidity. A smoky edge accompanies tastes of red cherry. The wine is rounded and light with attractive final acidity.,88,Chanson Père et Fils 2013 Beauregard Premier Cru  (Santenay)
"Citrusy and fresh, this low-alcohol (11.5%) blend of 80% Sémillon and 20% Sauvignon Blanc strikes the right chord as an apéritif or fish complement. It's lean, lemony and long, with hints of toast and paraffin adding a modicum of complexity.",87,Longview 2006 Red Bucket Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills)
"This off-dry wine presents a great balance between the spicy flavors and the tropical fruits. It's a lightly textured wine, already accessible, with a touch of pepper at the end along with just enough acidity.",86,Domaine Jean-Luc Mader 2013 Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Touches of wood meet with ripe tannins and acidity. Black-currant flavors, spice and toast are balanced with acidity and a finish that brings in black-cherry fruits. Drink from 2018.",87,Château Lamothe 2015  Bordeaux
"Just a bit mulchy on the nose, which signals that is a wine from the hot 2003 vintage. The palate sits on raisin and mocha, and there's even a creamy, thick feel to it. If you like rich, Porty flavors that border on dessert, it's likable. But be prepared for it to hit with a thud.",87,Alidis 2003 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)
"This is the last Wild Sky to be crafted by now-departed winemaker Gordy Hill. It's a full-on Bordeaux blend, 88% Cabernet Sauvignon, with the other four grapes filling in the rest. Substantial and mouth-filling, it displays a mix of black fruits, black olive, and Italian herbs. The mouthfeel is satisfying and the finish edged with dark chocolate.",89,Zero One Vintners 2009 Wild Sky Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This has a slightly aged appearance and tertiary aromas of candied berry, leather, tobacco and cola. The tannins are firm and tight; it still has an aging future ahead.",88,Torraccia del Piantavigna 2006  Gattinara
"Intensely fragrant, this honey-sweet auslese wafts of ripe yellow peaches and caramelized sugar. Tropical mango, pineapple and melon collide on the palate before falling neatly in line against a strike of high-toned acidity. The finish is luxuriously long, peppered by a faint dusting of saffron. It's a stunner already but should shine brightly for decades to come.",95,Weingut Hans Bausch 2011 Hattenheimer Hassel Auslese Riesling (Rheingau)
"Deeply fruity wine, almost black in color and very aromatic. It has opulent sweet ripe fruit, quite soft in character with violet and sweet plum flavors. It is probably not for long-term aging, while its fruit character will make it delicious soon.",90,Wiese & Krohn 2009 Vintage  (Port)
"This is a dense, rich wine that balances intense citrus fruit with a tight mineral texture. It is refreshing, crisp while also concentrated from the old vines. The wine is young and fruity and will be better from 2015.",90,Domaine Martin 2015 Les Trois Versants Vieilles Vignes Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"Verdicchio is celebrated for its crisp, green aromas that resemble lime, kiwi and cut grass. This expression offers those notes, with an added touch of lemon candy.",85,Capestrano 2010  Verdicchio di Matelica
"With an intensity of almond paste and charcuterie at first sniff, this nice Pinot Grigio from the Sangiovese specialists at Vino Noceto is light in color but rich in mouthfeel, with a flowery, apricot flavor. Its finish is smooth and a smidge sweet.",87,Noceto 2010 Pinot Grigio (Clarksburg)
"Sumptuous aromas of raspberry preserves and violets perfume this exceptionally lifted, pretty Pinot Noir. A deep core of fresh cherry and strawberry flavors penetrates the palate marked by complexities of tea leaf and potpourri, along with a firm frame of tannins. It's a lovely wine likely to improve from 2020–2025.",91,Millbrook 2013 Block Five East Estate Bottled Pinot Noir (Hudson River Region)
"This is briny, earthy and pickled on the nose, while the foamy palate offers peach and orange flavors that finish pithy.",83,Mas Fi NV Brut Rosé Trepat (Cava)
"The second wine of Médoc Château La Cardonne is a light, fruity wine with red berry fruits, acidity and a fresh tannin character. It is pleasingly ready to drink now.",85,Château La Cardonne 2007 Cardus de la Cardonne  (Médoc)
"Sharp, spicy fruit flavors lead into a thick, edgy, crisply defined sparkling wine with plenty of power. The heft and authority are there, but some softening around the edges would enhance the overall palate impression. Time should make this an even better bottle.",92,Heidsieck & Co Monopole NV Extra Dry  (Champagne)
"Perfumed and high-toned, this is an impressively crafted and priced blend of 35% Merlot, 24% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Malbec, 16% Grenache and 5% Petite Sirah. It shows a peek into each variety's personality, luxuriating in black pepper, leather, meat and black jam, with a juicy lushness to the palate.",93,Kokomo 2014 Cuvée Red (Sonoma County)
"Fresh, tart and crisp, this balances its natural acidity against sun-ripened aromas of peach and honeydew.",85,Villa Rubini 2011 Pinot Grigio (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"Raspberry and plum aromas carry hints of lemon and flower. It tastes solid, with flavors of herb, meaty berry, plum and lemony oak. There's a spiciness, with spiky acidity on the finish that feels forced.",86,Oveja Negra 2010 Single Vineyard Carmenère (Maule Valley)
"A dark tint and ripe aromas of blackberry, black plum and leather are appealing and inviting. This is weighty and full-bodied, with blackberry, boysenberry and cassis flavors. There's not a lot of nuance or complexity, but overall this is clean, tasty and generous.",89,Tierras Guindas 2011 Roble  (Ribera del Duero)
"There's a lack of structure and soul in this wine, which presents as somewhat mushy in tropical fruit and preserved lemon.",82,River Road 2014 Mills Cuvée Chardonnay (Green Valley)
"Squeezed lime, pear shavings and poached apple arise on the nose of this bottling. There is a tingling and tactile acidity on the sip, but only very light flavors of green pear and lime rind.",85,Clos LaChance 2015 Chardonnay (Monterey County)
"If you're looking for classic Napa Cabernet, this utterly delicious bottling is right there. Blended with some Petit Verdot and Merlot, it's a selection of the winery's extensive acreage across the Stags Leap, Rutherford, Carneros and Oakville appellations, showcasing the synergy of blending. The wine is dry, full-bodied, firm in tannins and extraordinarily lush, with blackberry, black currant, chocolate, plum, toasty oak and spice flavors. It's so good now thay you can drink it, but it holds the inherent balance to age for up to 15 years.",94,Pine Ridge 2010 FORTIS Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A bouquet of black cherry, toffee and violet sets the stage for flavors of black cherry, coffee, caramel and soft notes of mint. Acidity and tannins are well balanced, and the appealing finish features bright notes of lightly caramelized fruit and soft touches of mint.",91,Carmel 2010 Kayoumi Single Vineyard Shiraz (Galilee)
"Tight and stalky, this wine has smoky red-berry fruits and a strong layer of acidity. Still young, it will certainly soften, although it is likely to remain light and lean. Drink from 2018.",84,Château Fleur la Mothe 2013  Médoc
"Has bright, focused aromas, including lime and raspberry, with nutty, smoky bread dough and yeast. Very clean, with a pronounced kiss of sweet berry fruit. Finishes slightly sweet.",88,Robert Hunter 1994 Brut de Noirs  (Sonoma Valley)
"Reserve is rarely a word found in front of rosé, but here it seems meaningful. The 82% Merlot and 18% Grenache complement each other nicely. Cherry-pie tartness with a bit of sweet blueberry flavor make for a full-bodied, round and bone dry rosé that's substantial and delicious.",88,3 Horse Ranch Vineyards 2011 Reserve Rosé
"Once the sulfur note blows off this young wine, the tart berry and cherry aromas and flavors wear cocoa and tobacco accents. On the tongue an even palate-feel and smooth texture please, and decent acidity supports the fruit.",84,Abarbanel 1999 Estate Bottled Merlot (Languedoc)
"This is a Zweigelt with an identity crisis that thinks it may be Pinot Noir. It's elegant and silky, with a gentle tannic touch, refreshing acidity and restrained but evocative redcurrant and cranberry fruit. Overtones of peony and iris make this more intriguing, while there is substance despite its light body. This is delicious now, but will reward cellaring for one to two years to let earthy, tertiary flavors develop. Drink from 2014.",92,Schloss Gobelsburg 2011 Haide Zweigelt (Niederösterreich)
"A blend of Ugni Blanc and Colombard from Gascony, the wine has crisp herbaceous flavors and a tight zesty texture. It is light, refreshing and ready to drink.",85,Château du Cèdre 2015 Cedrus le Blanc White (Côtes de Gascogne)
"A crisp, red-currant flavored wine, this offers bright acidity and an attractive tangy texture. In its hallmark De Venoge carafe bottle, it is pure Pinot Noir with the addition of red wine from Pinot Noir to give its pale salmon-pink color. Drink now.",90,De Venoge NV Princes Rosé Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne)
"Tremenel has an earthy fragrance of underbrush, tobacco and ripe black fruit with a whiff of spice. The palate delivers a tight core of black cherry layered with raisin, white pepper, nutmeg and cocoa backed up by bracing but refined tannins.",91,Villa Erbice 2007 Tremenel  (Amarone della Valpolicella)
"An herbaceous selection, this leads with aromas of just-dried grass and yellow florals that are coupled with notes of green plum, melon rind and lime pith. The medium-weight palate is lifted by ample acidity, although the finish ends ripe and fruity. Drink up.",87,Thelema 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Stellenbosch)
"The most forward and drinkable of Foxen's many new 2011 Pinot Noirs. It's soft and juicy with raspberries and cherry flavors, plus subtleties of cola, sautéed wild mushrooms and sweet, toasty sandalwood. A pretty wine that's perfect with lamb.",89,Foxen 2011 John Sebastiano Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)

"94–96. Barrel sample. A surprisingly fresh Margaux considering that it's dominated by 87% Cabernet Sauvignon. Dense tannins, black fruits and tight acidity combine to present a wine that shows, for a Château Margaux, medium-term potential.",95,Château Margaux 2012 Barrel Sample  (Margaux)
"Mild tannin leads to integrated oak and a burst of juicy red cherry and pomegranate, laced in aromas of roses in this light-bodied wine. It finishes quick and lean.",88,Renteria 2012 Pinot Noir (Los Carneros)
"Packed with strawberry flavors, this ripe wine has plenty of the acidity typical of the vintage along with good fruitiness and structure. The wine is already developing well so drink from 2018.",90,Pierre Cornu Camus 2014 Les Charmières Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune)

"Big, bold and unreservedly stemmy, this Carmenère pulls in enough black-cherry fruit to balance out the herbs. The assertive tannins carry notes of earth, dried leaf and dark chocolate.",89,Plaisance Ranch 2013 Papa Joe's Private Stash Carmenère (Applegate Valley)
"This single-vineyard blend includes Jaen's fruitiness and Touriga Nacional's strength. That makes for a smooth, juicy wine, richly endowed with the spice of wood aging but more generously with the red fruits of the Jaen grape. Dusty tannins show behind all this delicious fruit. Drink this concentrated wine now.",93,Casca Wines 2011 Vinha da Carpanha Red (Dão)
"Ellner's entry-level nonvintage is a blend of the three main Champagne grapes. It is ripe and full, with a creamy texture and balanced acidity. The texture is soft, with apple and citrus flavors and a zesty aftertaste. It is well balanced and ready to drink.",88,Charles Ellner NV Carte Blanche Brut  (Champagne)
"Young, sappy and still quite tart, this wine needs a bit more time in the bottle to really pull itself together. Cranberry and raspberry fruit is at the core, clean and lip-smacking, with strong streaks of smoke and char from aging in 50% new French oak.",88,Abbey Creek 2012 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"There are massive flavors in this wine, and they're delicious. It just floods the mouth with milk chocolate, raspberry cream and cherry pie-filling flavors. The wine is pretty high in alcohol, but it's a classically rich, ripe Sonoma Zin.",87,Gracianna 2010 Bacigalupi Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)

"This limited reserve incorporates the best of 82 different lots, some done in stainless steel, some in neutral oak, and some in concrete eggs. Phenomenal concentration reveals a wine packed with powerful fruit flavors that cover the spectrum of citrus, apple, peach and pear. The luscious combination is supported with natural acidity and an underlying minerality. It's deep, long and satisfying, with the structure to age for decades.",95,Trisaetum 2012 Estates Reserve Riesling (Willamette Valley)
"Soft, attractively fresh, but simple, this shows lively apple and cream flavors, rounded by light tannins. It's pleasant, but it does need to fill out.",86,Guilbaud Frères 2007 Domaine de la Moutonnière  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"This is a very fruity Cabernet in which blackberries, black cherries, currants, licorice and cola star, along with oak influences. It's bone dry, and the tannins are thick and firm, but finely ground. Jammy and immature, the wine wants time in the cellar. Hold until after 2013 and see what happens.",88,Bugay 2007 Incline One-Nine Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"Given about a year in French oak, less than half of it new, this is a cohesive blend of 53% Grenache, 29% Mourvèdre, 12% Syrah and 6% Counoise. It's brawny in meat and leather, blackberry and tar, with a velvety mouthfeel benefiting from integrated oak.",90,Westwood 2014 Elevation Annadel Gap Vineyard Estate Red (Sonoma Valley)
"Subtle aromas of apple skin, yellow flower and nut lead the way. The nervy palate offers citrus, acacia honey, green pear and a mineral note. It's racy and linear, but not quite lean.",88,Ronco Blanchis 2014 Friulano (Collio)
"This bottling, an ode to Bill Foley's Texas roots, is reserved on the nose with hints of yellow melon, peach blossom and a kiss of vanilla. The palate is straightforward and very drinkable, with seared brown pear and sea-salt flavors cruising across lemon-pith texture and a chalky grip.",90,Foley 2013 T Anchor Ranch Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
This wine is 100% Sangiovese and is a pale pink color. Aromas of cherry bubblegum and herb lead to a dry full-feeling palate. The alcohol pokes out a bit at times but it still provides enjoyment.,87,Airfield Estates 2015 Rosé (Yakima Valley)
"88—90 Barrel sample. Soft, open, the wood giving roundness to a spicy, rich wine. It will develop quickly.",89,Château de France 2006 Barrel sample  (Pessac-Léognan)
"Big, bold and bulky on the bouquet, with a truck load of ripe blackberry and boysenberry aromas that rightly announce that a fruit bomb is coming. Feels plump, round and structured, with soft tannins and compact flavors of berries, black plums and herbs. Finishes full, with a mild herbal accent.",88,Siegel 2010 Crucero Reserva Syrah (Colchagua Valley)
"Aromas of black plum, black berries, underbrush and hints of espresso and chocolate all carry over to the palate. It's friendly but evolved, and you'll notice the warmth of alcohol although the official level is moderate.",87,Canneta 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
"Sesta is one of the wines coming out of Montalcino that manages to combine the old-world power and tannin of Brunello with top-quality fruit flavors. It is firm and concentrated, showing dry tannins that go right through the palate. At the same time, there is delicious ripe, violet-flavored fruit and balancing acidity. Drink after 10 years.",94,Tenuta di Sesta 1997  Brunello di Montalcino
"There's a noticeable stemmy quality on the nose of this incredibly intriguing, almost mysterious wine, with green and pink peppercorns, crushed coffee beans and squeezed blueberry fruit aromas. A woodiness pervades the palate too, where roasted poblano chile meets with smoked cigar, lavender, dried berries and asphalt. It evolves steadily while open, and will drink with fascination 2016–2028.",92,Melville 2013 Donna's Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills)
"The aromas are brooding, with notes of cranberry and dark fruit sprinkled with baking spices. The palate is rich and flavorful, packing a wallop of cherry flavors.",91,Revelry 2013 Aerial Series Block D Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)

"Baking spice, perfumed berry and crushed floral scents mingle together on this bright red. The straightforward palate offers black cherry, white pepper and clove accompanied by zesty acidity and fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2018.",88,Setriolo 2013  Chianti Classico

"Here's a dry, crisply elegant Pinot Noir to drink now with fine fare. It's quite ripe, and retains a nice silkiness that frames black cherry, red currants, Dr. Pepper cola, raspberry preserve and smoky sandalwood. Best now–2012.",89,Tin House 2007 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"Nobody ever said Argentina was Pinot Grigio country. This wine is yellow in color, with aromas of haystack and wheat. There's acidity to keep it upright, but flavors of briny citrus do little to bring it around.",80,Bodega Cuarto Dominio 2012 Lote 44 Pinot Grigio (Mendoza)
"The winery's top of the top, this is a viscous, concentrated expression of the grape, blended with 5% Merlot, the fruit from the producer's estate Sage Vineyard on Mount Veeder. Chocolate, blackberry, sage and meaty grips of black pepper and anise compete for attention amid all the ripeness and intensity, finishing with surprising softness.",92,Darioush 2012 Darius II Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This Brunello stands out because of the brightness of its color. Many of the other wines of 2008 show garnet and browning amber hues, but this wine is ruby red with purple rims. It shows a soft and modern side with bright cherry, chocolate and nicely structured tannins.",91,La Magia 2008  Brunello di Montalcino
"Serious wines from a tiny inland appellation in Catalonia—that's Abadal, a maker of true terroir wines that succeed way more often than they disappoint. This blend of Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Syrah is minerally and full of red fruit and vanilla aromas. The palate is husky but correct, with full tannins, a kick of acidity and pure, ripe berry flavors. Even from a tough vintage it justifies its selected status.",91,Masies d'Avinyo 2002 Abadal Selecció Red (Pla de Bages)
"All coming from Block 1, this wine was fermented 65% whole cluster and aged for 20 months in neutral barrels. Pretty aromas of spice, flower, herb, cherry and earth give way to a full fruit-forward palate that shows a dazzling sense of purity and richness while also maintaining its restraint. It's a bit of a stylistic departure for the winery in terms of its richness but it still delivers big time.",92,W.T. Vintners 2014 Gorgeous Destiny Ridge Vineyard Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills)

"A fine Chardonnay, showing cool weather influence in the brisk acidity and ripe flavors, which veer toward tart green apples, peaches and tangerines. The oak has been tastefully applied.",90,Frank Family 2008 Reserve Chardonnay (Los Carneros)
"Deep, woody, leathery aromas of blackberry and baked plum set up a dense palate that's a touch heavy, with buttery oak notes. Herbal berry, pepper and graphite flavors are woody and finish with notes of green herbs, mint leaf and chocolate.",90,Viu Manent 2012 El Olivar Alto Single Vineyard Syrah (Colchagua Valley)
"Flat, disparate aromas of bread and white fruits are mild. On the palate, this is plump but lacks edge and structure. Briny flavors of tropical fruits finish foamy and with a pickled flavor.",84,Echeverria NV Espumante Brut Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (Central Valley)
"This Blanquette (made with 90% Mauzac) offers a bouquet full of bright crisp red apple and melon core. The texture is creamy with fine bubbles and medium acidity, and the palate is loaded with satisfying sweet citrus rind and toasty brioche flavors. Drink now.",86,Château Rives-Blanques 2008 Brut Sparkling (Blanquette de Limoux)
"The bouquet delivers a mix of lactic-smelling oak, herbal berry and finally a blast of char. The wine is full and resiny in feel, with oak-driven flavors of cassis, blackberry, chocolate and clove. On the finish, this tastes baked and oaky, with some heat.",87,Koyle 2010 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)

"Aromas of black plum, coffee and baking spice lead the nose on this hearty red. The ripe accessible palate displays prune, tobacco and vanilla framed in chewy assertive tannins. Drink through 2021.",88,Fattoria La Lecciaia 2011 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"On the lean side, this taut and crisp red-currant-flavored wine is dominated by acidity and dry tannins. It seems to miss out on generosity.",84,Domaine Poulleau Père et Fils 2010 Les Mondes Rondes  (Côte de Beaune)
"Aromas of apple and hay are slightly oily but nice. Bright acidity renders this fresh and not too chunky, while flavors of dry oak, melon and salted apple finish steady, with a hint of lemon. If you are interested in barrel-fermented Verdejo, this is a good place to start.",90,Emina 2015 Fermentado en Barrica Verdejo (Rueda)
"Spicy anise and cinnamon notes accentuate fresh red plum and cherry in this brisk medium-bodied Pinot Noir. Crisp and a bit cutting in mouth feel, it finishes moderately long on a lingering fringe of fine tannins.",87,Silver Thread 2014 STV Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes)
"Black pepper and boysenberries put oomph into this dark-colored and firmly structured wine. While vivid and concentrated, the fruit, spice and dark-chocolate flavors are not sweet, but beautifully dry and appetizing, made to pair with a rare steak or tender osso buco. It will drink best from 2019.",93,Theopolis 2013 Estate Grown Petite Sirah (Yorkville Highlands)
"This old-vine Zin contains a dash of Petite Sirah. It smells like bacon and wood smoke and tastes like smoked beef. It's an extreme version to say the least, and will not be for everyone.",85,Oak Ridge 2012 Big Bad Zin Zinfandel (Lodi)
"Caparzo delivers a killer Rosso di Montalcino from one of the most anticipated vintages of the past 10 years. It is intense and clean, with polished berry aromas of black cherry and red currant that are backed by savory spice and leather.",89,Caparzo 2010  Rosso di Montalcino
"This smooth and inviting blend is impressive for the price. With mildly herbal Carmenère-driven aromas of olive and peppery spice, and then a deep and structured palate feel, Gold is golden. Look for a ton of ripe plum and berry flavor touched up by oak, chocolate and pepper accents. On the finish, it's spicy, peppery, smooth and complete. Drink now–2016.",92,Estampa 2009 Gold Carménère-Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc-Petit Verdot Red (Colchagua Valley)
"This is one of those wines that could be anything from Chardonnay to Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc. It doesn't really matter, because it's pleasant and easy to drink, with sweet flavors of tangerines and vanilla.",86,Daniel Gehrs 2010 Oak Free Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"Scents of leather, smoke and mint give this Bordeaux-style red blend a savory intrigue. It has an open and finessed texture, but the acidity jumps high toward the finish, making the wine border on feeling shrill. Try pairing it with seared lamb chops with tapenade to help tame the acidity.",83,Veramar NV Rooster Red (Virginia)
"Le Arele is a woody, smoky red dessert wine with firm tannins behind chewy, sweet notes of mature blackberry, cherry, nutmeg, clove and ginger. Pair this wine with chewy chocolate brownies.",87,Giuseppe Lonardi 2007 Le Arele 500ml  (Recioto della Valpolicella Classico)
"Rich and aromatic, with a full blast of fragrant toasty oak and plenty of tropical fruit. The apple, mango and pear fruit that coats your mouth is round and ripe but not too thick or grabby. And the finish is perfectly smooth. Sure, it's a bit buttery and full, so no one will confuse it for Chablis. But in its class it's one of the best out there.",90,Montes 2001 Alpha Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)
"This full-bodied and smooth-textured wine has subtle aromas like cinnamon, mint and raspberry. Bold flavors recall ripe plums and dried cherries. A soft mouthfeel is partly due to light tannins.",87,Bogle 2013 Pinot Noir (California)
"Fresh raspberry sorbet aromas meet with an herbal edge of pine oil, eucalyptus leaf, green peppercorn and dark sandalwood on the very compelling nose of this bottling by Edgar Torres. It's extremely lively on the palate, light in body but heavy in acid and tannic structure, with wild thyme, mint and sage decorating the mellow red-fruit flavors.",94,Hug 2015 Rancho Ontiveros Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
This medium-bodied wine has modest fruit and herb aromas and similarly subdued flavors. It is clean and straightforward.,84,Honor Winery 2013 Serve White (California)
"This 100% varietal provides a pretty example of Petite Sirah, with appealing accents of dark coffee and plum. The soft, supple feel to the fruit flavors belies the firm tannins at this wine's core. Amaro-like bitters on the finish are the only thing that holds this wine back from reaching further heights.",88,Sawtooth 2011 Trout Trilogy Petite Sirah
"This has been a consistent bottling from Wolff. The '06 shows classic Edna Valley acidity and very ripe, long hangtime fruit flavors of pineapples, Key limes, papayas and mangoes. It finishes with rich honey, but the wine is thoroughly dry.",87,Wolff 2006 Old Vines Estate Chardonnay (Edna Valley)
"This blend of Syrah (50%), Petit Verdot (18%) and equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon carries appealing aromas of herbs, cherries, orange peel and sweet barrel spices. It shows a pleasing sense of restraint, accenting the Syrah's suppleness with an elegant styling that keeps the attention high.",90,Telaya 2011 Turas Red (Columbia Valley (WA))

This rare grape is planted in the Setúbal vineyards of José Maria da Fonseca.,88,José Maria da Fonseca 2015 Colecção Privada Moscatel Roxo (Península de Setúbal)
"Brawny, baked aromas include hints of animal, cola, blackberry and prune. This is fleshy, wide and fairly soft in build. Concentrated, blackened berry flavors share the stage with creamy oak and notes of vanilla and marshmallow. A chewy, soft finish is a bit mushy, so drink now.",90,Clos Berenguer del Molar 2013 Selecció Syrah (Priorat)
"In the Tejo region, Alvarinho loses its specific mineral and ripe creamy texture. What is has instead is intense fruitiness. Green and white fruits fill the glass with a fresh and youthful character. It's bright, crisp and ready to drink now.",87,Fiuza 2014 Alvarinho (Tejo)
"This acidity-driven wine has a sheer veneer of tannins over thinned red fruit, earth and cocoa powder. With such a light, simple touch, this wine is a good choice for those who usually order white wine.",84,Robertson Winery 2001 Merlot (Robertson)
"Heavy oak greets you on the nose in the form of shoe polish and blackened aromas. This feels ripe, solid and woody, with good structure. Flavors of plum, mint and oak resin turn spicy and minty if given time, while the finish is driven by crisp acidity and plum and raspberry flavors.",89,Sur de los Andes 2011 Gran Reserva Malbec (Mendoza)
"The bright red fruit on the nose of this wine is joined with graphite minerality and sweetly toasted oak. The palate is quite fruity, boasting Bing cherry and strawberry reduction sauce, picking up complexity from cracked black pepper.",86,Robert Hall 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)

"Vaguely Chardonnay-like, with peppery, peach aromas and flavors, bone dry, and a creamy mouthfeel. Not a lot of complexity, it's a country-style wine, with no flaws but kind of obvious. —S.H.",83,Repolusk 2000 Weissburgunder White (Austria)
"A mineral, textured wine, this is full of grassy gooseberry and grapefruit flavors. Fruit on the palate is accented with a chalky character and strong, very present acidity. Drink in six months.",87,Château Bonnet 2012  Bordeaux Blanc
"This darkly-colored wine is a little on the heavy, fruity side for a rosé. But it's fantastically delicious, offering waves of berries, cola and spices. The acidity is refreshingly high. You can drink this instead of a red wine with lighter meats, such as lamb or pork.",90,Lynmar 2012 Rosé of Pinot Noir Rosé (Russian River Valley)
"Friendly apple fruit sits easily on nose and palate before a refreshing, clean finish. This is an easy, fruit-driven white ideal for a party.",86,Dopff & Irion 2014 Cuvée René Dopff Pinot Blanc (Alsace)

"The merest hint of red currant plays on the subtle nose. The tender red-currant fruit is enhanced by the very lively frothy mousse that fizzes away on the palate. This is light, fruit-driven, refreshing and easy—ideal as an enlivening apéritif.",88,Joseph Cattin NV Brut Rosé Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"Made with organically farmed grapes, this blend of Sangiovese and 10% Merlot highights earthy aromas of underbrush, moist earth and dark berry. The lively palate offers ripe black cherry, nectarine zest and a hint of ground pepper while ripe tannins provide the framework. Enjoy through 2016.",89,La Selva 2013  Morellino di Scansano

Lacks a certain finesse, but definitely a worthwhile venture by the winery, and a wine to watch.",88,Marimar Estate 2008 Don Miguel Vineyard Syrah-Tempranillo (Russian River Valley)
"Dense, baked and mulled blackberry and cassis aromas include bold but classy oak notes.

"The very fine Allen Vineyard, on Westside Road in the tenderloin of the appellation, has produced a high-quality Chardonnay that is capable of some bottle aging. Dry and savory, it shows a strong mineral component to the pie filling limes, lemondrop, apple, fig and roasted hazelnut flavors. Should develop before fading, over the next 5 years.",92,Williams Selyem 2005 Allen Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"A great wine, much more than only a Champagne, this is impressively rich and ripe, with crisp yellow fruits, spices and layers of toast.

"This firm, tannic wine's plum and black cherry aromas are matched by oaky maple and spice scents. Toasty, spicy black fruit and mocha flavors finish with a wave of toast, chocolate and spice. This is more bullish than elegant; drink through 2021.",91,Matsu 2013 El Recio  (Toro)
"Floral wine, enticingly perfumed. It is dry, nutty, layered with acidity. White fruits and pineapple go with the intense lime. Worth aging for at least a year, maybe more.",90,Domaine de la Rouletière 2010 Sec  (Vouvray)

On the finish, some cinnamon spice adds character to the baked-apple flavors. With no flaws, this is the epitome of affordable, drinkable Chardonnay. Best Buy.",88,Montes 2002 Reserve - Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Curicó Valley)
"Showing the richness of the vineyard, this delivers huge, flamboyant flavors of apricot and tangerine jam. While it's technically dry, there's a honeyed sweetness that suggests a touch of botrytis. It's a strong wine, unafraid to command a boldness that may not be for everyone. This is distinctly Californian in style, and as it loses fruit with age, it will develop nut and earthy notes.",92,Migration 2010 Charles Heintz Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"Made with organically farmed grapes, this charming, easy-drinking red is delicately scented with red berry and spice. The luminous, silky palate offers crushed strawberry, juicy cherry and white cinnamon alongside fresh acidity. Serve slightly chilled for the perfect summer red.",88,Feudo di Santa Tresa 2014 Frappato (Terre Siciliane)
"Smoky aromas of fresh-cut wood blend with berry and cassis form a welcoming, generous bouquet. This feels lively on the palate, albeit tartaric. Oaky plum, cassis and vanilla flavors finish full and agreeable. Drink through 2019.",91,Navarro Correas 2011 Alegoría Gran Reserva Malbec (Mendoza)
"Earthy notes of licorice, bark and bramble are prominent on the nose of this wine, framing the black berry, plum and boysenberry core. The mouthfeel is lush and ripe, with a subtle creaminess that's complemented by notes of baking spice and cocoa powder on the finish. Drink now–2018.",88,Graham Beck 2012 The Game Reserve Pinotage (Western Cape)
"This pale salmon-pink bubbly opens with frothy bubbles and an inviting note of hard candy. A rounded strawberry flavor unfolds on the palate and finishes dry, making this a lively, ideal party wine that will please many.",88,Schlumberger Wein- und Sektkellerei 2012 Brut Rosé Sparkling (Österreichischer Sekt)
"This Pinot is ripe in jammy cherry fruit, and it has a smoky, buttery richness from oak. But it's a little soft and heavy for the variety, which is perhaps to be expected given its Alexander Valley origin.",86,Alexander Valley Vineyards 2010 Wetzel Family Estate Pinot Noir (Alexander Valley)
"Among the greatest expressions of Fiano, Cometa is a full and generous effort, with deep layers of passion fruit and stone fruit, plus touches of vanilla, honey and light spice. The concentration and freshness is wonderful, and the wine would pair well with steamed lobsters or buttery crab legs.",92,Planeta 2011 Cometa Fiano (Sicilia)
Vermentino from southern Tuscany achieves a special richness and density that is well suited to the variety. This expression is smooth and creamy with some acidity on the close and lingering flavors of peach and honey.,86,Caparzo 2007 Doga delle Clavule Vermentino (Toscana)
"Well balanced, this red fruited-wine is also fully structured with a mineral background. With a dosage that brings out the texture as well as the fruit, this is a great apéritif-style of wine. Drink now.",88,Thiénot NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne)
"Blackberry paste and a slightly more tangy red fruit mix with cocoa dust, Middle Eastern spice, leather and black rocks on the nose of this blend of 83% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Cabernet Franc, 4% Petit Verdot and 3% Malbec. Tangy but ripe plum juice mixes with lifting spearmint and dill herbals on the palate.",92,Happy Canyon Vineyard 2011 Barrack Brand Red (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
"This restrained, medium-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon is a solid value. On the nose, cedar, vanilla and cassis elements blend together easily, while brown sugar and vanilla flavors are supported by just enough cassis and black cherry fruit. Drink now–2028.",90,Wildberry Estate 2013 Two Passions Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River)
"Fresh but not overly racy, with apple and pear aromas. There's ample snap and pop to the palate, but not a whole lot of body or specificity of flavors. That said, the tastes of lemon and green apple are clean albeit shallow, and the finish is more of the same. Drink now.",86,Undurraga 2008 Aliwen Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley)
"Attractive floral aromas and bright cherry and raspberry flavors make a light, refreshing impression. This medium-bodied wine has light tannins and lively acidity in the texture.",87,Tortoise Creek 2015 Mission Grove Pinot Noir (California)
"A good wine, dry and softly tannic, with cherry, red currant, violet, cocoa and sandalwood flavors, and it has an easy-drinking quality that makes it a good companion to steak. Seems best soon for its precocious fruit.",88,Selene 2008 Frediani Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley)
"This is a smooth, dry and well-integrated white, highlighted in apricot, peach and lemongrass, with an herbal undertone. It's ready for the table, with food-friendly acidity and medium body weight.",88,MacLeod 2016 Marie's Cuvée Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Valley)
"This Sémillon-Sauvignon Blanc blend is firm, powerful and polished. The fruit runs the gamut from citrus to melon to white peach, finishing with some youthful bite. Already a succulent, mouthfilling gem, but should improve for another five years.",92,Insania 2010 White (Red Mountain)
"Nutty and lush with layers of peach, pear and lime fruit, this is a medium-bodied and well-balanced white. It's refreshing while offering both length and breadth on the palate.",91,Eric Kent 2015 Cuvée Renee Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County)
"Musky aromas of red apple skins and stone fruits are mild but mostly clean. This Shiraz-Cabernet blend feels solid and full for rosé. Peppery, leafy flavors of spiced berry, apple and olive finish chunky, dry and slightly bitter.",85,Valle Hermoso 2015 Rosé (Central Valley)
"Solid and tannic, very firm from the opening to the finish. It is based around a dark core of wood and spice as well as more juicy fruit flavors. The wine needs time to round out and bring more of the juiciness to the fore.",87,Château les Mottes Pradier 2011  Côtes de Bourg
"New leather, rose, violet, menthol and dark spice aromas set the tone on this luminous red. It's more about finesse than muscle, delivering tight layers of cherry, raspberry, mint and white pepper while tightly-knit refined tannins provide the taut framework. Bright acidity gives it intensity while a mineral note further lifts the finish. Give it time to soften and fully develop. Drink 2023–2043.",95,Fratelli Alessandria 2013 Monvigliero  (Barolo)
"This bright rosato delivers a core of wild cherry, juicy strawberry and crushed raspberry, while notes of white pepper and clove add interest. Crisp acidity generates a clean, fresh finish.",87,Cantele 2013 Negroamaro Negroamaro (Salento)
"This wine's name translates to “cherry,” and cherries are in its aroma along with spice. The palate shows a juicy, forward fruity character, a tang of acidity and soft tannins. It's a fine wine, but not for long-term aging so drink now and over the next few months.",89,Pascal Aufranc 2012 Les Cerisiers Vieilles  Vignes  (Juliénas)
"A crowd-pleasing Barbera full of muted dark fruit, leathery aromas accented by cherry cola and blue and blackberry flavors that's soft and drinkable and packed with acidity.",87,Sobon Estate 2010 Barbera (Amador County)
"The Romans made it to Sancerre, hence the name of this wine. The flavors are rich, with a mineral edge to the notes of green fruits, plums and greengages and a serious citrus core. With its structure, the wine needs to age for 2–3 years.",92,Domaine Fouassier 2010 Les Romains  (Sancerre)
"This wine has the ripe fruitiness of the vintage, fresh and crisp although with a rich background of apple and pear flavors. Not aged in wood, the wine is all fruit with lively final acidity.",85,Château Lapinesse 2014  Graves
"This wine's peach, melon and flowers aromas are bright. The palate is dry and fleshy with a bitter note that distracts.",83,3 Horse Ranch Vineyards 2014 Vivacious White
"Smoky, charred aromas of maple, blackened spices and baked berry fruits set up a woody, fully oaked palate with good texture and weight. This features a blast of hickory flavor on top of berry and plum fruit, while the finish is grabby and tannic.",89,Casado Morales 2011  Rioja
"Crisp and dry, this is a medium-bodied, slightly austere wine. Hints of smoke or stuck flint join with grapefruit rind on the nose, while a slightly bitter note appears on the palate and persists through the finish.",84,Wild South 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"This is a textured wine, showing minerality and a tight character. Firm and closed, it needs to age, with its crisp stone fruit flavors and tangy, zesty fruitiness. Drink from 2016.",88,Domaine de la Pepière 2013 Les Gras Moutons Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"Made with 65% Nebbiolo, 20% Vespolina and 15% Uva Rara, this polished red from Piedmont offers aromas and flavors of dried red cherry, clove, baking spice and rust. It's well balanced, with silky tannins and fresh acidity while a graphite note closes the finish.",90,Vallana 2009  Boca
"Marked by aromas of raspberry liqueur, this is a sweet, listless Grenache. Sourced from a good site in Mendocino.",81,Claudia Springs 2010 Rhodes Vineyards Grenache (Redwood Valley)
This Brut Prosecco Superiore opens with mineral dryness and a touch of smoke or crushed granite that gives it a steely and vibrant personality. White almond and citrus mark the close.,87,De Stefani NV Brut  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"This is a kitchen sink-style blend of 11 different varieties with Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot making up nearly 75% of the mix. It offers direct, appealing notes of cocoa, sugared plum, blueberry, black olive and high-toned herbs. The black and blue fruit flavors are sugary-sweet and palate-coating, with cocoa accents on the finish.",89,Tamarack Cellars 2013 Firehouse Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"With ripe, forward cherry, raspberry, cola and toasty oak flavors, this is a Syrah to drink now. The tannins are soft and velvety, and there's just enough acidity for balance.",86,Lafond 2011 SRH Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills)
"A big, lush, exuberant Zinfandel, stuffed with sun-ripened fruit flavors of dark berries, coffee, chocolate and spice. Drink this dry, warming wine now.",87,Eberle 2006 Steinbeck Vineyard & Wine-Bush Vineyard Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"Iron and rose petals mix with hot gravel and olallieberry on the nose of this concentrated bottling by the Fess Parker family's Rhône-variety-focused brand. Dried black cherries and heady anise power the palate, with violet in the background.",91,Epiphany 2012 Grenache (Santa Barbara County)
"Blue fruit, flower and light oxidative aromas lead to restrained fruit flavors that taper toward the finish.",86,Gordon Estate 2014 Estate Grown Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a firm wine with ripe Merlot fruits that are still sheathed in tannins. Densely textured, it is rich with berries and a stalky character that needs to soften. Wait for this solid, concentrated and ageworthy wine until 2017.",90,Château de l'Annonciation 2011  Saint-Émilion
"Classic Weinert wine; meaning it's well-aged, mature and sort of throwback. It's not purple and saturated and sticky; instead it's medium-weight and a touch scratchy, with roasted berry aromas followed by dry cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. A touch of burnt brown sugar offers balance and sweetness, and as a whole it seems ready to drink.",88,Weinert 2002 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Along with the Dolcetto, this Petite Sirah tops the new releases for this micro-boutique winery. Bright and lightly toasty, it's a forward wine, with pretty cherry, cola and earth components. An appealing and supple streak of leather comes with hints of spice and butterscotch, all woven together seamlessly.",90,Animale 2011 Petite Sirah (Yakima Valley)
"This is an off-dry, lightly pétillant wine, with strawberry fruits and light acidity. Drink immediately.",83,Casa de Vila Verde 2016 Pluma Rosé (Vinho Verde)
"One of the better Sangioveses out there, although it's more like Zinfandel than the great grape of Tuscany. It's robust in rustic tannins, with ripe, extracted flavors of wild forest berries, cola, licorice, beef teriaki and sandalwood. At its best now.",87,IL Gioiello 2006 Estate Sangiovese (Amador County)
"Lively freshness and tangy citrus notes open this easy-going Italian white. This Pinot Grigio shows more intensity of aromas with layers of grapefruit, peach and honeydew melon. In the mouth, it feels smooth and polished.",87,Maso Poli 2011 Pinot Grigio (Trentino)
"A complex Champagne, with its apricot, green plum and pink grapefruit flavors, mixed with a rich, creamy texture and soft acidity. The final tastes are of lychees, with some toastiness.",92,Chartogne-Taillet NV Tête de Cuvée Fiacre Brut  (Champagne)
"The winery's entry-level bottling is firm, supple and classy, with a precisely defined configuration of fruit, earth and mineral. Red plum, black cherry, iron filings, clean earth and graphite combine gracefully, finished with a hint of toasted cashews.",91,Blakeslee 2012 Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"Steely at first, this wine softens like butter on the palate, with a luxurious, silky feel, complemented by lemon zest and brine. Lighter in style, it never holds back on texture or flavor, making for a beautiful, food-friendly white.",92,Martin Ray 2013 Mill Station Vineyard Chardonnay (Green Valley)
"Stewed black plum and tangy black cherry fruit meet baking spice and cola on the nose of this bottling from Lompoc-based Brian Loring. The palate is tangy with black cherry and cranberry, with a touch of herbs and forest floor.",91,Loring Wine Company 2015 Kessler-Haak Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"This opens with a whiff of green and clam shell but quickly transitions to black plum and berry scents. Tannic and rugged on the palate, it has a mix of blackberry, chocolate and herbal flavors. The finish is firm, with length and more than enough power.",88,François Lurton 2009 Gran Lurton Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Shades of crushed stone and granite add a penetrating minerality to the ripe, rich raspberry and cherry flavors of this nervy wine. A hint of dried herb and velvety tannins round out the finish that's long and lingering.",90,Vylyan 2008 Pinot Noir (Villány)
"Fresh and fragrant, this delivers aromas of ripe orchard fruits and nuts, with a whiff of yellow wild flowers. The linear palate offers crisp pear, apple and lightly toasted almond alongside brisk acidity and a firm, refined perlage. It closes on a note of fresh peach and chopped herbs.",91,Sorelle Bronca NV Brut  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Crisp, focused aromas of ripe berry fruits, hot asphalt and spice are potent and excellent. From one of the Priorat's highest locales (2,400 feet), this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Garnacha tastes of spicy plum, crushed peppercorn and schist. Warm finishing notes of minerality combined with strong fruit flavors are thorough and complex; drink through 2028.",94,Celler Pasanau 2012 Finca La Planeta Red (Priorat)
"In this blend of fruit from Lewis and Phinny Hill vineyards, sweet spice, baking spice, vanilla and dark fruit lead to silky dark fruit and barrel flavors. The wood influence is primary but it still brings a lot of appeal.",91,Pursued by Bear 2013 Baby Bear Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Highly herbal aromas shadow black cherry, plum, oregano and beet scents. This feels plump and full, while the flavor profile is pure Carmenère—herbal, minty and peppery as well as black-fruit driven. Heat, herbs and spice are draped on the finish of this love-it-or-leave-it Chilean specialty.",88,Casa Silva 2013 Los Lingues Vineyard Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"Made with 50% Sangiovese, 30% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has aromas of blue flower and red berry. The easy-drinking palate offers black cherry, black currant and ground pepper while mellow tannins offer soft support. Drink soon.",87,Cala de' Poeti 2013  Maremma Toscana
"Made of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Syrah and 10% Teroldego, this boasts alluring ripe black currant and white pepper aromas, with a whiff of graphite. The firm palate offers juicy blackberry, black plum and tobacco notes, held together by polished tannins. Enjoy now–2025.",92,Michele Satta 2012 I Castagni  (Bolgheri Superiore)
"Very ripe and sweet in orange, lemon and lime flavors that are almost sugary, like a fruit drink. At the same time, there's a brisk cut of acidity. The result feels odd.",84,Joseph Phelps 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (St. Helena)
"Tight and focused, this has a fine core of black cherry and cassis. Layers of coffee and dark chocolate are wrapped around the fruit, and the wine is compact and textural. Excellent now, but probably better in a few years.",90,Maryhill 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Dark, muscular and very oaky, especially early on where it smells charred and bacony, with black fruit in the background. Airing unleashes chewy, roasted berry, plum, carob and herbal flavors, and throughout there is a strong oak element. Finishes big and thick, with toast and leafy, herbal Pinot Noir nuances.",88,Kingston Family 2009 Tobiano Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)
"With a high proportion of the local Rolle grape in the blend, this is a lightly perfumed wine with a strong herbal element. It is a ripe finely structured wine, with great acidity and orange flavors. A style of wine that will be better for a few more months, it should be drunk from late 2017.",91,Bernard Magrez 2016 Château des Muraires Séduction Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"True to the ambitious Damiani style, this wine has tightly packed fruit tones with a generous overlay of vanilla and mocha from toasty new oak. Intoxicating flavors of caramelized pineapple and boysenberry frame the dense palate while refined tannins provide a counterbalance to the dense fruit. The finish is moderately long and slightly drying, winding up with a chocolate note. Best 2011–2013.",88,Damiani 2007 Meritage (Finger Lakes)
"Grapey and sappy, with almost candied cherry fruit, this is a young wine made to be consumed young. Try chilling it to give the cherry and chocolate flavors greater focus and quaff it with burgers this summer. —J.C.",84,Lindemans 2001 Bin 50 Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)
"The wood and alcohol seem to get out front of aromas of plum, raspberry and medicine cabinet. Flavors are sweet and concentrated with a tart, cranberry-filled finish. A lot of good things are going on but they don't quite seem to all come together.",88,Obelisco Estate 2012 BDX Merlot (Red Mountain)
"This will impress red wine lovers with its sheer deliciousness. It offers waves of blackberry and blueberry jam, dark chocolate, anise and cedar wood flavors, leading to a long, spicy finish. It's a bit soft, which might limit ageability, but it is a lovely wine to drink over the next few years.",93,Sojourn 2009 Vineyard Georges III Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"Crisp red plum and cherry flavors accented with ripe, brambly wood notes are pleasant, but coarse tannins combined with a slightly craggy acidity make this Long Island Cab Franc less than harmonious on the palate.",82,Pellegrini Vineyards 2005 Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island)
"The oak is at the fore, with notes of roasted coffee beans, char and sawdust. The tannins are quite grippy with vanilla flavors taking over.",87,Elevation Cellars 2011 Black Peak StoneTree Vineyard Tempranillo (Wahluke Slope)
"Gritty, tarry aromas of black olive and raspberry lead to a hard palate with choppy acidity. Sizzling plum and currant flavors come with a burnt note, while a long finish is bolstered by preserving acidity. This is a patented Chilean Cab: expect a heavy herbal character centered around olive and eucalyptus.",88,Morandé 2012 Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"At 15.9% abv, this is a monster by Finger Lakes standards, but it's unsurprising perhaps for such a hot vintage. A tad jammy on the palate, it's sweet with red cherry fruit that's framed by herbaceous green notes and layers of soft, furry tannins.",86,Lakewood 2010 Reserve Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes)
"This crisp, balanced wine has lively citrus fruits, light spiciness and some tight, mineral acidity. Drink now.",87,Les Parcelles de Stéphane Derenoncourt 2016  Bordeaux Blanc
"Very fresh although not particularly fruity aromas of raspberry mesh with allspice, thyme and tarragon on the nose of this block-designate bottling from the historic vineyard. Energetic and lighter red-fruit flavors like pomegranate show on the sip, where fennel is the dominant spice.",92,Foxen 2015 Block 43 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"A ripely smooth, polished wine, the new wood a major constituent of its character. It has a severe structure, dark and concentrated, but the texture of the very ripe fruit is rounded, jammy, giving a more generous potential. Age for at least five years.",92,Château Pape Clément 2006  Pessac-Léognan
"This blend of 60% Malvasia delle Lipari, 30% Carricante and 10% other native grapes features aromas of subtle oak, coconut and hints of exotic fruit. The round palate delivers sweet nectarine, peach and juicy tropical fruit accented with Mediterranean herbs.",88,Tenuta di Castellaro 2011 Pomice White (Sicilia)
"Strong aromatics introduce an oily-textured wine, very typical of this grape. The flavors are of bergamot, superripe lychee and sweet spice. This is definitely exotic.",84,Rosenhof 2006 Muskat Ottonel (Burgenland)
"A tremendous wine that easily merits being Barnett's most expensive release. Shows the ripe blackberry and black currant flavors and new oak that are so easily achieved, with yet near perfect tannins and a dryness unusual in a Cabernet this fruity. The combination of opposites makes this mountain wine noteworthy, as well as ageable. Now–2017.",95,Barnett 2007 Rattlesnake Hill Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District)
"90-92. Barrel sample. A herbaceous, fruity wine, with its acidity well integrated into the ripe, bright fruits. The wine is light, fresh and crisp, with an attractive lemon-curd note.",91,Château Picque Caillou 2011 Barrel Sample  (Pessac-Léognan)
"This basic, oaky red wine tastes overripe and raisinated with notes of bitterness.",83,Heibel Ranch 2010 Lappa's Red (Napa Valley)
"This is one dark, intense Ribera del Duero with loads of lush black-fruit aromas matched against minerality and fine French-oak scents. It is tight as a drum on the palate, with wiry acidity and rocky tannins. Flavors of oak-driven coconut and cream sit on top of blackberry and cola, while the finish ends abruptly, with hardness. Drink through 2024; 150 cases made.",92,Bodegas y Viñedos Tábula 2009 Clave de Tábula  (Ribera del Duero)
"A touch of roasted coffee clings to the nose, otherwise it wants to give little away. The taut palate barely shows the dark fruit, so tight is it with a fine-grained tannin structure. This is dense and sumptuous, but has ample freshness as a counterweight. It still needs to mellow and show its fruit. Drink 2018–2025.",91,Gunter Triebaumer 2014 Blaufränkisch-Cabernet Red (Burgenland)
"Airy and creamy aromas of sliced pluot, Asian pear, fresh orange rind and a touch of wet bread make for a compelling and zesty bubbly. The sip starts with a citrusy tang, continues with riper flashes of nectarine on the midpalate and shows a yeasty wash throughout. There's serious textural grip to the palate.",91,Presqu'ile 2012 Brut Cuvée Sparkling (Santa Maria Valley)
"This is one-third Cab Franc, one-third Merlot and one-third split between Syrah and Malbec—a who's who (or what's hot) of Southern Oregon viticulture. In the glass it's aromatically interesting, with citrus, leather and berry scents. In the mouth it's quite dry and leathery tasting, though with ample breathing time the fruit comes up.",87,Jaxon 2013 Forté Red (Southern Oregon)
"A deliciously light, fresh rosé, its crisp raspberry flavors enhanced by acidity. The finish is a full burst of fruit salad.",86,Domaine des Corbillières 2007 Rosé Pinot Noir (Touraine)
"White spring blossom and citrus aromas waft out of the glass. On the palate, crisp acidity brightens creamy apple, pear and tangerine zest. It's quite simply crisp and delicious.",91,Tiefenbrunner 2016 Pinot Grigio (Vigneti delle Dolomiti)
"With integrated leather, dried fruit, and tomato aromas, this is just what textbook Brunello is all about. It's sly, deep and complex, albeit a wee bit tight and tangy. Time should soften it up, and then it will deliver all the goods. Drink in 2007.",92,Le Macioche 1999  Brunello di Montalcino
"Aromas of mature plum, dark berry and violet lead the way. On the straightforward palate, hints of toast and espresso add a bit of depth to the dried cherry core. Dusty but fleeting tannins lead to a slightly raspy finish.",87,Villa Calcinaia 2012 Piegaia Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"This wine, which is from the Napa side of the sprawling Carneros appellation, is superb. It's soft, rich and chocolaty, with a rich vein of ripe blackberries, but it also has a tannic structure and dry finish that make it balanced and complex. Drink now–2015.",93,Joseph Phelps 2009 Larry Hyde & Sons Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley)
"Light aromas of raspberry, coriander, vanilla and barrel spice are followed by ripe rich red-fruit flavors that glide on the finish. A pillowy mouthfeel only heightens the interest.",91,Palencia 2014 Grenache (Yakima Valley)
"This southern Rhône-style blend is very soft and as sweet as a fruit pastry. It has jammy or pie-filling flavors of cherries, raspberries, red plums and cocoa, with a dusting of pepper and cinnamon.",84,Municipal Winemakers 2007 Bright Red Red (Santa Barbara County)
"Just about the best white wine out of Australia this year, this Roussanne isn't a fleshy wine, but it has beauty, power and structure in its corner. Full-bodied with powdery tannins, it has flavors of honeydew, peach fuzz and mineral, and an herbal-peppery finish that lingers on the tongue. Nose is a tantalizing mix of marzipan, jasmine and clover. Just excellent.",93,Giaconda 2001 Aeolia Roussanne (Victoria)
"This block selection hews closer to more conventional Oregon Pinots than the rest of the winery's portfolio, with powerful focused black-cherry fruit at its heart. It was fermented with native yeast and spent 17 months in barrel, 12% new. Those flavors come through in deft touches of graham cracker and cocoa powder, underscored with a wet-cement minerality.",92,Native Flora 2014 The Heretic North Slope Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Despite a savory backbone of slate and tart, tangerine acidity, sun-kissed cantaloupe, pineapple and citrus take center stage in this full-bodied Riesling. It's fresh and dry yet lusciously mouthfilling, clinging on the palate through a long, meandering finish. It's gorgeous already but should develop well through 2028.",94,Hermann J. Wiemer 2015 Magdalena Vineyard Riesling (Seneca Lake)
"This Pinot Noir needs a few years in the cellar to mellow, although you can decant it now to let it breathe. It's very rich in cherries, raspberries, licorice and sweet, smoky oak, with a soft, silky texture. Shows a real sense of sophistication.",92,Thomas Fogarty 2008 Windy Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Soft and semisweet, this simple wine has sugary cherry juice flavors. It contains 18% Syrah.",81,Fallbrook 2005 Reserve Merlot (California)
"With blackberry, tobacco and oak flavors, this is a sound Cabernet to drink with everyday fare. It's dry and smooth through the spicy finish.",84,Parkers Estate 2011 Old Vine Street Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"This luminous, ruby colored wine opens with a lovely bouquet of violet, rose, new leather, woodland berry and baking spice. The bright palate is loaded with finesse and smooth tannins, deliveing crushed red cherry and wild strawberry accented by clove and cinnamon. Enjoy now through 2020.",92,Biondi 2012 San Nicolò  (Etna)
"Made in the winery's style, which is ripe, full-bodied and rustic. This one's extracted in jammy blackberries, plums and currants, with some raisins on the finish, which is dry and spicy.",84,Peterson 2009 Old School Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"On first take, this hefty Carmenère smells almost entirely of massive oak and related vanilla and maple, although airing calms things down. A dense, heavily oaked palate is extracted and full in body. Charred oak and coffee flavors cover blackberry and cassis notes, while this is flush on a huge finish.",89,Montes 2014 Alpha Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"There's a change in the 2011 blend: There's no Roussanne, and it's almost one-quarter Marsanne. It's a tight, steely wine, with bracing acidity and citrus rind flavor, which is reflective of the vintage. Grapefruit and Meyer lemon notes come into play, and it remains balanced through the finish",88,Ott & Murphy 2011 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Wild berry, moist soil and a hint of menthol lead the way. The silky, easy-drinking palate shows polish and charm, offering juicy wild cherry, white pepper and a hint of anise alongside sleek tannins and bright acidity.",88,Castello di Ama 2013  Chianti Classico
"Lively and elegant, this fruit-filled wine from Kevin Arnold is perfect for a gourmet meal in the summer. Fresh tropical fruit flavors like lychee mingle with a balanced acidity and impressive mouthfeel. Long finish.",89,Waterford 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Stellenbosch)
"Aromas of dried yellow fruit, candied citrus zest and a whiff of oak lead the nose. The palate offers toasted bread crust, candied lemon drop, walnut and ripe golden apple alongside bright acidity and a firm perlage.",89,Matteo Correggia 2005 Severina Blanc de Blancs Extra Brut Metodo Classico Sparkling (Vino Spumante)
"With a dusty, cola-like quality, this flirty Mourvèdre gets better and better over time in the glass, unveiling layers of floral, earthy and wild raspberry notes sprinkled with a suggestion of gamy meat. With firm, chewy tannins and a mouth-coating texture, it showcases El Dorado's decomposed granite soils and the prowess of the winemaker with these grapes.",92,Donkey & Goat 2012 The Prospector Mourvèdre (El Dorado)
"Silky, spicy and roundly fruity, this estate-grown Viognier brings fruit flavors of citrus, melon and a hint of pineapple. Nicely woven together, it finishes with a citrus rind edge that's softened with a suggestion of cream.",88,Amalie Robert 2010 Our Muse Viognier (Willamette Valley)
"This nonvintage wine comes packaged in 187ml cans (four to a pack)—each good for one generous glass pour. Pleasant cherry flavors carry it through, and it's a fine porch pounder, or safe on a hike or campout (just pack the cans back out). Maybe the packaging puts the thought of metal in a taster's head, but there seems to be a slightly tinny aftertaste.",87,The Great Oregon Wine Company NV Pinot Noir (Oregon)
"Here's a ripe, chewy expression of Vino Nobile that opens with aromas of black cherry, dark fruit and even a touch of strawberry. The jammy fruit element is supported by wood tones that add structure and depth without taking away from the overall picture.",88,Icario 2008  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano
"Made from 80% Grenache and 20% Syrah this wine opens with a rich mouthfeel and flavors of tobacco and blackberry jam, layers of smoky meat in the foreground. At 15.9% alcohol it devolves into pruny territory, a tad hot on the finish. Drink now.",86,Baiocchi Wines 2011 del Maggio Grenache-Syrah (Fair Play)
"Intense in black, brooding blueberry and cinnamon spice, this wine is robustly varietal if not a bit overdone, dense and syrupy with challenged acidity.",86,Pezzi King 2013 Hunny Hill Reserve Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"Shows slightly sweet flavors of pineapple marmalade, green apple tart, honeysuckle and buttered toast, fortunately balanced with crisp, citrusy acidity. It was made from grapes grown in the Los Alamos region of Santa Barbara County.",87,Acre 2008 Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"Matured for 12 months in oak, this wine is full and ripe. It has juicy black currant fruits, plenty of firm tannins to balance and the typical minerality that comes from Douro schist. Drink this impressive wine now.",91,Rozes 2012 Quinta do Pégo Grande Reserva Red (Douro)
"Hints of white blossom mix with faint notes of pear to create a delicately balanced, fresh and spring-like wine that is as light as gossamer. This has verve and freshness, tender, blossomy aromatics and immense charm. Drink as soon as possible while its elderflower notes shimmer lastingly.",89,Nigl 2015 Gelber Muskateller (Niederösterreich)
"This Malbec-Merlot-Tannat blend from northerly Salta is bright purple in color, with compact aromas of wood smoke, graphite, ink and blackberry. The acidity is high but functions as a brace for plum, blackberry and cassis flavors. A crisp, clampy finish is edgy due to aforementioned racy acidity. Drink through 2020.",89,Domingo Molina 2011 Rupestre Red (Salta)
"This is an exclamation point of a wine. The fruit pops with pure notes of black and red plum along with herbs and milk chocolate. It's fresh and fruit-filled, with an elegant, palate-coating texture that simply dazzles the senses.",92,Walla Walla Vintners 2012 Dolcetto (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Chunky aromas are lacking in fruit. The palate feels pithy and citric, while pyrazines and bland citrus drive the flavor profile on this Verdejo-Viura blend that's past its prime.",82,Pedro Escudero 2012 Fuente Milano Verdejo-Viura (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"This wine has a gorgeous golden color, and follows through with a beautifully honeyed nose of vibrancy and richness. Lemongrass and ginger provide an exotic landscape on which to build integrated oak and lingering acidity.",93,Hunnicutt 2014 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"This pretty Cab Franc opens with vibrant notes of red cherry and blackberry that are infused with spicy notes of green pepper, fynbos and fresh minty herbs. Fine yet structured tannins feel green and woody, while flavors of plum and cherry skin unfold on the finish. Drink now–2018.",88,Raats Family 2013 Dolomite Cabernet Franc (Stellenbosch)
"Bright and crisp with just a touch of vanilla along with the more citrus character. The wine has red berry fruits, a light structure, fragrant, ready to drink.",86,Domaine de la Sanglière 2012 Breezette Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"A softer, more forward style than the Old Stage, showing more density and soft tannins. Light cherry fruit, good balance, texture, weight. Some hints of wood, earth and mineral too.",87,Valley View 1999 Anna Maria - Quail Run Merlot (Rogue Valley)
"91–93. Barrel sample. Showing both a firm tannic structure and jammy black fruits, this is a finely ripe and full wine. It has spice, sweet fruits and a solid tannic core. A wine that is likely to age well.",92,Château Le Boscq 2012 Barrel Sample  (Saint-Estèphe)
"This delicious wine shows focused black cherry, cola, cream soda and baking spice flavors. It's perfectly balanced, with all components in proportion and settled nicely together. Drink now through 2022.",92,Domaine Drouhin Oregon 2015 Dundee Hills Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Rubbery, medicinal aromas suggest iodine and latex. This blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah is heavy and flabby, with baked, herbal flavors that finish saucy and show notes of tomato and fennel.",83,Chakana 2013 Estate Selection Red (Mendoza)
"The nose on this Romanian blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Feteasca Neagra is dark and smoky with charred oak, coffee and tobacco melding into an herbaceous, woody backdrop. Juicy black plums and cherries are offset by strong grape and wood tannins and notes of cigar smoke and black pepper on the palate. It's fine now, but a year or two in the cellar might smooth out some jagged edges.",86,Terra Romana 2007 Cuvée Charlotte Red (Dealu Mare)
"It's all there in this Chardonnay, with barrel influences of butterscotch and toast, crisp Russian River acidity, and ripe flavors of pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes and green apples. Feels a bit sharp, so don't over-chill, and you can even give it a decant.",87,Bourassa Vineyards 2008 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This opens with aromas suggesting toast, menthol, mature berry, coffee and a balsamic note. On the full-bodied palate, notes of white pepper, cinnamon and powdered sage accent dried black cherry while firm, close-grained tannins provide the framework.",89,Negretti 2012 Bricco Ambrogio  (Barolo)
"With a soft, velvety mouthfeel, this bi-county Cabernet offers lush blackberry, blueberry, chocolate and spice flavors that are gently touched by smoky oak. This earns extra points for elegance and sipability.",87,Jade Mountain 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa County-Lake County)
"This easygoing, generously fruity wine has candied fruit aromas, just enough tannin for balance and leaves a nice blackberry nuance on the finish.",87,Tom Gore 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"This wine veers between firm tannins from old wood and red fruit acidity, without finding balance. It's very dry, with a hard edge.",83,Château Toumilon 2009  Graves
"This shows something of Margaux's—the neighboring appellation—delicacy, allied with firm, dry tannins. It has the dense structure and ripeness characteristic of the vintage, with a rich black-fruit flavor and acidity. It's a wine for long-term aging.",91,Château Cambon la Pelouse 2010  Haut-Médoc
"This is one of the most expensive white wines on the Central Coast, and it's mighty good, with aromas of cheese rind, lime pith, slate and tiny bits of Marcona almond and oak smoke. It's laser-focused on the chalky, mineral-laden palate, with poached apples in the midpalate and lemon peels and tangerine rinds throughout.",95,Sandhi 2013 Bentrock Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"The secret to this wine's quality, according to the producer, is to play Mozart non stop in the vineyards. Like the classical pianist's music, this wine displays both high notes and low notes, but with a beautiful, fruit-forward bouquet and a lean, crisp feel in the mouth.",88,Paradiso di Frassina 2008  Brunello di Montalcino
"A light and bright wine, this offers plenty of herbal fruit that is lifted by crisp acidity. The wine is refreshing, lively and ready to drink.",84,Château Haut Mondain 2016  Bordeaux Blanc
88–90. Barrel sample. Layered new-wood flavors dominate this ripe wine. It has a concentrated structure while also being full and fruity. There is a touch of bitter extraction at the end.,89,Château Cos Labory 2012 Barrel Sample  (Saint-Estèphe)
"Blackberry jam, menthol, truffle and leather aromas lead the nose while the concentrated, enveloping palates shows black cherry marinated under spirits, licorice and nutmeg. It's already approachable thanks to the juicy fruit and velvety tannins.",92,Orlando Abrigo 2011 Rongalio Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"Full-bodied and plush in texture, this offers plenty of apricot marmalade fruit and some nasturtium-blossom-like spice, making for a satisfying mouthful of flavor.",85,Yellow Tail 2015 Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia)
"Rather than your standard red cherry flavors, this unique Ripasso focuses on aromas of sweet cola, jasmine tea, bee's wax and white mineral. The wine has a good balance of acidity and structure and would pair well with pasta or meat dishes.",87,Bixio 2005  Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso
"Ripe and on the cusp of being classified as “raisiny,” but in the final analysis this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Tempranillo from one of the Penedès' best cava producers has plenty of appeal. Look for sweet, friendly plum, cassis and prune flavors sitting on a saturated, cuddly palate. Drink soon to capture the wine's livelier qualities; further aging will not help it.",89,Mas de Monistrol 2004 MM Reserva Privada Red (Penedès)
"Thyme, bay and lavender aromas provide strong regional character to this wine, a blend of 70% Grenache, 20% Syrah and 10% Carignan. Mixed berries form the core of this supple wine, which should be consumed over the next couple of years.",87,La Coterie 2012 Red (Côtes du Rhône)
"Earthy rose petals and a stemmy tartness shine in this wine, sourced from the Bush Vineyard planted to the Calera clone. Vibrantly complex hits of cranberry and orange add spiciness atop a lithe texture, with the ripeness considerably subdued.",93,Ernest 2014 The Artist Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Squeezed plums and a touch of star anise spice up the nose of this wine, made by a Kama Sutra-inspired winery that has a tasting room in downtown Paso Robles. It's fairly thick once sipped, with lots of red fruits and enough brown spice to keep it intriguing.",86,LXV 2014 Heart Note Rosé (Paso Robles)
"Heavy on the oak, this soft, rounded estate-made Merlot brims in red fruit and herb. A bit of a mouthful now, it should evolve in the bottle and in the glass, burning off some of the wood over time.",85,St. Francis 2011 Estate Merlot (Sonoma Valley)
"This wine is labeled medium dry, a fair description. Aromatic with waxy, mixed citrus components, it's refreshingly tart, with suggestions of lemon peel throughout. The finish brings in notes of orange-pekoe tea, with good concentration and length.",91,Brandborg 2015 Riesling (Elkton Oregon)
"Raw oak is the dominant scent, which overlays a less intense cherry aroma. It feels medium bodied, with a certain flatness about its core. Acidity lends the finish some zip, but it lacks focus overall, ending on a hazy mocha note.",83,Narmada 2009 Reserve Cabernet Franc (Virginia)
"Pesquié's red Quintessence is a blend of 80% Syrah and 20% Grenache, aged in oak barrels. The result features plenty of spices, like clove, nutmeg and cinnamon, but also lush cassis and raspberry fruit and a velvety texture. Drink now–2016.",90,Château Pesquié 2009 Quintessence Red (Ventoux)
"This rich, full-bodied dessert wine offers aromas of spicy plum, blackberry, prune and graphite. The dense palate doles out layers of blueberry syrup, clove and nutmeg alongside fresh acidity that makes this very drinkable.",92,Arnaldo Caprai 2008 Passito  (Montefalco Sagrantino)
"Fresh blueberry, burned caramel, black licorice and sage scents show on the nose of this bottling of a variety that doesn't often get its own stage. The tannins are light but ever-present, framing black plum, elderberry, thyme and peppercorn flavors. It's not as rich or dense as similar wines but is nevertheless a nice sipper.",87,Broken Earth 2011 Petit Verdot (Paso Robles)
"This well-priced Ripasso opens with soft, but plump aromas of ripe fruit, blackberry and barbecue spice. The wine shows a clean, smooth quality with a simple but satisfying finish.",87,Montresor 2009 Capitel della Crosara  (Valpolicella Ripasso)
"This is the top wine from this estate. Wood aged and richly endowed with both fruit and firm tannins, it has a fine balance. The 12 months in wood have softened the wine's structure and given it extra richness. It is still full of youthful fruit, so drink from 2018.",90,Château Armandière 2012 Diamant Rouge Malbec (Cahors)
"The Frog, it's called, and, no doubt it could be drunk with frogs' legs. But, with its intense crispness and superfresh, almost Sauvignon Blanc, green flavor, it would be much better with seafood.",86,Domaine de la Grenaudière 2007 La Grenouille  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"This is dry, medium bodied and extraordinarily rich, bearing flavors of baked black-cherry pie, mocha and grilled prosciutto, with a long, spicy finish. So what if it's too soft, or if there's a trace of overripeness? It's all part of the wine's personality.",90,Saddleback Cellars 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Notes of grass, lime leaf and garrigue herbs lead the bouquet of this attractive wine, supported by fruity tones of white melon, green plum and citrus peel. The medium-weight mouthfeel is countered by ample acidity and pithy flavors that finish slightly astringent. Drink now.",86,Mas Belles Eaux 2015 Chardonnay (Pays d'Oc)
"Produced in one of the newly designated Muscadet crus, this mature wine has spice, almond and toast flavors while still retaining a strong mineral character. It is a far cry from typical Muscadet with its rich, soft texture. Drink this unusual wine now.",90,Domaine du Colombier 2007 Mouzillon-Tillières  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"The 15th-century tower of the governor of Monségur gives its name to this wine from the local cooperative. It's a solid wine that has firm tannins along with jammy plum fruits and a ripe character. Blackberries dominate allowing some room, maybe not enough, for the acidity at the end. Drink now.",86,Les Vignerons Réunis de Monségur 2012 La Tour du Gouverneur  (Bordeaux)
"Oaky aromas like smoked bacon and rich, fruity flavors give this wine a lot of personality. It has a soft, thick texture and a hint of sweetness that rounds it out.",83,Black Box 2014 Red (California)
"Aromas of citrus and talcum powder are a bit muddled. This rosé of Pinot Gris feels lean, jumpy and juicy, while tangy flavors of citrus and stone fruits finish with a mild spritzy tingle. Other than that, there's not much to this.",86,François Lurton 2016 Piedra Negra Alta Colección Pinot Gris Rosado (Valle de Uco)
"Lightly citric and mildly tropical, but mostly it's just a simple, easygoing wine with cantaloupe and peachy flavors along with a mild, cleansing finish. Nothing special but nothing wrong, and therein lies its virtue.",84,Funky Llama 2009 Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"The heady savory note on the nose unites yeast and tarragon, celery and pepper, grapefruit and lemon; fragrance of hay and earth are hinted at, too. The palate continues this wonderful interplay and makes you thirsty for more. This manages to be rounded in a very slender, cool vintage but has the added verve of such years. A great joy to drink.",92,Bernhard Ott 2014 Der Ott Grüner Veltliner (Wagram)
"The Kingpin Cabernet leans into the flavors of savory herb and leaf, with peppery accents to the light strawberry fruit. It's a pleasant, relatively light style that fades into a gentle finish.",89,Sparkman 2010 Kingpin Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"Juicy and dark with layers of boysenberry and blackberry fruit, with high tones of tar and brick, Cedarville's estate-grown Zin comes to life in decomposed granite soils, giving the wine a satisfying and sultry profile. Enjoy this Zin in good time (3–5 years) and pair with dark, smoky meats.",91,Cedarville Vineyard 2010 Estate Zinfandel (El Dorado)
"Produced to be consumed young, this is a breezy, fruity selection. Its black plum-skin texture is balanced by firm tannins and a medicinal, herby-filled aftertaste. Not for long aging.",86,Georges Vigouroux 2011 Gouleyant Malbec-Merlot (Cahors)
"Ripe roasted black-plum and berry aromas are wild and a touch hot. This is jumpy, angular and pumped to the brim with acidity. Foxy currant and red-plum flavors show a baking-spice element, while this is racy and rugged on the finish. Best for burgers and pizza.",85,Casa de la Ermita 2015 Joven Monastrell-Syrah (Jumilla)
"Fruity, fresh and bone dry, this offers aromas of bright red berries and a hint of violets. The refreshing palate delivers intense strawberry and wild cherry accented with a hint of white pepper. Serve chilled and sip on the deck in summertime or pair with cold cuts.",89,Paltrinieri 2013 L'Eclisse  (Lambrusco di Sorbara)
"America's sweet tooth seems to be returning, especially for Moscato, and this sweetie satisfies for its orange soda, honey and vanilla cream flavors.",86,Martin & Weyrich 2010 Allegro Moscato (California)
"Initial aromas of vanilla and cream turn a bit sour upon deeper inspection. The citrusy palate is tart and sharp, and by no means is this a soft wine. Just the opposite: It's rather short and zingy. Best Buy.",85,Carmen 2002 Classic Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley)
"This blend of Pinot Gris, Pinot Noir, Petit Meslier, Arbanne, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay must be one of the most complex blends in Champagne. It is very different and its flavors are exotic and spicy, hinting at tropical. There is a haunting perfume to the aromas, while the palate is intensely structured. For the adventurous.",91,Aubry 2002 Le Nombre d'Or Brut  (Champagne)
"Dense and complex wine, packed with the ripest fruit. It has powerful tannins, although they are easily balanced by the rich plum and damson flavors. The wine is solid, chunky, based on a dry and firm core, ready for aging over 4 years.",91,Château du Cèdre 2008 Malbec (Cahors)
"A whiff of pine frond lends an invigorating alpine air to this lean, refreshingly mineral dry Riesling. The palate is crisp and cutting, bursting with fresh lime, gooseberry and quince flavors. Zesty acidity draws out a long, piercing finish. Drink now through 2020.",91,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt 2015 Wiltinger Trocken Riesling (Mosel)
"This is a fruit-driven, sharp and Port-like red wine, blended from Petit Verdot, Malbec, Grenache and Nebbiolo.",81,X 2009 Saved Red (California)
"Steely and intense in baked pear and pineapple, this white from a well-known vineyard more often associated with Pinot Noir offers contrast in a quality package. On the one hand, it's bright and vibrant, and on the other, there's a richness of caramel and oak, the wine coming in like a lion, out like a lamb. Cellaring might equalize the sides; hold through 2020.",90,MacPhail 2012 Gap's Crown Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"Distinctly sugary, which gives the blackberries and cherries a jammy sweetness. But it's clean and crisp. For those who like this style, it's pretty good.",84,Guenoc 2007 Victorian Claret Red (Lake County)
"“Bolle,” which is Italian for “bubbles,” plays up its cheerful and playful side with bright aromas of citrus, peach, passion fruit and green apple. It washes down easily thanks to the wine's natural acidity.",86,Botter NV Bolle  (Prosecco)
"Aromas and flavors of green apple, pear and a hint of citrus drop come together on this bright easygoing sparkler. Lively acidity keeps it fresh.",87,La Tordera 2016 Saomì Brut  (Prosecco Treviso)
"A blend of 50% Grenache, 30% Cinsault and 20% Syrah, this is a refreshing and well-balanced rosé. Though young and still somewhat tight right now, it offers bright notes of red cherry, strawberry hull and plum skin that are framed by hints of orange blossom, citrus peel and sweet spice. Silky in texture, with a mineral streak and ample acidity that results in a bright finish.",90,Gérard Bertrand 2015 Château La Sauvageonne Volcanic Rosé (Coteaux du Languedoc)
"The bewildering but utterly enjoyable mix of floral, citrus and herbal hints on the nose is symptomatic for the co-planted diversity of this vineyard. Subtle yeast adds a more sonorous tone on this slender, linear wine that is exemplified by flavors of orange peel and fennel seed and a textured palate.",91,Mayer am Pfarrplatz 2014 Nussberg Gemischter Satz White (Vienna)
"Fragrant and refined, this has classic Nebbiolo aromas of woodland berry, rose petal, tilled soil and a balsamic note of eucalyptus. It's vibrant, elegant and balanced, boasting juicy cherry, crushed strawberry, white pepper and a hint of licorice framed in bright acidity and taut, polished tannins. Drink 2019–2026.",94,Brezza 2013  Barolo
A strong almond and marzipan aroma jumps out of the glass. Flavors are quite fruity and the almond note isn't as strong as in the aromas. This wine is softly sparkling and somewhat sweet.,83,Weibel Family NV Almond Demi-Sec Sparkling (California)
"This savory wine is made with the native Pallagrello Bianco grape that's making a comeback in Campania. It's loaded with citrus, tropical fruit, juicy Bartlett pear and almond sensations accented with aromatic herbs. Smoky mineral gives a linear character.",88,Selvanova 2012 Acquavigna Pallagrello Bianco (Terre del Volturno)
"Light in color, the wine is equally light in flavor–a soft, gentle wine with only hints of tannins. Fruity without much depth, it is ready to drink, .",84,Château Fonfroide 2013  Bordeaux
"Black cherry juice vies with a dense structure in this powerful wine. It has layers of tannins and sweetness. This is a firm, solid wine packed inside velvet. Age for 10 years and more.",93,Louis Latour 2009 Les Quatre Journaux  (Romanée-St.-Vivant)
"With a pale straw color, this brut is properly dry and crisp, although it does have a honey-sweet richness. It shows citrus and pear flavors, with the yeasty, doughy earthiness of a good sparkling wine. A little scoury and fairly priced, it's a fine bubbly to drink now.",87,Korbel 2010 Brut Made With Organically Grown Grapes Sparkling (California)
"This small-production blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Merlot from winemaker Tom Rinaldi is rounded and juicy, with moderate acidity. It shows generous clove, cinnamon and black cherry flavors, the structure supportive and graceful.",92,Pellet Estate 2014 Pellet Vineyard Henry's Reserve Red (Napa Valley)
"This shows lots of blackberry and currant flavors, along with a polished jacket of smoky oak. It's bone dry but a little heavy. Perfect for easy drinking when you need a nice Cabernet and don't want to mortgage the house.",87,Goyette 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"This gets going with clean, light cherry and berry aromas that bring a citrus note to the fore. It feels crisp, dry and pure, with citrus, plum and dust flavors. An elegant rosé made from the Trepat grape, it finishes dry and spicy, with ample leftover fruit.",89,Mont Marçal 2009 Rosado Brut Sparkling (Cava)
"At only 7% alcohol, this packs plenty of residual sugar, but it's well balanced by crisp lime notes. Strident—almost crystalline—green apple and lime flavors dominate. There's tons of refreshing fruit in this wine, not as much minerality.",88,Knipser 2006 Kabinett Riesling (Pfalz)
"This leads with woodland berry, blue flower and dried herb aromas. The palate is rather closed and austere but eventually reveals cranberry, pomegranate and crushed mint flavors through its frame of tightly wound tannins and vibrant acidity. Give this a few more years to loosen up. Drink after 2021.",88,Piazzo Armando 2014  Barbaresco
"For fruity, red-cherry-flavored Beaujolais, look no further. This Gamay wine has it all: soft tannins, intensely juicy red fruits and crisp, tangy acidity at the end. Drink now.",85,Domaine Dupeuble Père et Fils 2014  Beaujolais-Villages
"Showing aromas of overripe mango, peach, lime and white flowers, this wine is intense on the nose. The palate is equally loud, with lime and candied peach standing out. The acidity is prickly and gives a sour taste to the finish.",85,Blue Valley 2016 Muskat Ottonel (Middleburg)
"Aromas of mature red berry, dark plum, chopped herb and a balsamic note come together in the glass. The structured mid-weight palate delivers dried cherry, star anise, cinnamon and mineral alongside firm, refined tannins.",90,Travaglini 2011  Gattinara
"Here's a rich, smooth wine for drinking now. It's softly luscious, packed with blackberry, cherry, anise and cedar flavors that finish with quite a bit of complexity.",88,Cameron Hughes 2010 Lot 357 Meritage (Napa Valley)
"Coming from a site across from Cold Creek, this wine offers notes of toast, sautéed herbs, blackberry and spice. It's rich, power packed and layered with dark fruit flavors and firm tannins—an excellent mixture of power and elegance.",92,Columbia Crest 2012 Reserve Wautoma Springs Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A blend of grapes from the north of the Vinho Verde region, this is tangy and crisp. It is bright and dry with attractive acidity and a lemon zest texture. Drink now.",88,Caves da Montanha 2014 Trinca Espinhas Alvarinho-Trajadura White (Vinho Verde)
"Like most Casillero varietals, this Merlot offers good concentration and a mix of berry fruit and light herbal aromas. The palate is lively, with good acidity and zesty red plum and pie cherry flavors. It's a little tangy throughout but on the plus side it's not overdone or heavy.",86,Concha y Toro 2008 Casillero del Diablo Reserve Merlot (Rapel Valley)
"Shaped by the capturing of a cool-climate site and philosophy, this wine is stemmy and balanced, offering a treasure's trove of fresh earth, black tea and clove, all within a lushly layered mouthfeel. The ripeness of the fruit and acidity are entirely complementary.",92,Davis Family 2014 Horseshoe Bend Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Made from one of the most widely planted varieties in Portugal (known as Tinta Amarela in the Douro), this is a soft wine with attractively juicy fruit that is made to drink young. Its gentle tannins and red-fruit flavors are open, lifted by some tannins and ready to drink from 2018.",87,Herdade do Esporão 2016 T Trincadeira (Alentejo)
"A rich, dry wine, soft and velvety in tannins. It feels satisfying all the way through. Not super-big in fruit, but nuanced, offering layers of blackberries, currants, dark chocolate, herbs, leather and pepper. One of the finer Syrahs to come out of the Sierra Foothills this year. Ready now.",89,Kendric 2007 Syrah (Shenandoah Valley (CA))
"As with all Ayoub wines, the immaculate fruit and impeccable structure impress the most. Deep flavors of strawberry and raspberry are set in a toasty frame, with underlying minerality. The finish is drying and extends for well over a minute.",94,Ayoub 2014 Estate Whole Cluster Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Colombard gives the same herbaceous character as Sauvignon Blanc. Here it is packed with acidity, green fruits and strong lines of citrus. Still young, it will benefit for a few more months, so drink from late 2015.",84,Domaine de Magnaut 2014 Magnaut Colombard (Côtes de Gascogne)
"Bright and friendly, this supple young red offers fresh red-berry flavors that are lightly accented by hints of tobacco and spice. Mouthwatering acidity gives it a vibrant character and a clean, dry finish. It's made to be drunk young so enjoy now.",87,Alta Luna 2013 Pinot Nero (Vigneti delle Dolomiti)
"Earth and cola notes accent a true Burgundian nose of rustic raspberry and herbs. This is a stylish, reserved wine—one that sits nicely on the palate and glides down smooth while still holding its cards tight to the vest. It should blossom and soften in about three or four years; now it has everything going for it.",92,Cristom 1998 Marjorie Vineyards Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This wine's aromas are slightly reserved at first, recalling yellow pear and chalk. The flavors are also restrained on the zippy palate, with Asian pear and honeysuckle hints. But what it lacks in expressivity it makes up for in crispness and textural grip.",88,Waxwing 2016 Tondre Grapefield Riesling (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Nice berry aromas feature a smidgen of spice and herbs, while the palate has forward acidity that props up lively berry flavors. Expect no frills and this big-format Merlot will satisfy. It's ripe and sweet, and overall it's done right.",86,Antonio Cesar Cavalli 2006 White Pearl Merlot (Mendoza)
"This delicious and distinctive take on the grape as a pure varietal impresses with its solid core of purple plum and blueberry fruit. Aromatic accents of lemon and green tea continue into the palate as well, and the lengthy finish is fresh and multi-dimensional.",92,Burrowing Owl 2014 Malbec (Okanagan Valley)
"Aromas of tobacco leaf, wet soil, mature plum, resin and a whiff of barnyard lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. The palate offers dried prune layered with notes of chocolate and grilled sage. The fleeting finish closes on a rather bitter note.",86,Villa Girardi 2010  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"Crisp and fruity, it conveys flavors of red fruit and spice. Its smooth texture is given just a lift by acidity and light tannins. Although young, it is ready to drink.",85,Henri Bourgeois 2012 Petit Bourgeois Cabernet Franc (Vin de Pays du Val de Loire)
"Unoaked, and instead fermented for 10 months in both stainless steel and concrete egg, this white remains light-bodied and crisp, touched by aromas of honeysuckle and refreshing flavors of pear and quince.",88,Thomas George 2014 Sons and Daughters Ranch Estate Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This is a full-bodied, rich and round Cabernet Sauvignon. Juicy, mouthwatering cassis fruit is framed by cedar, vanilla and baking spices, while the finish showcases fine tannins. Given the quality of this wine, it's a shame that Wynns' high-end john Riddoch Cab doesn't get exported to the U.S.",90,Wynns Coonawarra Estate 2013 Black Label Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra)
"Fruity while also lightly peppery, this is Fournier's entry-level Sancerre. It is juicy and crisp, delicious with lemon and gooseberry fruit. Still young, the wine will be better from 2017 as its budding fruitiness softens.",88,Fournier Père et Fils 2015 Les Belles Vignes  (Sancerre)
"This straightforward informal red offers aromas of dark berry and moist soil. The soft palate displays raspberry jam and a hint of dark spice. It's easy drinking, with supple tannins.",87,Triacca 2014 Bello Stento  (Chianti Classico)
"Grassy, herbaceous tones are a tad pungent, but they add freshness to this lusciously textured, easy-drinking Gewürz. It's off-dry, with loads of fleshy yellow peach, pineapple and melon flavors, with delicate tangerine-juice acidity. Drink now.",86,Casa Larga 2009 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes)
"Bold, dark and compelling, the nose offers scents of tar, resiny herb, dark fruit and pastry spice. The chewy tannins are woven into this heavy hitter's full body, while uplifting acids keep the palate feeling steady and toned. Structured plum and tobacco notes drive the long, balanced finish.",89,King Family 2010 Merlot (Monticello)
"Named after the redwood tank where the first Riboli family vintners stored their best wine a century ago, this blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 16% Petit Verdot and 14% Malbec shows blueberry and slate minerality on the nose, alongside licorice and mint spices. The palate is overwhelmed by tannins, though black pepper, tobacco and charred meat flavors emerge.",86,San Antonio 2010 Cask 520 Red (Paso Robles)
"The Pinot Grigio brings its usual green apple, lemon curd, peach and mineral flavors to this zesty sparkling wine. It straddles the delicate border between dry and off-dry, and is easy to drink with almost anything.",85,Barefoot NV Pinot Grigio  (California)
"Exceptionally fragrant, it sends up scents of white peaches and hazelnuts. Savory highlights adorn the crisp, detailed fruit flavors of peach, pear and yellow apples.",94,The Eyrie Vineyards 2011 Original Vines Reserve Chardonnay (Dundee Hills)
"Grippy in tobacco and dark cherry, this affordable, well-distributed Cab delivers a lot to like, from its medium weight to soft, integrated tannins. Enjoyable now, it'll stand up to big, rich foods and please a wide range of palates.",89,St. Francis 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"All Leonetti wines are 100% estate-grown fruit, mixing Seven Hills, Mill Creek Upland and Loess vineyard grapes. The 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon includes 12% Merlot, 8% Petit Verdot and 4% Carmenère in the blend. Young and chewy, with a hint of herbaceousness, this shows lovely balance and a mix of raspberry, black cherry, cassis, coffee and cacao. It's a young, deep and powerful wine that will certainly reward cellaring.",94,Leonetti Cellar 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
The typical citrus and bright fruits of the Arinto grape shine in this wine. It is lively and fruity with pear and kiwi flavors. A touch of wood adds a richer side to the wine. Drink now.,88,Campolargo 2015 Branco Barrica Arinto (Bairrada)
"Orange-pink in color, this is a warm style of rosé. Its richness is contrasted with the tangy, orange-zest-like acidity. A blend of Tinta Roriz and Touriga Nacional, it will be ready to drink this winter.",84,Valle Pradinhos 2011 Rosé (Trás-os-Montes)
"Neutral on the nose except for some apple and cheesy oak. The palate is angular and tangy, with cidery flavors. Finishes similarly, with lasting acidic bite and zest.",84,Haras 2009 Chardonnay (Maipo Valley)
"Bright berry and red-currant aromas. Lighter in style than Cabs being produced by other LI wineries. The finish turns tough and leathery, not a good match for the delicate fruit.",82,Channing Perrine 1998 Mudd Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Long Island)
Briny grassy aromas are barely ripe and smell of match stick. This feels citric and more or less normal for a coastal SB. Pithy flavors of grapefruit skins blend with passion fruit in front of a juicy finish that tastes of white grapefruit and green herbs.,87,Errazuriz 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Aconcagua Costa)
"This Godello is almost like water in color, while the nose is neutral and fruitless. A dilute, scattershot palate shows bland, oxidized flavors of bready white fruits.",83,Adrás 2013 Godello (Ribeira Sacra)
"Light in texture, this wine shows a fair amount of barrel influence aromatically. On the palate, it's similarly challenging to disregard the oak, which frames a mid-weight body marked by sour cherry.",87,Vino Vargas 2012 RIo Ruso Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Marked by oak and thick, dark blue fruit, this wine also conveys a buoyant softness and prettiness. The study in yin and yang characteristics starts with a bang and develops complexity in the glass.",90,Tuck Beckstoffer 2010 Semper Silver Eagle Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Pristine white peach, lychee and honeysuckle notes are framed by a laser-edged strike of acidity in this vivacious ice wine. While its blossomy, perfumed exuberance is pure Gewürztraminer, its crystalline demeanor and wildflower-honey sweetness exhibits a classic ice-wine elegance.",92,Standing Stone 2014 Ice Gewurztraminer (Finger Lakes)
"Still young and firm, this wine gives indications of potential fruitiness along with a structure that promises concentration. Layers of black fruits and acidity need time to integrate fully with the dark structure and dense texture. Wait to drink this wine for a few more years, at least until 2018.",91,Domaine Maillard 2011  Corton Les Renardes
"Sweet and forward in pineapple, peach and lime flavors, this is a blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay. It has good acidity and a clean, spicy finish.",85,Turn 4 2010 White (California)
"Underneath the austere exterior, there's a fruity character, with layers of citrus, kiwi and white peach flavors, along with the richness from having been aged in wood. Cellar this taut, minerally and structured wine for 2–3 years.",89,Château Vitallis 2010  Mâcon-Fuissé
"50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot and 10% Grenache make this a flavorful and well structured Vin de Pays from the south of France.

"Perfumed, soft, easy wine, showing the juicy, fresh side of the two grapes. The fruits are more red than black, open and ripe, but still with youthful exuberance and great freshness.",88,DFJ Vinhos 2005 Touriga Nacional e Touriga Franca Red (Estremadura)
"Aromas of acacia, nut and yellow stone fruit lead the nose. It's ripe and round, offering dried apricot, bread crust, golden apple and a note of bitter almond.",88,Venica & Venica 2015 Ronco delle Cime Friulano (Collio)

"Fleshy and smelling of berry skins, this is a large Malbec. Everything tastes dark and fruity, with heavy flavors of spice and toast that powerfully linger on the finish. Texturally, this is tannic, ripe and syrupy.",87,Altocedro 2012 Año Cero Malbec (La Consulta)
"Still our favorite Malbec from Chile, Viu 1 rises above the rest due to its pedal-to-the-metal combination of fruit, perfect oak and human attention. The bouquet here is deep and sultry, with oily black fruit and toasty aromas working a perfect pas de deux. The black plum, blackberry and leather flavors hit the spot courtesy of proper acidity and tannins, and the the finish is thick but not fierce or fat. Drink now (decant) through 2013.",92,Viu Manent 2006 Viu 1 Malbec (Colchagua Valley)
"There's a mixture of fruit and barrel on this wine with dark fruit aromas melding with cocoa, clove and spice. Sweet and concentrated flavors coat the palate, with a light squeeze of tannins backing it up.",92,Reininger 2012 Malbec (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Fresh-pressed blackberry aromas leap out of the glass of this wine, along with asphalt and a touch of purple flowers. The palate is a study of density and thickness, with black plums, coffee and espresso showing most out of the deep, black flavors.",88,Siot 2013 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)
"90–92. Barrel sample. This is an herbaceous, cool wine that shows fresh pear and lime flavor. It does have a sense of structure that gives density and texture on the finish.",91,Château Rahoul 2012 Barrel Sample  (Graves)
"A blend of eight different Syrah clones and a splash of Grenache, this is dark and sappy, with dense veins of citrus oil, licorice, coffee liqueur and black tea that are anchored by a solid black-cherry flavor. This should drink well for a decade or longer.",91,Eight Bells 2010 Red Willow Vineyard Clonal Block Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"This is a delicious, fruity wine with just a core of tannins to hold it together. It is packed with red berry fruits along with intense, still-youthful acidity. As it develops, it will become fruitier and softer.",88,Manuel Olivier 2011  Aloxe-Corton
"The old-vine estate vineyard delivers a well-balanced, elegant wine that shows mineral and steel along with tart berry fruit. Despite a much lighter vintage than 2012, there is enough density and depth to reward some additional cellar time.",92,Winderlea 2013 Winderlea Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Simple, bright and packed with fresh berry intensity, this easygoing Rosso would pair well with meatloaf, lamp chops or pasta with meat sauce. The wine's naturally crisp acidity will cut through the fat content of these succulent foods.",87,Casato1 2009 Voliero  (Rosso di Montalcino)
A lean wine with some austerity. It has a firmly tannic character while missing the fruit for the future.,82,Château Brethous 2010  Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux
"VJB's estate Syrah, from Sonoma Valley, is vintage variable, and 2004 was kind to it. The grapes got quite ripe, so the wine, which is slightly hot, shows lush flavors of black and red currants, dates and figs, chocolate macaroons, anisette and peppery spices. Yet it maintains a balancing backbone of acids.",89,VJB 2004 Syrah (Sonoma Valley)
"The inaugural release from this winery from Sleight of Hand Cellars' production winemaker Keith Johnson is a blend of Mourvèdre (90%), Syrah (8%) and Grenache Blanc. Stylistically somewhat unique for Washington, it brings brooding aromas of sauvage, herb, smoked meat and white pepper, along with a bit of reduction. The fruit flavors are pure and bring an appealing sense of texture. Give it time to open up and pair it with food to see it at its best.",90,Devium 2015 French Creek Vineyard Red (Yakima Valley)
"Deftly showing restraint with this grape that can easily be made into overripe wine, this bottling offers clean aromas of nectarine, apple blossom, bubblegum and tropical guava cream. A mouthwatering acidity hits the palate first, followed by a line of tense chalkiness, then comes the stonefruit, lime juice and a tactile sizzle into the finish.",91,Left Bend 2014 Black Ridge Vineyards Viognier (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Burgundian in every way, this deceptively light (in color, alcohol and impact) wine rewards your attention with its finesse and complexity. Rhubarb, pomegranate, peppermint, earth and savory herbs are all highlights, and the length is equally impressive. It's low in alcohol, but high in aging potential.",91,Roco 2011 Private Stash #9 Pinot Noir
"A ripe, raspberry flavored wine that is crisp while also very fruity. It has attractive acidity and a refreshing, juicy aftertaste that is irresistible. Drink now.",86,Philippe Viallet 2015 Gamay Rosé (Vin de Savoie)
"Merlot and Nerello Mascalese make for perfect blending partners, creating a wine with cherry softness and bright fruit intensity, plus volcanic minerality and elegance. Polished and clean on the finish.",91,Barone di Villagrande 2008 Sciara Red (Sicilia)

"Gigantic, huge, enormously extracted Zinfandel. So strong, it's practically a food group. Offers tiers of raspberries, cherries, blackberries, black currants, raisins, dark chocolate and spices. The alcohol level is very high, giving it a hot finish. It's a classic example of this old vine, superripe style.",88,Vermeil 2010 Luvisi Vineyard Zinfandel (Calistoga)
"Selected from parcels across the estate, this wine aims to reflect the totality of the appellation. It succeeds with its combination of minerality and ripe fruit. Oak, almond and citrus fruits are still right up front, showing that this is a young wine that will age well. Drink from 2018.",94,Château de Fuissé 2014 Tête de Cru  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
"Although this wine is called “Dolce Bianco” it is indeed a dark red sparkling wine. It opens with an inky ruby color and bitter aromas of cherry, blackberry and cassis fruit. There's a touch of sweetness on the close with foamy bubbles as well.",83,Sei Amici NV Dolce Bianco  (Lambrusco dell'Emilia)
"Pressed violet, baked plum, baking spice and coconut emerge on the nose and carry over to the full-bodied palate along with ripe black cherry and licorice. Tightly packed but refined tannins provide firm support.",90,David Sterza 2011  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"Lemon-lime soda aromas meet with orange blossom, toast, lanolin and steel on the nose of this voluptuous yet well-defined bottling. It's tightly wound on the palate, with lemon, grapefruit rind and crushed limestone flavors, bound by a chalky texture, showing deft restraint for a Roussanne.",91,Zaca Mesa 2013 Roussanne (Santa Ynez Valley)
"A whiff of floral potpourri that persists from start to finish adds elegance to this full-bodied wine. The palate is expansive and rich, but finishes refreshingly tart with flavors of crisp green apple and lemon.",87,Mattebella 2009 Famiglia Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island)
"This simple Extra Dry Prosecco Superiore opens with peach, nectarine, simple lines and a watery mouthfeel. The sparkler's momentum is achieved mostly by the creaminess of its bubbles.",85,Terra Serena NV Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"A pale pink sparkler with loads of intensity and elegance, Essence opens with delicate aromas of cranberry, toasted almond, mature fruit and grapefruit. The wine's perlage is steady and foamy.",90,Antica Fratta 2006 Essence Rosé Sparkling (Franciacorta)
"Fermented and aged in wood, this rich and complex wine is still young. The potential of the ripe yellow fruits, tight structure and toast and spice flavors are all there. Rounded and generous, this is a wine for some good aging; drink from 2017.",90,Dão Sul 2014 Casa de Santar Reserva Branco White (Dão)
"New oak dominates this wine, giving it aromas of toast and vanilla. After decanting, the air brings out interesting notes of dried herbs and blackberries. Tastes very rich and flamboyant, almost sweet, like a chocolate berry pastry, and should develop over the next few years. Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with Sangiovese, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.",90,David Arthur 2008 Meritaggio Red (Napa Valley)
"Aromas of cedar, grilled pepper, cut grass and mature dark-skinned fruit lead this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. The concentrated palate doles out juicy blackberry, steeped plum, espresso and tobacco alongside assertive but fine-grained tannins. It ends on a licorice note.",90,Donna Olimpia 1898 2012  Bolgheri
"From 100% estate-grown fruit, it spent more than a year in 100% French oak and is dense in baked strawberry, black cherry and a richness of herb. The grip of fruit is balanced by moderate acidity. The grapes are organically certified.",90,Domaine Carneros 2011 La Terre Promise Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"New oak dominates this Chardonnay, lending buttered toast, vanilla and caramel aromas and flavors, while the underlying fruit veers toward very ripe, sweet pineapples. Made in the modern style, it will appeal to Chardonnay lovers of flash, but ultimately palls for too much upfront sweetness.",88,Keller Estate 2009 La Cruz Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"Still young, this blend of Pinot Noir, with a small amount of Pinot Meunier, is crisp with bright citrus and white fruits. Richness and a touch of tannin give structure. The acidity cuts through at the end, offering a zesty, tight aftertaste. Drink this vintage from 2017.",92,Pannier 2010 Blanc de Noirs Brut  (Champagne)
"Here's the quintessential Soave Classico that veers on the side of informality and easy-drinking appeal. The wine is redolent of white peach, citrus and Golden Delicious apple.",86,Cantine Lenotti di Lenotti 2011 Capocolle  (Soave Classico)

"Oak dominates this wine, with toasty charcoal aromas and flavors. The underlying wine seems pretty simple, with blackberry fruit flavors. Doesn't seem capable of aging, so drink up.",86,Cakebread 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This is a very attractive oak-aged Barbera with aromas of sweet spice, bitter chocolate and loads of bright berry fruit. The wine is compact, clean and thanks to the bright acidity, it leaves your palate polished and fresh.",89,Damilano 2008  Barbera d'Asti
"Tomato, red bell pepper, plum and currant aromas have a slightly sharp, varietal-related minty, green angle. This feels round and creamy on the tongue, with good acidity propping up flavors of baked berries, spice, chocolate, raw oak and vanilla. A medium-length finish with baking spice flavors confirms the wine's power.",88,Andeluna 2008 Pasionado Cabernet Franc (Tupungato)
"Underbrush, dried mushroom, ripe dark-skinned fruit and cake spice aromas lead the nose on this accessible, robust red. The warm, hearty palate offers dried black cherry steeped in spirits, licorice and the heat of evident alcohol. Velvety tannins provide the setting.",89,Paradisone 2011  Brunello di Montalcino
"With its origins in the 17th century, this estate has 50 acres. This red with its ripe tannins and juicy red-berry fruits has the weight to give richness as well as fruit. A good structure supports the fruit while remaining discretely in the background. Drink now.",87,Domaine Roger Champault 2014 Les Pierris  (Sancerre)
"With just a tiny touch of oak, this wine's fruit and acidity star. It has flavors of Meyer lemon, lime, green apple, vanilla, honey and white pepper, brightened by zesty acidity. A nice cocktail wine to drink now.",87,Rodney Strong 2011 Charlotte's Home Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Northern Sonoma)
"Based in the village of Lancié in the heart of the Beaujolais crus, this producer has made a ripe wine that is full of black-cherry fruits and balanced tannins. It is concentrated and ripe, perfumed with a fresh, crisp aftertaste.",89,Domaine André Collonge 2015  Beaujolais-Villages
"A whiff of salted caramel endows the nose with an appetizing idea of toffee apple. The frothy palate is lively and shows off ripe, fruity apple notes of Red Delicous and shortcrust pastry. Crispness is countered by richer, playful fruit that anchors notes of biscuit and yeast. The finish is sustained.",90,Hush Heath Estate NV Leslie's Reserve Sparkling (England)
"Stalky, dry, with attractive black currant fruits and a light tannin character. Showing little sign of its potential richness.",84,Château la Fontaine de Genin 2009  Bordeaux
"This is a dry, firm wine with concentrated tannins along with dark chocolate and bitter coffee flavors. It is going to need some time, so wait to drink until 2018.",86,Sobredos 2012 Aneto Reserva Red (Douro)
"Raisiny, pruny aromas are all that register on this rubbery, jammy Garnacha. Flavors of sweet plum, raspberry and raisin are chunky, while the finish is raisiny in flavor and rubbery in feel.",84,Bodegas Valdemar 2010 Conde de Valdemar Old Vines  (Rioja)
"This block selection is a field blend of four different clones, and brings complex flavors of herbs, tree fruits and melon. The low alcohol content and high acidity make it a good choice to drink slightly chilled. There's a light touch of toasty oak resonating through the finish.",89,Winter's Hill 2014 Block 9-Corner Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Makers of textbook Prosecco, Mionetto's extra-dry sparkler is lush and pulpy with aromas of lemon blossom, melon, beeswax, pear and oats. Count on good freshness in the mouth. reinforced by lemon candy flavors.",88,Mionetto NV Sergio Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene)
"Sort of creamy and unconvincing on the nose, with carob and stemmy berry aromas. The palate runs toward red fruit, but it's also a bit green and herbal. Finishing notes of chocolate and green herbs are typical of Merlot, yet there isn't enough ripe fruit or excitement. Hence, it's a mid-level red wine with some green character. Contains 9% Cabernet and 5% Shiraz.",84,Caliterra 2007 Reserva Merlot (Colchagua Valley)
"Aromas of wild cherry, blue flower and a hint of cinnamon unfold in the glass. The no-frills palate offers black cherry, sage and a note of white pepper alongside soft, rather fleeting tannins. Drink through 2016.",87,Tasca d'Almerita 2013 Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"A wine that pushes the concept of Grüner to its limits. It is powerful, dense and concentrated, with spice, lychee and apricot flavors. This is full bodied, superrich. Screwcap.",91,Nigl 2010 Senftenberger Pellingen Erste Lage Privat Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"Citrus rind and grapefruit fruit flavors are set against more floral highlights. It's as refreshing as a gin and tonic, and even carries a hint of quinine flavor in the finish. The wine is sturdy and consistent through the middle and finishes with a gentle fade.",88,William Church 2007 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A really perfumed wine, full of oak and truffle aromas. With its juicy rich fruit, it is not a shy wine. Bold red fruits, balanced tannins and a ripe texture all contribute to the dense concentration. The alcohol shows in the pepper edge. Drink this just mature wine now.",90,Quinta de Sant'Ana 2012 Merlot (Lisboa)
"This is a firm wine, but it has ripe red fruit. It shows an attractive touch of smoke, and there is fine balance between the firm tannins and fragrant fruit. Drink now.",85,Albert Bichot 2010 Secret de Famille  (Bourgogne)
"Chunky, jammy and full of blackberry and boysenberry aromas, this is lively but limited in mouthfeel, with wild berry and savory flavors. It feels pointed and short on the finish, but overall it's dark, full and well made.",88,García Figuero 2009 Tinto Figuero 12 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"This is quite easily the best Justin Cabernet ever. The wine achieves a new height of richness of fruit, dazzling with waves of blackberries, blueberries, cassis and chocolate, liberally enhanced with sweet vanilla oak. Yet it's bone dry, and the tannins are immaculate, with enough acids for balance. Gorgeous now with haute cuisine.",93,Justin 2007 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Meaty in wild berry and leather, this is a high-toned wine with a gritty texture that evolves to become velvety in the glass. Generously ripe and rich in body, it's intense and fresh in equal measure, showing a complement of balanced brawn and beauty.",94,Carlisle 2015 Papa's Block Syrah (Russian River Valley)
"A simple but drinkable Pinot. Smells and tastes like black raspberry jam, spread onto buttered white toast, with a sprinkle of pepper.",82,Arrow Creek 2011 Coastal Series Pinot Noir (California)

"This good, sturdy wine has ripe, broad fruit flavors, medium to full body, and a relaxed mouthfeel.",85,Cambridge & Sunset 2014 California Series Pinot Noir (California)
"Darker in color than a rosé, this Clairet is fruity with ripe strawberry fruit. But it does seem heavily laced with caramel as well as some tannins and spice.",83,Château de Fontenille 2010 Rosé (Bordeaux Clairet)
"Cherry flavors turn a bit syrupy, with a sour cherry candy appeal. Acidic and slightly volatile, this tight, chewy wine spent 14 months in 40% new French oak barrels.",87,Erath 2009 Estate Selection Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Deep but elegant lilac and rose petal aromas meet loamy soil, river stone and tangy cranberry on the nose of this bottling from this historic vineyard. There is great depth to its flavors—a layering of dark raspberry thyme, anise and dill—while showing plenty of turned earth notes throughout.",92,Fess Parker 2014 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"Baked blackberries meet with caramel, vanilla, forest floor and a tart plum skin touch on the nose of this bottling by the Paso Robles-based Tooth & Nail team. It's smooth and soft on the sip, with black currant, elderberry, pepper dust, charcoal and rosemary flavors. It's ripe but with a very dry edge.",91,Amor Fati 2014 Murmur Vineyard Syrah (Santa Maria Valley)

"Orange rind, leather and black cherry aromas are a touch funky. This dark-colored Pinot is big in body and bulky. Black plum, tea and berry flavors are drawing on the finish.",86,Cucao 2015 Reserva Pinot Noir (Limarí Valley)
"Blueberry and plum aromas are slightly exotic but also unusual and wayward. An easy feeling palate is medium in body and intensity, while woody flavors of herbal blueberry finish mild, with a persistent herbal aftertaste.",87,Los Haroldos 2011 Roble Malbec (Mendoza)
"A barrel selection of Schindler fruit, this reserve notches up the color, density and alcohol without sacrificing the basic character and finesse of the vineyard. Here are the tight layers of bacon fat, stone, pepper and leaf, along with tart, lightly herbal red fruits. The core fruit is concentrated, fresh and primary, and promises excellent aging potential.",92,Sineann 2008 Schindler Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Fresh lemon and gooseberry flavors lend an herbaceous edge to this fruity but tightly textured wine. It has richness and density, but it's a wine that is both refreshing and serious. Keep for a year before drinking.",91,Château Argadens 2012  Bordeaux Blanc
"Its mix of heady aromas include chamomile flower, Spanish broom and yellow stone. The bright, fresh palate offers peach, pear, crunchy apple and a touch of mineral alongside vibrant acidity. It finishes crisp and clean.",87,Cantina Valle Isarco 2014 Aristos Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige)
"The Cherryblock Cabs seem to share a common minty characteristic that's particularly noticeable in this vintage. There's also a decent amount of cassis, earth and tobacco, and the finish remains firmly tannic. Drink or hold.",87,Sebastiani 1992 Cherryblock Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley)
"This is the most impressive Chante-Alouette I can recall, boasting layers of honeyed pineapple fruit, the barest hint of fresh, just-golden toastiness and notes of gingered apricot. It's full bodied and lush on the palate, ending long and mouthwatering. It should drink well into 2015, but expect it to close up only to re-emerge between 2020 and 2030.",92,M. Chapoutier 2011 Chante-Alouette Marsanne (Hermitage)
"The wine leads with aromas of raisin and black fruits. In the mouth, it feels spiky, with pointed tannins. Earthy, stewed plum and baked berry flavors lead to a big, edgy feeling finish with blocky tannins.",85,Finca del Marquesado 2008 Crianza  (Rioja)
"Made with organically farmed fruit, this opens with aromas of ripe plum, tilled earth, leather and spice. The dense, warm palate delivers crushed blackberry, blueberry extract, oak, black pepper, espresso and cinnamon alongside big, velvety tannins. It's flamboyant but it's shy on freshness and the burn of searing alcohol throws it off balance.",88,Di Filippo 2010  Montefalco Sagrantino
"Aromas of menthol, blue flower and dark berry lift out of the glass. The tannic palate is still primary, offering tart sour cherry and star anise while a hint of dried sage closes the firm finish.",89,Grimaldi Bruna 2012 Bricco Ambrogio  (Barolo)
"This shows petrol, honey and brie cheese rind notes on the nose, and is quite creamy once sipped, yet the edges are punctuated with orange peel bitterness. The tartness ensures cellaring potential, so drink 2018–2025.",91,Zocker 2012 Paragon Vineyard Riesling (Edna Valley)

Can be held for more complexity; drink now through 2020.",92,Feudi di San Gregorio 2012 Pietracalda  (Fiano di Avellino)
"Scorched soil, black-skinned berry, worn leather and dried herb aromas come together here.

Give the tannins a few more years to unclench then drink up to catch the remaining fruit.",87,Canneta 2011 Le Bruciate  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"This is a big, concentrated and rather Burgundian Pinot Noir. It shows powerful flavors of cherry pie, cola, rhubarbs, pomegranates and dried herbs, with an earthy, mushroomy complexity. Feels young and tannic and thick in wood sap, yet its future is hard to predict.",90,J Vineyards & Winery 2009 Freestone Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Aromas of apple, cherry and liqueur open. The racy airy palate offers mature red-apple skin and toasted nut alongside big, vigorous bubbles.",88,Vite Colte 2015 La Gatta  (Moscato d'Asti)
"Just a hint of citrus emanates from the glass. The very light-bodied palate remains very citrussy, taut, fresh and bright. Save this one for a hot summer day and it will provide ultimate refreshment.",90,Hiedler 2014 Thal Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"This sophisticated Sauvignon Blanc sets itself apart with its rich nose of nuts, vanilla and flowers, followed by pretty flavors of spice and white flowers and fruit. Acidity balances the fruit. A fuller-bodied style that can handle richer seafood dishes.",85,Domaine Costa Lazaridi 2008 Amethystos Sauvignon Blanc (Drama)
"Hints of tropical fruit, yellow pear and apricot show on the nose of this bottling by a Sierra Foothills-based producer. There is a slight sweet touch to the sip, but then it dries out nicely, offered pear, apple and honeysuckle flavors against a decent textural grip.",88,Prospect 772 2015 Stepping Stones Grenache Blanc (Santa Barbara County)
"This lightly fruity wine brings in layers of the freshest acidity before broadening out with citrus and green fruits. The wine is all about crisp, light fruitiness. A blend of Grenache, Syrah and Cinsault, it benefits from warm days and cool nights from vineyards at nearly 1,200 feet.",85,Pure Provence 2014 L'Opaline Rosé (Coteaux Varois en Provence)
"Full bodied and fleshy, this is an approachable wine, richly concentrated in candied-peach flavor that pleases and finds a balance between power and grace.",88,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2015 Karia Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Voluptuous in wild strawberry, cranberry and tart cherry, Quintus is light and suggestively chalky, balanced in velvety tannins and a backbone of structure. Dancing in the background is a taste of black tea and dark, fragrant earth.",93,De Coelo 2012 Quintus Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Raspberry aromas, cherry and strawberry flavors, and a strong hint of milk chocolate throughout best define this Gallo-owned wine. Some raisins and a touch of buttery oak appear late, rendering it a simple quaff.",84,Ecco Domani 2000  Chianti
"Blue-fruit aromas are front and center along with notes of herb and barrel spice. The palate shows restraint and suppleness that continues through the sweet fruit flavors on the finish. It's an intriguing, stylistically unique offering of this variety.",91,Northstar 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Bursting at the seams with ripe, juicy flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and anise, this Cab has a rich overlay of smoky oak. It's a little on the soft, heavy side. Drink soon.",86,Artesa 2005 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Ripe pear, melon and pineapple aromas lead the way, while the creamy-textured palate delivers more muskmelon and apricot, with a hint of ginger, suggesting a bit Viognier is in the blend. The finish is clean and refreshing. Drink now.",87,Léon Perdigal 2015 White (Côtes du Rhône)
"With its well-integrated scents of cedar, plum and tobacco, this is a medium-weight wine whose hallmark is its balance. Vanilla and dried spices meld nicely with cherry and plum fruit, finishing smooth, with modest tannins. Drink now-2008.",87,Companhia das Quintas 2000 Cado Red (Douro)
"Fruity and fragrant, this opens with aromas of red berries, violets and baking spices. Notes of white pepper and clove accent the crushed strawberry and wild cherry flavors that are supported by silky tannins.",89,Sordo 2012  Nebbiolo d'Alba
"Acidity marks this fresh, young wine, giving a tension to the mouthfeel, and suggesting some time in the bottle to round it out. The underlying flavors are exquisite, suggesting cherries, raspberries, strawberries, pomegranates, Dr. Pepper cola and spice. The pedigree is obvious from the refined mouthfeel.",92,Morgan 2006 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"This is a full and generous wine (90% Sangiovese with 10% Merlot) that lavishes on rich layers of red cherry, soft chocolate, tobacco and spice. You taste the pureness of the black fruit in the mouth and are treated to a rich, velvety finish.",92,Mazzei 2007 Ser Lapo Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
Apple notes have a lifted ethereal quality. The palate comes in with beautifully poised lemon freshness that counters the just off-dry richness of the fruit flavors. This is balm-like in its apple-focused fruitiness and goes down very easily. Flavors linger.,91,Dopff & Irion 2011 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"Made by the team at Wrath, this is one of the better canned wines on the shelves right now. Light in the glass, it offers very refreshing, mineral-driven aromas of wet riverstone and rain on cement as well as slight touches of Pink Lady apples and green hay. Asian pear flesh mixes with slightly sour lime peel and sweet chives on the palate.",88,Al 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey County)
"Bright-pink in hue, this has crisp acidity and enduring aromas of grapefruit, raspberry, wild fruit and chopped herb. There's even a touch of bitter almond on the bubbly close.",85,Piera Martellozzo NV 075 Carati Rosé Cuvee Dry Sparkling (Veneto)

"What's not to like about this extremely fruity, easy-drinking Rhône-style blend? It smells and tastes like blackberry jam, with a lightly tannic texture. A touch of sweetness keeps it soft.",87,Helwig 2013 Round Up Red (California)
"A light, fruity, high-acid wine with strawberry flavors and a hint of leaf and herb.",84,Northwest Totem Cellars 2006 Potlatch Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Here's a newly released Barolo that appears older than it actually is. The wine's ruby color shows a browning edge and aromas here reflect tertiary tones of balsam, drying mineral and licorice. In the mouth, you'll get iron-like flavors backed by fine, drying tannins. Don't wait too much longer to drink this wine.",89,Cavalier Bartolomeo 2006 Solanotto Altenasso  (Barolo)
"Fresh notes of crisp apple, with grassy hints, on the nose turn to rounded and mellow red-apple notes on the palate. The tiny bubbles make for a creamy mouthfeel while some biscuity notes provide substance. It makes an elegant and dry apéritif.",89,Domaine Vincent Stoeffler NV Blanc de Blancs Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"Whiffs of vanilla, saffron, peach and yellow cherry lend exotic flair to this unctuous yet delicate dessert wine. A blend of Riesling, Scheurebe and Huxelrebe grapes, its unique composition lends plumpness of fruit balanced by zesty acidity and a lingering waxy sheen. It's sure to be a dramatic finish to an elegant dinner event, yet surprisingly affordable.",92,Thörle 2013 Grains Noble White (Rheinhessen)
"This producer is showing true skill with this variety, vibrant in red and black cherry and cassis. Bright and satisfyingly generous on the palate, it's succulent as well as being earthy, with lingering layers of black pepper and cinnamon. It never gets heavy or burdensome, maintaining a fleetness of freshness that's irresistible.",93,Kokomo 2014 Grenache (Dry Creek Valley)
"In the smooth, polished style of other wines in the Cistus range from Quinta de Val da Perdiz, this wine has mint aromas, licorice and some bitter chocolate flavors, rounded and burnished with new wood flavors. It needs aging—maybe 4 or 5 years.",89,Cistus 2004 Grande Reserva Red (Douro)
"From a newer vineyard located up Gypsy Canyon off of Highway 246, this wine shows light apple aromas along with lemon blossoms. Ripe yellow pears and apples show through a stony tightness that frames the midpalate, offering a Key-lime pith element and good saline quality.",90,Lea 2015 Mormann Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County)
"This tasty, lightly toasty wine is 100% varietal, with fruit approaching plumpness and offering mixed flavors of cantaloupe, pear and peach. It rolls smoothly into a well-rounded finish with a dash of white pepper.",88,Winter's Hill 2015 Reserve Pinot Blanc (Dundee Hills)
"Yeasty, bready aromas lack the citric kick and minerality that top Rueda whites deliver in spades. The palate is dilute but slightly creamy, while yeasty flavors are low on fruit and finish with a note of gardenia flower.",85,Ossian 2013 Quintaluna Verdejo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)
91–93. Barrel sample. The second wine of Cheval Blanc is surprisingly soft and ripe—full of blackberry fruits—with delicious acidity and a lingering black-currant aftertaste.,92,Le Petit Cheval 2012 Barrel Sample  (Saint-Émilion)
"This is a textured wine, firm and tight initially. Plenty of flavor is waiting to develop and to reveal white fruits and attractive citrus. It can be drunk now, but the wine will be much better from 2016.",87,Julien Braud 2013 Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"A field-inspired blend of 80% Zinfandel with 12% Carignane and 12% Petite Sirah, this wine holds red jammy fruit at its core. Medium to full-bodied in weight, it has fine tannins that give silkiness to offset the wine's sizable power.",88,Ravenswood 2012 Teldeschi Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"This wine is concentrated with ripe, juicy fruit along with brisk acidity and a delicious sense of Southern French herbs. The wine has weight as well, giving it fine aging potential. Drink from 2016.",91,Domaine de Terrebrune 2010 Red (Bandol)
Here's a fresh and feminine expression of Pinot Nero with nuances of wild berry and white cherry followed by light touches of spice and almond skin. Balanced acidity and a lively finish make the wine very enjoyable indeed.,88,Kellerei Kaltern Caldaro 2010 Pinot Nero (Alto Adige)
"Lemon, apple and a hint of honey characterize the bouquet, which is appealing as a whole. The palate is smooth, with a good mix of body and acidity. Flavors of pithy citrus, apple and green banana lead to a slightly bitter finish with almondy notes and lasting minerality.",89,Gaba do Xil 2011 Godello (Valdeorras)
"Tropical aromas are typical for basic Chilean Chardonnay. This is plump in feel, with cantaloupe, honeydew and chunky apple flavors. The palate feels balanced and the wine is just focused enough on the finish, which shows a spot of bracing acidity. Drink right away.",86,Caliterra 2012 Reserva Estate Grown Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)
"An unusual blend of 40% Malbec, 40% Syrah and 20% Merlot, this wine intrigues with its aromas of black pepper, plum and café au lait. It's supple in feel, with reserved red and blue fruit flavors that persist on the finish.",89,Bunnell 2011 Fête BDX Red (Snipes Mountain)
"Plenty of dry Malbec tannins here. In fact, this verges on the austere, piling high on to the fruit. There is density, those tannins going right through the wine, finishing with acidity. Tough at this stage: give it 2–3 years.",88,Château la Reyne 2007 Le Prestige Malbec (Cahors)
"A lifted, phenolic note of Bosc pear peel suggests both freshness and maturity. The soft, rounded palate sings with pear sweetness and finishes medium-dry. There is softness and pliability, but a guiding, focused freshness that provides excellent balance.",90,Domaine Moltès 2014 Steinert Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Baked boysenberries, purple flowers, rose petals, night jasmine and cola combine for an elegant nose on this restrained Zin bottling. Tart and woody blackberries arise on the palate alongside touches of cedar, pine needle, black peppercorn and roasting herbs, proving more savory in style.",89,Écluse 2013 Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"This formidable Rhône-style blend has a deep color, smoky, toasted, and grilled-meat aromas, a dense and chewy texture and focused flavors like blackberries and black pepper. The concentration is quite good, the balance and tannins are very firm, preparing this wine for a long life. Drink after 2019.",91,Bonterra 2012 The Butler Red (Mendocino County)
"With relatively high altitude vineyards, Chiroubles can produce wines like this, with an austere backbone and high acidity. Together they make for a tight wine with red berries and a dry texture. Age for six months.",85,Vignerons de Bel Air 2010 Eté Fleuri  (Chiroubles)
"This blend of Cabernet France, Malbec and Pinot Noir shows the eclectic range of red grapes at the disposal of a Touraine vigneron. It has also produced a soft, gently tannic wine with perfumed fruits, bitter cherry and a herbal aftertaste.",86,Domaine des Corbillières 2010 Les Demoiselles Red (Touraine)
"A fine and impressively complex wine, rich, packed with sultanas and dark chocolate. Very firm, this is worth aging but drinkable now.",89,Quinta do Passadouro 2005 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port)
"Delicate tones of crushed stone and dried apricot entice on the nose of this silken yet steely dry wine. Despite its moderate alcohol, there's a robustness on the palate marked by concentrated white peach and apricot flavors. That steely precision rings through the finish though, bolstered by a nervy streak of lemon and lime acidity.",90,Balthasar Ress 2015 Rüdesheimer Trocken Riesling (Rheingau)
"Totally grassy and herbaceous, this green, crisp wine also has a more serious, ageworthy side. There is a firm minerality here, along with a nervy, tense character that will allow it to mature. Drink from 2016.",88,Saget la Perrière 2013 Comte de la Perrière Silex  (Sancerre)
"A garnet color and amber highlights mark the appearance of this biodynamic wine. It presents slightly oxidized aromas of butterscotch and apple, backed by raspberry and strawberry tones.",83,Cefalicchio 2011 Rosato (Puglia)
"An unidentified mix of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot sourced from throughout the county, this is a smoky, leathery expression of sanguine black and red fruit that's approachable and easygoing. The finish has a bittersweet note of chicory.",87,Gundlach Bundschu 2012 Mountain Cuvée Red (Sonoma County)
"The aromas bring notes of dark cherries and exotic spice. The palate is big and bold, with a mixture of fruit and barrel flavors backed by firm slightly dry tannins. It needs some time to settle in, with the wood currently a bit primary.",91,Palencia 2013 El Viñador Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"Crisp, bright and delicious, this has pure red fruit, with an herb note, intense acidity and a tangy texture.",92,Château Coussin 2011 Rosé (Côtes de Provence Sainte-Victoire)
"Somewhat aromatically restrained with notes of kiwi, pineapple and citrus. It's somewhat sleek in style but has with a lightly creamy feel. The wine is enjoyable but the acidity doesn't quite seem to be there to pull it all together.",86,Columbia Crest 2013 H3 Sauvignon Blanc (Horse Heaven Hills)
"A darkly colored red blend that tastes like coffee sweetened with blackberry liqueur and anise. It's a big, rich, thick wine that's rustic, but entirely drinkable with barbecue, burgers, pizza.",84,MommyJuice NV Red (Central Coast)
"Faint rose petal notes still perfume the peachy fruit. The palate is rich, medium sweet and honeyed, as though peach and citrus were soaked in honey. This is fresh and rich, rounded and poised, tipping the scales just a little bit more on the rich side. The spice on the finish is reminiscent of honeysuckle.",91,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2011 Steingrubler Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Seara d'Ordens is a quinta at the western end of the Douro region. This rich and polished wine is full of black fruits, with herbal overtones and layers of wood aging that have left espresso flavors. With this concentration, the wine needs to age for several years; drink after 2017.",91,Quinta Seara d'Ordens 2011 Talentus Grand Escolha Red (Douro)
"This supple yet mouthfilling wine boasts intense notes of garrigue--that Provençal blend of wild thyme, bay leaf and lavender--layered over hints of pepper and a base of cherry fruit. A hint of cocoa emerges on the short but pleasant finish. Drink it now and over the next couple of years.",89,Les Trois Couronnes 2011 Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape)
"This is a ripe wood-aged wine drawn from a selection of barrels. Eucalyptus flavors go with the black fruits and solid tannins. The wine is dense, and still obviously very young. It is going to be an impressive ripe wine. Drink from 2019.",91,Château Tour Prignac 2014 Grand Réserve  (Médoc)
"Give this young Cab time in the cellar to come around. Right now, it's fresh and tannic, with primary fruit blackberry and cherry flavors, and the sweet smoky oak hasn't been integrated. Should knit together over the next 4-6 years, at least.",91,Clark-Clauden 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Rose, sage, menthol and cellar floor aromas carry over to the palate along with raw sour cherry, cranberry and clove. Assertive tannins clench the astringent finish.",86,Boasso 2013 del Comune di Serralunga d'Alba  (Barolo)
"While this wine is dark and packed with tannins, it has the fruit weight potential to compensate. It is a firm wine, solid with ripe tannins and blackberry flavors. The acidity at the end promises a good future, so drink from 2022. Lucien Lurton took over Bouscaut in 1979. Since 1992, has been in the hands of daughter Sophie Lurton and her husband Laurent Cogombles. Investments include vineyard renovation, a barrel cellar in 2010 and a B&B in 2013.",92,Château Bouscaut 2013  Pessac-Léognan
"This Zinfandel is alcoholic, and it's dominated by overripe prune and raisin flavors.",80,Tin Barn 2010 Los Chamizal Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley)
"This is a particularly expressive wine with lots of personality. It opens with aromas of cherry, tea and wood smoke, and tastes very dry and structured with vivid fruit acidity and tannins. Sour cherry and raspberry provide the fruit flavors.",90,Donkey & Goat 2013 Perli Vineyards Syrah (Mendocino Ridge)
"Aromas of blueberry and clove, with a soft hint of cinnamon set the scene for flavors of blackberry, anise, black pepper, vanilla and white chocolate. A grid of smooth tannins makes way for a finish dotted by flavors of dark berry, spice, and cranberry sauce.",93,Jerusalem Wineries 2013 3400 Premium Shiraz (Judean Hills)
"This Viognier from the outlands region of Elqui is minerally but low on fruit aromas. A fresh, linear palate offers lettuce, lime and other limited green-leaning flavors, while the finish is lasting and firm, with zesty acidity.",85,Falernia 2014 Reserva Viognier (Elqui Valley)
"Leafy, brambly notes are prominent against a backdrop of lean red-cherry flavors on this tart, Cabernet Franc-dominant blend. It's a vibrantly acidic but delicately structured wine with soft, rippling tannins on the finish.",85,Silver Thread 2011 Blackbird Red (Finger Lakes)
"93-85 Barrel sample. Mint and eucalyptus aromas are the hallmark of this tensely tannic wine, which relies on finely polished new wood as well as blackcurrant flavors. It is very dry, with a hard edge, but the potential balance is there.",94,Château Beau-Séjour Bécot 2008 Barrel sample  (Saint-Émilion)
"Aged for 20 months in 40% new French oak, this remains a tough nut to crack. It's encased in a hard tannic shell, with little ripe fruit, and is strongly flavored with barrel notes of tobacco and vanilla. Decant it or put it through an aerator.",86,Maryhill 2011 Proprietor's Reserve Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The La Jota and W.S. Keyes vineyards are the sources for this classically styled wine that is intense and alive in minerality. Clove, black pepper and mountains of dried herb are front and center between firm, dusty tannin and oak. The texture is plush and velvety on the palate, with plenty of length on the finish.",95,La Jota Vineyard 2013 Merlot (Howell Mountain)
"A very pretty effort, the wine's strawberry and rhubarb flavors are balanced against spring herbs and hints of leaf. The Morrison Lane Sangiovese is blended with 15% Syrah from the Boushey vineyard.",89,Trio Vintners 2007 Sangiovese (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"A perfumed nose of violet, black cherry and cedar give this Syrah-Mavroudi blend a seductive start. On the palate, black fruit and spice flavors are balanced, but not overly complex. A solid everyday red with indigenous appeal, and a great match for pasta with red sauces, pizza or steak.",85,Tsantali 2008 Kanenas Maronia Vineyards Mavroudi-Syrah Red (Ismarikos)
This is spicy with a strong floral character. Its red-berry fruits are shot through with acidity. The crispness and attractiveness of the wine are spoiled just by the hint of candy and caramel. Drink now.,84,Fabre en Provence 2016 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Opaque and almost black in the glass, this young bottling shows savory aromas of roasted meat, crushed slate, dark chocolate, fresh thyme and green peppercorns. Ripe black fruit flavors leap from the glass, bringing layers of thyme, pepper and Indian spice, all framed by bright acidity. Ready to enjoy now.",92,Tensley 2015 Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"There are a lot of different elements going on here, with aromas of black fruit mixing with nuances of sweet smoke and a touch of leather. Balanced and full in the mouth with moderate tannins and a solid finish. Drink now.",85,D'Aria 2009 Music by D'Aria Red (Durbanville)
"This plump, succulent wine is a solid value. Understated toast frames pineapple and melon in this fruit-driven style. Drink this crisp, appealing quaffer now–2018.",88,Franklin Tate 2014 Tate Chardonnay (Margaret River)
"This medium-weight red's berry fruit and saddle leather accents can't rise above a tart, even sour, herb-vegetal note that appears early and remains throughout. Shows modest tannins and a little length on the back end, but the odd note prevails. —M.M.",81,Montesierra 1999 Tinta de Toro (Somontano)
"Grassy lime, kiwi and crème brûlée provide succulence and substance to this wine, surrounded refreshingly by ebullient acidity. Fermented in stainless steel, it was then aged minimally in neutral French oak. The wood provides firm structure without getting in the way of the fruit.",91,Trione 2014 River Road Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley)
"A rubbery, rustic nose starts out stalky and gritty before settling down. This is closed in feel, with stalky, almost burnt dark-berry flavors that end similarly, with stalky, herbal notes.",84,Ruca Malen 2014 Yauquen Bonarda (Mendoza)
"Bianco Maggiore delivers touches of lemon drop and kiwi with fresh lime and yellow rose. The mouthfeel is thicker and denser than you'd expect, and it offers a long, tangy fruit-driven finish.",86,Cantine Rallo 2010 Bianco Maggiore Grillo (Sicilia)
"Powerful and dense, this wine has great potential. With full-bodied blackberry fruits and acidity that push through the dark tannins, it shows a rich character that is impressive for the year. Drink from 2020. The property has been owned since 1999 by Sophie Lurton of neighboring Château Bouscaut.",93,Château Lamothe Bouscaut 2013  Pessac-Léognan
There's a certain elegance to this Dolcetto that distinguishes it in a crowd. The fruit element is bright and strong and the wine shows generous layers of raspberry and cherry on the close.,87,Tenute Cisa Asinari dei Marchesi di Gresy 2008 Monte Aribaldo  (Dolcetto d'Alba)
"This Bordeaux-style blend of 48% Merlot, 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 10% Cab Franc looks a bit murky, unfiltered, and is currently showing a lot of influence from barrel aging. Medium-weight blackberry and cassis fruit is married to dark chocolate, with a dash of black olive in the mix. It's tasty for drinking 2017–2019.",89,Adams Bench 2010 Reckoning Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Self-proclaimed to be the only Sagrantino in the Napa Valley (which is probably true), this wine displays varietal character in its smoky leather and its fruit characteristics trafficking in tart cranberry, orange and black cherry. It is light and subtle.",87,Benessere 2012 Estate Sagrantino (St. Helena)
"The quality of this wine is as high as you'd expect, given the ABC production and vineyard sourcing. Not many winemakers are able to source fruit from a Talley vineyard, but Jim Clendenen can. Beyond the raspberry, pomegranate and cola fruit flavors, what's notable about the is the acidity. It is strong and searing, and strongly suggests pairing with something rich, like lamb.",93,Au Bon Climat 2010 Talley Vineyard Rincon Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley)
Rustic aromas are followed by rough-edged fruitiness in this young wine. It has ripe berry fruits as well as some firm tannins in the background. It is not yet integrated and needs to develop much more. Drink from 2018.,86,Quinta de Porrais 2012 Porrais Red (Douro)
"90—92 Barrel sample. Named after the limestone, Astéries, which dominates this small vineyard. The wine is mineral, tannic, somewhat austere at this stage, with dry tannins.",91,Les Astéries 2006 Barrel sample  (Saint-Émilion)
"A botrytized wine that definitely shows honey and ripe fruit, along with the ethereal acidity. The wine is sweet and fresh, the richness only hinted at in the mouth. A library wine that is only produced in years when there is botrytis.",92,Emmerich Knoll 2006 Loibner Smaragd Vinothekfüllung Riesling (Wachau)
"Layers of vanilla, spice and toast persist throughout this richly textured wine. Sunny raspberry and cherry flavors are pleasant, but peek through a bit shyly on the palate. It's an oaky wine, but supple and seductive with a fringe of finely grained, persistent tannins.",86,Goose Watch 2012 Merlot (Finger Lakes)
"An intriguing combination of almost equal parts Malbec, Mourvèdre and Petit Verdot, Rock Wall's Romancer hails from Clarksburg's small Heringer Vineyard, and is bright, fruity and juicy with blackberry and strawberry flavors. Aromatic lavender and jasmine notes against a backdrop of meaty tobacco make the presence of Mourvedre apparent.",89,Rock Wall 2011 Romancer-Heringer Vineyard Red (Clarksburg)
"The aromas bring notes of cocoa, green herb and purple fruit, seeming more evolved than its age might indicate, while also bringing along some volatility. The palate shows gamy fruit flavors that seem a bit dried out.",83,Cedar River Cellars 2013 Ava's Crush Cabernet Sauvignon (Rattlesnake Hills)
"This is a festive wine, with soft, ripe fruit and acidity, plus a red berry flavor.",86,Henry Fessy 2012 Nouveau  (Beaujolais)

"From the Bouyssou family estate, this structured wine is perfumed, ripe with black fruits and firmly based on serious tannins. It has weight and richness with spice and concentration. At the end, the acidity is crisp and juicy. Drink from 2019.",88,Château Armandière 2014 Ancestral Malbec (Cahors)
"This blend of 60% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 10% Cinsault would be a crowd favorite if more than 700 cases were available in the U.S. The black cherry fruit is punched up by hints of herbs and cracked pepper, there's ample weight but great freshness and zest, and the finish is long and complex, showing off hints of licorice, pepper and dusty earth. Drink now–2020.",90,Alain Jaume et Fils 2014 Haut de Brun Red (Côtes du Rhône)
"Brilliantly aromatic, this wine beguiles with exotic scents of plum pudding, spice cake, cherry compote, pipe tobacco, red licorice and raspberry jam. All that and more can be tasted—the wine is a riot of fruits and baking spices. This makes the best possible case for Mourvèdre as a stand-alone varietal wine here in Washington.",92,Syncline 2008 Coyote Canyon Vineyard Mourvèdre (Horse Heaven Hills)
"A blend of 40% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 25% Mourvèdre, all aged in neutral oak, this wine impresses with alluring aromas of ripe strawberry, clove, blueberry, coffee and spice. Flavors are rich and palate-coating while displaying balance and finesse, with a finish that lingers.",93,Tenet 2013 G-S-M (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Delicate and complex, a cool climate wine with a mixture of ripe cherry flavors and leaner ones of tobacco, tomato skin, and cranberry. Bone dry with excellent acidity, this somewhat tart wine is well made, and may be an ager.",88,Kynsi 1999 Paragon Vineyard Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)
"This unusual varietal wine hits with a giant wall of herbal aromas that suggest tomato leaf, oregano and basil. The palate is firm and structured in feel, with smacking tannins and flavors of dark berry fruits, green herbs and coffee. A peppery tasting finish with residual green flavors and mocha works for this decidedly herbal-leaning but high-quality wine. Drink now.",88,Bodegas Valdemar 2005 Inspiración  (Rioja)
"Great acidity on this wine, with a squirt of lime juice giving it needed zest. The wine itself is simple, lush and fruity, with peach and pineapple flavors.",86,Lincourt 2010 Courtney's Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"A sleek blend of wet-cement minerality, slight dairy notes, citrus pith and a grapefruit spritz freshness makes for a very inviting nose on this wine from a new vineyard that overlooks the Santa Ynez River. A rocky, grassy element powers the palate, with lime zest and chopped Granny Smith apple-peel flavors.",91,Grimm's Bluff 2014 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
"Appetizing notes of Cox Orange Pippin and ripe red apples with lemon zest make up the nose of this fruity wine. The palate gives them full rein, adding a funky tone of yeast. This wine is characterized by intense, refreshing juiciness that ripples across the palate in fruity abandon. It's dry and refreshing.",91,Wieninger 2016 Riesling (Vienna)
"Deep golden notes of honey, stone fruit and acacia flower open this beautifully luminous blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon and Riesling. The wine has a creamy, rich personality and brightens the palate with its crisp, almost steely freshness.",88,Il Roncal 2006 Ploe di Stelis White (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"Lean and austere, this is a firm, medicinal and herbal wine that's still very young. Red berry fruits, along with drying tannins and spice from wood aging hint at its aging potential. It's best to wait until 2016.",90,Château d'Aiguilhe 2011  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux
"This is a simple but delicious Barbera loaded with ripe plum and black cherry flavors punctuated by licorice and pepper notes. Soft and round, this is ready to enjoy now. Pair it with pasta topped with cream sauces or grilled chicken dishes.",87,Manzone 2011 Barilot  (Barbera d'Alba)
"This is a powdery, pillowy and richly lush wine that flirts with voluptuous tendencies of soft, juicy red fruit, yet offers pretty floral elements and complex seasonings of cinnamon and nutmeg on the nose. At the same time, the underlying grip provides structure and depth. Decant or hold through 2022.",94,Anomaly 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
"Very minerally in character, this wine has only a touch of wood, showing attractive acidity, citrus fruits and a tight, nervy texture.",89,Domaine Vincent Girardin 2010 Murger des Dents de Chien Premier Cru  (Saint-Aubin)
"This is a well-made and inviting wine, made from a majority of Merlot, with 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and small amounts of Petite Sirah and Petit Verdot. Muted aromas give way to a dense palate laced with leather and dried cherry notes. Mild in tannin and oak, it's enjoyable now.",88,Purple Heart Wines 2014 Red (Napa Valley)
"This dark purple blend of 55% Ancellota and 45% Lambrusco Salamino has subtle mature grape and black-skinned berry aromas. The dry, foamy palate offers dried black cherry and raisin hints alongside bright acidity.",88,Medici Ermete 2016 Solo Red
"Raw, earthy plum aromas are spicy and lightly herbal. This feels saucy yet monotone. Tomato, red-plum and herbal flavors end with a hint of brown sugar and a continuation of the wine's herbal plum character.",85,Chilensis 2013 Reserva Estate Bottled Merlot (Maule Valley)
"Rich in sweet oak and almond paste, this is a concentrated, fulsome and big wine, creamy in mouthfeel and approach. It gets fruitier in the glass, sharing flavors of baked apple pie with brioche.",90,Rodney Strong 2013 Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Melon, nectarine and mild citrus aromas are clean and direct. This basic white is firm and balanced, while stone fruit, melon and white-pepper flavors end easy and fresh.",88,Palma Real 2015 Verdejo-Viura (Rueda)
"After helping Liquid Farm launch to Chardonnay success, the Dragonette crew took their own stab at making the white grape, and have succeeded wildly. Extremely pithy aromas of lime and yellow grapefruit meet with yogurt, kiwi and chive on the zesty nose, which unleashes a citrus explosion once sipped of lime peels, tangerine flesh and skin, and yellow apples in the midpalate.",93,Dragonette 2014 Duvarita Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County)
"This wine is a blend of Grenache (46%), Cinsault (31%) and Counoise. A very pretty pale peach color, it offers quite light aromas of strawberry and watermelon. The flavors are sleek and light, capped off by a tart finish.",88,Tranche 2015 Estate Grown Pink Pape Blackrock Vineyard Rosé (Yakima Valley)
"Aged 15 years in oak, Donnafranca Marsala is a new product from these historic cellars with notes of resin, maple syrup and honey roasted almonds. At 19% alcohol it's intense and powerful without the burn; it ends on a long note of toasted almond.",89,Cantine Florio NV Donnafranca Superiore Riserva Semisecco Ambra  (Marsala)
"This is an impressively rich, ripe wine that maintains great swathes of fresh pear and apple flavors. It is dense on the palate, with a powerful mineral and steel expression to pair with the opulent texture and rounded aftertaste. Should develop well over at least five years.",95,F X Pichler 2012 Loibner Oberhauser Smaragd Riesling (Wachau)
"This is a light wine—light   in fruit, acid and tannins, and light in body. That doesn't mean it doesn't offer a lot of pleasure. It does. It has complex herbal, berry and spice flavors, and it's nicely dry, with a certain richness. It's a great wine for early drinking.",89,Byron 1998 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"Dark berries and sweet baking-spice tones carry the nose. The medium-bodied palate brings juicy blackberry flavors showing mild concentration, supported by soft tannins.",85,Messina Hof 2012 Paulo Limited Edition Primitivo (Texas)
"The brothers are better known for their Cornas, but this Saint-Joseph is a nice wine as well. It combines notes of marinated beef, ripe blackberries and espresso in a medium- to full-bodied wine that's mouthwatering and easy to drink. Try it now and over the next several years.",90,Éric & Jöel Durand 2010 Les Coteaux  (Saint-Joseph)
"This is a gentle, ripe wine that has pineapple and peach flavors and fresh fruitiness. It is smooth with balanced acidity and a zesty aftertaste. Drink now.",84,Quinta do Casal Branco 2014 Quartilho Branco White (Tejo)
"Admirable for its consistency from year to year, the B is always a safe choice. It adds a layer of creamy texture to bold passion fruit aromas and ripe citrusy flavors. Best consumed before the end of 2014.",89,Brancott 2012 Letter Series B Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"96–98. Barrel sample. The first vintage from a newly-constructed cellar, this is a beautiful wine, with glorious Merlot flavors. It's full of spice and dense with velvet tannins. The wine has great opulence and its fruit is well integrated into the structure.",97,Château Pétrus 2012 Barrel Sample  (Pomerol)
"Oily, stalky, bready aromas are a bit tired. This has a chunky feel offset by citric acidity. Briny, salty flavors of citrus fruits and lees are lasting. For varietal Tempranillo Blanco, this isn't bad.",86,Nivarius 2014 Colección Monovarietales Tempranillo Blanco (Rioja)
"A soft wood- and almond-flavored wine. It misses fresh fruit, instead offering a rounded, ripe character that suggests it is not for aging.",86,Domaine Corine Perchaud 2009 Vaucoupin Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"Unlike many of the kabinetts from 2006, this is a true kabinett-style wine, with modest levels of alcohol and sugar balanced by crisp acids. Mineral-diesel notes accent apple and mint flavors, and there's a hint of honey as well. Finishes fresh, if just a bit short.",86,St. Urbans-Hof 2006 Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Kabinett Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer)
"Clean and fresh, and also varietally correct as it unloads full but accurate aromas of cucumber, passion fruit and lime. Casas del Bosque does very well with Sauvignon Blanc. This wine has all the citrus, tang and style you could ask for, but it shows good depth and complexity as well, which is what pushes it up to the next level. For $14, this wine delivers plenty.",89,Casas del Bosque 2008 Gran Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"Rich, velvety blackberry and cherry flavors flood the palate of this decadently full-bodied Cabernet Franc. It's irresistibly juicy and forward, but invigorating acidity and shades of herb, bramble and fine-grained tannins lend depth and structure. The finish is languid and luscious.",89,Billsboro 2013 Sawmill Creek Vineyards Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes)
"This is a great example of Pinot Noir made in the slightly underripe style, showing underbrush, kalamata olive, black olive, black pepper and a touch of just-ripe mulberry on the nose. Those elements carry through the fresh sip, where intriguing notes of thyme, marjoram and bay leaf decorate the tart red-fruit and olive character.",92,Mercy 2013 Griva Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco)
"Aromas of wild rose, chopped mint and an earthy whiff of grilled Porcini mushroom slowly emerge. The taut, austere palate shows cranberry, raw sour cherry, star anise and clove framed in firm acidity and tightly wound, close-grained tannins that clench the finish. This needs time to unfurl and fully develop. Drink after 2023.",89,Poderi Luigi Einaudi 2013 Terlo  (Barolo)
"The wine spent 20 months in 50% new French oak, and tastes like it still has the substantial, ripe, dark rich fruit to more than handle the barrel flavors. Black cherry and cassis meet mocha and espresso head on, swirling together into a lush, tasty finish.",90,Two Vintners 2010 Pepper Bridge Vineyard Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Oaky aromas of almond, vanilla and peach settle on a palate with grip and acidity. Flavors of toasted almond, baked apple and briny apricot finish with forward acidity. This is a blend of Garnacha Blanca and Macabeo, but it's the white Garnacha that sticks out.",89,Mas Blanch I Jové 2013 Saó Blanc White (Costers del Segre)
"Made with 80% Sangiovese and 20% Merlot, this opens with aromas of prune, scorched earth, toast and a hint of black currant. On the structured palate, notes of grilled bell pepper, espresso and dried herb accent a core of dried black cherry alongside fine-grained tannins that give it a firm finish.",90,Castello di Ama 2011 Vigneto La Casuccia Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico)
"This Bordeaux blend is based on Cabernet Sauvignon. It's a big wine, full-bodied and very dry, with a long, spicy finish. Certainly packs a lot of flavor, with tons of blackberry jam, cassis and raisins. Has the inherent balance to age for a little while, so give it until 2015, but not much longer.",89,Bon Niche 2010 Chemin Path Red (Paso Robles)
"Fruit overload and gumball richness define the syrupy, super ripe nose on this Monastrell (Mourvèdre) Cabernet Franc blend from Valencia. This is big stuff, with blackberry, prune and chocolate cake qualities. It's thick, intense, tannic and will continue to be lively and drinkable for another six or seven years. A surprise wine; 100 cases produced.",91,Bodegas Rafael Cambra 2003 Minimum Monastrell (Valencia)
"Earthy hints of clay pots and spice evoke the clay and limestone vineyards from which this dry Riesling originates. Sunny Meyer lemon, apple and lime flavors penetrate through the palate, with a smoky, mineral edge. It's full bodied and richly textured, with a long, lingering finish.",90,Pflüger 2015 Ungsteiner Herrenberg Trocken Riesling (Pfalz)
"A Claret from Missouri? Adventurers should give this wine a shot. On the nose, it's delicate and filled with floral and soft, spicy notes. The flavors are somewhat thin and wan though—red berry, pepper, tobacco—and the wine finishes with a slightly bitter edge. Pair with with barbecue—it might fare better.",82,Mount Pleasant Winery 2006 Claret Red (Missouri)
"There is plenty of ripe fruit here. With soft tannins and a generous structure, the wine is rich, full of berry and red-plum flavors and with just enough tannins. Give this fruity wine until 2018.",90,Château le Roudier 2014  Bordeaux Supérieur
"A blend of old-vine Cariñena (60%), Syrah (25%) and Merlot (15%). The color is impressively dark and so is the fruit—mainly plums and blackberries. Toast and dried spices from new oak give an additional impression of opulence. But even more impressive is the balance. This is no low-acid, fruit-and-oak wonder; the natural acidity of the Carignane shines through, giving lift and definition to the flavors. Easy to drink now, but should easily hold a few years.",91,Miguel Torres 1999 Cordillera Red (Curicó Valley)
"This almost colorless sweet wine is made from Macabeo, not your most expressive grape variety. Aromas are funky and cheesy, with a low-acid palate that's on the flabby side, while creamy vanilla and caramel flavors don't allow for much fruit to shine through.",85,Casa de la Ermita 2013 Dulce Blanco Macabeo (Jumilla)
Emidio Pepe is an iconic leader of the organic and natural wine movement in Italy. This meaty Montepulciano d'Abruzzo shows some aromas of rubber and Band-Aid followed by polished cherry fruit. A soft and velvety mouthfeel is followed by cured meat and bresaola.,87,Emidio Pepe 2003  Montepulciano d'Abruzzo
"The raspberry and cherry flavors are a bit obvious at first, but then the balanced tannins and acids become apparent, and the tasteful application of sweet, smoky oak surfaces. This wine grows more interesting as it sits in the glass. Drink it now and over the next 3–4 years for maximum freshness.",91,Siduri 2011 Pisoni Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"This stylish bottling offers a silky nose with hay, pound cake and herb notes. Lean and clean, it sports grapefruit and green-apple flavors, and a good feel and finish, with mineral and spice elements. A trim, well-toned contender.",89,Piper-Heidsieck 1995 Brut  (Champagne)
"Plump aromas of black cherry, mulberry, vanilla and star anise rise on the rich but not overbearing nose of this wine. There is dark-fruit ripeness on the front, but then comes a heavy array of spices, from allspice and clove to thyme and dried sage. The texture is soft, yet the tannins are noticeable and the acidity is buoyant.",95,Laetitia 2015 Single Vineyard La Coupelle Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"While this smells a bit rough and herbal, it's more generous than the winery's varietal Tannat. This Merlot has some of the same scratchy qualities of the Tannat, but it shows more body and richness as well as riper black-fruit flavors.",84,Marichal 2011 Premium Varietal Merlot (Canelones)
"The producer held this wine back from release because it came from such a great ageworthy vintage—this is well worth the weight. With the wonderful richness of the 75% Pinot Noir dominating, this is a balanced wine, just hinting at toastiness, with concentrated ripe apple fruits melding into the texture of the wine.",96,Mailly Grand Cru 2008 Les Echansons  (Champagne)
"Crushed violet, red berry, mint and menthol aromas lead the nose. The firm palate offers dried red cherry, raw strawberry, licorice, white pepper and sage alongside grippy tannins that leave an astringent finish. Give the tannins a few more years to unclench then enjoy before the remaining fruit fades.",88,Ca'Romè 2012 Chiaramanti  (Barbaresco)
"This appetizing wine has attention-getting grapefruit and fresh-cut herb aromas, vivid and crisp fruit flavors, light body and a lingering, citrusy finish.",87,Mirassou 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (California)
"Lean and basic, with fairly ripe aromas and a decent helping of apple, peach and grapefruit. The fruit is a touch soft and lacking in structure though.",84,Valdivieso 2002 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley)
"A rare gem, this Sémillon-Sauvignon Blanc blend is sourced entirely from Red Mountain's Klipsun vineyard. Aged for 10 months in one-year-old French oak, it's a spicy wine with aromatics and flavors of botanicals such as mint and quinine. Fruit is sharp with flavors of grapefruit and white peach, and hints of toast and cracker.",88,Balboa 2007 Mith White (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The concept here is a southern Rhône blend—47% Syrah, 17% Grenache, 19% Cinsault and 17% Mourvèdre. With the extra dollop of Syrah, it's got more substance than the usual Châteauneuf wannabes. Spicy and sharp, this benefits from the fact that the grapes all came in at once and were co-fermented, so the blend married early and well. Despite its youth, this is seamless and focused; a complete and very successful wine with berry, cherry and sweet plum fruit flavors annotated with spice and bits of chocolate. Elegant, feminine and supple, this is a lovely bottle.",91,Bunnell 2006 Stonetree Vineyard à pic Red (Wahluke Slope)
"The aromas of earth, herb, cranberry, cherry and barrel tones are light and subdued. The flavors are tart and brambly, with the tannins needing some time to stretch their legs.",91,Leonetti Cellar 2013 Sangiovese (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Acorn has produced one of their best bottlings ever. The wine is drily crisp and tannic, but rich and supple, with cassis, cherry and carob flavors that have an earthy, mushroom and tobacco grounding. The wine contains smaller amounts of at least 10 other varieties, in the manner of an old field blend.",91,Acorn 2005 Alegria Vineyards Heritage Vines Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"The wine is crisp, bright with acidity and red-currant fruits. It has weight while also having an intensely crisp texture. Its aftertaste and rich texture are lifted at the end by a shot of citrus. The wine comes from the estate of a 19th-century family-owned chateau.",88,Les Vins Bréban 2016 Château de Libran Rosé (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence)
"Pungent aromas of tight-grained oak meet with almonds, pecans and lemon sorbet on the opulent attention-grabbing nose. Woody flavors of sandalwood and cedar continue to the palate, which is crisp, clean and salty but not unctuous at all, with tangy citrus on the finish.",94,Two Sisters 2015 Courtney's Vineyard Reserve Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Situated in the south-east end of the Setúbal peninsula, this estate has produced a ripe, smooth and densely rich wine. It has a plum jelly flavor that is sustained by finely integrated tannins. It has a medium-term future, with full, generous fruitiness developing fast; drink from 2016.",88,Herdade da Comporta 2012 Red (Península de Setúbal)
"Fermented and aged in stainless steel, this is a direct and appealing wine that brings notes of freshly cut red apple and peach, with a dash of Muscat Blanc (1%) lifting the aromatics. It's medium bodied with a pleasing interplay of citrus and stone fruit flavors throughout.",87,Sawtooth 2012 Estate Grown Pinot Gris
"Welcoming on the nose, this top-end bottling offers aromas of baked red cherry, clove and black plum before diving into crushed graphite, wet slate and loamy mud aromas. Soft on the palate but immediately vibrant with acidity, flavors of dark cranberry and tart cherry are lifted by anise-like spice.",92,Testarossa 2014 Niclaire Pinot Noir (California)
"There's a forward hickory-maple smoke note to this interesting blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 20% Barbera. Dark berries, vanilla bean and toasted oak notes unfold on the nose and in the mouth, with a touch of cigar tobacco spice that carries through on the finish. Drink through 2016.",88,Shiloh Winery 2009 Mor Red (Judean Hills)
"Mineral, mulberry, dried herb and black-fruit aromas lead to layered dark-fruit flavors that show intensity as well as exceptional balance. This has a delicious factor that is impossible to ignore.",92,Avennia 2013 Arnaut Boushey Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"Aromas of black cherry, clove, black pepper and chocolate lay the groundwork for flavors of ripe black cherry, strawberry, chocolate, fennel bulb and black pepper. A hint of coolness arrives towards the finish in a burst of eucalyptus, but restrained tannins and final notes of bright fruit make for a satisfying experience.",90,Tulip Winery 2013 Just Merlot (Judean Hills)
"Aromas of golden raisins, fig, licorice and vanilla lead to full-feeling dark-fruit flavors, with the tannins bringing a sense of grittiness. Time might smooth things, but the aromas already seem a bit dried out.",88,Barons 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"Made using Pinot Noir skins to color the wine, rather than the more usual Champagne trick of adding red wine, this is a well judged, ripe wine. With its red fruits and light tannins it still tastes young. Acidity and a balanced dosage make for a wine that will be better from 2017.",92,Pannier NV Egérie Rosé de Saignée Brut  (Champagne)
"This wine offers drying aromas of dried hay or graham cracker that are very unusual for a dessert wine. In fact, they suggest an obvious pairing with dried biscuits or sponge cake. That said, the wine certainly has personality and offers a smooth, honey-like finish.",86,Volpago NV Lunastorta Passito White (Veneto)
"Popcorn and baked apple aromas are oaky but not overly woody. This feels fresh but with substance. Flavors of baked apple, woodspice and toast finish healthy, long and with acidic kick.",89,Errazuriz 2013 Max Reserva Chardonnay (Aconcagua Valley)
"A Bordeaux-style blend, it's half Merlot, the rest split between the Cabs. Suggestions of sweaty, funky aromas lead into a core of sweet candied fruit. It's a bit disjointed, fine for glugging, not for keeping.",86,Grizzly Peak 2013 Rogue Rouge Red (Rogue Valley)
"This is a landmark Amarone that has often acted as the category's biggest ambassador abroad. It bursts open with aromas of dark berry, spice, leather and tobacco, and it is both generous and long-lasting on the palate.",91,Masi 2008 Costasera  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"This impressive Barbaresco shows generous intensity and a very nice equilibrium between wild berry fruit and oak-driven tones of spice and tobacco. There's a fun touch of pepper and white truffle as well and the wine is compact, firm and elegant on the close.",91,Carlo Giacosa 2007 Montefico  (Barbaresco)
"This ripe, fruity wine is ready to drink. With red berry fruits and fresh acidity spiced with wood flavors, it's an easy wine that is ripe and soft.",85,Patient Cottat 2012 Le Grand Caillou Pinot Noir (Vin de France)
"While the nose is a bit cool, suggesting tart, green notes of melon rind and apple, the palate of this late-harvest Riesling is unctuously ripe. It's boldly honeyed yet pristine in fruit character, suggesting sun-kissed yellow cherries and tangerines. The palate is concentrated and forward but balanced by zesty acidity and a lingering, delicately sweet finish.",93,Domdechant Werner 2015 Hochheimer Hölle Spätlese Riesling (Rheingau)
"Massive fruity extract characterizes this Cabernet. With noble tannins and explosive black currant, cassis and dark chocolate flavors, it defines the modern Napa cult style of soft, delicious complexity. Good to go now, but you're better off holding it for 8–12 years.",93,Black Coyote 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A touch blossomy against a core of ripe raspberry and cherry perfume, the nose on this traditional-method Pinot Noir sparkler is particularly alluring. The palate is elegant and fresh, marked by fine, mouthfilling mousse and delicate raspberry-candy finish.",89,Macari 2010 Cuvée Gabriella Brut Rosé Sparkling (North Fork of Long Island)
This über-simple sparkler has an extremely shy nose while the diluted off-dry palate offers mere suggestions of tropical fruit and a confectionery note. Brisk bubbles provide the backdrop.,83,Cavicchioli NV Extra Dry  (Prosecco)
"Doesn't show quite the rich complexity of Sequana's single-vineyard Pinots, but a fine wine nonetheless. Dry, tannic and crisp in acidity, it has berry, currant and spice flavors with a nice earthiness.",88,Sequana 2009 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Rather barnyardy and gaseous at first, but air breathes more clarity into the nose. The palate is chunky, grabby and a little awkward, with herbal, medicinal black fruit and buttery flavors. Slight heat and burn hamper the finish.",84,Bodegas Fontana 2007 Misterio de... Red (Uclés)
"A wine with only natural sulfur, it feels lean, with piercing acidity and firm tannins. It is young and all the elements should fall into place, but with the fruit's stalky character the wine will always be dry.",85,Henri Milan 2010 Sans Soufre Ajouté Red (Vin de France)
"For an inexpensive wine, this offers plenty of wood spice, vanilla, char and toast on the nose. The palate smacks hard with drawing tannins, while flavors of medicinal plum and raspberry carry a charred aftertaste. Good as a whole, with oak dominating the finish.",86,Arroyo 2008 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"Ripe black cherry, raspberry and wild strawberry notes abound on the nose and in the mouth of this accessible wine. Medium weight, with fine yet spicy tannins and a medium-length finish that's kissed with a hint of mocha. Easy, approachable and food friendly; drink now.",89,Les Vignerons de Tautavel Vingrau 2009 Réserve Vieilles Vignes Red (Côtes du Roussillon Villages Tautavel)
"Now at its drinking peak, this has attractive acidity balanced by mature flavors. It has weight, richness and a dry, steely core Enjoy this with food or by itself.",86,Hugel 2007 Jubilée Riesling (Alsace)
"Aromas of spicy oak and dried berry fruits lead to a clampy, rubbery palate. Plum and berry flavors are slightly saucy, while the finish, which is still fresh for a 2009, is tannic and pulling.",88,Mileto 2009 Reserva  (Rioja)
"Very dry and with too much wood, this is an attenuated wine with a hard facade. It doesn't offer enough fruit for the future.",83,Château Noblet 2011  Côtes de Bourg
"Made from Nerello Mascalese and Nerello Cappuccio, this shows bright berry aromas of blackberry and cassis, with cola, dried ginger and polished mineral notes. The mouthfeel is clean and bright, with a touch of chopped mint.",88,Cottanera 2011 Barbazzale  (Etna)
"Ruddy slightly overripe black cherry and berry flavors are juxtaposed with tart green notes in this fruity but rustic Cabernet Sauvignon. Soft, sunny acidity lends a plush, juicy mouthfeel and a brisk finish.",84,Rooster Hill 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes)
"More exotic than many Malbecs, with intriguing aromas of prune, moss and savory berry. The palate has a proper, likeable texture and jammy flavors of black cherry and herbs. Finishes a bit short and hollow, which may be a reflection of tough harvest conditions in 2008.",87,Finca Decero 2008 Remolinos Vineyard Malbec (Agrelo)
"Ruby red with garnet hues in color, this easy-drinking Merlot brings aromas of cherry, black berry and black raspberry on the nose. Tones of black plum and black cherry are ripe and persistent on the finish.",87,Vini 2013 Veni Vidi Vici Merlot (Thracian Valley)
"A 50-50 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this opens with aromas of red currant, cooking spice and a lightly toasted note. The sleek, easy palate doles juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper and mocha alongside supple tannins and fresh acidity. Enjoy soon.",88,Fattoria San Felo 2012 Balla La Vecchia Red (Toscana)
"Brambly berry fruit is dotted with highlights of black pepper and tart tangy herbs. The acids are way out in front of the fruit, delivering a citrusy, lightly toasty kick to the finish.",89,Amalie Robert 2012 Estate Selection Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Soft and fruity, this is a wine that is ready to drink. Red fruits and soft tannins are lifted by perfumed fruits that are forward and immediately attractive.",85,Caves Velhas 2015 Serradayres Colheita Seleccionada Red (Tejo)
"Shows a weaker side of the 2006 vintage, with an overly broad mouthfeel and a certain lack of precision, but still boasts ripe apple and melon flavors.",84,Paul Anheuser 2006 Kreuznacher Kahlenberg Spätlese Riesling (Nahe)
"Big and muscular, this opens with aromas of blackcurrant, grilled pepper and exotic spice. The solid palate delivers grilled porcini mushroom, roasted coffee bean and prune alongside teeth-coating tannins.",88,Secondo Marco 2008  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"Clove and barrel spice are dominant factors in this ripe Tannat, from first whiff to the finish. In between, there's char on the nose and palate as well as ripe blackberry and black currant flavors blended with wood-based pepper, nutmeg and more. A smoking, chewy, tannic finish closes this out. Drink from 2016–2019.",89,Bouza 2012 A8 Parcela Única Tannat (Montevideo)
"This ripe and spicy wine from the Dop family's 27 acres offers layers of black fruits. It has a concentrated texture and a firm structure that is juicy while dense. With this richness, the wine will develop into a smooth and generous wine. Drink from 2019.",91,Château Haut Cabut 2014  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux
"Dusty, chalky mineral tones extend throughout this delicate wine, lending a stark, linear tone to concentrated flavors of sweet apple and lemon. It's startlingly brisk with acidity, but zesty and clean in feel, making it a perfect pairing for creamy cheeses and fish or fowl in cream sauces.",88,Johannishof 2012 Johannisberger Klaus Spätlese Riesling (Rheingau)
"Light and juicy, this has fresh blackcurrant fruit, with balanced tannins. With its fruit forward flavor, it's not a wine for aging.",84,Rigal 2010 The Original Malbec (Vin de Pays du Lot)
"A well-made Tempranillo that's lush and rich yet balanced, its tannins well structured and its blueberry fruit intensity inviting. Lay it down awhile or give it a chance to breathe.",89,Duarte Georgetown 2008 Georgetown Divide Mountain Estate Tempranillo (El Dorado)
"Freshly ground black pepper and dark cherries scent this Hungarian Kékfrankos. It is medium bodied, presenting flavors of pomegranate and sour cherry with a slightly tart finish.",87,Weninger 2012 Balf Kékfrankos (Sopron)
"Smooth as silk and soft as butter, this glides across the palate in a smoky, sexy and seductive manner. Butter and berry, black cherry and a finishing flourish of chocolate nibs, capped with espresso, give this a complete start-to-finish set of flavors. Drink now and over the next decade.",93,Domaine Divio 2015 Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge)
"Grassy raspberry and cherry aromas are a bit leathery. This Carignan-Garnacha-Syrah blend feels saturated but not entirely comfortable. Jammy ripe mixed-berry flavors are chunky, candied and finish hot, with chocolaty oak.",85,Tossals 2014 Junior Red (Montsant)
"This wine seems unripe, and while it's nicely dry and crisp, it has an aggressive aroma and flavor of tart lime.",82,Ancient Peaks 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles)
"The overriding character of this basic Rioja is raisiny, ripe berry fruit; it's on the nose, palate and finish. Alongside these notes are mild tannins, some rubbery weight and chunky friendliness.",85,Viña Cerrada 2009 Crianza  (Rioja)
"This wine is the top of the line for Black Kite, and it certainly does not disappoint. Tea leaves, raspberry and cherry make a great blend of aromas, while the fruit flavors are bright like red cherries, the texture lively and fresh, and the overall impression very elegant. Best now through 2020.",93,Black Kite 2013 Angel Hawk Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Blended with 4% Viognier and 1% Grenache, this fragrant offering displays aromas of fresh flowers, herbs, green olive, huckleberry and smoked meat. The palate is ripe and fruit forward, a bit balled up in the middle right now but showing a pleasing sense of purity with length to match. Give it time to come into its own.",91,Eight Bells 2011 Eight Clones Red Willow Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"With an opening scent of freshly crushed raspberries and cherries sprinkled with black pepper and drizzled with anisette, this is an inviting wine. A Grenache-based Rhône blend, it turns soft and a little sweet and simple in the mouth, but is very easy to enjoy.",85,Tercero 2006 Cuvée Christie Red (Santa Barbara County)
"Crisp and elegant in feel, this has apricot and peach flavors that are balanced by the tight structure and the green-fruit-like acidity. The layers of toast have integrated with the ebullient fruit character and the taut, minerally finish. For aging 3–4 years.",92,Olivier Leflaive 2010 Dents du Chien Premier Cru  (Saint-Aubin)
"Firm, but balanced, this is a wine with many of the virtues of the vintage. It has weight and richness, but also fresh, juicy, fruity acidity all packaged nicely in tannins. Drink this wine from 2015.",87,Château Trocard Monrepos 2011  Bordeaux Supérieur
"Perfumed with woodland berry, dried rose, cake spice and sweet pipe tobacco, this is one of the most impressive of the '09 Riservas. The delicious, full-bodied palate offers layers of juicy black cherry, clove, cinnamon, licorice and mineral. Firm, ripe tannins give it structure and a polished feel. Drink 2019–2029.",95,Cavallotto 2009 Vignolo Riserva  (Barolo)
"A touch foxy and reduced on the nose, with jumpy berry aromas, this feels edgy and shows a grating tannic bite. The wine's plum, herb and candied berry flavors are solid, finishing with a dose of blueberry.",85,Salentein 2011 Portillo Estate Bottled Malbec (Valle de Uco)
"Smooth and creamy textured, with lovely toast and spice notes up front. Melon, pear, apple, mandarine orange and lemon flavors are evenly balanced. The wine is crisp and clean on the finish, yet also long and fresh. -J.M.",91,Hollywood & Vine 2001 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"This is firm and tannic, reflecting the challenges of the vintage, yet it does show classic garrigue aromas and flavors of black olives and dark cherries. Drink it now with grilled meats, or hold it a year or two in the hopes of it softening a little.",87,Famille Perrin 2013 Red (Côtes du Rhône Villages)
"Integrated acidity and ripeness allow for a Good & Plenty licorice-like note, accenting the fresh apricot and white peach flavors in this lovely, easygoing sipper.",90,Sivas-Sonoma 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County)
"92-94. Barrel sample. Mint and new wood aromas lead to a palate that has dark and concentrated tannins. The wine is bright and fresh, with juicy black-currant and plum flavors.",93,Château Troplong Mondot 2011 Barrel Sample  (Saint-Émilion)
"The chilly vintage has yielded tart, green gooseberry and green tea flavors, which run like a nerve through riper orange and mango notes. It's clean and elegant now.",90,Marimar Estate 2011 Don Miguel Vineyard Acero Unoaked Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Here is a ripe but well-balanced wine with aromas of cherry, spice, dark chocolate and minerals. The wine boasts a modern edge that is identified by its soft, forthcoming personality and its jammy fruit characteristics. It tastes smooth and rich and would pair with any hearty winter meal.",87,Farnese 2004  Montepulciano d'Abruzzo Colline Teramane
"A cool wine, full of citrus as well as green apple flavors. The wine is bright, crisp and refreshing in its acidity. Almonds and white fruits add to the attractive mix.",87,Nuiton-Beaunoy 2011  Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Beaune
"Heavily roasted, leathery, earthy aromas slightly override the fruit tones. This has a grabby, tannic palate and burnt, herbal, earthy black-fruit flavors. Saltiness and blackened notes are to be found on a clampy finish.",84,Vicente Gandia 2013 Dolmo  (Ribera del Duero)
"Fresh-squeezed blueberry, warm saddle leather and pitch-black chewing tobacco aromas introduce an awesome Cab Franc experience from an unirrigated vineyard planted in 1985. The cedar and even tannin flavors mesh elegantly with the blue and purple fruit.",90,Cooper-Garrod 2010 Francville Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"This blend of 50% Roussanne, 30% Grenache Blanc and 20% Clairette is soft in texture. A welcoming mix of ripe stone fruit and spicy nasturtium blossom finish clean and refreshing.",88,André Brunel 2013 Domaine de la Becassonne White (Côtes du Rhône)
"This is 100% varietal, aged in one-quarter new French oak. It's quite light, perhaps from young vines, with strawberry fruit that might be mistaken (in a black glass) for a rosé. It's tasty and fruity, but without much depth or detail.",87,Irvine Family Vineyards 2015 Pinot Meunier (Oregon)
"This is a very good Napa Cabernet, stylishly dry and smooth in tannins. It's rich in blackberries, cherries and sweet new oak, with earthier hints of dried sage and tobacco. Drink now–2016.",88,Bell 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This eco-friendly wine is demure and elegant on the nose, with medium-intense aromas of black fruit, incense, tree bark, licorice root and schist. The palate offers more oomph, with firm, gripping tannins that yield a tight structure. Slightly smoky black cherry and berry flavors help to flesh out the palate, before transitioning into the peppery, gamy finish. Drink 2018–2022.",90,Château Veronique 2012 Carignan-Grenache (Saint-Chinian)
"This opens with subdued aromas that evoke dried yellow flower and overripe citrus peel. The aromas carry over to the lean brisk palate along with suggestions of lemon, bitter yellow-apple skin and an unusual funky hint of crushed black olive.",85,Ascevi Luwa 2015 Ceròu Pinot Grigio (Collio)
"Soft white peach, chamomile, lemon rind and citrus blossoms show on the nose of this well-balanced bottling. The palate begins with a racy lemon-oil acidity, sours up a tad on apple skins and grapefruit, and then expresses a richer pear-extract component toward the finish.",89,Four Lanterns 2014 Lamplight Viognier (Paso Robles)
"Sweet red fruit aromas have a chemical artificiality to them. The palate is underdeveloped, thin and tastes medicinal. Drying and hollow on the finish.",80,Campo Marin 2006 Selección Crianza Red (Cariñena)
"A robust nose of cigarbox, cinnamon spice and minerals introduces this elegant wine from Meerlust. On the palate, it's integrated and serious, with blackberry, anise and pepper. With its firm tannins and lingering finish, the wine is a classic red with character, and is approachable.",88,Meerlust 2003 Rubicon Red (Stellenbosch)
"Roasted coffee aromas are inviting on the nose of this Cabernet Sauvignon, blessed with 25% Cabernet Franc. The marriage works on every level, providing structured tannins and a leathery afterthought around vibrant accents of blackberry and dark plum. Broad shouldered, the wine is balanced with a jolt of minerality, suggesting cellaring through 2022–2027.",94,Ramey 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"The wine is at the balancing point between fruit and wood-aging flavors. Bright fruitiness is underpinned by old wood and old gold flavors. It's an open, generous Port with the fortifying spirit in evidence while still leaving fruitiness.",88,Quinta do Vallado NV 10-Year-Old Tawny  (Port)
"With its dusty, leathery components that are wrapped in sweet tannins this tastes typical. However, it's a little austere in terms of fruit.",84,"Villa Toscano 2009 Centurion, Old Vine Zinfandel (Shenandoah Valley (CA))"
"Great execution and delivery: This lively Brut layers on stone fruit, floral and mineral tones in well-measured doses. The mouthfeel is creamy and soft, gliding over the palate in an attractive and refreshing way.",89,Bisol NV Brut Crede  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)

"Made in a Méthode Champenoise style from well-farmed vineyards, this Blanc de Blancs is sharp in acidity and biting flavors of green apple and lemon zest. Crisp and fresh, it's also complex and slightly brooding, weaving in waves of brioche and almond as it goes.",93,Foundry 2013 Sangiacomo Road Vineyard Blanc de Blancs Sparkling (Sonoma Coast)
"The aromas bring notes of herb, dark fruit and spice, seemingly a bit muddled. The palate packs a big mouthful of fruit and savory flavors that show a sense of purity, while bringing a lightly tacky feel. A lack of aromatic clarity holds it back.",88,Andrew Rich 2014 Ciel du Cheval Mourvèdre (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Rich without being heavy, this wine offers bright cherry and strawberry, followed by pretty floral components and just a tiny dose of cinnamon. Balanced and not overdone in oak, it's enjoyable and ready for the table.",87,Ca' Momi 2011 Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"Oily aromas of petrol are almost akin to certain Rieslings. This Viognier-Sauvignon Blanc mix feels round and mildly citrusy. Bready wheaty flavors of melon and papaya suggest that it's losing sizzle, so drink now.",85,Junta 2014 Reserve Momentos Viogner Sauvignon Blanc White (Central Valley)
"This luminous wine opens with scents of wisteria, jasmine and white orchard fruit. The vibrant palate doles out tart green apple, white peach and a hint of lemon drop alongside brisk acidity and a foaming mousse.",88,Valdellövo 2014 Anno Zero Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Ross Mickel (Ross Andrew Winery) made this Côtes du Rhône-style blend, a flashy riot of floral scents and earthy, funky fruit. Even with several hours breathing time it feels tight—decanting is mandatory. But give it a few years in the cellar and it will unpack even more layers of flavor. Dry and astringent in the mouth, it brings young flavors of cranberry juice and grape concentrate, plenty of acidity and minerality, and excellent depth.",92,Grand Rêve 2007 Collaboration Series II Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain)
"This is almost red in color, with spicy bell pepper aromas resulting from early harvested Cabernet Sauvignon. Its full, chunky palate shows yeasty, lightly green and peppery flavors that linger on the finish.",84,Príncipe de Viana 2016 Cabernet Sauvignon Rosado (Navarra)
"The inviting scents of melting butter on hot dinner rolls and vanilla-lemon custard ensure a rich wine, and the palate delivers with caramelized apples, dominant oak and more vanilla on the finish. It is balanced out with mustardy tartness and lemon rind acidity.",89,Blackjack 2012 Black Cap Reserve Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County)
"The great Ritchie Vineyard, a renowned site for Chardonnay, also possesses highly sought-after Sauvignon Blanc. Here, it shows as grassy in pea shoots and thick, with a voluptuous texture and body weight.",87,Carica 2015 Ritchie Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley)
"Produced from 60-year-old vines, this wine has a great balance between crisp acidity and ripe yellow and white stone fruit flavors. It is rich with a touch of toast and spice from wood fermentation and aging. The wine is still young and will be better from 2018.",90,Quinta do Casal Branco 2015 Falcoaria Fernão Pires (Tejo)
"The nose offers both minerally crispness and full-fledged black-fruit aromas. Chunky and meaty in feel, the wine has baked, loamy flavors of blackberry and plum that hold onto their vitality. A medium-long finish with hints of salted beef, leather and chocolate provides for a good ending.",90,Marchiori & Barraud 2012 Malbec (Perdriel)
"Apart from an obvious emphasis on oak-related aromas of vanilla, spice and carpentry shop, this is a satisfying Rosso that would pair with roast chicken, potatoes, garlic and rosemary. The garlic and rosemary would take the edge off those wood tones.",87,Fattoria Scopone 2008  Rosso di Montalcino
"This ripe wine from the Montagne de Reims is dominated by its 75% Pinot Noir. That gives a rich wine, full of ripe berry and citrus fruits and with a strong edge of tannin and minerality. It is young—a vintage that needs to age. Drink this firm, youthful wine from 2019.",93,Mailly Grand Cru 2011 Extra Brut Millésimé  (Champagne)
"This lively Barbera d'Asti offers great integrity of fruit with pristine aromas of cherry, blueberry, tart raspberry and a touch of spice. The wine is smooth, crisp and closes with medium persistency.",87,Massimiliano Vivalda 2006 'l Clumbé  (Barbera d'Asti)
"Deep red-cherry aromas meet with crushed slate, wet rocks, wild mint and bay leaf on the complex nose of this bottling by Richard and Thekla Sanford and winemaker Nick de Luca. It's soft on the sip, with slightly tart red plum, cranberry and raspberry, lifted by more bay leaf, thyme and dried fennel.",91,Alma Rosa 2015 Clone 667 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Tropical aromas of lychee and banana come with a varietally familiar note of bath soap. This is oily feeling, but with integrated acidity it isn't ponderous. Pithy citrus flavors are backed by a hint of bitterness, while the finish is juicy, a touch burning and tastes of nectarine and mango.",88,Nieto Senetiner 2015 Torrontés (Cafayate)
"Minty, creamy and as oaky as can be. Coconut, sawdust, carob and other barrel-based aromas steal the nose, with secondary black fruit and thick tannins composing the palate. This is a ripped, high-alcohol, almost soupy Syrah that in some people's eye may seem overdone and too woody. But the fruit is of unquestionable high quality, and if you give it time to air out you'll get the best results.",90,Montes 2005 Folly Syrah (Apalta)
"With 12.9% alcohol, this Riesling is absolutely dry and fascinatingly complex. High acidity frames citrus fruit, green apple and mineral flavors. Should develop in interesting ways over the next six years.",90,Smith-Madrone 2009 Riesling (Spring Mountain District)
"Quater is a rich red blend that opens with blackberry, rum cake, Indian spice, cola and ground clove. It combines intensity and complexity with a bold, opulent mouthfeel.",90,Firriato 2007 Quater Red (Sicilia)
"Juicy pineapple, mango and citrus notes lend a tropical feel to this penetrating, yet light bodied, Pinot Gris. Off dry in style, it's dancingly light on its feet, with a revitalizing shower of acidity that lingers through the finish.",88,Atwater 2013 White Birch Vineyards Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes)
"The nose on this Sauvignon Blanc is chunky and shows hints of corn and baked apple. The body is in good shape, as proper acidity offsets any fat in the wine. Melony flavors match the texture, and there's some notorious Baja saltiness to the finish. This is definitely a food wine.",87,Paralelo 2012 Emblema Sauvignon Blanc (Valle de Guadalupe)
"A fine wine to drink now, this has the dryness that suggests pairing it with goat cheese. It has rich flavors of gooseberries, limes and vanilla, with a little smokiness from the oak.",88,Del Dotto 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford)
"Light and mostly fresh up front, this is a wine to drink now. Regular apple and citrus flavors are simple and easy, with zero complexity. This is an average everyday white with no clear faults but not much character either.",86,Larchago 2015 Viura (Rioja)
"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir and Syrah. Aromas of green wood mixed with tire rubber, red currant, strawberry and spice. It delivers red and black-fruit flavors that linger on the finish.",86,Castle Rock 2014 Cuvée Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Possessing bold waves of pineappley fruit, this is an intensely flavored Chardonnay at a reasonable price. It's fruity and direct, with clean citrus featuring prominently from start to finish.",86,Rocland Estate 2009 Ass Kisser Chardonnay (South Australia)
"Dark and dense up front, with leathery, beefy aromas that suggest weight and size. The palate is indeed round and full, while the flavors are herbal and savory as you dig through blackberry and fig. Hefty, a little hot and a bit baked on the finish.",87,De Martino 2008 Legado Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"One of the library releases from Nikolaihof, this has become a light, elegant wine that walks a tightrope between freshness and mature smoke and toast flavors. Smooth almonds and spiced apples are beautifully ready to drink.",90,Nikolaihof 1999 Steinriesler Riesling (Wachau)
"A classically fruity Beaujolais from the south of the region, this is packed with bitter cherry and ripe raspberry flavors. The tannins are soft—plentiful enough to lend structure. It is delicious, juicy and ready to drink.",85,Domaine du Vissoux 2011 Les Griottes  (Beaujolais)
"Created to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the birth of Saint Theresa of Avila, this wine made from a special selection of fruit. Richly structured, it displays great style as well as intensity. Black fruits are beautifully integrated into the ripe body of the wine, backed by acidity and with tannins and wood-aging flavors in the background. Drink from 2018.",92,Quinta da Lapa 2014 Santa Teresa d'Avila Homenagem Red (Tejo)
"With good structure and some firm tannins, this wine will age. Plenty of plums and dark black cherries add freshness to the ripe wine. Let it age another year and drink from late 2016.",89,Château de Pizay 2014  Morgon
"This aromatic wine features melon, red apple skin and tropical notes. It drinks a hair off dry with a broad, rich feel to the fruit flavors.",88,Gård 2013 Lawrence Vineyard Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Here is a friendly, fruity, medium-bodied wine with light apple and pear aromas. Off-dry flavors are more melony and floral, and the wine has a relatively soft texture. Made from old vines and fermented in stainless steel, it offers subtle charms.",86,Dutton-Goldfield 2014 Chileno Valley Vineyards Riesling (Marin County)
"A good, rich and complex Bordeaux blend, with ripe fruit and plenty of smoky new oak, but also very tannic. The flavors are classic Napa, of blackberries, black currants, sour black cherries, tobacco and cedar. Should develop through 2012.",91,Von Strasser 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)
"One of the most exciting white wine varieties to emerge from Italy in the past five years, Pecorino delivers a sturdy, creamy mouthfeel backed by intense aromas of apricot, butterscotch, candied orange peel and fragrant yellow rose. Pair it with pasta, white meats or shellfish.",88,Cantina Tollo 2010 Pecorino (Terre di Chieti)
"This is a smooth wine with gentle tannins and red berry fruit. It has juicy acidity and a slight toastiness from oak. With spice and acidity, it will be an attractive wine to drink from 2018.",87,Nuiton-Beaunoy 2015  Beaune
"This delicious, ripe and juicy wine is full of rich yellow fruits and refreshing balancing acidity. It has a crisp, mineral side to it, with a tangy lemon zest flavor. It's an attractive wine that's just ready to drink now.",89,Vincent 2013 Cuvée Marie-Antoinette  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
"Aromas of bath soap, ham, yeast and white flowers lead to a tangy, narrow palate. Flavors of pineapple and pithy citrus fruits finish dry and slightly bitter. Drink now before this fades away.",86,Serra da Estrela 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas)

"Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec and Syrah all play a part in this wine. Pink-red in color and ripely sweet in stone fruit, it conveys intense, full-bodied layers of tannin and texture.",85,Simi 2014 Dry Rosé (Sonoma County)
"Aged 12 months in large oak casks, this bright Nebbiolo offers pretty aromas of small berry, tar, licorice and cigar smoke backed by tight intensity and structure. Pair this powerful wine with braised quail or pork tenderloin.",87,Boffa 2006 Nebbiolo (Langhe)
"This small estate is outside the main classified growth areas of Sauternes, close to the river Garonne. That makes it a wine that is accessible earlier, with plenty of honey and botrytis. It is already balancing out into a fine orange-marmalade-flavored wine with just the right acidity. Drink now.",89,Château Laribotte 2011  Sauternes
"Ripe, almost overripe notes of yellow pear signal a generouswine. Full of fruit, the palate is juicy, mellow and easy. Drink soon to make most of all these pear notes.",87,Helfrich 2015 Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Made from a majority of Cabernet Franc, complemented with a small handful of Merlot, the wine is aged in new French oak half barrels. Tannic and savory in cassis and cranberry, the wine also shows a trace of black tea and tomato leaf. The wine's oak remains extremely pronounced, which suggests some time in cellar, through 2020.",88,Jarvis 2012 Will Jarvis' Science Project Red (Napa Valley)
"Fresh nectarine, wet stone, cider apple and cut grass notes show on the nose of this bottling. The flavors are rounded, with Anjou pear, Granny Smith apple and citrus touches, upright tannins and prominent malic acids.",89,Roark Wine Co. 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Lots of dynamics play on the nose of this wine, from chamomile flowers and daffodils to chalk, pink lemonade, cotton candy and tropical fruits. The palate is framed by a tense minerality, seasoned with flavors of lemonade, browned butter and guava.",91,Talley 2013 Rincon Vineyard Chardonnay (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"Made in a style that will appeal to Cabernet Sauvignon fans, this full-bodied wine is thickly layered, packed in blueberry and plum with a slap of toasty oak on the backside. With a leathery, rounded texture, it sparks in spicy vanilla as it goes down.",88,Hanaiali'i 2014 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"A blend of equal parts Merlot and Petit Verdot, this offers aromas of underbrush, toast, baked plum, nutmeg and mocha. The smooth palate offers dried blackberries, raisins, cocoa, tobacco and ground black pepper. Velvety tannins hold the flavors together. This has reached its ideal drinking window so enjoy soon.",90,Colle Spinello 2007 Sine Terra Red (Toscana)
"Big, powerful, soft, rich and ageable. In other words, classic Etude Heirloom. Resembles the rich 2002, with massive flavors of cherries, raspberries, cocoa, anise, bacon and smoky sandalwood. Enormously complex, a wine that changes with every sip as it breathes and warms. Shows the density of Cabernet, with Pinot's silkiness. Now–2014.",95,Etude 2006 Heirloom Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Carneros)
Red plum and cherry aromas struggle to overcome notes of rubber and wet forest floor. Light weight with soft tannins and a short finish.,84,Beyerskloof 2009 Pinotage (Stellenbosch)

"Not just an intriguing wine that geeks will love to find, this bottling of Charbono is intriguing and accessible to lovers of many different styles.

91-93 Barrel sample. There is a good structure to go with the rich fruit and intense ripeness. The acidity compensates for the slight burn of alcohol.,92,Château Nenin 2009 Barrel sample  (Pomerol)
"This pretty Pinot offers ripe fruit flavors of strawberry and cherry. There's a nice dash of chocolate and a supple, seamless mouthfeel, with all the components beautifully integrated.",91,Alexana 2015 Revana Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)

In all, this wine offers an attractive combination of complexity and concentration.",89,Tenuta Friggiali 2003  Brunello di Montalcino
"Produced from organic grapes grown in the dry Côa valley, this is a pure, fruited wine with a black-plum-skin texture and firm tannins. With its layers of acidity, it is crisp at the end while remaining solidly textured. The wine needs to age further, drink from 2018.",90,Rui Roboredo Madeira 2014 Quinta do Côa Red (Douro)
"A maderized tint signals a wine in decline. Nectarine and mild citrus aromas lack edge or snap, while flavors of apple, melon and white grapefruit are showing oxidized characteristics.",83,Parra Family 2011 Parra Jiménez Verdejo (La Mancha)
"Concentrated and smoky, this wine has plenty of black cherry and black currant fruit. Its firm tannins promise that aging that will make it a richly endowed wine. Drink from 2020.",90,Château les Petits Arnauds 2015 Excellence  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"If this bottling is any indication, Picpoul may be Paso Robles' best chance at becoming better known for white wines. Tense chalk, baking soda, pomelo pith and lime skin aromas show on the fresh and compelling nose. The palate is tightly wound and nervy, showing clean, grippy kumquat and citrus rind flavors. That tension holds firm even days after opening.",93,Four Lanterns 2015 Apricity Picpoul (Paso Robles Willow Creek District)
"Boushey and Red Willow are the vineyards that contribute to this 100% varietal Cabernet Franc. There's excellent concentration to the brambly, bright, blackberry fruit, and some sharp acidity to underscore it. It's pure varietal and should continue to improve 2019–2021.",90,Barrage Cellars 2010 Outcast Cabernet Franc (Yakima Valley)
"This has aromas of overripe black cherry and spice. The palate reveals mature black fruit, raisin and pepper notes. This is very warm and shows the heat of the vintage, so drink soon.",86,Villa Monteleone 2011 Campo San Vito  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
"The nice thing about this Brunello is that it is not one of those in-your-face reds. Instead, the wine delivers measured tones of cherry, leather, coffee and spice that are integrated and balanced as a whole. In the mouth, it shows good tannic structure and point of bright acidity.",88,Cantina di Montalcino 2008  Brunello di Montalcino
"Situated between the two mountain ranges of Saint-Baume and Sainte-Victoire, this estate is dry and relatively cool in the summer. That produces this fresh, lightly pink-colored wine that has a smooth caramel flavor and rich strawberry fruits. The aftertaste is soft and ripe.",87,Ravoire et Fils 2015 Domaine Champelle Rosé (Coteaux Varois en Provence)
"Among all eight of the winery's current Rieslings, this was the least accessible upon opening. With ample breathing time it began to show more aromatics, with flavors of orange and pear in a nicely concentrated, well-balanced package. This is the one to decant!",93,Trisaetum 2014 Coast Range Estate Riesling
"A well-balanced wine that both shows an herbaceous character and a ripe, full flavor that brings in yellow fruits and green plums. It has a well-judged hint of spice from wood aging to give extra richness. Drink from 2013.",88,Château Magnol 2012 Les Charmes de Magnol  (Bordeaux Blanc)
"Fleshy plum notes rich with cinnamon set the tone on nose and lead to a big, bold and dense palate full of plum and black cherry fruit. Ripe tannins provide quite some grip but a vein of acidity keeps this fresh and counters the richness. Cinnamon and pepper linger.",92,Hillinger 2013 Blaufränkisch (Leithaberg)
"Quite dry, crisp and lean, this wine is a great palate refresher that will pair well with raw oysters or goat cheese. It has bright citrus flavors, light body and a tangy finish.",89,Dancing Crow 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County)
"Lactic and creamy smelling, with a muddled, green edge that never really settles. The palate is tannic and mildly green, with herbal olive and berry flavors. And the finish is basically more of the same. Standard base-level Carmenère.",84,Chilensis 2008 Reserva Carmenère (Maule Valley)
"Baked bread, pine forest and strawberry rise out of the glass in this relatively light yet complex and layered wine, spicy in cinnamon and black tea. It shows the powerful grace of good winemaking, showcasing the appellation's beauty and brawn from a warm, even year.",94,Williams Selyem 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Very ripe yellow pears set the scene. Richness continues on the palate, with the wine preserving a light touch without sacrificing concentration. Full marks for balance, charm and savory length.",92,Aigner 2012 Privat Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"This zesty, light-footed Riesling is a showcase of puckery lime, lemon and yellow-plum flavors off set by a delicate haze of sweetness. Just a shade off dry in style, it finishes moderately long with touches of herb and bramble on the finish. Drink now through 2018.",87,Dr. Nägler 2013 Rüdesheim Bischofsberg Kabinett Feinherb Riesling (Rheingau)
"The aromas are brooding, with notes of ash, raw meat, smoke, herb, stem, blood orange and mineral. The palate brings a sense of freshness to the generous savory flavors, showing a bit of tannic heft on the finish that should settle with additional time in the bottle.",93,Cayuse 2014 En Cerise Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR))
"Exotic and brawny, with an alluring nose of tar and licorice interlaced with violets and roses. Muscular tannins frame streamlined cherry fruit and earth tones in the mouth. Nicely persistent. Although not the most sophisticated of Barolos, Veglio offers solid value in the category. Best after 2013.",90,Veglio 2004  Barolo
"A low-intensity wine with dull apricot aromas and mild oxidization. Riesling is the base grape, but the wine is mildy Sherried and honeyed, with burnt orange as the lead flavor. Heavy orange and apricot flavors weigh down the short finish.",84,Miguel Torres 2007 Vendimia Tardía Riesling (Curicó Valley)
"Although not indicated on the label, this is 100% Mourvèdre, bone dry and barrel fermented. As a result, it's not your typical fresh and fruity rosé, showing instead dark, complex flavors of cola, chocolate tree bark and earth. Hints of strawberry lighten it somewhat, but this is almost more red than rosé. Drink now–2008.",90,Torbreck 2006 Saignée Rosé (Barossa Valley)
"This crisply fruity wine is primarily composed of the local Loureiro grape. It is light, bright, dry and full of citrus flavors. Drink now.",87,Vicente Faria Vinhos 2016 Animus Branco White (Vinho Verde)
"Plum and berry aromas are straightforward, but also clean and nice. The palate on this wine from San Rafael is focused and orderly, with flavors of red fruits, spice and mild woody notes. Long lasting on the finish, with freshness and just a modicum of tannic bite.",88,Tango Reàl 2008 Gran Reserva Malbec
"For such a large production Chard, this one gives a lot of concentrated varietal purity. It's dry and crisp, brimming with ripe pineapple, green apple, Key lime pie, pear, date and smoky vanilla flavors that finish with real sophistication and class.",88,Alexander Valley Vineyards 2006 Wetzel Family Estate Chardonnay (Alexander Valley)
"Swathes of freshly cut herbs and blossom perfume zesty grapefruit and honeydew flavors in this dry, deftly balanced wine. Bracing acidity invigorates and amplifies its crystalline demeanor, extending a long, mineral finish. It drinks well now, but should improve through 2025.",93,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt 2014 Scharzhofberger GG Trocken Riesling (Mosel)
"A rugged wine, with harsh tannins and a green, unripe taste to the cherry-berry flavors.",82,Clayhouse 2007 Adobe Red Red (Central Coast)
"From one of the rare organic vineyards of the Médoc, this is a firm wine whose tannins are a fine sheen over the ripe fruits. Balancing Cabernet and Merlot, the wine has structure and juicy blackberry flavors, laced with acidity. It's a wine to age for some years, so drink from 2018.",88,Château Meyre 2012  Haut-Médoc
"Compact right now, this Pinot has fine depth and a unique character. Offers a cherry, smoke and leather bouquet and displays dried cherry, licorice and mineral flavors along with a distinct chalk dust feel in the mouth and on the finish. Solid tannins and the fine depth of fruit indicate that two or three years cellaring are merited.",90,Adelsheim 1998 Seven Springs Vineyard Pinot Noir (Polk County)
"This is basic, full-bodied red juice, richly dense on the palate and buzzing in a current of dried herb and meaty game.",86,Angels & Cowboys 2014 Proprietary Red (Sonoma County)
"This variety is extremely rare in Washington, especially in single-vineyard wines that are dry farmed. Light aromas of white pepper, lime and herb are followed by a dry palate marked by a strong sense of acidity. It needs food to shine.",89,Savage Grace 2016 Underwood Mountain Vineyards Grüner Veltliner (Columbia Gorge (WA))
"Linear layers of lemon chiffon and clove-spiked orangewrap around light oak and focused acidity. Medium bodied and smoothly textured, it offers a kiss of caramel on the finish.",90,MacRostie 2014 Kent Ritchie Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Quite foamy when poured, this bubbly from the historic sparkling house offers aromas of apple flesh, ripe pears and lemon-lime soda. It presents straightforward flavors on the palate accented with apple blossoms, while white tuberose florals and a touch of guava trend toward the tropical side of the scale.",89,Laetitia NV Brut Cuvée Sparkling (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"Jumpy berry aromas are young, simple and raw. This feels fresh but jagged, with clean but basic pomegranate and berry flavors. An edgy palate with juicy acidity helps to maintain the wine's integrity.",86,Grandes Vinos y Viñedos 2015 Corona de Aragón Garnacha (Cariñena)
"This opens with aromas of charred topsoil, resin, leather, game, overripe black-skinned fruit and raisin. The forward palate is equally earthy—a bit rustic even—showing fig, cured meat, carob, steeped prune, fig and a note of bitter almond alongside ripe, chewy tannins.",87,Tenute Soletta 2011 Corona Majore  (Cannonau di Sardegna)
"This is the entry-level wine from this producer. Following the vintage, it is rich, juicy with white fruits as well as citrus and already refreshing. There is an attractive bite of minerality at the end. Drink now.",89,Domaine Matthias et Emile Roblin 2015 Origine  (Sancerre)
"A classic rosé blend of Grenache and Cinsault, this is soft, crisp and fruity. The smooth texture gains attractive lift from acidity and raspberry fruits. It is light and bright at the end.",88,Château Pas du Cerf 2014 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This single-vineyard Tempranillo opens with smooth, straightforward dark-fruit aromas that are calm and collected. A deeply stacked palate is a touch fierce but well structured. Toasty blackberry and cherry flavors linger on a toast-etched finish. Drink through 2032.",92,Olivier Rivière 2014 Las Viñas de Eusebio  (Rioja)
"This delicious bottle sings out with a burst of bright raspberry fruit. As with all the Winderlea designates, the exposure to new oak is fairly minimal—just 10 months in one-sixth new barrels. Juicy acidity keeps flavors buoyant, and the barrels add light notes of caramel and nougat. Drink this with great enjoyment over the next two or three years.",91,Winderlea 2014 Crawford Beck Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Full bodied, softly tannic and immediately appealing, this offering from Alain Jaume's négociant business is attractively priced. It's not the biggest or most complex Châteauneuf-du-Pape, but the ripe black-cherry and chocolate flavors and finely dusty texture are undeniably satisfying. Drink now–2018.",91,Alain Jaume et Fils 2009 Vieux Terron Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape)
"This cooperative, based in Aÿ, has benefited from the fine Pinot Noir in the village to produce a ripe red fruited wine. With balanced acidity and a soft aftertaste, it is ready to drink.",86,Collet NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne)
"Subtle hints of tart apples appear first, then there is the merest touch of quince, even a touch of lemon balm. The palate pans out aromatically, always in that apple and quince spectrum, and has a brightening crisp edge of freshness and absolute concentration and dryness. With more air, the aromatic lemon balm note adds its special perfume to this wine. This is invigorating and enlivening.",93,Boeckel 2014 Zotzenberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"It's said that Viognier is difficult to grow, but then how can bargains such as this continue to exist? For $10, you get truffled pear aromas rounded out by the addition of melon, decent concentration and a long, dusty-minerally finish. Drink now.",88,Domaine de Gournier 2008 Viognier (Vin de Pays des Cévennes)
"This wine is closed, tight and possibly still developing, with some acidity and hints of citrus flavors. There's also a cheesy character that is less attractive.",84,Régis Jouan 2014  Sancerre
"Rich and creamy poached pear, banana and coconut aromas show in a ripe but not overdone way in this blend of 46% Roussanne, 37% Marsanne and 17% Viognier. There is a strong textural grip to the palate, focusing its apple, cherimoya and lemon peel flavors.",91,Cass 2015 Rockin' One White (Paso Robles)
"This is opulent, but with restraint. The fruit is rich, black and delicious. Touches of spice and wood are present, lending complexity to the ripe fruits and balanced tannins. Impressive.",95,Château Branaire-Ducru 2005  Saint-Julien
"Tangy berry/black cherry fruit is backed with lots of acid and hints of earthy funk. It's not vegetal but it is definitely herbal, a complex and flavorful reserve that falls right between Balboa's regular Syrah and the Sayulita.",90,Balboa 2007 Reserve Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A warm, generous wine, full of ripe fruits. There is weight, richness and generosity here, although not a great depth of flavor.",86,Louis Latour 2009  Meursault
"Simple and sweet. Tastes like canned juices of pineapples, peaches and pears, with a hint of vanilla and smoke.",83,Watts 2007 Casa Azul Vineyard Dijon Chardonnay (California)
"This 90th anniversary edition boasts enticing aromas of baked plum, crushed violet, new leather, French oak and a whiff of pipe tobacco. The firm concentrated palate presents layers of dried blackberry, black cherry extract, licorice and cake spice framed in assertive fine-grained tannins. Give it a few more years to fully develop. Drink through 2018–2026.",92,Pasqua 2006 Famiglia Pasqua Riserva  (Amarone della Valpolicella)
"On the leaner side, with mineral overtones to the grapefruit and cut-grass aromas and flavors. Comes out of the bottle with some smelly reductive notes that take some aeration to eliminate, so decant before serving.",86,Mount Nelson 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Aromas of cherry cough drops and huckleberry syrup are heady and perplexing. The palate is like cough medicine, while syrupy cherry and berry flavors transition to medicinal and chocolaty. A rich, flabby finish is just more fuel for a unique but challenged fire.",86,Alta Alella 2012 Dolç Mataró Organic Sweet Red (Spain)
"Aromas of butter, vanilla, corn silk and tropical fruit lead to barrel-forward, oak-laden pineapple flavors that intertwine through the finish. For the style, it's well done but the oak is pretty intense.",90,Columbia Crest 2015 Reserve Chardonnay (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Blackberry jelly meshes with enticing aromas of hot gingerbread on the nose of this bottling by regional pioneer Gary Eberle. Dark chocolate, coffee, black cherry, loam, crushed herbs and graphite all play into the layered palate, held strongly by firm tannins.",90,Eberle 2013 Vineyard Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"As this wine shows, what marks out 2014 is the great fruitiness. This is full of rich black currants from a 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon blend. A smoky background from tannins gives shape to the fruit and acidity. It will mature quickly; drink from late 2016. An Alliance Bourg member.",86,Château Peugeais 2014 Vieilles Vignes  (Côtes de Bourg)
"Black-cherry and plum aromas on the nose open to similar flavors, with toast and mineral accents on the palate. An elegant and refined wine, with a lengthy finish that displays cassis and earth flavors, and moderate, even tannins. Not a heavy or fat wine, it shows very good balance and should be cellared for three to five years.",90,Guenoc 1997 Reserve Beckstoffer IV Vineyar Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Here's a charming wine that opens with delicate floral aromas of white flowers and stone fruits. The palate offers banana, pineapple and creamy white-peach flavors alongside freshening acidity. It finishes on a bitter almond note.",88,Santa Barbara 2012  Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi
"Zinfandel has been a Forgeron specialty for the past decade. Done in a ripe, though not too Porty style, it's more like a Dry Creek wine. Flavors of red and blue berries are annotated with a note of sweet grain, giving it a California twist, with Washington verve and acidity.",89,Forgeron 2010 Zinfandel (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Here's a foamy, frizzante rosato made with organically-farmed fruit from a little-known wine region in northern Italy. Wild berry and raspberry open the bouquet and although there is a trace of sweetness the wine could otherwise be classified as dry.",83,Tenuta Villa Tavernago 2012 Querido Rosé Frizzante Pinot Nero (Colli Piacentini)
"Very spicy, lychee-flavored wine, rich and concentrated. It is full of this perfumed character, with pepper, sweet spice and an edge of honey.",91,Joseph Cattin 2009 Hatschbourg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Aromas suggesting forest floor, ripe berry, leather, scorched earth and a hint of cured meat slowly emerge on this full-bodied red. The firm concentrated palate offers dried black cherry, grilled herb, star anise and clove while youthfully austere tannins provide an age-worthy structure. Drink 2022–2035.",93,Cavallotto 2010 Bricco Boschis Vigna San Giuseppe Riserva  (Barolo)
"Collemattoni delivers a ripe, fruit-driven Brunello that will appeal to those who enjoy plump, jammy notes in their red wine. Raspberry, strawberry and mature cherry stand out within a larger embroidery of spice and tobacco. The wine is soft and smooth with sweet berry notes on the close.",87,Collemattoni 2005  Brunello di Montalcino
"Enticing aromas recall white flower and a hint of stone fruit. The focused palate offers Bartlett pear, yellow apple and tangerine alongside subtle notes of dried aromatic herbs and crisp acidity. Fermentation in large casks lends this structure and complexity.",91,La Tunella 2012 Col de Bliss Ribolla Gialla (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"From one of Italy's most important showcase designer wineries, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot lives up to its super Tuscan celebrity. It is gently redolent of dark chocolate, ripe fruit, leather, tobacco and crushed black pepper—the bouquet's elegant moderation is one of its strongest points. The mouthfeel is rich, creamy and long. Drink after 2018.",92,Petra 2008 Petra Red (Toscana)
A Bordeaux saved from its high alcohol by its acidity. There is power and superripe fruit yet parallel to these is the black currant acidity that cuts right through. Age for 1–2 years.,85,Château Saint-Michel 2010  Bordeaux Supérieur
This boasts just the right touch of distant sweetness that makes it perfect to serve with cocktails and finger foods. It closes with fresh tones of peach nectar and lemon zest.,88,Sorelle Bronca NV Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Fleshy peach, melon and papaya aromas set up a round, pulpy, full-bodied palate housing a creamy weight. Grapefruit, lime, melon and guava flavors finish a bit herbal, with shades of tarragon.",88,Mayu 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Elqui Valley)
"This has medicinal herb and adhesive bandage aromas that carry over to the lean palate. Racy acidity and a bitter note give it a firm, brisk finish.",83,Ferruccio Sgubin 2015 Pinot Grigio (Collio)
"Rhubarb, turned earth and iron aromas power the nose on this bottling by Sabrine Rodems, who also makes Wrath wines. The iron character extends to the palate, picking up flint and gunmetal notes along with raspberry fruit and more fresh dirt flavors.",88,Scratch 2013 Kw Ranch Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Fresh purple flowers and pressed boysenberry fruit meet with hints of smoke, herbs and white pepper on the complete-package nose of this bottling. The palate offers a strong sense of pepper, purple flowers and plummy fruits, finishing with a lifting character of juniper and dried mint.",91,Barton 2014 Mr. Jones Grenache (Sta. Rita Hills)
"This Cabernet is very dry, with a high level of acidity. It lacks generosity, but it's elegant. The green edge mellows as it warms in the glass, giving way to a note of blackberry jam. Drink up.",85,Frisby 2009 Reserve OC Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"With its 10% Muscadelle, the wine has an attractive perfumed edge that lifts the citrus fruit. The wine is floral, fruity and crisply ready to drink.",85,Château Naudeau 2015  Entre-Deux-Mers
"More deeply colored than the current fashion for pale rosés, this wine also has plenty of flavor. It offers juicy red-berry fruits, orange juice, and a crisp, direct texture. It is meant to go with food.",90,Clos Venturi 2015 Rosé (Corse)
"While the nose is demure, suggesting only a hint of muted apple and pear, the sweet-tart palate on this spry wine is full of yellow-cherry flavor. Bracing acidity wraps the finish up tight and brisk.",87,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt 2013 Goldtröpfchen Spätlese Riesling (Mosel)
"Ignore the crazy price on this aged Tannat and enjoy the overall high quality of this Uruguayan bruiser. Sun-baked, minty, earthy aromas scream “warm-climate” wine, while the palate is chunky in feel, with some hardness. Flavors of rich, stewed berries, tons of oak, related spice and earth notes finish hefty but with minimal stuffing. Drink now.",88,Familia Deicas 2006 1st Cru d'Exception Tannat (Juanico)
"From a single parcel in this estate, this wine is a rich Merlot-dominated wine. It has dark tannins and plenty of juicy blackberry fruits that are deeply spiced by the wood aging. It is a full wine, ripe although with a fine streak of finishing acidity. Drink from 2019.",91,Château Tour Bayard 2014 L'Angelot  (Montagne-Saint-Émilion)
"Oily aromas of almond extract and peanut butter are earthy, a tad briny and classic in terms of offering buttery, yeasty notes of flor. This feels round, oily and deeply textured. Flavors of almond skins, sea salt and dried stone fruits finish loud and long.",92,Bodegas Hidalgo NV Manzanilla Pasada Pastrana Single Vineyard Sherry (Manzanilla-Sanlúcar de Barrameda)
"Thick, soft and heavy, this Merlot has medicinal cherry and blackberry flavors.",81,Stephen Vincent 2006 Merlot (California)
"Complex and inviting, this artfully blends tart berry fruit with streaks of clove, pepper, sandalwood and hibiscus tea. Balanced and lingering, it shows the sexy, seductive side of the grape.",90,Troon 2013 Estate Zinfandel (Applegate Valley)
"Young, thick in the mouth, and sweet in briary fruit, this Syrah could be a sleeper. It's really too jammy now, with its wealth of cherries, berries, currants, chocolate and pepper. Unless you like this kind of immediate fruity pleasure, give it a sleep in the cellar. Better after 2009.",87,Bradford Mountain 2005 Grist Vineyard Syrah (Dry Creek Valley)
"At the age of five-plus, this 100% Sauvignon Blanc is showing some mileage. It's losing freshness, with dried pineapple, apricot and peach flavors emerging, and an edge of cashews and dried herbs. Yet it remains lively and clean. If you're unfamiliar with an older Sauvignon Blanc, try it. Fully ready now.",87,Fiddlehead 2005 Hunnysuckle Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Aromas of espresso, tar, oak extract, grilled red pepper and spiced plum lead the nose. The extracted palate offers dried black cherry, anisette and graphite alongside astringent tannins and the evident warmth of alcohol.",87,Fattoria della Talosa 2010 Riserva  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano)
"Close to the Grand Cru vineyards, Mont de Milieu is one of the best known of the Premier Crus. A rounded, full wine, this balances ripe yellow fruits with toast and tighter acidity. It's a stylish wine that asserts itself with the rich fruitiness and the spicy aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",93,Domaine Pascal Bouchard 2013 Mont de Milieu Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"While 2010 was a great vintage in most of Spain, parts of Bierzo had a mildew problem and thus some wines are less than fully ripe. This seems to be a case in point; it's scratchy on the nose, with a sinewy, drawing mouthfeel that's only partly covered up by oak. Prickly berry and black cherry flavors finish tight, with scraping tannins. Drink now with meat or cheese.",88,Losada 2010 Mencía (Bierzo)
"Swathes of green herbs add a blast of freshness to ripe, rich stone-fruit and quince notes on this bone-dry, single-vineyard Riesling. It's remarkably complex, with layers of crushed-stone minerality, lime and lime-pith notes that reverberate on the finish.",90,Red Newt Cellars 2010 Sawmill Creek Vineyards Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"The aromas are brooding, with notes of orange peel, mineral, raspberry and cranberry. The palate is flavorful yet reserved with a lingering fruit-filled finish.",91,Doyenne 2013 Grand Ciel Grand Ciel Vineyard Syrah (Red Mountain)

"Bright red fruits dominate this approachable wine that offers smoky tannins along with spice and acidity. With a fresh, fruity aftertaste, the wine will develop quickly. Drink from 2018.",88,Domaine Sylvain Pataille 2014 Clos du Roy  (Marsannay)
"With firm tannins and generous blackberry jam, crispy bacon and black pepper flavors, this wine is California ripe all the way. It's pretty upfront, but has some complex mineral and floral notes. Drink through 2019.",89,MacLaren 2011 Atoosa's Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley)
"Fresh and refined, this offers aromas of tropical fruit and white spring flower. The round palate boasts juicy yellow peach, pineapple, apricot and a hint of almond.",88,Ferruccio Deiana 2014 Donnikalia  (Vermentino di Sardegna)
"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this straightforward wine offers aromas of forest floor, violet, red berry and spices. The juicy palate delivers ripe black fruit accented with notes of white pepper, cinnamon, black tea and clove alongside firm but ripe tannins. Enjoy this now through 2018.",89,Castelli del Grevepesa 2011 Castelgreve  (Chianti Classico)
"Still with its young tannins intact, the wine is firm and structured. It has spice, mint and black-currant fruits under the tight texture. It will still age so wait, if you want, for another year.",87,Château l'Espérance 2011  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux
"This wine is light cherry-red in color, showing some bricking. Strawberry, bubble gum and orange-peel aromas are followed by off-dry flavors with a broad feel.",86,Finn Hill 2014 Blondie Rosé of Sangiovese (Red Mountain)
"Smooth, rich and dense with a touch of sweetness, packed with intense flavors of sweet potatoes, pepper and honey. The texture is thick, creamy, weighty and concentrated. One of the library releases of selected wines, produced by Knoll in the best years.",92,Emmerich Knoll 2006 Vinotekfüllung Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"Made with Negroamaro and Malvasia Nera, this concentrated wine conveys aromas of perfumed berry and cake spice. The ripe, round palate offers crushed raspberry, wild cherry, clove and licorice alongside firm, velvety tannins.",88,Cantine Paolo Leo 2009 Riserva Red (Salice Salentino)
"A tasty, lighter style of Pinot Noir, it offers fresh cherry and raspberry aromas, juicy fruit flavors and a delicate texture. There's enough complexity to keep you coming back for another sip.",87,Castle Rock 2012 Pinot Noir (Mendocino)
"This perfumed wine is firm with tannins that gives a spicy character. It has a dry core, a juicy aftertaste and rich blackberry fruit that will certainly develop as it matures. Give it some time and drink from 2021.",89,Château Labrousse 2015  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux
"Leafy underbrush, sunbaked earth and a toasted note lead the way. The lean one-dimensional palate is a bit shy on freshness, offering dried sour cherry, raisin and a hint of dark spice alongside dusty, not very persistent tannins. Drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit.",86,Castellani 2010 Brunaio  (Brunello di Montalcino)
Good cherry and cranberry flavors lend a lot of fruitiness to this medium-bodied moderately proportioned wine. It has a touch of tannin in the texture and good balance overall.,87,Auburn 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Made from 85% Grenache and 15% Syrah, both from Kick Ranch Vineyard, this salmon-colored quaffer was fermented in concrete, and is hard to describe aromatically, taking its time to open. Dry, it tastes of watermelon and a hint of clove-like spice, remaining fresh on the palate and lightweight.",90,Kale 2014 Rosé (Sonoma County)
"Since we last reviewed a vintage of Romaneira, with the 2005 wine, the estate has moved closer to realizing its potential. This is an impressive, powerful yet elegant wine. Its dark fruits are sustained by wood and leavened by acidity. It has a great sense of style and considerable aging potential.",94,Quinta da Romaneira 2008 Tinto Red (Douro)
"High-toned aromas of beeswax and ginger carry onto the medium-full, lissome palate, which picks up notes of glazed pear and flower.",86,Cooper Vineyards 2012 Chardonnay (Virginia)
"There's an earthy, rustic quality to this soft red Bordeaux blend that veers into overripe, syrupy qualities on the palate, giving it a heaviness that seems to defy its cooler appellation.",85,Blue Oak 2012 Estate Blend Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville)
"A soft, juicy wine, slightly sweet in raspberries and cherries, but the finish is nicely dry. It's mellow in acids and tannins, so perfect for drinking now. Try with a great beef taco.",85,Vinum 2010 Red Dirt Red G-S-M (Paso Robles)
"Blended with 5% Sémillon, this crisp, tropical white is generous with bright acidity and a strong taste of pineapple and lemon. Zippy minerality adds a stoniness to the texture and flavor, as a fresh-cut grass note lingers in the background.",88,Merryvale 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"This is an over-the-top vintage for this wine; it's simply crammed full with floral and fresh fruit flavors. Grapefruit, peach and melon notes are in abundance, all juicy, ripe and resonant. It would be hard to imagine a better or more versatile non-Chardonnay white at this price.",92,Abacela 2016 Albariño (Umpqua Valley)
"A new wine for this winery, this comes from declassified barrels from its other programs. This blend of Merlot (36%), Syrah (26%), Cabernet Sauvignon (23%) and Petit Verdot delivers a whole lot of immediate appeal with its notes of smoke, char, black currant, huckleberry and plum. The flavors are full and lush with a creamy, supple feel and soft tannins.",91,Betz Family 2012 Cuvée Frangin Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Opening with a rich, luxurious nose, this wine is delightfully bright on the palate before evolving into brooding notes of black cherry and smoky oak. Hints of dark chocolate and coconut shavings round out the intrigue and complexity. The wine is ready to enjoy now, but worth cellaring through 2020.",93,Stone The Crows 2012 Three Twins Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Simple and earthy, with coffee and spiced plum flavors. Curiously lean and one-dimensional for such a great vintage. The tannins are soft and melted and acids are also easy.",85,Imagery 1999 Ash Creek Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"At nearly 10 years of age, this beautiful Gewürz shows how well a good California dessert wine can age. It's still brisk in clean acidity, but is honeyed and sweet, with nearly 19% residual sugar. Shows rich, exotic pineapple, tangerine marmalade, gingerbread, apricot jam, buttered toast, crème brûlée, vanilla cream and spice flavors, leading to a long, deliriously delicious finish. A heady, flamboyantly sweet wine to drink now.",95,Nicolaysen Family Vineyards 2001 Late Harvest Alisos Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Santa Barbara County)
"The blend of 55% Grenache, 25% Syrah, 16% Mourvèdre and 4% Cinsaut offers subtle mulberry fruit on the nose, a spicy peppercorn kick and plenty of gamy meats. That funky meat quality, from raw to jerkied, is prominent and pure on the sip, surrounded by exotic plums and Middle Eastern spices.",93,Bonny Doon 2013 Le Cigare Volant Red (Central Coast)
The wine is soft and lightly textured. It has fruit with ripe apricot and white peach flavors that are lifted by the bright citrus aftertaste. The wine is ready to drink.,86,Herdade do Rocim 2014 White (Alentejano)
"There's a potpourri of wildly distinct and amazing aromas on this 60% Syrah-40% Cabernet Sauvignon, from cooked ripe cranberries and distinct black pepper to red clay, anise, violet and savory goulash with dried strawberries. Raspberry, pepper and cola overtake the palate, with a refreshing tartness on the finish.",92,Left Bend 2011 Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Made with 60% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot, this offers aromas of underbrush and prune. The dense palate delivers dried black cherry, espresso and a hint of licorice alongside chewy tannins. Drink through 2018.",88,Ambrogio e Giovanni Folonari 2015 Campo al Mare  (Bolgheri)
"Toasty and tart, this lively wine is built upon wild-picked berry flavors. There is a streak of iron or metal running through the center of the palate; a flavor that some tasters will enjoy more than others.",88,Vista Hills 2009 Rollins Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This bold, ripe wine is full of tannins as well as great fruit. Juicy with black currant flavors, smoky from wood aging and rich with tannins, it's finely structured and ready to mature gently. Drink from 2021.",91,Château la Croix Saint-Pierre 2015 Grande Réserve  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"Toast, espresso, oak and grilled sage aromas lead the way while the firm palate delivers ripe raspberry, fleshy cherry, powdered sage and star anise. Astringent tannins provide support but also dry out the finish.",88,Enzo Boglietti 2012 Case Nere  (Barolo)
"On the basis that anything goes with rosé, this wine is 100-percent Sangiovese, known locally as Niellucciu. The acidity that is typical of the grape is very present as are red cherry and tight fruit flavors. It is so crisp and lively, bouncing from the glass and leaving a beautiful array of red fruits at the end.",90,Domaine Terre de Mistral 2015 Pauline Rosé (Mediterranée)
"Lime and citrus peel aromas are light and innocuous. Juicy on the palate but light in weight, this tropical-leaning white delivers zesty tangerine and orange flavors in front of a citrusy finish.",85,Bodega Norton 2013 Colección Varietales Torrontés (Mendoza)
"Integrated and low in oak, this bright, clean and refreshing white doesn't skimp on body or texture. Lemon and lime rind play off toasted almond and apple crisp for a satisfying seesaw of savory and succulent.",91,Fritz 2013 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"A subdued nose has the gentle lift of lemon oil and fresh lemon zest. The palate confirms all of this rich freshness, which streams with great direction across the palate. This is taut and concentrated, with a poised freshness and structure that holds very rich lemon and tangy citrus at its core. There is so much drive and direction. The lovely long finish is reminiscent of Seville orange and pink grapefruit.",95,Malat 2015 Silberbichl Reserve Riesling (Kremstal)
"Attractive aromas of fresh berry fruits are vital and announce a plump but punchy palate with toasty, blackened flavors of wild berries and lactic oak. A toasty finish stops just short of bitterness, while pouring on the power. Drink through 2022.",91,Cadus 2013 Single Vineyard Valle de Uco Malbec (Uco Valley)
This is a fruity Merlot with a strong lemony streak. There are hints of pepper as well. Drink soon.,85,Tildio 2009 Merlot (Wahluke Slope)
Classic Semillon aromas of hay and quince create an intriguing but subtle opening act while the simpler palate displays some attractive cut-grass notes from the Sauvignon Blanc. A good partner for flavorful shellfish preparations.,86,Cape Mentelle 2007 Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Margaret River)
"Using dry-farmed grapes, Ryan Pease crafts a heavily structured wine with aromas of black gravel, mocha and blueberries reduced in a vanilla vinaigrette. The sticky tannins will need some time to unravel, but the flavors of cooked cherries, blackberries and coffee paste are promising. Drink 2018–2024.",91,Paix Sur Terre 2013 Comes a Time Alta Colina Vineyard Mourvèdre (Adelaida District)
"Coming in one of the more beautifully shaped bottles on the market, which enhances the pretty light-pink color, this wine shows light, brisk raspberry fruit and a rain-on-cement minerality. The flavors are expectedly light, with just a touch of strawberry fruit, slight lime bitterness and a tongue-exciting texture.",89,McIntyre Vineyards 2014 Estate Rose of Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Ripe, fruity and full of spice, this is a fresh wine. With its light color, it is a perfect summer quaff, crisp with red currants and with a light, fragrant aftertaste.",86,Winenot 2014 Les Jolies Filles Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Tight citrus aromas meet with bubblegum and wet stone on the somewhat reserved though clean and inviting nose of this wine. The flavors are also quite light, with strawberry and lemon touches, so the point is more of the racy acidity and slight tannic grip.",86,Vinum 2016 Rosé (Paso Robles)
"This well-balanced, flavorful and medium-bodied wine will pair nicely with many different meat, poultry and pasta dishes without distracting from the food. It smells lightly spicy, tastes like raspberries and red cherries and has light tannins that add some needed grip.",87,Shooting Star 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lake County)
"Rubbery dark-berry aromas yield to earth, leather and chocolate scents upon airing. This feels healthy and standard, with full-force flavors of medicinal berry. It's tight, fresh and slightly resiny on the finish, despite having spent only three months in oak. A blend of 80% Garnacha and 20% Carignan.",87,El Raval 2010 Grenache-Carignan (Montsant)
"Grapy blackberry and cassis aromas come with charred oak and pastry-like richness. In the mouth, this notoriously ripe Mencía is loaded with tannins. Spicy blackberry flavors can handle the classy oak this wine has seen, while flavors of tobacco, lemon and spice drape over a full-fruited finish. Drink through the 2020s.",93,Dominio de Tares 2012 Bembibre Mencía (Bierzo)
"Regarded almost as a Grand Cru in its own right, the Moutonne vineyard, wholly owned by Albert Bichot, is in a corner of the Vaudésir Grand Cru vineyard. In this sumptuous year, the wine is more generous, ripe yellow fruits than mineral texture. The acidity and the tangy aftertaste are a reminder that this is from cool-climate Chablis. Drink from 2023.",95,Albert Bichot 2015 Domaine Long-Depaquit Moutonne  (Chablis)
"This wine has good spiciness, ripe fruits and firm tannins. There is a good balance between acidity from red berry fruits and a dense, tannic character. It is solid and concentrated, and needing to age longer. Drink from 2015.",89,Caves de Rauzan 2011 Château Villotte  (Bordeaux Supérieur)
"A lovely touch of flint and smoke carry a touch of residual reduction. Underneath that is lemony purity. The palate adds a touch of stone fruit, a touch of ripe mirabelle plum—its generosity only underlined by the taut lemon freshness that pervades the wine. There is something stern and stony at the core, something fundamental and profound. The body is precise, dry and powerful and incredibly moreish. This is lip smacking but has not even started to show itself properly. The finish is clean, stony and lasting. This is one to keep. Drink 2020–2040.",95,Biecher & Schaal 2015 Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"With its head-turning aromas of honey, truffles and ripe peaches, this is a knockout offfering from Tardieu Laurent. In the mouth, it's broad yet focused, with layers of rich, nuanced flavors that coat the palate before ending in a long, mineral-inflected finish. Drink now-2020, and possibly beyond that.",94,Tardieu-Laurent 2007 White (Hermitage)
"Pear and anise introduce this robust, voluptuous wine that's brimming in high-toned acidity. It becomes more lengthy and complex as it develops in the glass. Touches of baked pineapple provide a tropical edge amid wintertime nutmeg and spiced lemon. This is a beautiful, full-bodied wine that's lush and memorable.",94,The Vineyard House 2014 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"One-quarter of the wine is aged in wood that leaves the merest touch of toast on the palate. The wine is ripe, hinting at yellow fruits along with an abundance of acidity. The end is crisp and tight, and the wine needs further aging. Drink from 2016.",88,Domaine Laroche 2014 Réserve  (Bourgogne)
"From a historic vineyard in a region that rarely grows this grape, this wine features a nose with tangy red-fruit punch, concentrated pomegranate, crushed violets and a slightly sour shred of menthol. The palate shows lots of eucalyptus and dried mint along with cranberry fruit.",89,Adelaida 2013 HMR Vineyard Pinot Noir (Adelaida District)
"This straightforward Barolo offers aromas of pressed rose petal, red berry, truffle and a whiff of leather. The round palate displays Morello cherry, menthol, chopped mint, ground pepper and anise accompanied by smooth, polished tannins.",89,Moscone 2010  Barolo
"Complex and generous on the palate, this vineyard-designated varietal is surprisingly light and bright in spirit, ethereal even, offering aromas of black pepper, violets and gunpowder, hard to figure out but inviting nonetheless. On the palate, juicy plum and dark cherry provide an exuberant edge.",92,Carlisle 2013 Rossi Ranch Grenache (Sonoma Valley)
"This richer, rounder version of dry rosé is pale salmon in color, smells lightly fruity and has a savory white-pepper touch in the flavor. The texture is more mouthcoating and smooth than many.",88,Page Mill Winery 2014 Angela's Cuvee Rosé (California)
"Intensely ripe wine, with melon and pear flavors, spiced with just the right amount of wood and structured fruit skin tannins. So classy, this is a beautiful wine, boasting the richness of 2009 while still keeping a sense of nervy texture.",94,Louis Latour 2009 Les Demoiselles  (Chevalier-Montrachet)
"Rich and fruity, this wine is balanced, with tannins and red fruits in harmony. It has weight and richness without being overpowerful. Ready to drink in six months.",87,Château Montlau 2010  Bordeaux Supérieur
"This unusual blend, all co-fermented, includes roughly equal proportions of Vermentino, Viognier and Marsanne, with a splash of Roussanne. It's perfumed with the intensity of Gewürztraminer, a mix of baby powder and candied citrus, and those flavors carry through the palate. Though listed as just 12.5% abv, it tastes and feels much riper, showing some heat in the aftertaste.",87,Troon 2014 Longue Carabine White (Applegate Valley)
"Starts off slowly, with slightly odd, machine-oil aromas, then turns into a rather angular, high-acid Riesling for a 2009, with pear and citrus flavors that finish crisp.",86,Franz Karl Schmitt 2009 Niersteiner Ölberg Spätlese Trocken Riesling (Rheinhessen)
"For Cab Franc, this is super ripe, with floral, perfumed, earthy aromas of cassis and wild berries blended with pastry and vanilla. In the mouth, it's big but balanced, with loamy, slightly salty flavors of baked black fruits. A lasting ripe-fruit character carries onto the finish.",91,El Enemigo 2010 Gran Enemigo Agrelo Single Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Mendoza)
"This blend of 59% Syrah and 41% Cabernet Sauvignon plays to the savory side of the two grapes, with dominant dried oregano and thyme aromas edged with violet, blackberry and caramel scents. The palate provides great cohesion of those elements, its plush plum fruit laced with dried herb flavors, proving easy to enjoy and relatively light on its feet.",89,Epiphany 2014 Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Barbara County)
"An inky-deep color with a dark red rim hints at the concentration. Enticing aromas from the spice rack, milk chocolate and vanilla lead to meltingly rich fruit and cocoa flavors that are deep and focused. At first sip it's almost sweet with ripe black cherry and black currant notes, but the vivid acidity and layer of fine tannins keep it dry and balanced. It will be best after 2020.",93,Hourglass 2012 Blueline Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Aromas include underbrush, truffle, graphite and raw red cherry. These carry over to the palate along with strawberry, white pepper and mineral. It's elegant, with vigorous tannins and brisk acidity but it lacks fruit richness and body.",87,Gemma 2010 Colarej  (Barolo)
"Vivid with acidity yet deep and rich in body, this dry, voluptuous wine brings out the best of a difficult vintage for Germany. It's fresh on the palate with bright apple and pear flavors, touched with nuances of bramble, spice, pollen and caramel that add complexity to the long finish.",93,Robert Weil 2013 Kiedrich Gräfenberg Trocken GG Riesling (Rheingau)
"Sourced from parcels of vines planted in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, this a fine, concentrated wine. It has rich structure, great maturity and complexity. Lime acidity mingles with rich white-fruit flavors, balancingdelicacy with intensity. Drink from 2016.",93,Pascal Bouchard 2011 Fourchaume Premier Cru Vieilles Vignes  (Chablis)
"Held back for four-plus years before release, this Bordeaux blend has become softly gentle and approachable. It's rich in cherry, raspberry and cassis flavors, with a gorgeous, plump coating of sweet, toasted oak. Drink over the next five years.",92,Summers 2006 Checkmate Red (Napa Valley)
"Stalky and foul on the nose, this Chardonnay doesn't smell inviting. Oily and heavy on the palate, this tastes of resiny oak, related cream and bland white fruits.",82,Vega Sindoa 2014 Chardonnay (Navarra)
"Fleshy in cantaloupe and pear, this subtle, low-impact white has a touch of acidity that keeps it fresh and refreshing. While the backbone is light bodied, it finishes clean and lean.",86,Franciscan 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Aromas of blue fruit, green herb, funk and savory notes lead to sweet, luscious blue-fruit and smoked-meat flavors that linger effortlessly on the finish. The sense of balance and length are rare for a wine at this price.",90,Saviah 2015 The Jack Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This wine plays to the variety's savory side, with aromas of smoke, raw meat and generous amounts of black pepper. It's full bodied, with mesquite and spice flavors that linger.",90,Darby 2011 Mourvèdre (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Pungent clove and cinnamon appear upon entry to this medium-bodied wine, which also offers smooth, rounded tannins and subtle oak. Plum, raspberry and tobacco all make an appearance, finished off by a healthy dose of black pepper.",88,Robert Mondavi 2012 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"This is a fragrant and generous Chardonnay from Piedmont that shows bright tones of melon, exotic fruit and pineapple. The wine is rich and smooth in the mouth and grips the palate in a very satisfactory manner.",88,Tenuta Olim Bauda 2008 I Boschi Chardonnay (Piedmont)
"This pleasant, medium-bodied wine stays 11 months in French oak (30% new), so there's plenty of barrel influence. The cherry and herb notes manage to stand up to the wood treatment, which adds a layer of mocha flavor and a touch of bitterness. Drink now–2017.",86,Grove Mill 2013 Pinot Noir (Wairau Valley)
"Fairly round in the mouth, this has blackberry, vanilla and butter notes. It's rugged and simple, but tasty.",84,Real del Pedro 2010 Malbec (Mendoza)
A whiff of cellar floor and powdered sage lead the nose. The simple diluted palate offers dried black cherry and an earthy note alongside fleeting tannins.,84,Barba 2015 Vasari  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo)
"Barrel-fermented Pinot Gris is a bit of a rarity, but this one is good if you like the style. Buttered apples and nuts lead the way, backed by tangerine fruit and outlined by oaky spice. Tough to know whether aging it will result in slightly better integration, or if you're better off drinking this one young.",86,Escarpment 2006 Pinot Gris (Martinborough)
"This is a big, rich rosé, and a very delicious one. With fairly high alcohol, it's full-bodied, with complex flavors of orange peel, peach, watermelon, vanilla and spices. Perfect with paella or anything with ham.",88,MCV 2012 Pink Rosé (Paso Robles)
"A blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sämling, this gold straw colored wine is about freshness and acidity as much as about sweetness. That gives this ageworthy wine a great delicacy and poise, balanced and fresh, the honey botrytis texture attractively layered through this delicious wine.",92,Nittnaus Hans und Christine 2009 Trockenbeerenauslese Essenz White (Burgenland)
"A wine that emphasizes the fruity character of the year, putting aside any missing tannins. Wood still dominates the fruit, giving spice and bitter chocolate flavors, but the green edge present in the futures tasting has gone, to give final cranberry and black currant freshness.",89,Château Monbrison 2007  Margaux
This is a wine to drink from a carafe in an inexpensive bistro with just about anything that makes you happy. The cherry-berry flavors will wash down everything from steak to fries.,84,Hey Mambo 2008 Sultry Red Bistro Style Red (California)
"This is a plump, medium-bodied rosé, one that ably marries strawberry fruit with hints of cracked pepper and cinnamon. Drink now.",88,Louis Bernard 2015 Rosé (Côtes du Rhône)
"This is a big, sweetly oaked wine notable for its ripe flavors and sheer opulence. It's distinctly Californian in the massive, rather jammy blackberries, cherries and raspberries, and shows good balance in the richness of tannins and savory acidity. Delicious as it is, it's all primary fruit now. Give it 2–3 years to mellow.",92,Modus Operandi 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This opens with tobacco, dark spice, forest floor and leather aromas. The palate offers dried black cherry, licorice and clove flavors, set against tightly wound, taut tannins. It still needs a few years to come together. Drink 2019–2025.",90,Tenuta di Sesta 2012  Brunello di Montalcino
This tartly acid-driven effort from Mumm includes Chardonnay and Pinot Gris. Honeyed aromas lead into a luxurious palate of thick mousse and crisp green apple flavors.,90,Mumm Napa 2010 Blanc de Blancs Oak Barrel Aged Sparkling (Napa Valley)
"Bill Price's ongoing partnership with winemaker Gavin Chanin continues full steam with this deceptively light, mineral-laden wine that nonetheless exudes the power of Durell. Aromas of buttery oak and toasted marshmallow play tricks on the nose before a salty, tropical, medium-bodied, waxy and exotic palate confounds. Subtle acidity belies firm structure. Drink now through 2021.",91,Lutum 2013 Durell Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"A wine that is fruity and aromatic, this is made to drink now. It has a crisp texture, like biting into a green apple, and acidity that shoots through the fruity palate. Screwcap.",85,Dopff Au Moulin 2012 Riesling (Alsace)
"This blend is comprised of Merlot (70%) and dabbles of Mourvèdre, Petit Verdot and Shiraz, sourced mainly from the Clements Hills region of Lodi. The wine is marked by a strong streak of green bell pepper and herbal scents, and is a tad dull on the palate.",82,Oenophile Wines 2011 Oe-lixir Red Mélange Red (California)
"Layered aromas of dried rose petals and violets meet with peppery strawberry and plum fruit, proving relatively light with crushed-rock minerality on the nose. The palate is also light but juicy with strawberry, soft cherry and red currant, spiced by black pepper. The tannic structure builds throughout the sip.",89,Stephen Ross 2014 Dante Dusi VIneyard Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"You'll find aromas suggesting underbrush, wild berry, tobacco and a whiff of aromatic herb on this. The palate isn't quite as expressive as the nose and is still tightly wound, offering red cherry, cranberry and white pepper alongside a backbone of tense tannins and bright acidity. Give it time to unfold. Drink 2025–2035.",92,Camparo 2013 Boiolo  (Barolo)
"Meaty and very oaky, with resin, mocha and milky aromas that amount to a wood cutter's dream. Not surprisingly, the mouthfeel is more shocking and acidic than the oaky bouquet suggests; flavors are racy and tart, and then a bitter lactic quality comes on strong. Too much going on, with nothing pulling in the same direction.",83,Gladium 2005 Crianza Tempranillo (La Mancha)
"With smoky tannins and tangy acidity, this wine is solid, dense and full of toasty wood. Over this structure, black currant notes are fragrant and attractive. Drink from 2018.",90,Château le Thil 2012  Pessac-Léognan
"This simple Chardonnay is tropical fruit driven, with a floral aroma and a twang of resiny oak. The palate seems slightly disjointed in feel, briny in flavor and citric on the finish.",84,Santa Alicia 2014 Reserva Espiritu de Los Andes Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Maipo Valley)
"The complex blend of Bordeaux grapes does not quite jell into a wine with specific focus. It's dark and tastes of black cherry, with grainy tannins and a chalky finish. The acids are not well integrated and the wine seems disjointed in the finish.",85,Matthews Estate 2006 Claret (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This Chardonnay, Sémillon, Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier blend is a good, all-purpose white wine but lacks focus.",85,Maryhill 2006 Winemaker's White White (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Sommeliers will appreciate this Chardonnay for its dryness and elegance, not to mention the price. It favors restraint over flamboyance, yet offers plenty of rich tropical and citrus fruits, with hints of honey and minerals. The alcohol is refreshingly balanced.",90,Bump 2011 Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley)
"The nose on this Muscat is flat and smells like applesauce and peach syrup. Surprisingly, the palate is bright in feel, with ample acids and flavors of tangy peach, apricot and honey.",84,Viña el Aromo 2010 Artemisa Late Harvest Muscat d'Alexandrie (Itata Valley)
"Tre blends Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah from three vineyards in three different AVAs. Tasted just after being released, it showed good balance and flavors of cherries and spice, with some herbal threads running through the tannins.",90,JM Cellars 2011 Tre Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This blend of grapes from four vineyards—48% Alamo Creek, 18% Bien Nacido, 18% Spanish Springs and 16% Ventana—offers dense berries and smoke on the nose as well as black pepper and tar. The tar shows strongly on the palate, as do blackberry blossoms and denser black pepper spice.",92,Bonny Doon 2012 Le Posseur Syrah (Central Coast)
"A heavy oak character controls the nose, and with it comes aromas of sawdust, vanilla, cocoa and raspberry. This feels a bit sticky and creamy, while palpable oak returns on the palate and creates vanilla, pepper and chocolate flavors. Heat, high acidity and peppery spice work the finish on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère and Syrah.",87,Santa Luz 2013 Gran Corte Red (Colchagua Valley)
"Firm strikes of lime, lemon and crushed mineral contrast buoyant peach and even guava notes in this bright, fruity Riesling. Dry in style, it finishes refreshingly crisp with just a hint of lingering bramble.",89,Fjord 2014 Dry Riesling (Seneca Lake)
"This svelte wine is smooth and supple, its strawberry and cherry fruit laced with a vein of milk chocolate. Ready for near-term drinking, but balanced and fresh enough to cellar for a few years, it finishes with a lick of citrus.",90,Cottonwood Winery of Oregon 2012 Brigette Catherine Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"A ripe, fleshy wine, full of cherry notes and spice. It is rich, full in the mouth while keeping a light fruitiness that allows it to develop fast. Overpowering banana flavors at the end spoil the overall effect.",84,Louis Jadot 2013  Beaujolais-Villages
"This is a rich wine, full of structure, tannins and bold red fruits. It is dense, solid and dark, filling the mouth with swathes of ripe fruits. It delivers a juicy, fresh aftertaste. Drink now.",88,Lucien Lardy 2014  Beaujolais-Villages
"Aromas of wisteria and green apple lead the way on this straightforward white. The tangy palate tastes of juicy pear, citrus and a hint of white almond while zesty acidity and a mineral note give the finish a slight lift.",87,Peter Zemmer 2014 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige)
"This delicious, accessible, easy-sipping wine has everything in moderation, from gently fruity aromas, to light but complex flavors of plum, black tea and spices, to medium body and a supple mouthfeel. It will taste good on practically any occasion.",91,FEL 2015 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"This is an attractively balanced blend of 60% Sauvignon Blanc and 40% Sémillon. It is still at its youthful, green-herb stage although signs indicate that the wine will round out and fill. The aftertaste hints at crisp apples and Rocha pears.",86,Exem 2014  Bordeaux Blanc
"This is the first Dineen designate from :Nota Bene, and it's worth chasing down. Focused dark purple and black fruits line up—cherry, plum and cassis—with a rich layer of espresso and a lick of graphite following. The 22 months in barrel brings an interesting hint of caramel to a nicely balanced finish.",91,:Nota Bene 2010 Dineen Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley)
"The first vintage to see Aglianico (8%) blended in, this wine brings aromas and flavors of leather, sour cherry, earth and flowers. Seeing only neutral puncheons and oval botti, it's fresh and focused, coating the palate with textured fruit flavors brightened by tart acids and backed by firm tannins. It's both appealing and serious.",93,Leonetti Cellar 2012 Sangiovese (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Nice and crisp in acidity, with a brisk, clean mouthfeel, this houses citrus and tropical fruit flavors. It seems a little sweet, so don't expect anything too dry.",85,Provenance Vineyards 2011 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford)
"The smoky, spicy aromas and richly oaked flavors of this medium-bodied wine are tempting and delicious. While the wine's personality comes mostly from new oak nuances, good fruit flavors lie underneath.",88,Replica 2014 Pickpocket Red (California)
"Herbaceous aromas of mint and catnip are heavy on the nose, which also gives off a note of licorice gumdrop. This Malbec is tight and raw in feel, while herbal, spicy plum and currant flavors finish somewhat green.",84,Luis Segundo Correas 2013 Valle Las Acequias Malbec (Mendoza)
"Rose gold in color, this rosé smells fresh and inviting, with pleasant underripe strawberry, mango and citrus zest scents. The palate is similarly light-footed, yet ripe tropical fruit tones lend some substance and richness.",85,Domaine la Colombette 2016 Notorious Pink Rosé (Vin de France)
"This is dainty and pretty, with solid floral aromas of peony and orange blossom that lift the pear and hard peach fruit backbone. Vibrant acidity keeps the palate fresh and the finish clean and mouthwatering. Drink now.",87,MAN Vintners 2011 Chenin Blanc (Coastal Region)
"Pollen and dusty minerals lend an earthy savoriness to lemon, saffron and honeysuckle in this off-dry Riesling. The palate is bright and brisk, finishing on a delicately honeyed note. Drink now through 2019.",87,Bellangelo 2014 Tuller Vineyard Riesling (Seneca Lake)
"Orange peel and citrus zest slowly give way to mature peach and apricot. This sparkling Prosecco definitely seems on the ripe side with a slightly golden element to its appearance and big peach intensity in the mouth. But it does exhibit an elegant, sophisticated style with interesting levels of complexity.",87,Oriel NV 365 Prosecco  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
"Spicy and juicy, this majority Cabernet also contains Merlot, Petit Verdot and Ruby Cabernet, plus a microscopic amount of mixed reds. Aged in American oak, it has soft tannins and flavors of mocha and blackberry, suiting it for many occasions.",87,Sebastiani 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"One of the more reliable, affordably priced Rhône blends in the state, this mix of 43% Grenache, 34% Syrah, 15% Mourvèdre and 8% Counoise offers slightly shy aromas of black and red licorice, red currant and cinnamon candy, tucked behind a layer of slate. The palate is more simplistic, with purple fruits most prevalent.",87,Beckmen 2012 Cuvee Le Bac Red (Santa Ynez Valley)
"This creamy white is soft and smooth, with just the right kick of acidity at the end. Delicious and perfumed, it's ready to drink now.",87,Jean Perrier et Fils 2016 Altesse Cuvée Gastronomie Altesse (Savoie)
"This is a sweet, oaky, simple Chardonnay. It's forward in ripe pineapple, orange and melon fruit flavors, with a honeyed finish.",84,Newton 2010 Red Label Chardonnay (Napa County)
"The winery names Ribbon Springs its “most important source” of Pinot Noir grapes. The Ribbon Ridge AVA, a small subset of the northern Willamette Valley, is distinguishing itself for refined, focused Pinots such as this. Raspberries and rocks collide in midpalate, with a lick of milk chocolate as it fades into a gentle finish. The alcohol is listed at 13.2%.",89,Adelsheim 2008 Ribbon Springs Vineyard Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge)
"The wine shows the firm tannins of the vintage. They give a dry core that will probably remain. However, there is also a fine layer of fresh black-currant fruit that gives a fine lift to the wine at the end. It will be ready soon, drink from 2017.",89,Château de Lescours 2011  Saint-Émilion
"Focused crisp aromas of white fruits reflect a cool vintage. This is roughly one-quarter each Macabeo, Parellada, Xarello and Chardonnay, and it feels tight, fresh and focused. Dry stone-fruit flavors include a hint of lime, while this is clean on the finish.",90,Albet I Noya 2013 Brut Natural Reserva Sparkling (Penedès)
"A 100% varietal wine, this offers a depth of earthy mushroom and forest, especially on the nose, before expansive waves of juicy raspberry and blackberry take over on the palate. Enjoyable now, it reveals a touch of dried herb and violet as it progresses in the glass.",90,Cornerstone 2012 Black Label Stepping Stone Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley)
"There's a slight cobbler-like character to the nose of this wine, with mealy scents of peach bubble gum, banana and strawberry. The palate is more linear, with a pronounced line of acidity and flavors of green banana and orange citrus.",86,Domaine de Jarras 2013 Pink Flamingo Tête de Cuvée Gris de Gris Rosé (Sable de Camargue)
"A bit on the soft, easy side, with sweet, pie-filling flavors of cherries, red currants, licorice, vanilla and cinnamon spice. Ready now, with baked ham or fruit-glazed grilled pork or veal.",87,Testarossa 2006 Subasio Syrah (Central Coast)
"Vigna Broglio is a ripe, jammy Barolo with bold notes of mature cherry and blackberry preserves. It tastes more like a Tuscan wine than one from the Langhe and offers syrupy fruit flavors that indicate a hot vintage or a low altitude vineyard. It's soft in the mouth, however, and offers very smooth tannins. Drink 2012–2015.",88,Palladino 2005 Vigna Broglio  (Barolo)
"The nose of this New Orleans-inspired blend is juicy and fruit forward, with blackberry jam, black plum and a light licorice scents. It's soft and full on the palate, with Concord grape flavors and nicely polished tannins. A crowd-pleaser.",89,The Big Easy 2014 Red (Santa Barbara County)
"A fine example of this sometimes tricky grape, this wine is structured with solid tannins and rich fruit. Wood aging has softened some of the structure, allowing a more rounded, rich aftertaste.",90,Herdade do Esporão 2008 AB Alicante Bouschet (Alentejano)
"Tough in tannins, with an astringent, lockdown quality. That's the iron fist of this wine. The velvet glove is the rich, flamboyant core of blackberries and cassis. Give this young wine at least six years to come around.",92,Baldacci 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District)
"Dusty mineral and herbal aromas contrast against a palate that's chock full of raspberry and cherry flavor. It's forward with fruit, but a bit strikingly acidic, spiked by a razor-like edge of cranberry and lemon.",86,Knapp 2014 Dry Rosé (Finger Lakes)
This is an obviously wood-aged wine with plenty of toast flavors. This wood aging has flattened the fruit giving a wine that is soft with few tannins. It is ready to drink.,84,Château Laffitte Laujac 2012  Médoc
"Structured and fragrant, this wine offers aromas of tilled soil, forest floor, blue flowers, rose and dark berry. The savory palate delivers mature black cherry, ripe plum, orange peel, Asian spice and anise alongside supple tannins and vibrant acidity.",89,Rizzi 2012  Barbera d'Alba
"Luscious melon aromas, creamy fruit-tart flavors and a silky texture make a pleasing combination in this wonderfully soothing wine. A crisp core of lemon and apple flavors are surrounded by a layer of vanilla and hazelnut. The plus texture carries the flavors through a long finish.",90,The Tribe 2014 Chardonnay (Lodi)
"Aromas of freshly cut green pepper, herbs, cherry and dark chocolate pop on this lightly colored wine. It's high octane with lighter-styled cherry flavors.",87,Nodland 2012 Bad Attitude Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Nicely concentrated fruit flavors and an especially rich, almost thick texture help this full-bodied wine stand out from the pack. Black cherries and blackberries spill out of the aroma and into the flavors, where they become quite vivid and lingering.",91,Saracina 2014 Big Shot Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino County)
"A rich plummy shade carries you into an aromatic fruity wine with a tart mix of plums and cherries. It's just this side of candied, and there's an intriguing suggestion of peppermint. All in all it's quite tasty, clean and ready for immediate enjoyment.",89,Season 2014 Limited Edition Series Grenache (Southern Oregon)
"From a Pinot Noir specialist in the heart of the Russian River Valley, this white is equal parts floral and fruity, shy and dry, with a succulent layering of lime, grapefruit and fig. A medium level of acidity wraps itself around a viscous core, keeping the wine fresh on the palate. It's the right kind of weighty, finishing with ginger and honey.",90,Balletto 2013 Estate Grown Estate Bottled Pinot Gris (Russian River Valley)
"From grapes grown in the Douro Superior region, this is an open delicious fruity and ripe wine that is ready to drink. Its black currant and red berry tastes are balanced by spice, wood aged flavors and a core of tannins. The aftertaste introduces fresh juicy acidity.",90,Poças 2013 Vale de Cavalos Red (Douro)
"Loads of clove, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg spice show up the strawberry, blueberry and red cherry aromas of this lavish bottling, which also offers scents of crushed rock and turned earth. Similar elements entertain the palate, culminating with a minty pine needle note, proving to be a very dynamic sip.",90,Lorenzi Estate 2012 Old Vine Lopez Ranch Zinfandel (Temecula Valley)
"Broadly fruity, this dark and smooth Merlot is loaded with a luscious mix of black fruits. The flavors play out in forward, accessible fashion, flecked with a pleasing minerality.",89,O•S Winery 2009 The Tusk Elephant Mountain Vineyard Merlot (Yakima Valley)
"Sticky tar, dense blackberry, leather, soy and lilacs combine for a thick nose on this well-priced, widely available bottling. Beef char, dense purple flowers, blackberry jam and tar consume the palate, which is chewy with a strong tannic structure.",87,Kendall-Jackson 2014 Vintner's Reserve Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"Baked pineapple and mango rise to the fore in this nutty, slightly grassy and herbal wine. It's lightly bodied and creamy in texture.",86,Decoy 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County)
"Gaseous, rubbery aromas are a fair introduction to an edgy, bouncy type of Malbec. Cherry and plum flavors finish candied and also a little spicy. There's also some heat to this jumpy style of wine.",85,Finca La Luz 2013 Estate Malbec (Valle de Uco)
"This wine is dry and substantial, emphasizing earthy, savory flavors over fruity ones. An attractive walnut and almond element carries through from the aroma to the flavors.",86,Kitchen Sink NV White (California)
"Ripe, spicy and full both of ripe fruits and tannins, this is a full-bodied wine that brings out the minerality and structure of a Douro wine. It has plenty of red fruits to balance these tannins, resolving into the wine that is firm but ready to drink.",86,Adega Vila Real 2015 Premium Red (Douro)
"This is a medium-bodied, slightly plump Sauvignon Blanc that hits the right herbal notes of snow pea and tomato leaf, then blends those with grapefruit and hints of stone fruit.",88,Twin Islands 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Named after enologist Benjamin Cooker, this wine was aged in egg-shaped cement tanks. Pure Malbec that is rich, rounded with spice and firm tannins, it has a generous, spacious character that is beginning to develop. With a dark background to the black-currant fruits, this needs to age. Drink from 2018.",93,Château de Gaudou 2013 Le Sang de la Vigne Signé Benjamin Cooker Malbec (Cahors)
"Notes of peel and flesh of Bosc pear pervade nose and palate, there is a core of earthy ripeness but the palate gives the impression of ginger-spiced freshness, tempered by earth. Rounded and beautiful.",89,Sipp Mack 2014 Osterberg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Barolo Sorano (from the Serralunga d'Alba area) is an impressive wine with big color and extraction followed by aromas of cherry liqueur, spice, vanilla, clove and ginger. The wine is chewy and succulent in the mouth with firm tannins that will soften with time. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers.",94,Claudio Alario 2006 Sorano  (Barolo)
"Pretty fragrances and freshness characterize this popular Pinot Grigio with aromas of stone fruit, acacia flower and honeydew melon. It's a simple, easy wine with a thin consistency but those floral aromas help make it stand out in a crowd.",86,Santa Margherita 2007 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige)
"Here is a luminous single-vineyard bubbly with steady and persistent perlage and pristine aromas of acacia flower, orange zest and peach. Thanks to small percentages of Verdiso and Perera, it is a very fruit-forward wine with great balance and drying mineral tones.",87,Andreola Orsola NV Dirupo Brut  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
"A rounded wine, surprisingly soft for a Pauillac. The tannins are ripe, with chocolate and sweet black currant fruit flavors along with spice and some toast.",90,Château Pibran 2008  Pauillac
"Fresh and fruity, this wine is also lightly herbal and shows touches of wood. It is crisp, tangy with its yellow-fruit flavors mingling with the citrus acidity. The wine will be ready to drink from late 2016.",89,Le Nardian 2013  Bordeaux Blanc
"Sugary sweet, this blend has jammy flavors of raspberries and cherries, with a sprinkling of chocolate.",82,Hovey 2007 Dalton Cuvée Petite Sirah Syrah (Calaveras County)
"This simple, bright Dolcetto is packed tight with plump fruit tones, spice, leather and a touch of moist pipe tobacco. It's a thick, dense wine that offers loads of mature blackberry and cherry on the finish.",87,Il Vino dei Padri 2009  Dolcetto d'Acqui
"Aromas of stewed prune, grilled pepper and roasted coffee bean join in this blend of 45% Merlot, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Sangiovese and 10% Cabernet Franc. The evolved palate shows date, vanilla and coconut. Drink sooner rather than later.",88,Poggio Verrano 2007 Chance  (Maremma Toscana)
"Delicious in raspberries, cherries, sassafras, cola, orange blossom tea and vanilla, with a beautifully silky texture, this single-vineyard Pinot comes from low-yielding vines in the central part of the appellation. It's a little too soft for cellaring, but offers solid pleasure now.",87,Roar 2005 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"A Chardonnay with an easygoing disposition, this has a broad, waxy aroma of white orchard fruit. The melon-flavored palate bears a slight oiliness. Pair it with grilled swordfish steaks.",85,The Williamsburg Winery 2010 Acte 12 of Sixteen Nineteen Chardonnay (Virginia)
"Luna Selvatica (“wild moon”) is an easy and straightforward expression of Cabernet Sauvignon that shows dark fruit, cola, licorice and a touch of toasted spice. In the mouth, the wine shows alcoholic power and some grittiness on the finish.",87,La Tosa 2009 Luna Selvatica Cabernet Sauvignon (Colli Piacentini)
"Solid as a boulder and concentrated on the bouquet, with a mix of floral, fine perfume and blackberry aromas. Feels lush, complete and easygoing, with blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors. Graceful and composed on the back end.",90,Tapiz 2010 Malbec (Mendoza)
"A blend of Pinot Bianco, Chardonnay and Sauvignon, this northern Italian white opens with crisp, tangy fruit and long tones of stone fruit, mineral, pineapple and pear. Those fruity notes help support the wine's medium structure and build.",88,Manincor 2011 Réserve della Contessa White (Alto Adige)
"Set in the southern half of the Pauillac appellation, this estate still is not expressing the quality of its vineyard location. The wine is firm, lean with tight acidity and dry tannins. It will soften, although not by much.",86,Château Croizet-Bages 2013  Pauillac
"Lush and mouth-filling, this is a plummy rendering of Châteauneuf-du-Pape that's ready to drink. Hints of green peppercorn and mocha add nuance, while the finish is long and voluptuous.",92,Louis Bernard 2009 Domaine La Crau des Papes Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape)
"While this wine has eye-watering acidity, it also has a sweet backdrop of fruit candies and lemon tang. It is ready to drink.",84,Lago Cerqueira 2014 White (Vinho Verde)
"Southern Oregon, unlike the northern Willamette Valley, is warm and conducive to growing Bordeaux varieties, as evidenced by this hearty, tannic blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc. Right away you get kirsch and cassis from this heavyweight, and that's followed by a ripe palate that blasts loudly with plum and chocolate. Along the way there are some drying tannins and pulsating acids, so either lay it down for a couple of years or decant and serve with grilled meats.",89,Cana's Feast 2000 Del Rio Vineyard Red (Rogue Valley)
"This is the kind of food-friendly wine to pair with grilled shrimp kebabs or fish tacos. It presents clean aromas of citrus, pear and stone fruit, backed by zesty acids on the finish.",87,Tenuta del Buonamico 2011 Vermentino (Montecarlo)
"Concentrated and rich, this has fine tannins that are integrated into the big plum fruits. It's a black-fruited wine that has both the fruit and the structure to allow it to age well. Drink from 2020",93,Château Pape Clément 2012  Pessac-Léognan
"This expression of Fiano comes forward with crisp, clean aromas of freshly cut lemon, orange blossom and almond paste. The mouthfeel is tonic and lean, but the real point here is the wine's freshness.",86,Rocca del Principe 2009  Fiano di Avellino
"The 100% new oak used in the aging of this wine was not a good idea. It has given too much woodiness and not enough fruit. Still young, it may soften enough to allow the generous blackberry flavors to come through.",87,Château Valade 2014  Saint-Émilion
"This off-dry Riesling awakens the palate with a piercing strike of lemon-lime acidity, but recovers quickly with pliant layers of sweet berries, yellow cherries and pear. It's sharp and brisk, but mouthwatering and juicy.",90,St. Urbans-Hof 2013 Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Kabinett Erste Lage Riesling (Mosel)
"The odd name of this wine—meeting in September—is because grapes from different parcels are blended directly in the press at harvest time in September. It is an easy, ripe and open, with attractive white-peach flavors and just a touch of tighter minerality. Drink now.",88,Rijckaert 2014 Rendez-Vous de Septembre  (Viré-Clessé)
"Shy on the nose, this wine evolves into a subtle suggestion of smoky barbecue—its tight tannin structure holding on for dear life against a subversive note of red currant and cedar. Full-bodied and quite robust, it provides a dry, tacky finish.",90,Midsummer Cellars 2013 Katz Family Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
"This sultry wine is sourced from the producer's Trenton Road vineyard, cooler than where the winery itself sits in Chalk Hill. Planted to six clones, it provides this bottling with a taste of blueberry and raspberry integrated around soft, juicy tannins and a brightness of acidity.",90,Chalk Hill 2013 Estate Bottled Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"There's no mistaking the variety, with aromas of sarsaparilla, underbrush and cherry, though a rubber-tire note provides some distraction. The cherry, strawberry and cranberry flavors show good concentration, though they seem a bit clunky at times.",87,Bethany Vineyard 2012 Gracee Estate Produced Pinot Noir (Washington)
"Aged only in stainless steel, this fresh Soave Classico from the hills of northern Italy shows lemony and citrus-like freshness with simple lines and balanced acidity. There's a touch of sweet almond on the close.",87,Le Battistelle 2010 Battistelle  (Soave Classico)
"This “basic” Tierra de León wine made from the obscure Prieto Picudo grape outshines Pricum's higher-priced bottlings. It has a leathery nose with mild baked-berry flavors, while the palate is tight but not astringent. Flavors of toamto, red currant, raspberry and herbs are snappy, and overall it's textured and long in the mouth.",87,Pricum 2007 Prieto Picudo (Tierra de León)
"Notes of crisp green pear and crunchy red apple are very appetizing, the palate is fresh and echoes these flavors and edges them with some spice and alcoholic heat, but also has a drive and energy of its own. Friendly and very moreish.",90,Anton Bauer 2015 Gmörk Grüner Veltliner (Wagram)
"Tight, taut and mineral, tense and concentrated. There is intense acidity and a touch of spice, but this is all about structure and suppressed fruit. Keep this wine at least until 2010.",95,Franz Hirtzberger 2006 Singerriedel Smaragd Riesling (Wachau)
"Chignin is one of the cru villages of Savoie. This wine is crisp, mineral and tight, with delicate layers of lemon and grapefruit acidity. Lively and bursting with fruit, it's ready to drink.",86,Domaine les Fils de René Quénard 2015 Les Cantates Chignin Jacquère (Savoie)
"A wood-aged white that is gently spicy, while also ripe and fruity. It has great balance, with its rounded character cut by delicious citrus and peach flavors. It will certainly age, so drink from 2015.",89,Quinta de la Rosa 2012 Reserva Branco White (Douro)
"The winemaker rightfully praises this Pinot for having so much fruit at below 14% alcohol. He's right, but there's more to great wine than fruit. The wine is massive in cherries, raspberries and currants, but right now that's about all you get in the way of complexity. Could surprise with some time in the cellar.",87,Clos Pepe 2007 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Made in small quantities, this wine opens in a decadence of gingerbread and graham cracker aromas before a medium-bodied texture supports a supple ripeness of green apple, melon and pear.",89,Sill Family 2014 Très Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"Ripe and attractively fruity, this wood-aged wine has ripe tannins that are still firm and strong. The fruit is still young, full of black currant flavors and bright acidity. These elements give a wine that has structure and needs to age. Drink from 2018.",88,Château Laffitte Laujac 2011  Médoc
"Cline has done a very nice job with this Zin, which comes partly from Lodi. Although it's very soft and won't age, it has a velvet and silk purity that carries rich flavors of cherries, raspberries, licorice, sweet vanilla and pepper.",86,Cline 2006 Ancient Vines Zinfandel (Contra Costa County)
"Ripeness of peach, citrus, apple and pear shimmers everywhere. The palate is clean, very fruit-driven and fresh, if a little upfront. Drink this refreshing and dry wine soon.",88,Marcel Hugg 2015 Réserve Saint Jean Riesling (Alsace)
This offers much of the intensity of Amarone with some of the easy-drinking appeal of Valpolicella. Twists of ripe cherry and dried ginger lend it extra personality.,87,Castellani Michele & Figli 2010 San Michele Ca' del Pipa  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
"Light strawberry and black cherry fruit is the story here, backed with decent acidity. Tannins are dark and well-structured, so the wine keeps its balance. Though it does not have the weight or depth of Washington Syrahs, or the sweet berry flavors of California, it is soundly made, drinking well, fruit forward, and a good choice for warm weather sipping.",87,J. Scott Cellars 2007 Del Rio Vineyard Syrah (Rogue Valley)
"With its hot, sugary finish, this will appeal only to those who like an overripe style; sweet as raspberry jam.",83,Peachy Canyon 2005 BFD Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"Crisp and green, this has a ripe, rounded apple flavor that lends the wine richness. There is a yeasty character to go with the fruitiness, while the refreshing acidity lasts through the finish.",87,Vera 2011 Alvarinho (Vinho Verde)
"Faint white flower, orange peel, spice and citrus aromas are followed by broad fruit flavors in this wine, which lacks concentration.",87,Novelty Hill 2015 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This open ripe wine is made for drinking young. Its soft red fruits, light tannins and acidity all come together in an easy fruity wine. Drink now.",87,Adega Cooperativa do Cartaxo 2015 Bridão Classico Red (Tejo)
"Etienne Le Riche is a total Cabernet specialist. With a tiny production of 5,000 cases across all his wines, this is boutique in the best sense. The Reserve Cabernets are, of course, the stars. This 2003 is fruit and wood driven, a powerful but still elegant wine, with black plums, tannins and super-ripe fruits.",91,Le Riche 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch)
"Fresh acidity and satisfying, full fruit flavors make this a winner all around. A lighter pink color and bright grapefruit and peach aromas are followed by tangy raspberry and cherry flavors. The balance is outstanding and will make it very versatile with food.",90,Senses 2014 Rosé of Rosé (Sonoma Coast)
"This is a light, graceful red that's stemmy and fresh in a mix of well-integrated cranberry, rhubarb and cardamom flavors. An undercurrent of earthy truffle plays on the palate, weaving its way to a long finish.",90,Ampelos 2014 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Heady aromatics create a signature on this wine, so floral in lychee, orange blossom and lemongrass. Light and dry, it's classically varietal, with grapefruit and tangerine jockeying for attention amidst plenty of minerality.",90,Dutton-Goldfield 2013 Dutton Ranch Green Valley Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Green Valley)
"Made in the classic Clos du Val style, this Cabernet is less ripe, drier and more acidic than many of its Napa Valley neighbors. It's also very tannic. Currently, it's an aloof, austere wine, but it has a deep core of blackberries. This wants at least eight years in a proper cellar, and should age well for another decade beyond that.",91,Clos du Val 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District)
"The fantastic nose pitches French toast together with Meyer lemon pith, crushed rock, struck match and a slight sour-cream element. This wine is immediately lively on the tongue, with lots of but not overdone acidity. Yeasty toast flavors are cut by lemon and poached pear on a racy and focused palate.",93,Testarossa 2013 La Rinconada Vineyard Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Soft, velvety and fruity, with chocolate, black raspberry, currant and oak flavors this blend is spiced up with white pepper and cinnamon notes. Drink this hearty wine with stews, barbecue or pasta.",87,Star Angel by Montes 2008 Red Wine Red (Paso Robles)
"This is the reserve-level Pinot Gris, comprised of lots from five different vineyards. Juicy, succulent and quite tart fruit flavors emphasize fresh apples and pears, lightly dusted with cinnamon spice. The concentration and lingering finish prove it worthy of its reserve status.",92,King Estate 2015 Backbone Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"Tastes like a supermarket peach, mango and pineapple fruit-juice drink, with the headiness of alcohol. There's a subtle hint of oak in this wine that finishes on the sweet side.",84,Tower 15 2012 Grenache Blanc (Paso Robles)
Faint notes of white pepper and bay leaf create an aromatic introduction to this delicate rosé. The slender palate delivers red apple and a pleasant hit of citrus which lingers beautifully.,88,Jäger 2015 Rosé (Wachau)
"Aromas of tomato, balsamic black fruits and beef stew announce a blocky palate that's flat in feel. Flavors of pepper, prune and stewed blackberry finish dark and rubbery, and overall this is ripe but lacking in structure and mouthfeel.",87,Rejadorada 2009 Sango Reserva  (Toro)
"This is a ripe wine. Red plum and berry fruits are given weight and richness by the solid tannins, smoky flavors and the dryness at the heart of the wine. Give this structured wine time to develop and drink from 2021.",92,Albert Morot 2014 Les Toussaints Premier Cru  (Beaune)
"This is the first wine made from Oregon grapes by this southern California winery. But one can't help but wonder if shipping fruit all the way down the coast might bang it up a bit. For whatever reason, this wine tastes fractured, metallic and chalky. There is a core of black cherry, but it seems surrounded by gun-metal flavors, which stick to the palate and abruptly shut down the finish.",85,Loring Wine Company 2006 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Like all wines from Les Baux, this is made from organically grown grapes. It's rich, packed with dense black fruits and tannins. With Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend giving structure, this concentrated wine will repay aging. Drink from 2017.",92,Château d'Estoublon 2010 Red (Les Baux de Provence)
"Leafy, herbal aromas of plum and raspberry show a touch of tomato, with a dash of oregano. This is soft on the palate, without a lot of spine or structure. Earthy, herbal flavors of stewed berries, tomato and green herbs finish minty and leafy, but with good feel.",86,Tres Palacios 2012 Family Vintage Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"Almost equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this wine is reduced and tastes somewhat burnt, lacking in fruit with a sour aftertaste.",80,Ideology Cellars 2012 Proprietary Blend Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Grassy and herbal, this wine is crisp, tight and mineral. It's delicate and bright in character, and ready for drinking now.",85,Château Pierrail 2012  Bordeaux Blanc
"Bell pepper and citrus aromas control the nose on this racy wine that clocks in at only 12% abv. An alert, tangy palate matches the nose, while this tastes of lemon-lime, tart green apple and sea brine. A lean, high-acid finish stops short of tasting green.",88,Veranda 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Bío Bío Valley)
"This soft, easy-drinking wine smells spicy, almost like tobacco, and tastes plummy and pruney. It has a good, smooth texture and lingering finish.",88,Josh Cellars 2014 Zinfandel (Lodi)
"There is a definite feeling of maturity here. The wine has a fine tang of fruit along with toast, vanilla and hints of grapefruit and apple. This opulent Champagne is ready to drink now.",90,Vranken 2000 Demoiselle Millésimé Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne)
"This robust rustic red has aromas suggesting barnyard, game and cured meat. The aromas carry over to the muddled palate along with cranberry, raisin and a salty note. Stalky, grainy tannins give it a raspy finish.",85,Montresor 2013  Amarone della Valpolicella
"Muted aromatically, it has a light, bright core of cherry lurking in the layers of juicy spice. The grapes come from the Klindt and Wiley Vineyards. Let it breathe or decant before drinking, and enjoy it soon.",86,Harmonique 2007 The Noble One Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"A heavily spiced nose of cracked peppercorn and tobacco notes mesh with blackberry extract and blueberries on this top bottling from the winery. Its flavors are even darker than blue fruit, with creosote and smoked cigar elements that mellow and evolve as the bottle sits open.",92,Blackjack 2010 Harmonie Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Barbara County)
"Aromas recall blue flower, tilled earth and a whiff of game. The bright palate offers up crushed black cherry accented with sweet baking spices alongside fresh acidity and supple tannins.",88,Albino Rocca 2012  Nebbiolo d'Alba
"Dark and brooding on the nose, with mint, menthol, beefy fruit and coconut for sweetness. Feels choppy and more acidic than expected, with heavy flavors of coconut, toast and blackberry. Toasty, herbal and slightly scratchy on the finish.",88,Familia Marguery 2006 Single Vineyard Malbec (Mendoza)
"This wine is tight and tannic, with a rustic hint of leathery saddle and barnyard that makes it hard to highly recommend.",82,Main & Geary 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Concentrated, dense and powerful, this has all the structure of a Chambertin. As a contrast, the juicy acidity cuts through the texture, luring out black fruits that balance the solid core of tannins. It needs to age for at least seven years.",92,Louis Latour 2010  Chambertin
"93-95. Barrel sample. This wine has an intense herbaceous quality, with fruit and nutmeg flavors. It feels and tastes powerful, with alcoholic warmth and a taut and nervy character.",94,Château Haut-Brion 2011 Barrel Sample  (Pessac-Léognan)
"Set at 1,000 feet, the vineyard of Les Mouchottes inevitably produces cool and crisp wines with tangible acidity and strong red currant fruitiness. It's attractive and light, with a bright, fragrant aftertaste. Drink from 2016.",87,Nuiton-Beaunoy 2012 Les Mouchottes  (Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Nuits)
"Murky, mulchy aromas of baked black fruits and coffee grinds set up a gritty, hard palate of barrel char and roasted berry fruits. The finish is more of the same—lots of oak, burnt coffee and baked black-fruit flavors.",85,Falernia 2013 Pedriscal Vineyard Reserva Carmenère (Elqui Valley)
"Cedar, cinnamon and nutmeg notes show in the aromas and continue in the flavors. This complexity blends well with the classic Merlot flavors of black cherry and subtle herbs. It's medium to full bodied, but very smooth in texture. The blend is Merlot, Zinfandel and Petite Sirah.",87,Ironstone 2012 Obsession Red (Lodi)
"Ripe and jammy, this is a rich wine from a fine vintage. The tannins are well-integrated into the black fruits, soft texture and juicy plum flavors. Drink now.",86,Bailli de Bourg 2010  Côtes de Bourg
"This is a spicy, exotic wine with flavors of rich berry fruits and a warm, perfumed structure. There are dense tannins supporting the ripe fruitiness and dark, brooding edge of this still-young wine. It can be drunk now for its fruit, but will also age remarkably well. Drink until 2019.",90,Tinhof 2009 Classic Blaufränkisch (Burgenland)
"Waxy notes of white flower and orange peel persist on the nose and palate of this bold, invigorating wine. Dry and full bodied, it's structured and concentrated, but it finishes crisply with hints of tart tangerine and hazelnut skin.",87,Korta Katarina 2009 Posip (Korčula)
"A little bit off balance, with mild compost and earth on the nose giving way to an angular palate with pointed acids along with flavors of zesty berries and red apple skins.",84,Dios Ares 2004 Crianza  (Rioja)
"Fermented entirely in stainless steel, this is meant to be a flinty, grassy and herbal experience, especially as the main variety was blended with 3% Riesling. Simple and dry, it offers peach, lemon zest and lychee fruitiness and medium weight.",85,Outlot 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County)
"From one of the top vineyard sectors of Pouilly-Fumé, the wine is rich, full and complex. Spice and vanilla are contrasted with the intense acidity and steely white-fruit and citrus flavors. It is still young with its fruitiness bursting out of the glass. Wait until 2018.",92,Patrice Moreux 2015 La Loge aux Moines  (Pouilly-Fumé)
"Attractively fruity, with plenty of red berry and black cherry flavors. Along with the fruit, the tannins and spice round out the texture, giving a final velvet feel.",86,Château de Fontenille 2008  Bordeaux
"This boasts oak-driven aromas of honey and vanilla, with notes of exotic fruit, citrus and Golden Delicious. It is soft and supple, with a lively, fruit-driven finish.",91,Marisa Cuomo 2010 Furore Bianco Fiorduva White (Costa d'Amalfi)
"This wine has aromas of coffee, toast, cherry meats, herbs, mocha and barrel spices along with a lightly green edge. It's tart and flavorful, with a supple feel and chalky tannins.",88,Swiftwater Cellars 2012 Zephyr Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Labeled “Stainless Cuvée,” this stainless-steel-aged Chardonnay is definitely European in style. A fine contrast to Rulo's toasty Walla Walla cuvée, this has minerally apple and citrus flavors. It's delicate but full flavored, with concentration and length.",91,Rulo 2011 Sundance Vineyard Chardonnay (Wahluke Slope)
"Produced by the same team as Château Cambon la Pelouse, this wine is already drinkable. With attractive black currant fruits and acidity, it is gently tannic with a dry core. The aftertaste is juicy and full of fruit.",87,Château Trois Moulins 2012  Haut-Médoc
"This oak-aged blend of Sangiovese (50%), Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon opens with a dark ruby color and aromas of black cherry, cassis and exotic spice. Smooth, sweet berry fruit characterizes the finish.",87,Barberani 2009 Foresco Red (Umbria)
"In this easy-drinking wine, jammy aromas of multiple black fruits lead to a soft, simple palate with a streak of bracing tartaric acid. Straightforward blackberry flavors come with little to no complexity, while the finish is quick and fades away with modest grip and length.",88,Trivento 2012 Reserve Malbec (Mendoza)
"Savory notes of soy sauce and yeast extract add richness and umami to the sweet, cooked plum and cherry flavors on this Finger Lakes Pinot. A bit rustic with hints of smoked meat and leather, it's an ideal accompaniment to winter stews and braises.",85,Hosmer 2009 Pinot Noir (Cayuga Lake)
"A powerful and concentrated wine that has solid tannins and a tight, firm structure. It comes from heavily granitic soil, giving a steely texture that will take time to soften. As the red cherry and plum flavors develop, it will broaden out impressively. Drink from 2016.",91,Laurent Gauthier 2013 Côte de Py Vieilles Vignes  (Morgon)
"This wine is full of fruit, dusty tannins and great structure. A smooth surface covers the complex, juicy black fruits, dense tannins and mineral texture. This wine will certainly age, so don't drink before 2017.",91,Herdade do Rocim 2010 Olho de Mocho Reserva Red (Alentejano)
"This smells both dry and oily, with apple and melon notes. The palate is round and healthy in feel, while flavors of honeyed apple and white peach turn more briny and pyrazinic as this breathes and finishes.",84,Grÿphus 2015 Viña Macatero Estate Chardonnay (Maule Valley)
"Simple red-berry aromas are about as good as this gets. In the mouth, it's wet but dilute. Flavors of pithy citrus and grass finish with grapefruit and bitter flavors. This is basic at best and empty at worst.",82,Bodegas Valdemar 2012 Conde de Valdemar Rosado (Rioja)
"With 12% Sémillon in the blend, this is a lovely, fresh, almost exuberant Sauvignon Blanc. Bracing and textural, with good varietal character but no excessive herbaceousness, it's loaded with fruit flavors of melon, grapefruit, kiwi and apple. A fine mix of precision and length.",90,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a delightfully sweet Moscato di Trani with aromas of pear and Golden Delicious apple backed by honey and stone fruit. It offers a gritty, sweet texture and a fine point of acidity on the close that breaks through the dense sweetness.",89,Rivera 2006 Piani di Tufara Moscato (Puglia)
"89—91 Barrel sample. Very spicy wood aromas, but to taste the wine is better balanced. The wood seems to be integrated with the fruit, leaving a sweet, softly rich wine.",90,Château Smith Haut Lafitte 2006 Barrel sample  (Pessac-Léognan)
"This shows the extraordinary richness and complexity that the winery's estate vineyard has exhibited over its lifetime. It's vast in cherry, red currant and licorice flavors, plus multiple layers of sautéed mushroom, exotic baking spice, mineral and sweet, smoky sandalwood. It's also very tannic, with a brisk spine of acidity. Good as it is, it needs time for all the parts to knit together. Better after 2018.",95,Williams Selyem 2010 Williams Selyem Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
This wine is all about fruit. It is dry and so fresh and crisp with apple and green pear flavors. There is a light prickle there that adds a dancing lightness to this refreshing wine.,87,Quintas de Melgaço 2015 QM Terra Antiga White (Vinho Verde)
"Opening aromas include crushed blue flowers, graphite and woodland berries. The bright palate delivers tart red cherry, mint and menthol alongside brisk acidity and silky tannins. Enjoy soon to capture the fresh, juicy fruit flavors.",88,Amalia 2013 Nebbiolo (Langhe)
"A great success for the vintage, this wine is firmly structured and expressive, bringing out a dark structure, ripe tannins and swathes of black fruits. Further generosity will develop as the wine matures. Drink from 2018.",93,Château Beau-Séjour Bécot 2011  Saint-Émilion
"A complete wine that starts with lemony oak-based aromas that come with notes of herb, spice and dark-berry fruit. Feels layered, ripe and fresh, with full, sweet flavors of brown sugar, herb and baked berry and plum. Chocolaty and smooth on the finish. Drink now through 2014.",90,Echeverria 2008 Limited Edition Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley)
"Give this Cab credit for immensely ripe, fruit flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and cocoa. Rich in oak, it finishes dry despite the opulence. It's hard to find anything particularly Rutherford-y, but it's delicious for drinking now.",88,Riboli 2010 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"Creamy and crisp, this boasts enticing scents of hawthorn and black locust flower while the tangy palate evokes tangerine, white peach and green apple. Vibrant acidity brightens the fruit flavors.",89,Le Colture NV Fagher Brut  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"This wine needs plenty of breathing time, revealing pleasant hibiscus, rose, cranberry and tart cherry aromas as it opens. The flavors suggest pepper and red fruit, with a somewhat leathery aged character.",88,Midnight 2013 Synnove Petit Verdot (Paso Robles)
"Elegant in terms of packaging and content, this blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon offers delicate aromas of forest berry, cassis and blue flower. The wine builds momentum in the mouth thanks to its natural power and rich texture.",90,Tenuta di Ceppaiano 2007 Violetta Red (Toscana)
"Tastes a bit medicinal, with a sweet-sour quality of lemons and pineapples, and is quite acidic. Lacks richness, but it's a decent everyday Chardonnay.",83,Castoro Cellars 2007 Chardonnay (Central Coast)
Hints of orange and lemon on the rather muddied nose of this wine lead to a palate characterized by ripened fruit. While the palate is slightly dilute it shows freshness and a dry finish.,86,Koenig 2015 Riesling (Alsace)
"This is unusual in that it's heavily oaked, as evidenced by aromas of varnish, hard spice and resin. The mouthfeel is fresh on top of resiny, while flavors of dry oak, spice and mild apple and citrus operate in the background. While this wine has depth of body and acidic lift, it's dominated by the barrel.",87,Abadia Retuerta 2011 Le Domaine Blanco de Guarda White (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)
"This is a smooth, ripe and fruity wine. It has a touch of tannin, although the red fruits and rich texture make it easily drinkable even when young. The Merlot smoothes the Tannat, giving a round texture at the end.",86,Alain Brumont 2013 Brumont Tannat-Merlot (Côtes de Gascogne)
"Smells grassy, jumpy and foxy, and while it sports a decent feel on the palate, it's herbal and tomatoey in terms of flavor, with a vegetal undertone. Green and oaky on the finish.",81,Viñas de Vila 2009 Reserva Bonarda (Mendoza)
"Grass and apple-flesh notes are wrapped in a slightly reductive, oily frame on this blend of 55% Sauvignon Blanc, 18% Loureiro, 15% Verdelho, 7% Grenache Blanc and 5% Chardonnay. The flavors are also a tad tarry, with green-apple peels, lime zest, candied pear and dried grapefruit.",86,Marianello 2012 Estelle Bianco White (Santa Barbara County)
"This limited-production, aged wine incorporates 8% Merlot, sourcing grapes from several vineyards across the Napa Valley. Blueberry pie and sweet tobacco rise to the fore around an elegantly crafted structure, while soft, firm tannins provide just enough grip to stay juicy and compelling on the palate. It finishes with notes of chocolate, caramel and baking spice.",94,The Vineyard House 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Concentrated chocolate and licorice flavors characterize this wine, which shows signs of extraction along with a burn from the alcohol. Its fruit is the high point, with a burst of ripe blackberry juice, plus a black-currant-like tautness. The superripe Merlot will need several years to soften.",85,Château Jacques Noir 2010  Saint-Émilion
"This wine starts with a refined nose of lemon, peach and flower notes. The palate is lively and balanced, and it offers ripe citrus flavors, buoyed by spice and flint notes. An expressive medium-bodied white with style.",88,Gentilini 2010 Robola (Cephalonia)
"Produced from organically grown grapes, this wine has attractive red fruits and a warm ripe character. Dominated by Grenache, it has a light peppery edge as well as plenty of bright acidity to contrast the fruitiness. Drink now.",87,Domaines Pierre Chavin 2016 Pierre et Paul Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Good and dry, with rugged, dusty tannins and fine varietal flavors. Shows real elegance and class, with cherry, red currant, cedar and spice flavors. Drink now–2013.",88,Sean Minor 2008 4B Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Toasty and nutty upfront, with hints of minerality showing through, this is a refined Chardonnay that should have the structure to age. Despite being barrel-fermented, there's no malolactic fermentation, so it stays crisp through the long finish that barely hints at pear and peach.",90,Mount Mary 2005 Chardonnay (Yarra Valley)
"This wine entices with its nuanced aromas of mineral, spice, almond butter, lemon pith, tropical fruit and chamomile. The flavors are concentrated while still showing exquisite restraint along with pitch-perfect balance. The extended finish kicks it up a notch.",91,Efeste 2013 Lola Chardonnay (Ancient Lakes)
"Crisp and linear, this offers delicate aromas of Spanish broom and orchard fruit. The vibrant palate offers fresh green apple and juicy citrus while energizing mineral backs up the fresh, flinty finish.",89,Tornatore 2015 Bianco  (Etna)
"This hearty Brunello smells oddly unripe and slightly green with aromas of crushed peppercorn, eucalyptus, cola and coffee. The mouthfeel is bold and slightly bitter with plush berry flavors and raw tannins.",87,Marchesi de' Frescobaldi 2003 Castelgiocondo  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Here's a pert Pecorino, with bright citrus and tropical fruit sensations of lemon, tangerine and pineapple. A subtle note of flinty mineral on the close jazzes this up a bit, but overall this is a simple and enjoyable wine to enjoy with everyday fare.",86,Centanni Giacomo 2012  Offida Pecorino
"Lush and creamy as soon as it hits the palate, this fine value is packed with flavors of fresh-sliced, just-ripe pear. Hints of apple and tangerine further expand the flavor, and it finishes crisp and clean.",88,Acrobat 2014 Pinot Gris (Oregon)
"Lightly pink in color with a hint of orange, this bottling, which includes 20% Grenache Blanc, shows rose petals and a touch of watermelon shaved ice on the shy nose. The palate is very steely, reserved and tense, with only hints of light strawberry emerging. The wine is more about texture than flavor.",87,J. Lohr 2015 Gesture Rose of Grenache (Paso Robles)
"Soft and fruity, this is ripe with a gentle character from a high dosage (sugar syrup that tops up the bottle after they freeze the neck to pop out old yeast cells). This light-colored wine is perfumed with the scent of wild strawberries.",87,Canard-Duchêne NV Cuvée Léonie Brut Rosé  (Champagne)
"In this vintage, the producer's beloved blend is a commingling of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Merlot, 10% Petit Verdot, 3% Malbec and 2% Cabernet Franc. Two years in new French oak give it a youthful, tannic nature around smoky black cherry, burly leather and full-bodied richness and concentration. Further time in the bottle should coax out the blackberry and cherry; cellar through 2027.",95,Joseph Phelps 2012 Insignia Estate Grown Red (Napa Valley)
"Deep purple, this riveting Malbec melds dark red and blue fruits to the grip and texture of ripe Yakima Valley tannins. Think clean earth lightly dusted with chocolate, and you have the finish. A powerful wine with excellent cellar potential.",92,Stevens 2009 Timley Malbec (Yakima Valley)
"Easy to like, with gentle, soft flavors of apricot jam, ripe pear, vanilla and honeysuckle. Tastes like there may be some residual sugar, making it a nice afternoon cocktail wine.",85,Tablas Creek 2006 Grenache Blanc (Paso Robles)
"Aged in wood, this is an unusual style of Pinot Blanc for Alsace. The toast flavors are subtle, leaving plenty of room for fresh fruits, light acidity and creamy texture. It's ready to drink.",88,Domaine Ostertag 2011 Barriques Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
"Pretty ordinary stuff, a tannic wine with sharp, jammy berry-cherry flavors and a fast, hard finish.",81,Butterfield Station 2005 Shiraz (California)
"This rich Syrah is a pleasure to drink with lamb and beef dishes. It has an excellent structure, softly tannic and silky in the mouth, with long, luscious black cherry, blueberry, beef teriyaki, sandalwood and spice flavors. Only 100 cases were produced.",90,Broadway Vineyards 2008 Syrah (Carneros)
"Fairly intense and flavorful, this Chard expresses assertive aromas and flavors of wood-grilled peaches, buttercream frosting, lemon custard and toasted brioche. Medium weight in the mouth with good balance and a touch of baking spice on the close.",89,Jardin 2009 Nine Yards Chardonnay (Stellenbosch)
"This ruby hued Nero d'Avola opens with earthy aromas of mature red and black berries, underbrush and a whiff of white pepper. The lean palate isn't very expressive, showing raw red cherry and a hint of roasted coffee bean. It finishes on a green, bitter note.",86,Casa di Grazia 2011 Gradiva Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"Smooth and rich, the first release of the new vintage from Le Cadeau is a gem. Tangy berry/cherry fruit is framed in chocolate, while balancing acidity props up softer, caramel streaks. The finish brings a wash of citrus, leaving the mouth feeling clean and ready to sip again.",90,Le Cadeau 2009 Oregon Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This is a tight, tangy wine, laced with attractive wood flavors. Plenty of crisp citrus and spicy flavors balance each other. It is already delicious, so drink now.",89,Domaine Sophie Cinier 2016  Mâcon-Verze
"This women-owned château above Cadillac produced a crisp wine, tight and nervy. With lively acidity, it focuses on the citrus side of life, finishing with a mineral edge. It will drink best from the end of 2017.",87,Château Peneau 2016 II Sauvignons  (Bordeaux Blanc)
"Berry and raisin aromas announce a slightly overripe wine. That's confirmed on the palate, which feels a bit syrupy. Oaky black-fruit flavors are candied, and this Garnacha finishes steady but chunky.",85,Valcantara 2015 Old Vine Garnacha (Cariñena)
"Gen Yers and Baby Boomers will remember when Rosemount's ubiquitous Diamond Label wines represented great value. This Cab offers slightly confected cherry fruit, a whisper of mint and hints of vanilla. It's round in the mouth without being heavy, a fresh fruity wine for immediate gratification.",86,Rosemount 2009 Diamond Label Cabernet Sauvignon (South Eastern Australia)
"Oily, gritty stone-fruit aromas announce a plump, soft palate with papaya and banana flavors. A mealy quality and bitterness rise up on the finish.",83,O. Fournier 2013 Urban Uco Chardonnay (Uco Valley)
"This fresh, stalky wine has hints of wood. The fruit is light and only just ripe, giving it a tight character, with plenty of acidity and a dry core of tannins. It will be ready to drink in a crisp way from 2017.",85,Château Poitevin 2013  Médoc
"Tropical fruit and melon aromas are basic but friendly. This has a punch-like mouthfeel as well as open-knit flavors of orange, nectarine, white grapefruit and apple. What it lacks in finesse is made up for in fruit.",84,Region 1 2013 Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"Aromas of herb, grass, pear and citrus lead to sleek fruit flavors. It shows a lot of elegance but lacks concentration.",86,Barnard Griffin 2015 Fume Blanc Dry Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Hot in alcohol, soft in acidity and sweet in berry-cherry fruit, this simple Cabernet earns a point or two for its lush, ripe tannins.",84,Hunt Cellars 2007 Bon Vivant Destiny Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"A beautifully made wine, it shows very intense aromas of apricot nectar and lime peel. While it has that wonderful easygoing personality of an Asti, it is more interesting and structured than most of them. A very fine example.",88,Ricossa 2007  Moscato d'Asti
"Cheesy oak and raw cherry and plum aromas create a nose that needs time in the glass to show its best. This Rioja feels fresh and tight, with pulling tannins. Zesty plum and cherry flavors carry a peppery side note prior to a snappy finish with similar flavors.",90,Bodegas Palacio 2014 Cosme Palacio 1894  (Rioja)
"Named for the winery's co-proprietor and founder, Lynn's is powerfully graceful, much like the man himself, offering seamless texture and length. Full bodied and complex, it's structured and ripely satisfying in its mix of black tea, grenadine and feral evocations of a walk in the woods.",94,Lynmar 2014 Lynn's Blend Quail Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Finished (apparently) off-dry, this seems to show some residual sugar in a leesy, yeasty style. The fruit suggests pears and cotton candy, with juicy acidity supporting the sweetness. Don't look for your standard dry Pinot Gris, but what's here is generous and enjoyable.",88,Maysara 2013 Momtazi Vineyard Pinot Gris (McMinnville)
"Damp forest and dried cherry with cranberry combine on the nose and palate in this wine, sourced predominantly from Monterey County. Soft and silky it risks veering off balance once the oak begins to unwrap, becoming quite burly on the finish.",86,Ghost Pines 2013 Winemaker's Blend Pinot Noir (Sonoma County-Monterey County)
"Quite young and firm, this is packed with bright purple and black fruits, balanced against stiff but smooth tannins. Black olive and blueberry come through, with a light suggestion of caramel.",92,Pepper Bridge 2010 Trine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This medium-bodied Chardonnay features aromas of pineapple and roasted cashew. Similar notes of ripe pineapple and nuts mark the palate, then ease to a rather soft, easy finish. Drink now.",86,Yalumba 2016 Made With Organic Grapes Chardonnay (South Australia)
"Duckhorn's new releases are so good, you might hesitate to make the investment on this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend. True, it's not the most drinkable of their wines, at this time, but it easily is the most intense and concentrated. Dazzles with a molten core of sweet blackberries, blueberries and cassis, deep and long in the finish. Don't insult it by drinking before 2013, but you're better served by holding for far longer, even into the 2020s.",95,Duckhorn 2007 The Discussion Estate Grown Red (Napa Valley)
"Aromas of honey, chestnut and mature fruit are followed by drying mineral flavors and crisp freshness. The wine is made from a blend of Tocai and Verduzzo Friulano, which is an often over-looked white wine variety from Northern Italy with good structure and density.",87,Marco Cecchini 2006 Tovè White (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"Clean lines of red cherry, fennel, crushed slate, dried sage and other minty aromatics show on the nose of this clonal study by Richard Sanford's winery. It's tart and herbaceous on the sip, with a backbone of red cherry fruit and pomegranate lifted by dried herbs and sagebrush.",91,Alma Rosa 2013 Clone 115 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
This is completely dominated by oak. It doesn't have the fruity richness to support the toasted notes and invasive wood sensations. It finishes on an astringent note.,84,Tinazzi 2011 Monterè Ca' de' Rocchi  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
"If you like heavyweight Tempranillo, this is a textbook rendition. It's deep and dark, with earth, leather and oak in addition to monster black fruit on the nose. Feels lush, powerful and layered, with bursting blackberry, spice, mocha and vanilla flavors. Quite black and spicy on the finish. Drink from 2012 through 2016.",94,Teso La Monja 2009 Alabaster  (Toro)
"Highly reputed for its red wines, Vacheron continues to display its skills with this latest vintage. The wine is rich and full with a combination of bright red fruits and a firm, integrated structure. It is a fresh wine now and one that should age. Drink from 2018.",92,Domaine Vacheron 2014  Sancerre
"This wine is well sourced, its grapes coming from Brown Ranch, Toyon and Trefethen, among other sites. Aging takes place partially in barrels that have been soaked in water before toasting to lessen the impact, and in stainless steel. Light, crisp honeyed apple, pear and vanilla star alongside caramel and a floral flourish.",91,Duckhorn 2014 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"This is a fruit-driven, medium-bodied rosé of Grenache (60%) and Mourvèdre (40%). While not the most complex rosé, the yellow-fleshed, red-skinned plum flavors are potent, lingering on the mouthwatering finish.",87,Château Signac 2013 Cuvée Dona Clara Chusclan Rosé (Côtes du Rhône Villages)
"Ripe, muscular wine, with a full throttle nose rich with jammy black fruits. Firm structure, smooth tannins, and a chocolaty finish make this an appealing, consumer-friendly style.",88,Stonehedge 1997 Reserve Zinfandel (Napa Valley)
"Aromas of ripe dark-skinned fruit and baking spice lead the nose. The palate delivers black cherry, raspberry compote and a hint of ground pepper while close-knit, fine-grained tannins grip the finish.",88,Montevetrano 2013 Core Aglianico (Campania)
"Simple and sweet, like a mango, pineapple and peach fruit juice blend. Not much going on, but will appeal to lots of Chard lovers at this price. Production was half a million cases.",83,Sterling 2008 Vintner's Collection Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"This has a traditional garnet color with a light rim. It smells a bit earthy and herbal and tastes rather lean, like rhubarb and sour-cherry candy. It's light to medium bodied, a bit quirky but enjoyable.",84,Cycles Gladiator 2013 Pinot Noir (California)
"Hot olallieberry jam, lava rocks and uncracked black peppercorn aromas decorate the nose on this blend of 45% Syrah, 24% Mourvèdre, 20% Grenache and 11% Tempranillo, about 90% of which is from the Paderewski VIneyard. It's jammy, juicy and meaty on the palate, a lip-smacking wine made interesting by a plum-skin tartness and pork stew richness.",93,Epoch Estate Wines 2012 Estate Red (Paso Robles)
"A blend of Nero d'Avola, Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon (in equal measure), this is soft and ripe, with black cherry, cassis, chocolate and toasted espresso-bean notes. The mouthfeel is rich and velvety, with a touch of berry-like sweetness.",90,Baglio del Cristo di Campobello 2011 C'D'C' Rosso Red (Sicilia)
"Nothing subtle about this big, ripe, oaky Chardonnay. It shows the tropical fruit richness of a fine Alexander Valley Chard, flamboyant in pineapple custard flavor, with a flinty minerality. The sweet overlay of smoky oak is perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume.",87,Dutcher Crossing 2006 Stuhlmuller Vineyard Chardonnay (Alexander Valley)
"Structured and alluring, this opens with yellow stone fruit, tomato vine and chopped herb aromas. The enveloping palate doles out juicy yellow peach, grapefruit and savory thyme notes while tangy acidity lends balance.",90,Russiz Superiore 2012 Riserva Sauvignon (Collio)
"Fruity and tannic, this has a dry character that dominates the red fruit underneath. It's full bodied, with a nervy edge of acidity and a smoky flavor that comes from having been aged in wood.",87,Vignerons de Buxy 2010 Buissonnier  (Mercurey)
"This is a good value for a sophisticated Merlot from Napa Valley. It's not an ager, but it's delightful now for its dryness, smooth tannins and complex cherry and red currant flavors with hints of herbs and sweet peas.",88,Parcel 41 2011 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"A spicy, earthy personality makes this wine unique, and it has a great sense of balance. It exudes cardamom, wood smoke and black pepper aromas, and the flavors follow with black plum and clove, accented by peppery spice.",89,Holly's Hill 2015 Estate Mourvèdre (El Dorado)
"There's a touch of smoke, ash or sulfur at the very beginning that never fully blows away. In the mouth, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah offers ripe cherry and blackberry flavors, with hints of black pepper and bitter almond.",85,Giorgio Meletti Cavallari 2009 Borgeri  (Bolgheri)
"This Syrah is heavy and minty, with plastic aromas. The palate is chunky and citrusy in feel, with little body. Flavors of clove, mint and berry lead to a resiny, almost fruitless finish.",82,Botalcura 2010 Litú Syrah (Central Valley)
"At first this profoundly compelling wine seems rather light, but as it pirouettes on a base of cherry and sassafras, it constantly shifts and sends up shafts of previously undetected flavors. Popcorn, saffron and just the faintest hint of barnyard emerge—suddenly it becomes a full-throttle cherry bomb that can best be described as yummy.",94,Elizabeth Chambers 2012 Freedom Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Made with organic grapes, this charming young red has a delightful fragrance of blue flowers and woodland berries. The zesty palate doles out crunchy red berry and a hint of white pepper accompanied by lively acidity.",87,Salcheto 2013  Chianti
"Give this lush, rich Syrah two or three years to soften and develop in the bottle. It's a very good wine, offering impressive blackberry, blueberry and cherry-pie filling flavors, wrapped into fine acids and tannins. But it's fresh and young and will get better. Better well into 2011.",90,Andrew Murray 2008 McGinley Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Solid, rich and ripe red raspberries and brambly berries are upfront on the nose of this attractive wine, with seductive tones of sweet oak and cured meat in the back. Medium in weight, with spicy, structured tannins and ample acidity, the oak is well-integrated into the plush fruit core.",90,Gérard Bertrand 2014 Syrah-Mourvèdre (Saint-Chinian)
"Floral scents of wisteria and hawthorn mingle with white stone-fruit aromas. On the creamy, rather sweet palate, bright acidity lifts green apple, white peach and candied lemon peel while a confectionery note wraps around the finish. It's polished, with a silky mousse.",89,Spagnol 2016 Domus-Picta Dry  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"The alcohol is high, giving the wine a peppery burn, but that's part of its charm. Without such ripeness, the wine wouldn't have the briary berry, sweet dried currant and leathery flavors. New oak, to the tune of 25%, adds an even richer layer of char. Quite an accomplishment. Drink with barbecue or big, hearty beef dishes.",92,Seghesio 2009 Zinfandel (Rockpile)
"Aromas of orange peel, ripe stone fruit and a leesy whiff of yeast lead the nose. Refermented in the bottle, the semisparkling palate offers yellow apple, citrus and a drop of acacia honey alongside bright acidity. It finishes dry and crisp.",88,Adami 2016 Sul Lievito Glera
Rich hints of juicy pear on the nose lead to an equally fruity palate. The pear notes and juiciness are boosted by slight sweetness that is held in check by lovely texture and clean freshness. The finish is off dry.,89,Jean-Baptiste Adam 2014 Les Natures Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Aged for more than two years in new oak, this 100% Cab bursts with smoky vanilla and char that currently dominate its underlying fruit. But it's likely that time in the bottle will meld everything together. The powerful black currant, black cherry, carob and tobacco flavors, wrapped into rich, soft tannins, suggest holding at least through 2008, and the wine should develop well for a decade.",92,Souverain 2004 Winemaker's Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"A sweet style of white Port, almost tawny in character, with nuts, acidity and old fruit flavors. Crystallized red fruits add an extra element. Drink by itself, or as long cocktail with tonic.",87,Rozes NV Porto White Reserva  (Port)
"This is one unusual wine. It's a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon with Tempranillo and Garnacha, but it smells like a root-based perfume mixed with herbs and tobacco. It's over the hill in feel and green and herbal in flavor, with a raisiny aftertaste.",82,Bodegas Medina 2005 Jaloco Red (Extremadura)
"Made entirely with Nero d'Avola, this opens with aromas of red berry and Mediterranean herb. The vibrant straightforward palate delivers red cherry, raspberry and baking spice alongside fresh acidity. Drink soon.",87,Fondo Antico 2014 Aprile Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"This fruit-driven wine lacks a touch of minerality but features admirably pure, focused notes of perfectly ripe apples, pineapple and citrus. It's a sweet, medium-bodied spätlese that's plump and succulent, delicious sipped on its own on a warm summer evening. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",90,Johann Haart 2006 Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Spätlese Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer)
"Crisp, spicy aromas of red fruits matched against oregano, basil and olive notes give this Cabernet a lot of character and points of interest. The palate is tight and well structured, while dark berry, spice, herb and chocolate flavors flow onto a toasty, minty, warm and tannic finish. This is a bit aggressive now; give it two years and drink through 2019.",92,Ochagavia 2011 Raices Nobles Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"From vineyards in both Alexander Valley and Bennett Valley, the grapes were fermented in French oak for eight months, a minority of it new. This is a medium-bodied, integrated wine rich in caramel apple and fresh-squeezed tangerine. Brisk and in balance, it finishes with a note of toasted almond.",90,Matanzas Creek 2013 Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"Here's a sweet white wine (the term Amabile refers to the high sugar content) that opens with compelling notes of honey, acacia flower, peach and yellow candy. It's hard to imagine what to pair it with: It could either go with fruit salad or salty crackers with cheese.",83,Bigi 2009 Amabile  (Orvieto Classico)
"Made from 70% Pinot Noir and 30% Chardonnay, then aged three years, this wine offers a copper-pink color followed by dry, firm acidity and highlights of cherry, cassis and grapefruit zest. A gentle nudge of nutmeg closes in on the finish, giving the wine a salty air and complex ending.",91,Iron Horse 2011 Wedding Cuvée Sparkling (Green Valley)
"Lemon zest, lime and melon aromas lead this elegant white blend. Zesty citrus and lush melon on the palate offers a refined character that is nonetheless fine for everyday enjoyment. The finish is expressive and slightly floral.",87,Estate Biblia Chora 2011 Ovilos White (Pangeon)
"An instantly enjoyable, balanced rosé. It's fresh, clean and full of red berry fruits, with a crisp finish. Drink now.",87,José Maria da Fonseca 2013 Periquita Rosé (Península de Setúbal)
"Foresty blackberry aromas come with a cola note and a dash of char. This feels full and rich, with wall-to-wall tannins. A mix of baked berry fruits and soy sauce flavors finishes with mild leather and lasting savory notes. Drink through 2022.",91,Taron 2011 Cepas Centenarias  (Rioja)
"This is soft, sweet and syrupy, with a cherry pie flavor.",82,Dahlia 2010 Reserve Pinot Noir (Monterey County)
"Coconut, black currant, toasted oak and grilled bell pepper lead the nose on this blend of Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. The polished, full-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, raspberry, licorice and espresso framed in silky tannins.",92,Tenuta di Biserno 2012 Biserno Red (Toscana)
"Expensive, yes, but it shows the drama and interest that a Joseph Phelps Cabernet predictably delivers. It's rich and ripe in blackberry, cherry, currant and oak flavors, with wonderful tannins and a dry finish. Best now.",92,Joseph Phelps 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Purple and black fruits spread across the midpalate, with herbal, tannic flavors from the Franc and floral highlights from the PV. There is a bit of a hole in the middle, and the tannins seem to hit a bit hard following that drop-off. It could be a phase, or it could be a failing.",88,Spring Valley Vineyard 2005 Uriah Red Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
The nose is all gardenia and pear enveloped by citrus. The crisp palate doesn't have a great deal of intensity but compensates with very pleasant flavors of pear drop and nettle. Enjoy with fish in a citrus sauce.,87,Bricco dei Guazzi 2007  Gavi di Gavi
"A bold, ripe, perfumed wine with Baga tannins and acidity, this is not a wine for easy drinking—demanding rich, oily or fatty foods instead. It's a great example of this notoriously fickle grape and is packed with spicy fruit. Drink from 2018.",90,Global Wines 2011 Encontro Baga (Bairrada)
This Champagne is soft and has some sweetness (although technically Brut). Ripe melon and pear fruits are cut with enough acidity to keep the wine fresh and fruity.,87,Canard-Duchêne NV Authentic Brut  (Champagne)
"A good buy in a Cabernet that's dry and elegant enough to pair with a great steak, chop or roast. It has classic blackberry, black currant, herb and cedar flavors, and is soft enough to drink now.",87,Wellington 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
This floral wine is bursting with notes of jasmine and honeysuckle backed by sweet fragrances of candied fruit and caramel. The wine is sweet and thick in the mouth but the well-dosed acidity keeps it from being cloying or too fat. It would pair well with slightly sweet foods such as honey glazed ham or lobster.,91,Bastianich 2005 Plus Tocai Friulano (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"A lacy spray of sweetness extends from start to finish on this fruity, fresh Kabinett. Fresh apple, pear and tangerine are honeyed and lip smacking, energized by a streak of lemonade acidity on the finish.",89,Peter Nicolay 2014 Graacher Himmelreich Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"A dense bouquet of dark cherries, plum, earth, meat and subtle tobacco pulls you in. It is big in the mouth, yet never brutish, with lovely depth of fruit flavor, earthy accents and great texture. The fine, long finish has even, dry tannins. Seductively accessible, this world class wine will age well for 6–12 years or longer.",93,Almaviva 1998 Red (Puente Alto)
"This dry, light-footed Riesling offers savory notes of bruised apple and walnut skin. It's refreshingly breezy on the palate with streaks of lemon acidity, and finishes crisp and clean.",86,Silver Thread 2013 STV Estate Vineyard Riesling (Seneca Lake)
86-88 Intense wood aromas that are translated through to the palate. This is all smoky plank and structure.,87,Château Fonréaud 2010 Barrel sample  (Listrac-Médoc)
"Simple and earthy, this ranch-designate shows a wealth of brick color and flavors of cherry cola, raspberry and bay, its full-bodied ripeness offset moderately by acidity.",87,Laird 2014 Phantom Ranch Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"Dark berry, rose petal, tilled soil, aromatic herb, leather and a whiff of game are just some of the aromas you'll find on this intense, full-bodied wine. The palate is still tight, showing wild cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, baking spice and tobacco alongside firm tannins that need time to unwind. It already has depth but will develop even more complexity over the next decade and more. Drink 2018–2027.",93,Cascina delle Rose 2012 Rio Sordo  (Barbaresco)
"With 90% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc, this is an unusual blend for a Haut-Médoc wine. The result is a wine that's light and already soft. Fresh red-berry flavors are lightly underlined by tannins. It will develop fast, so drink from 2017.",86,Château Reysson 2013  Haut-Médoc
"A restrained hint of earthiness does not forebode the intense lime and grapefruit-like freshness on the palate of this slender, fresh and yet concentrated wine. The finish lingers and is whistle-clean.",89,Wohlmuth 2014 Klassik Sauvignon (Südsteiermark)
"A blend of Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, this opens with aromas of black plum, tilled soil and a hint of underbrush. The palate offers dark berry, tobacco and a hint of espresso alongside firm tannins.",88,Nottola 2010 Il Fattore  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano)
"Quite a good Chardonnay for the price. Shows classic flavors of pineapples, pears and apples, enriched with smoky oak and vanilla, and folded into a creamy texture. Good value, and easy to find, with 7,800 cases produced.",89,Guenoc 2007 Chardonnay (Lake County)
"Shows the crisp acidity that usually marks Carneros Chards, and also an earthy, freshly picked herb quality to the jammy peach, pineapple and green apple flavors. Consider it a food-worthy Chardonnay. Drink now.",87,Schug 2006 Chardonnay (Carneros)
"This bright Dolcetto d'Alba offers fresh fruit and berry flavors on top of rich concentration and a plush, velvety feel. This is a very easy, uncomplicated wine that will pair with most home-cooked pasta dishes.",87,E. Pira e Figli (Chiara Boschis) 2009  Dolcetto d'Alba
"Three quarters Sauvignon Blanc and the rest Sémillon, this attractive white wine has an appealing snap to the fruit and an underlying acidity that sets it up in lively fashion. It's a food wine through and through, lightly toasty, with green berries and apples providing the clean fruit flavors. A fine value.",89,Davenport Cellars 2009 Snowflake White Wine White (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Clean Asian pear, wet gravel and lime peel aromas show on the tightly wound nose of this bottling. The palate is quite delicate at first, offering lightly seared white peach, chalk and lime zest notes, but grows increasingly savory and delicious as it opens, indicating great cellar potential. Drink 2018–2030.",93,Chanin 2015 Los Alamos Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County)
"Vanilla, baking spice, herb, plum and cherry aromas are followed by supersmooth, creamy feeling plum and barrel flavors in this Cabernet. Caramel and vanilla notes linger on the finish, and while the oak influence is heavy, it largely works.",88,Waterbrook 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"An aromatic mélange of lemon custard, apple pie and salted caramel intrigue your nose while crisp flavors of lemon rind, citrus zest and grapefruit delight your palate. Pair this wine with freshly shucked oysters on a warm summer's day.",90,Kozlović 2012 Malvazija Malvasia (Istria)
Aromas of Bosc pear and candle wax lead to off-dry fruit flavors. It brings some easy-drinking appeal but lacks a sense of clarity.,85,14 Hands 2015 Hot to Trot White (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is the top wine from Château Minuty. The Grenache (95%) and Syrah (5%) blend is harvested and sorted by hand. It combines the Provençal charm with some weight and a serious purpose. It is rich, full in the mouth, packed with red berry fruits and balanced acidity. The aftertaste brings out a lightly tannic texture. Drink from late 2015.",92,Château Minuty 2014 Rose et Or Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This opens with aromas of toast, hazelnut and a whiff of adhesive bandage. The raw rather bitter palate shows unripe sour cherry, strawberry and a medicinal note alongside vivacious—almost harsh—bubbles and marked acidity.",85,Tenuta Mazzolino 2011 Cruasé Rosé Brut Metodo Classico Pinot Nero (Oltrepò Pavese)
"This modern interpretation of Dolcetto opens with plush, meaty tones of black cherry and blueberry backed by power and concentration. The finish is short, clean and tight.",86,Clavesana 2010 You d'Oh Something to Me Dolcetto (Piedmont)
"Hints of soy and pepper color the generously ripe notions of yellow pear and red apple on the nose. The palate reinforces the spiciness with more shimmering white pepper and the ripeness with extra juiciness. This is rounded but fresh, and just so full of sunny friendly fruit. The appetizing and moreish finish returns to that initial soy-like spice.",93,Malat 2015 Höhlgraben Reserve Alte Reben Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"Atypical on the nose, as air freshener, berry jelly and exotic but odd aromas take over. The palate seems superficial and wholly unusual, with floral blueberry flavors and then an angular, floral finish. Not terrible but doesn't seem much like Cabernet.",84,Argento 2008 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
This is an easygoing fruity wine. It has soft tannins and bright juicy red fruits. The structure is just right to give the wine its shape along with the acidity and generous aftertaste. Drink now.,85,Georges Vigouroux 2015 Le Temps des Vendanges Malbec-Merlot
"The Lapa vineyards are away from the Tagus (Tejo) river giving better structured soil and therefore firmer wines. That shows in this ripe wine with its tannins and bold fruits. It is attractively fruity, with a dry core. The wine is ready to drink.",86,Quinta da Lapa 2014 Selection Red (Tejo)
"Jammy, ripe blueberry and blackberry aromas belie a crisp, tight palate, with wild berry, licorice and peppery flavors. This is fresh, wiry, firmly structured and alert as well as comfortable and controlled. Think classic Priorat to drink through 2018.",91,Cellers Unió 2009 Roureda Llicorella Gran Selecció Vitis 60 Red (Priorat)
"This rosé, made from Cinsault and Syrah, offers assertive aromas of garrigue herbs—think rosemary and thyme—alongside fruity tones of minty cherry, strawberry and raspberry. The mouthfeel is light and fresh, with the mentholated character dominating the red berry core. Drink now.",87,Domaine Sainte-Eugénie 2014 Rosé (Corbières)
"Tropical aromas arise from the bouquet of this unoaked new Chardonnay, and there's some pineapple and lemon-lime thrown in. Flavors of apple sauce, cinnamon and lime juice are sweet and tasty, while the mouthfeel is simple and fleshy. Drink now for the wine's youthful jump.",84,Finca Sophenia 2008 Altosur Chardonnay (Tupungato)
"This is a hugely rich wine with great black-plum fruit flavors. It's powerfully concentrated, densely tannic, solid and chunky.",93,Le Carré 2010  Saint-Émilion
"This opens with aromas that recall white flower, orchard fruit and a light medicinal note. The lean, rather diluted palate offers apple skin, mineral and a hint of bitter almond alongside brisk acidity.",85,Subida di Monte 2014 Friulano (Collio)
"This is a well-balanced and rich wine, with its tannins and acids giving it a sense of structure. With its black cherry and plum skin flavors, this is firm and smooth.",87,Domaine Dupré 2011 Haute Ronze  (Régnié)
"Off-dry and direct in citrus, apricot, green apple and honey flavors, this easy-drinking wine is refreshed with crisp acidity. Good now as a cocktail sipper.",85,Luna 2009 Pinot Grigio (Napa Valley)
"Although based in Cahors, Château Famaey uses this looser Côtes du Lot appellation for this easy, fresh and fruity wine. It has ripe berry fruits with a light touch of acidity and tannin. Drink now.",85,Château Famaey 2013 Chevalier Famaey Malbec (Côtes du Lot)
"Typical earthy Zweigelt flavors join great plum juice fruit and acidity. The wine is ripe, packed with fruit and soft tannins, ready to drink. Screwcap. Private Reserve.",86,Dürnberg 2009 Ried Rüsselgarten Select Zweigelt (Niederösterreich)
"This wine is a standout, with seasoned, full-bodied layers of peppercorn, clove, cinnamon and jammy plum, balanced in weight and length, with just a hint of sanguine character. While it plays the savory card successfully, it dabbles judiciously in dark chocolate, too, finishing like a chocolate kiss.",92,Joseph Carr 2012 Merlot (Rutherford)
"Blackberry and slightly green, herbal aromas start it off, and while the flavors maintain that herbal, green-tobacco core, there's enough body, blackberry and oaky coffee and mocha notes to make it a nice wine. Needs more clarity of fruit, cleanliness and purity to reach the peak, but still good as is.",87,Cinco Sentidos 2005 Reserva Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Spine-tingling acidity cuts a fine edge through this buoyantly fruity but nuanced wine. The palate is lip-smackingly sweet-tart, bursting of ripe raspberry and yellow cherry flavors that stretch out a long, spicy finish. Drink now through 2020.",92,Dr. Loosen 2014 Ürziger Würzgarten Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"This is a pleasant red wine from Piedmont in northern Italy made with Nebbiolo and Vespolina grapes for a clean delivery of berry, spice and cola aromas. The wine is tonic and fresh in the mouth with clean acidity and playful bite of exotic spice on the close.",88,Dessilani 2005 Lochera  (Fara)
"This is an attractive, soft, fresh wine, with concentration and structure, as well as a light, rounded aftertaste.",84,Santa Margherita 2002 Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
"Four qualities distinguish this Barbera. It's bone dry, high in acidity, rigidly tannic and rich in cherries. By itself, it's rustic and old-fashioned. But it's the kind of wine the oldtimers drank with the cheese, meat, bread and sauce, and so should you. Like any respectable Barbera, it will age for decades, softening and sweetening without necessarily gaining complexity.",87,"Eberle 2010 Steinbeck Vineyard 48%, Kokopelli Vineyard 43%, Partridge Vineyard 9% Barbera (Paso Robles)"
"Canned peach, banana and lilting white-flower aromas show some good concentration on the nose. The palate is playful and textured, with a pop of tropical fruit on the entry and more florals on the midpalate. A peach-fuzz texture tingles on the close.",87,Spicewood 2014 Viognier (Texas High Plains)
"The standout fruit flavors are melon and grapefruit, with a backing of wet stone and spice. It's a refreshing style, and a useful white-wine choice for shellfish and other white fish or simple poultry dishes.",88,South Stage 2014 Pinot Blanc (Rogue Valley)
"A touch tough and stemmy on the nose, but given the price it rates as positive. The body is medium and friendly, while the flavors of raspberry and strawberry feature a peppery accent. Finishes crisp and fresh.",84,Zarpado 2009 Malbec (Mendoza)
"A blend of roughly equal parts Mourvèdre and Syrah, this does not offer much in the way of fruit; there's an emptiness to the midpalate. It's a difficult wine to get a handle on, even after breathing time. Perhaps more bottle age will open it up.",85,Convergence Zone 2010 Virga Red Red (Red Mountain)
"This opens with inky, dark concentration and offers many of the beautiful aromas associated with the Cabernet family of grapes: Dark berry, prune, dried spice and chocolate. It delivers impressive intensity and persistency, with well-formed tannins and mocha softness on the finish.",93,Tenuta di Biserno 2008 Il Pino di Biserno Red (Toscana)
"Equal parts Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this is a powerfully rich wine based on the 1998 and 1997 vintage. It is full, packed with citrus, peach and apricot flavors mingling with a beautiful, generous creamy texture. This is a glorious Champagne, a worthy homage to Louis Tarlant who pioneered the family's Champagne in the early 20th century.",94,Tarlant NV Hommage à Louis Tarlant Brut  (Champagne)
"Dusty gritty citrus aromas are briny and piercing. This feels honest and solid, but cutting. Grassy flavors blend with lean citrus notes prior to a basic short finish.",86,Viña Casablanca 2016 Cefiro Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"A tangy, zesty wine with a strongly mineral texture, this is fruity and fresh. It's full of green plum, herbal and gooseberry flavors. With its texture and structure, it needs to age, so drink from 2017.",87,Philippe Girard 2014  Sancerre
"Prius is a bright rosé from Sardinia that offers fun aromas of myrtle berry, chopped herb, bramble and savory spice. It's a crisp, silky wine that would pair with Thai or Indian dishes.",87,Tenute Soletta 2010 Prius Rosé (Isola dei Nuraghi)
"A pleasing, well-crafted Riesling in a lighter, elegant mode, this brings a delicate stone-fruit flavor into a mix of mineral and breakfast tea highlights. The moderate alcohol makes it an ideal summer sipper.",88,Jones of Washington 2011 Estate Vineyards Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Tahbilk, one of Australia's historic wineries, has turned out a velvety-textured Shiraz named for one of the company's long-time winemakers. This is a medium-bodied, yet velvety-soft Shiraz that boasts plenty of intensity. If its blackberry, licorice and vanilla flavors develop more complexity over the next few years, the 89 rating may seem stingy.",89,Tahbilk 2002 Eric Stevens Purbrick Shiraz (Nagambie Lakes)
"Hailing from the winery's Minnick Estate Vineyard, this is an aromatic Riesling with notes of orange peel, ripe peaches, and jasmine. While listed at less than 10 g/L residual sugar, it tastes a good  bit sweeter, but the acid keeps the sugar in check.",88,Willow Crest 2011 Estate Grown Riesling (Yakima Valley)
"Meaty aromas lead on the nose of this wine, with additional supporting notes of red cherry, black pepper and curing spice. It's easy on the palate, with medium yet fleeting tannins and balanced alcohol. The finish is fully loaded with spice, ending quite peppery.",87,Les Vignerons de Tautavel Vingrau 2010 Roc Gris Red (Côtes du Roussillon Villages)
"This Merlot tastes hotter than than its official alcohol. A jalapeño pepper heat seems to accentuate the ripeness, so that raisins and prunes star. It's a robust, somewhat rustic wine of limited ageability, but it will pair well with strongly flavored, spicy beef stews and barbecue.",86,Phipps 2010 Heller Vineyard Merlot (Sonoma County)
"The wood and toasty character of this mature Port is just right. It has a fine balance between its old gold flavors and the spirit, giving an intense, concentrated character. Hints of fruitiness are still, just there. The aftertaste, rich and dry, lingers on and on.",90,Poças NV 20-Years-Old Tawny  (Port)
"Tart and herbal in sage, this is a densely concentrated wine that wraps its head around black cherry, cranberry, pomegranate and black tea. A note of freshly baked bread pokes through on the nose and within the fruitier, savory flavors.",91,Baldassari Family Wines 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This opens with aromas of underbrush, leather, berry and a balsamic note. The forward palate offers dried cherry, white pepper, tobacco and the warmth of alcohol alongside firm tannins. Drink this sooner rather than later.",90,Comm. G. B. Burlotto 2011 Acclivi  (Barolo)
"Dominated by the Trincadeira and Aragonez grapes, this is a super-smooth, ripe wine from northeast Alentejo. Oak aging has rounded out the tannins, with generous red fruit driving the palate. Already completely integrated, this wine needs no further aging to be pleasantly enjoyed.",90,Monte da Penha 2009 Reserva Red (Alentejano)
"Melon and tropical fruit aromas are restrained. This Elqui Viognier feels plump but also a bit dilute in the middle, with a mildly tannic sense of grape skins. Melon and citrus flavors are good, while this feels a bit yeasty and plump on the finish.",86,Falernia 2015 Reserva Viognier (Elqui Valley)
"Lightly scented, this linear white opens with aromas of orchard fruit and wildflower. The lithe, elegant palate delivers crisp green apple, pear and flinty mineral while racy acidity provides plenty of verve and freshness.",88,Castelfeder 2014 Vom Stein Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
"Mature berry, dark cooking spice and blue flower are some of the aromas that emerge on this firm red. On the palate, ground pepper, clove and licorice accent a black cherry core while brisk acidity provides the racy framework.",89,Comm. G. B. Burlotto 2013 Aves  (Barbera d'Alba)
"Smoke, cedar and plum aromas are followed by a focused palate of pepper and berry flavors. Poised and sophisticated, this wine is great for fans of drier style reds.",89,Semeli 2004 Grande Reserve Agiorgitiko (Nemea)
"Taut and zesty, lip-smacking and dry: this Riesling is a successful combination of grapefruit and lemon, of zest and flesh. The dry finish makes the lemony qualities of this dry wine even more appealing. Serve this on a hot day.",91,Paul Blanck 2014 Rosenbourg Riesling (Alsace)
"A sharply defined, racy Viognier, this cuts right through with a mix of pine needle, citrus rind and pineapple. It should be served chilled and would be a fine accompaniment to grilled prawns, spicy noodles or anything with jalapeños.",87,Valley View 2006 Anna Maria Viognier (Rogue Valley)
"It's incredibly rich and ripe in blackberries, black currants and dark chocolate, with a lovely veneer of toasted oak. The tannins are super smooth. Drink now–2020.",93,Silenus 2010 Estate Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Taut and edgy, very steely in character, with almost an austere character in its youth. Its fruits are definitely on the citrus side of the spectrum, crisp yet rich as well. The acidity shoots right through the wine.",93,Simonnet-Febvre 2008 Blanchots  (Chablis)
"A solid, earthy, dusty, lightly leathery Cabernet Sauvignon. Though perhaps not technically perfect, it captures the palate imagination with texture and detail, and a light touch which keeps the alcohol around 14% and the tannins proportionate. No massive new oak here either, though the (virtually impossible to read) back label notes that it was made in 100% French oak, half of it new.",90,Robert Ramsay 2007 Upland Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley)
"It is lemon that constitutes the beginning, middle and end of this alluring wine. The first bright freshness flashes on the nose. The absolutely dry palate then becomes enveloped in the incisive, bright and invigorating fruit and zest of ripe lemon, providing direction and litheness. The finish is moreish and lip-smacking with the zesty freshness. You simply want more. Drink 2017–2027.",93,Willm 2014 Kirchberg de Barr Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"This estate-grown, single-vineyard Pinot Blanc is succulent, tart and tangy, with lightly spicy citrus, kiwi and starfruit flavors. The lingering finish, lightly flecked with dried herbs, shows amazing grip and texture, with a mineral ridge across the mid palate. Great elegance and length.",92,Ponzi 2011 Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley)
"Robust on the bouquet, with ample red berry fruit and vanilla. The palate has a deep, layered feel and flavors of plum, berry and peppery spice. A tight blend of Carignan, Garnacha and Syrah that's forward and wiry, with power in reserve. Drink now through 2015.",89,Besllum 2008 Red (Montsant)
"Made with 80% Chardonnay and 20% Friulano, this amber-colored wine boasts more fruit richness than many other wines from the orange wine movement. Loaded with ripe apricot, candied citrus zest, dried herbs and crushed stone, this is brightened by lively acidity on the palate. A perfect introduction to the genre; Drink now–2016.",91,Radikon 2012 Slatnik White (Venezia Giulia)
"A crazy-good combo of lavender, espresso and baking spice flavors make this full-bodied wine fascinating to taste. It's deeply colored, aromatic and tannic, but not heavy. The wine has a vivid stamp of spicy oak, with enough lavish blackberry and black cherry behind it for balance.",91,Skinner 2013 Syrah (El Dorado)
"Condensed up front, with aromas of berry compote and molasses. So why is this so tangy and tart in the mouth? Maybe the grapes weren't as ripe as they seem from the nose, and in the end it fails the all-important balance/wholesomeness test.",83,Hemar 2006 Joven  (Ribera del Duero)
"This The wine from a monopole vineyard shows the intense acidity of the vintage yet also bursts with red berry fruit, underlined with firm tannins. Drink now, or better yet, from 2018.",90,Domaine Jeannin-Naltet 2014 Clos les Grands Voyens Premier Cru  (Mercurey)
"Dusty apple and peach aromas are mostly pleasant. Chunky and pulpy in feel, this basic Chardonnay tastes of melon and peach. A dry fleshy finish includes a sprinkle of saltiness. Drink now.",87,Finca Sophenia 2015 Reserve Chardonnay (Tupungato)
"This wine smells fruity, like raspberry and cranberries, and turns very tart and astringent on the palate. Sharp fruit flavors come out on the finish along with a metallic edge.",84,Los Portales 2013 Garnacha (Shenandoah Valley (CA))
"A hint of lemon balm lends a fresh, herbaceous character to concentrated pineapple, honey and preserved peach flavors. It's sweet with fruit, but balanced with bright citrus acidity and a sprightly mouthfeel.",91,Dr. Loosen 2011 Ürziger Würzgarten Spätlese Riesling (Mosel)
"A fruit-driven Cabernet, with cheerful, bright cherry-berry flavors. Tannins are firm but ripe, accenting the cassis-tinged close with a slightly dusty texture.",87,Rosedale Wines 2009 Cat Amongst the Pigeons Cat Walk Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa)
"There's a rainbow of peppercorns represented on the nose of this varietally classic wine, with a tiny bit of pasilla chile greenness cutting across strawberry and cherry fruit. Those red fruits join with blueberry on the palate, which is complex with pipe tobacco, tomato leaf and herbal, peppery spices.",90,Sculpterra 2011 Cabernet Franc (Paso Robles)
"Concentrated and jammy smelling, with a note of iodine to go with racy black fruit aromas. Dense as night in the mouth, with gamey, roasted berry flavors. Turns minty on the finish, with a hint of herbal green. Fruity and nice but lacks that final gear.",88,Bodega Noemía de Patagonia 2010 A Lisa Malbec (Patagonia)
"This is a classic Bordeaux-style white wine with its cool herbal character and light perfume from the Muscadelle in the blend. The wine has no oak aging, just ripe fruit that has citrus, pineapple and green fruit flavors. Drink now.",87,Château Bélingard 2015 Bélingard White (Bergerac Sec)
"Exuberant aromas of botrytis, lime zest and flowers are followed by suggestions of stone fruit. It tingles the palate with lighter-weight fruit flavors that display a good sense of balance that keeps the interest high.",89,Chateau Ste. Michelle & Dr. Loosen 2014 Eroica Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A delicate, almost fragile wine, this opens with tart fruit flavors of strawberry and red plum. There's more than enough acidity, smooth tannins, and a graceful flow to the wine, ending with a light dusting of cocoa.",88,Siduri 2012 Arbre Vert Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This is ripe and floral, with intense acidity under the sweet, honeyed surface. Its dry core of botrytis is controlled by acidity and citrus flavors. Still developing and still young, it needs to age for many years. Drink from 2024.",95,Château de Malle 2014  Sauternes
"Vanilla, cherry, cedar, pipe smoke and violet extracts swirl into a rather amazing nose on this wine from the Gallo-owned producer. The black cherry-dominated palate is lifted by baking soda minerality, and the tannins are present but not intrusive.",89,Bridlewood 2012 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
"Smooth, dry and full bodied, this subtly floral wine has a rich texture that soothes and coats the mouth. It should make a nice pairing with everything from spicy Asian or Latin American cuisine to sausages and sauerkraut. It smells like roses, tastes like pink grapefruit with a dash of kiwi, and has a long finish.",89,Clif Family 2013 Gewürztraminer (Mendocino)
"Rich flavors of cherries, persimmons, cola, anise and oak flood the mouth with immediate deliciousness. Bright Russian River acidity provides fortunate balance. It's delicious now, but young; this has the balance to develop nicely, so give it 6–7 years.",90,Russian River Vineyards 2009 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Alluring Nebbiolo aromas of dark berry, purple flower, baking spice, truffle and herb slowly unfold in this wine. The savory, succulent palate doles out Marasca cherry, raspberry compote, cinnamon and licorice flavors against a backdrop of firm, refined tannins and bright acidity.",92,Cascina Luisin 2014 Asili  (Barbaresco)
"Nearly dry, this is a full-bodied, slightly creamy-textured Pinot Gris. It's a bit shy on the nose, offering only modest melon and citrus notes, then closes with hints of nuts and spice. Drink now.",86,Mt. Difficulty 2009 Pinot Gris (Central Otago)
"There's a concentrated forest floor funk to the nose of this intriguing blend of 58% Grenache, 21% Syrah and 21% Carignane, as well as sweet root vegetable, blueberry, black plum and dried beef aromas. The palate is very wound up in a reductive, tarry tensions, with elderberry fruit and incense oil flavors. Needs some time to unfurl.",88,Kitá 2013 Spe'y Camp 4 Vineyard Red (Santa Ynez Valley)
"The nose is sulphuric and a bit barnyardy, which screams“watch out,” but in the mouth there's acceptable if unspectacular apple fruit. It's scratchy in the finish, and probably just this side of not being worth drinking.",80,Santa Alicia 2001 Estate Chardonnay (Maipo Valley)
"This shows brisk, mouthwatering Central Coast acidity, which brightens the slightly sweet lemon and lime flavors.",84,Robert Mondavi 2011 Private Selection Pinot Grigio (Central Coast)
"With 4.5% residual sugar, this Riesling falls into the shadowy realm between an off-dry table wine and a dessert wine. You could have it with trout almondine or with a fruit tart. Either way, it's crisp in acidity, with complex flavors of Meyer lemons, limes, pineapples, peaches, pears, buttercup flowers, honey and cinnamon spice. It's also a good buy.",87,Maddalena 2007 Riesling (Monterey)
"Notes of yellow mirabelle plum compote make for a fruit-laden opening. The purity of that ripe, soft mirabelle fruit pervades the entire palate and also providesthe natural, enlivening freshness that illuminates a more citric edge. This is full of joyous fruit and just off-dry.",89,Klipfel 2013 Clos Zisser Kirchberg de Barr Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"The Daou brothers have become increasingly known for their rich, unctuous and lavish high-end wines, but this bottling offers a taste of that opulence for just $30. Plump blueberry and soft, cedar-like spice scents show on the nose, while the palate bursts with black cherry, dark chocolate and caramel flavors, powered by ample acidity. It will age gracefully, but is already delicious.",93,Daou 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Strikes a nice balance of ripe berry and chocolate flavors, firmed with softly smooth tannins, and a deep earthy-spiciness suggesting sweet tobacco, anise and sage. Turns lush and intricate toward the finish. This is a really nice Zinfandel.",90,Hobo 2007 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"Full of ripe tropical fruits, this is rich and opulent. Apricot, mango and peach all feature along with spice from wood aging. All this ripe fruit is balanced by fresher acidity. It's a powerful wine touched with pepper, full in the mouth and packed with fruit and toast. Drink from 2015.",89,Herdade Grande 2012 Reserva Branco White (Alentejano)
"While a bit lean in concentration, yellow apple, pear and lemon are pristine and ripe on the nose and palate. The mouthfeel is a bit broad and flat but finishes briskly. Drink now.",86,Sherwood House Vineyards 2016 Oregon Road Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island)
"Aromas of mature berry, menthol, coffee bean, toast and dark cooking spice emerge on this bracing wine. The firmly structured palate delivers dried black cherry, espresso, French oak, licorice, chopped herb and tobacco set against bracing, close-grained tannins and the warmth of alcohol. The tannins will need years to unwind.",90,Ceretto 2011 Prapò  (Barolo)
"Young and visibly spritzy, this appealing wine bursts forth with scents of lemon tea and orange blossoms, followed by flavors of orange soda, candied pineapple and stone fruits. It's round and fruity, definitely sweet, but kept lively with plenty of acid and that tongue-tickling spritz.",90,Chehalem 2015 Ridgecrest Vineyards Sext Riesling (Ribbon Ridge)
"A tad cloying on the nose with pungent orange-flavored tea, bruised apple and billowing florals, this bright lemon yellow Viognier is broad and full bodied with lots of fresh orange and lemon peel notes and a hint of spice.",84,North Gate 2008 Viognier (Virginia)
"Ripe and full of fruit, the wine also has a firmer tannic structure that gives concentration. The rich cherry and red plum fruits show strongly through the drier core, adding their rounded feel and contrasting with the acidity that comes through at the end.",87,Château de Pizay 2013 Château de Saint Lager  (Brouilly)
"This serious red blend puts together a texture firmed up with gripping tannins and acidity, flavors brimming with blackberry and sweet spices and a lingering finish. Too structured to appreciate alone, it will need pairing with roast beef, lasagna, ribs or the like.",88,Kendall-Jackson 2012 Vintners Reserve Summation Red (California)
"Wheat grass and hot peppers make for an intriguing if odd bouquet. A fair amount of vegetal flavor carries onto the palate—mostly green beans and some pickle. Fortunately, there is also a light tropical fruit background to the flavor profile, something reminiscent of papaya. Ultimately, however, this wine is characterized more by its vegetal character than bright, clean fruit.",86,Dry Creek Vineyard 2000 Limited Edition DCVIII Fumé Blanc (Dry Creek Valley)
"Right now, this feels like a compact parcel of closely packed fruit flavors, held tight by citric freshness and yet it offering glimpses of what is to come: there is a hint of yeasty savor, but also a textural element reminiscent of apple peel. The citrus notions are promises of tart grapefruit, tangy orange, ripe tangerine and the purest lemon. There is something definite and astute that stands with an absolutely straight backbone, just waiting for its time to arrive. It will be spectacular. Drink from 2019.",96,Bründlmayer 2014 Heiligenstein Lyra Reserve Riesling (Kamptal)
"Always an elegant wine, the Aragonez shows its beautiful smooth fruit, flavors of blueberries with leathery tannins and fine acidity. With its structure it could age, but there's no need to wait.",89,Cortes de Cima 2007 Aragonez Red (Alentejano)
"Divus is a bold, earthy expression of Montepulciano with ripe aromas of forest fruit and red cherry, followed by spice and black peppercorn. There's a touch of cherry sourness and bitterness on the finish as well.",87,Ciavolich Giuseppe 2008 Divus  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo)
"From vines that were 171 years old when the grapes for this wine were harvested, this is packed with dark berry fruit, then layered with vanilla, cedar and mint. It's full, plush and warm, just too big, intense and bulky for current consumption. Best from 2020–2030.",93,Langmeil 2014 The Freedom 1843 Shiraz (Barossa)
"Big and purple, with sweet aromas. But the palate is very uneven, with acute acidity that scours and turns the plum and grape flavors sour. Grabby mouthfeel as well, with clamp.",80,Santa Julia 2007 Merlot (Mendoza)
"This cuvée offers a classic mix of rose petals, black cherry and cola. It's lively, fruity and light on its feet. Delicate touches of herb, pinpoint acidity, a hint of lime and perfect balance keep it satisfying through an extended finish.",91,Sokol Blosser 2010 Dundee Hills Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"In this opulent, full-bodied wine, mango and other tropical fruits give a smooth, creamy character that is just lightly spiced by wood. Drink this rich wine now.",90,Loron et Fils 2015 Domaine des Sanson  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
"This finely wood-aged wine is rich and packed with ripe toast and generous fruit flavors. Its balanced combination of intense acidity, tangy citrus and apple flavors are supported by the spice from the wood aging. It is a generous wine, still young and best from 2016.",90,Vinha Paz 2015 Reserva White (Dão)
"Leafy red-berry aromas come with a note of olive. This wine feels lean and searing, with edgy tannins and high acidity. Spicy flavors of herbal plum and tomato finish with a dusting of baking spices.",85,Apaltagua 2015 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Apalta)
"Rothrock Vineyard provides the fruit for this wine that was fermented and aged in neutral French oak. The aromas are light, with notes of herb, chamomile, green apple and spice. It's medium bodied, backed by vibrant acidity that carries through the finish.",89,Lauren Ashton Cellars 2016 Chenin Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This has fresh citrus and dried apricot flavors, with Grüner's typical peppery edge. For drinking now. Screwcap.",86,Höpler 2011 Grüner Veltliner (Burgenland)
"The dark garnet color seems right for a wine that smells like black cherries and black-skinned plums, and tastes deep and rich. Both the flavors and the texture seem shaped by subtly spicy oak. Fine-grained tannins add a velvety touch and the finish lingers.",91,Saxon Brown 2012 Durell Vineyard Hayfield Block Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Firm with tannins, this is a dry wine. Its tough structure dominates the berry fruit, needing time to balance out. Drink from 2018.",84,Château Guitar 2015  Bordeaux
"Freesia and tangerine rind scent this bright, aromatic wine. It's dry in style, yet luscious and ripe, streaked with tones of honey tangerines and peach. Bristling lime acidity lends cut and vibe to the finish.",92,Prinz Salm 2012 Kirchberg Bingen Trocken GG Riesling (Rheinhessen)
"Savory on the nose with enough sweet blueberry to make it varietally enticing, this light purplish Syrah is well-balanced, pleasing and well-made, ready to drink now with a range of foods, its alcohol in proportion and acidity right on target. Wente blends in small percentages of Counoise, Petite Sirah, Mourvèdre and Tempranillo into this great-value Syrah. Delicious.",88,Wente 2008 Shorthorn Canyon Syrah (Livermore Valley)
"Here's a hot, jammy Primitivo that has all the heat of the Southern Italian sun locked within. The wine boasts luscious dark concentration and a sweet, syrupy nose with spice, oak and tobacco. You can feel the heat in the mouth and the wine is soft and incredibly chewy to the touch. If you love big and bold wines, this is for you.",87,Giordano 2007 Alberello Cinquanta  (Primitivo di Manduria)
"This Cabernet Sauvignon blend is very young and ready to drink with its sweet fruit and forward, vanilla-laced flavors. It fades quickly, leaving a lingering impression of soda pop (root beer).",87,Owen Roe 2012 Sharecropper's Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Big and fruity, this wine is broad but without great definition. It offers weight, soft apple fruits and light acidity. Drink now.",85,Georges Duboeuf 2012  Saint-Véran
"Delicate toast and smoke accent pretty apple blossom and pear notes on this delicate, supple Chardonnay. Judiciously oaked, the palate showcases sweet-cream butter and fresh yellow-cherry flavors that linger long on the finish.",88,Thirsty Owl Wine Company 2013 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"This massive, explosive Chardonnay is marked by extremely ripe pineapple, pear and peach fruit, accented with lots of sweet, caramelized oak. It's a potent, high alcohol wine whose buttered popcorn flavors are complex by crisp acidity and minerals. A bit obvious, but a fine example of its style.",92,Sbragia 2007 Gamble Ranch Vineyard Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"At first this muscular wine feels tight, even stiff, with crisply defined plum and cassis fruit. The only knock on it is the drying tannins, which leave a chalky aftertaste. Pair with a juicy cut of pork or salmon.",88,Three Rivers 2011 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A light and fruity wine that is ready to drink. From the heart of the Entre-deux-Mers region, it has red berry fruits and juicy acidity. A greener, herbal character in the background suggests grapes that weren't totally ripe at harvest.",83,Château de Crain 2012  Bordeaux
"Sweet black fruit aromas come with notes of animal hide, brown sugar, prune and fern. Feels good but a touch scratchy and acidic, with dark spice, ample barrel influence, vanilla and blackberry flavors. Tastes minty and fades quickly on the finish.",87,Filus 2009 Reserve Malbec (Uco Valley)
"This ripe wine has rich black fruits, a smoky character and a rounded, full-bodied texture. The old vines bring concentration, while the acidity gives freshness and drinkability now.",88,Domaine du Vissoux 2014 Cuvée Traditionelle Vieilles Vignes  (Beaujolais)
"For once, I wasn't able to pick this wine out as a Tardieu-Laurent. The oak is reined in, leaving the focus on plummy yet savory notes of coffee and black olive, mint, clove, licorice and chocolate liqueur. It's full-bodied, firm and intense, with a long finish framed by dusty but ripe tannins. Drink now–2025+.",93,Tardieu-Laurent 2013 Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape)
"This is a powerful wine, almost too powerful for its own good, with forward citrus, tropical fruit and vanilla-oak flavors.",86,Pride Mountain 2010 Viognier (Sonoma County)
"Cherry cordial rises to the fore of this rich, thick and full-bodied red blended with 25% Syrah. Velvety in texture, it offers a wealth of meat, dust and chocolate flavors.",90,Ideology 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"The chilly vintage has given this wine a toughness of tannins and acids that makes it difficult to appreciate now. And the toasty, sweet oak has not meshed yet with the fruit, which is rich in black currants and cassis liqueur. All signs point to the cellar. Hold until 2018, at least.",90,Piña 2010 Wolff Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville)
"This is a dry and firm wine, with hints of sweet-tasting fruits that peep through its dense structure. It shows great power and concentration, with an obvious long-term future.",92,Château Certan 2009  Pomerol
"This is a soft, white-fruit-driven wine. It has an attractive touch of spice to match the ripe fruit, allowing the acidity to shine. The wine is warm, full and ready to drink.",86,Trimbach 2009 Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
"A wine of intense acidity, this Verdejo, usually native to Spain, is sourced from relatively cool Clarksburg and has a salty, herbal quality to it, more fennel and cedar than tropical fruit, and a light, woody finish.",85,Riaza 2012 Heringer-Holland Vineyard Verdejo (Clarksburg)
"Leathery berry and savory, smoky oak aromas are a rugged introduction to a stout palate with juicy acidity. Flavors of baked plum, hard spices, salt and savory herbs finish with rubbery tannins, energy and spicy, peppery flavors.",89,Vinos de Arganza 2013 Marqués de Montejos Selección Mencía (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)
"The grape's stereotypical green nose gets a whole new interpretation, with aromas of sunburned hay, bags of desiccated grass and wild oregano. The herbaceous characters carry the palate, but it's smooth with thyme and chile verde flavors, and a lingering bit of citrus tartness and tannic grip.",92,Mercy 2013 Zabala Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Arroyo Seco)
"Blending Syrah and Touriga Franca, this is the flagship wine from this property. New barrel aging adds a creamy toast character to a rich wine with its dusty tannins and dense texture. At the same time, the wine is very elegant, ripe with its black fruits. Still young, it will be ready from 2019.",94,Monte da Ravasqueira 2013 Vinha das Romãs Red (Alentejano)
"Cooked cherries in vanilla butter, just-pressed espresso, chopped dill and a hint of tar decorate the nose of this 71% Syrah, 24% Malbec and 5% Petit Verdot blend from a unique vineyard atop the Cuesta Grade. Black licorice, dark blackberries, rustic elderberries and a cedar-y, asphalt-laden grip power the palate.",90,Ancient Peaks 2012 Renegade Margarita Vineyard Red (Paso Robles)
"On the dusty, earthy side of the Rhône spectrum, with hints of cordite accenting cherry fruit. It's undeniably fresh and vibrant, just lacks some of the richness characteristic of the 2007 vintage.",86,Perrin & Fils 2007 L'Andéol Rasteau Red (Côtes du Rhône Villages)
"This top tier effort captures all the most distinctive characteristics of good Oregon Pinot Noir. Black cherry fruit, a liberal dash of cola, a touch of sassafras and a dusting of baking spice combine in a burst of flavor. Delicious already, it will drink well for another half decade or longer.",92,Fullerton 2015 Bella Vida Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Solid and elegant, this standard-bearer offers round, plummy aromas and flavors, as well as cocoa and tobacco accents. The fruit is very clean and bright, and the flavors well defined on the lush, well-balanced palate. Finishes dark and juicy, with fine tannins. This wine should improve over the next three to five years, and then drink well until 2008.",90,Chalk Hill 1997 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Chalk Hill)
"This ripe, warm-smelling blend of 75% Monastrell and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon deals aromas of jammy blackberry and baked plum. The palate is thick and chewy, with leathery flavors of roasted plum and baked berry fruits. Notes of raisin, chocolate and earthy spice can be found on a lush finish. Drink through 2018.",89,Fuerza 2010 Red (Jumilla)
"Opens with a blast of oak rendered as bacon and sawdust. Feels bulky, tannic and tight, with saturated wood flavors taking on a heavy hickory accent that overrides what standard red fruit the wine is bringing. Quite woody for a wine of this caliber.",84,Apaltagua 2010 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"Flowery and balanced in crisp, dry flavors of lemon and pear, this wine takes its designation from the French word for fog, a nod to its cool-climate environs. Supple tannins and refined acidity round out the deal.",88,Michel-Schlumberger 2012 La Brume Chardonnay (Dry Creek Valley)
"Firm and dry, with tart acids and minerals, this Chardonnay's fruit veers toward golden apricots and herbs. Not showing much richness now. Drink up.",84,Vine Hill 2010 Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"A beautiful Pinot Noir, dry and firm, with an authoritative structure. A little modest in fruit, with earthy, dried sour cherry candy and spice flavors, uplifted by brisk acidity. What a nice restaurant wine.",91,Bonaccorsi 2008 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"A strong, toasted, smoky aroma and charred oak flavors define this medium-bodied, rich-textured wine. Not exactly light on its feet, but fans of oak will appreciate the bold, toasty, buttery character.",86,Page Mill Winery 2013 Vitner's Select Chardonnay (Livermore Valley)
"This delivers a spectacular explosion of fruity, floral flavors. Notes of apricot preserve and honeysuckle are exuberantly aromatic, balanced with a delicate palate of sweet, sugared peach and tangerine. It's sprightly and lean, yet elegantly lingering on the finish.",94,Dr. Hermann 2012 Goldkap Eiswein Riesling (Mosel)
"Lifted lemon purity surrounded by white summer blossom make for a fresh Riesling with wonderful balance, concentration and poise. It offers that quintessential acid streamline that Riesling-lovers always look for.",90,Brandl 2013 Terrassen Riesling (Kamptal)
"So ripe and soft with raspberry and cherry jam, milk chocolate, smoky new oak and anise flavors that it's almost a fruit bomb. But firm tannins and fine acidity come to the rescue. Hard to see it aging, so drink up.",87,Y Rousseau 2010 Le Roi Soleil Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder)
"With massive fruit and power, this low production (300 case) Zinfandel will make lovers of the Shelton style exult, while others might find it lacking elegance. But there's no doubting the potency of the wild berry, licorice, cola, cedar and spice flavors, which earn this wine its high score.",91,Carol Shelton 2006 Bacchus Laureate Reserve Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"In contrast to the winery's big, rough and tumble style of Merlot, this Cabernet is lightly fruity. It shows cherry and cranberry hard candy fruit flavors. The tannins are rough and substantial, and quickly take over the finish.",86,Cliff Creek 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Southern Oregon)
"Savory wisps of smoke and dusty minerals juxtapose exuberantly juicy, sweet yellow peach and nectarine flavors in this crystalline kabinett. Just off-dry on the palate, its refreshing, high-spirited style makes it an excellent apéritif.",89,Bollig-Lehnert 2014 Trittenheimer Apotheke Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"An extremely dense nose reveals espresso bean, blackberry paste, caramelized berries, black pepper and a hint of tobacco, reminiscent of a fruit-laced, heavily spiced crème brûlée. The blend of 54% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Merlot, 17% Cabernet Franc and 5% Syrah is silky on the palate with oregano, dill and fennel giving nuance to dried blueberry fruit, laid across a powerful structure. Drink 2016–2027.",93,Summerwood 2012 Senito Red (Paso Robles)
"A touch of smoky petrol in the aroma and flavor adds intrigue to this full-bodied, creamy-textured wine. A lot of effort in the winery, including native fermentation, 33% new French barrels and lees stirring helped it have a good sense of depth and richness without being overripe, contributing a mouthflling sensation and lingering finish.",90,La Folia Winery 2015 Vermentino (Sierra Foothills)
"This ambitious, against-all-odds island project with ancient grapevines is showing promising results, in this case offering smoked meats, hard spice and very tight purple fruit on the nose. The palate is tart with cranberries and raspberries, with a pencil lead and earth character, proving quite interesting if not entirely Zin-like.",89,Rusack 2013 Santa Catalina Island Vineyard Zinfandel (California)
"Luxuriously honeyed, this wine sings in rich hazelnut but also remains crisp on the palate, relatively light-bodied in fresh pear and lemon. Staying lithe as it goes down, it has subtle power and integrated oak, finishing creamy and bold.",90,Corner 103 2014 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"There's much to enjoy in this unusual blend of Syrah, Merlot, Grenache, Cabernet Franc and Pinot Noir. It generally works, with fruit-focused notes of raspberries and plum accented by barrel spices of clove and toffee. The flavors are tart, tangy and precise, with chewy tannins providing the frame.",88,Canoe Ridge 2011 Reserve Cherry Street Red (Horse Heaven Hills)
"The juice is sharp and spicy, with some baking spice and cinnamon livening up the back of the palate. The fruit flavors suggest boysenberry and blackberry, set up against stiff acids and earthy tannins. Young and still a little rough around the edges, this distinctive bottling should be cellared for a few years and could go as long as a decade or more.",90,Torii Mor 2005 La Colina Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Brûléed pastry crust and salted butter aromas overlay golden apple and spiced pear tones. The palate feels lax with curved acids, which lead to a light, yielding finish.",86,King Family 2012 Chardonnay (Monticello)
"Truth be told, both the regular and reserve Chardonnays from Blakeslee are very close in quality, cost and flavor. This selection is loaded with thick fruit flavors of peach and apple, along with barrel notes of buttered popcorn and coconut.",90,Blakeslee 2013 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
"Hints of waxy white florals and lemon zest persist from nose to finish on this intensely revitalizing semidry Riesling. Tart stone-fruit flavors penetrate the palate, highlighted by a stream of spine-tingling acidity.",90,Anthony Road 2013 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Herb aromas and veggie flavors dominate this light-bodied wine. Not much fruit flavor peeks through the herb garden, but the lean white pepper notes and crisp texture are appealing.",83,Line 39 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (California)
"A delightful bottle, this fruit-packed Gamay has more stuffing and sweetness than most of the Oregon Pinots from 2007. Plums, cherries and black currants ramble through the mouth, running into some fairly stiff, chewy tannins. This is a sturdy, immediately drinkable, thoroughly enjoyable quaffer.",88,WillaKenzie Estate 2007 Gamay Noir (Willamette Valley)
"A very nice Merlot whose pure cherry, red currant and cedar flavors are supported by rich, sturdy tannins. The finish is spicy and long. Great partner with steaks and chops, and the price is right.",88,Beaulieu Vineyard 2005 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Fresh and breezy, brimming with zesty lemons and apple blossoms, this light-bodied Riesling is refreshing and tart. Just a touch off dry, it's straightforward in style and thirst-quenchingly enjoyable.",86,Castel Grisch 2013 Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Stillwater Creek, Conner Lee and Bacchus vineyards provided the fruit for this young, sappy and rich Syrah. It captures the varietal character of the grape, especially as expressed in Washington State. Inviting aromas of berries and chocolate, bright and fresh, lead into brambly red fruits, umami-soaked mushrooms and moist earth.",91,Arbor Crest 2008 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A briny-smelling nose is lacking in ripe appealing fruit. This feels pithy and oily, while bitter briny flavors come up short on fruit and friendliness. Pyrazines and bitterness control the finish.",82,Pazo Pondal 2015 Lenda Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"A superb value, this estate-grown Pinot brings dense fruit flavors of raspberry and cherry, sourced from Dijon clones. Firm and slightly high-toned, it spent 17 months in one-third new oak, resulting in baking-spice notes that unfold on the finish.",91,Redhawk 2012 Redhawk Estate Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Coming from this exceptional winery the term reserve (or in this case, riservata) actually means a great deal. Flavors are broad and deep and entwined with plum, cherry compote, soy and chocolate. The length and power are impressive: these flavors just don't quit.",95,Alloro 2014 Estate Riservata Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"Intense freshness and acidity follow the most delicious perfumes in this crisp wine. It shows considerable minerality, bursting with citric flavors and a mouthwatering aftertaste. Age for several years. Screwcap.",93,Bründlmayer 2010 Heiligenstein Erste Lage Riesling (Kamptal)
"This is an unctuously ripe Chardonnay dense with melon, tangerine and even mango flavors. Balanced solidly in acidity and alcohol, it's an impressive, powerfully concentrated wine. Swirls of vanilla, coconut and smoke could still use a few years aging to integrate but it should show beautifully by 2020.",92,Thörle 2013 Saulheimer Réserve Trocken Chardonnay (Rheinhessen)
"Perfumed green pears, overlaid with the floral charm of summer blossom, characterize this concentrated yet lithe wine. Nonetheless, it is based on a firm core that suggests the ancient rocks where the vines grew. Little by little, a miso-like saltiness also reveals itself.",94,Lagler 2012 Steinborz Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"Fragrant and refined, this elegant sparkler offers enticing scents of hawthorn, wild flower and sliced pear. The vibrant balanced palate doles out citrus, crisp apple and a hint of ginger set against firm acidity and a soft, foaming mousse. It has clean dry finish.",90,Mongarda 2016 Vigneto Rive Alte Extra Dry  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"From Block 29 of the acclaimed vineyard, this wine is delightfully juicy and flirty in black cherry, leather, black pepper and tobacco. Full bodied and ripe, it never gets heavy, rather trafficking in enough acidity and sense of place to stay grounded on the palate.",90,Rock Wall 2013 Hendry Vineyard Zinfandel (Napa Valley)
"This producer continues to up its game with this brand. This wine offers a smoky, luxurious experience defined by black-cherry spice, smoky oak and a thickness of chocolate. Textured and full bodied, it's made for fans of a richer, more concentrated style.",91,La Crema 2013 Pinot Noir (Los Carneros)
"Smooth and rich, this wine has structure as well as tannins. The generous red-berry fruits are smooth and rounded. The vines are owned by the Amorim family of cork-production fame. Drink this ripe, rich wine from 2020.",91,Quinta Nova de Nossa Senhora do Carmo 2014 Collection Tinto Red (Douro)
"Plum, berry and milk chocolate aromas are not too aggressive. The palate is round and friendly feeling, with flavors of wild berry, sweet oak and carob. Finishes with solid oaky flavors. Good Syrah that's uncomplicated and generally well made.",86,Siegel 2010 Crucero Syrah (Colchagua Valley)
"This 100% varietal wine is dense and heavy on the palate in a generosity of tannin and concentrated black fruit. Lingering notions of cedar, dried herb and tar provide a tinge of bitterness as it develops in the glass.",89,Peju 2013 Petit Verdot (Napa Valley)
"In Beaujolais, 2010 was a firm and structured year, and this is very evident in this darkly tannic wine. It is packed with juicy acidity and red berry fruits, while it is also in need of several months' aging.",87,Georges Duboeuf 2010 Sélection  (Juliénas)
"Light and rusty in color, with lean aromas of baked fruits and maple. The palate is tight and spicy, with baked fruit and plenty of dry oak. Potent, hot and spicy on the finish.",84,Valentin Bianchi 2009 Pinot Noir (Mendoza)
"Some vegetal flavors accompany ripe blackberries, cherries and cola in this softly tannic, high alcohol Zinfandel. It's a robust wine to drink now.",84,Bruliam 2011 Rocky Ridge Vineyard Zinfandel (Rockpile)
"Excessive acidity gives this wine a sour bite, while the flavors, of cherries and cranberries, are tart. Significant new oak helps to provide spicy richness. Drink now.",85,Cline 2009 Cool Climate Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"A diffuse wine without focus. The tannins and the fruit are some way apart, while the final flavor is dry and tough.",82,Château la Petite Roque 2010  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux
"Coming from the north-eastern Beiras region, close to the Douro, this wine is a ripe, rich and crisp wine. It has a perfumed character from the Malvasia in the blend and an attractive yeasty aftertaste. Drink now.",86,Casca Wines 2010 Altitude Reserva Bruto Sparkling (Távora-Varosa)
"This rich wine is a great success. It's enormously rich, almost flamboyant in blackberry jam, blueberry cobbler, anise and smoky new oak, as delicious as any Cabernet out there. Yet it shows a fine structure and relatively modest alcohol, a feature of the 2008 vintage. Good as it is now, you can safely cellar it for the rest of this decade and watch it evolve.",95,St. Supéry 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"A rich and inviting nose of berry-laced pastries, dried strawberries, stewed cherries and sagebrush kick off this layered bottling. The palate shows savory cracked black pepper along with strawberry, plum and black-raspberry fruit. A dry sagebrush quality gives complexity to the whole sip.",91,Four Sisters Ranch 2011 Limited-Edition Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"Spunky raspberry and plum aromas are youthful and bright. A wiry palate is drawing and tight, with red plum, currant and a dash of salt making up the flavors. Saline becomes even more apparent on a tight, scratchy finish.",86,Adrás 2013 Mencía (Ribeira Sacra)
"Its Grand Escolha (equivalent to a Reserve wine) label explains why this is a young, reticent and closed wine. With its firm fruits and tight tannins, it needs several years of aging to reveal what will always be a serious wine.",89,Quinta Vale de Fornos 2008 Grande Escolha Cabernet Sauvignon (Tejo)
"Firm, dry tannins behind this wine give a hard edge that will need time. The wine is powered by its structure, solid and only just fruity. Wait until at least 2017 to allow more fruitiness to come through, although the wine will likely always be tough.",85,Producta Vignobles 2011 Château la Rose Bourdieu  (Bordeaux)
"This is a simple, soft, easy to drink Cabernet, with candied berry and spice flavors. The easiness suggests backyard barbecue, with sweetly grilled ribs and burgers on a summer evening.",84,Sean Minor 2010 Four Bears Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"There is plenty of red cherry and currant in this Cab, blended with a quarter's worth of Merlot, Malbec, Petite Sirah and Petit Verdot. The thin, balanced layers also recall anise and vanilla.",87,Roth 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Char and coffee notes ride high on this Tempranillo's black-fruit bouquet. Grabby tannins and an overriding scratchy quality control the palate, which is full, ripe, tannic and abrasive. Dark flavors of blackberry and chocolate end with notes of espresso and black pepper.",88,Venta Mazzaron 2012 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)
"Refreshing, fun and refined, this crowd-pleasing sparkler offers ripe Bartlett pear, green apple and a hint of nectarine drop. Crisp acidity and a lively perlage give it a vibrant edge.",87,BiancaVigna NV Brut  (Prosecco)
"This offers subdued aromas suggesting leather, raisin, spice and menthol. The bracing palate displays dried prune, tobacco and the heat of alcohol but not much fruit richness. Raspy tannins that leave an astringent finish.",86,Cà della Scala 2011  Amarone della Valpolicella
"Aromas of ripe berry, Mediterranean herb, menthol and eucalyptus lead the nose. The medium-bodied palate is already somewhat evolved offering blackberry extract, mature black cherry, licorice, spice and espresso alongside polished tannins. It closes on a note of bitter walnut.",89,Valle dell'Acate 2012  Cerasuolo di Vittoria Classico
Picked relatively early—the finished alcohol level is only 11%—this is suprisingly soft and round while remaining light in body: It's a charming sylph. The only quibble is that the lime-like flavors fade relatively quickly on the finish.,88,Zonte's Footstep 2009 The Love Symbol Single Site Savignin Blanc Savagnin (Langhorne Creek)
This is a balanced wine with fine young tannins and plenty of blackberry and black-plum fruits. It is ripe while keeping plenty of acidity. The wine is going to develop well and should be ready from 2019.,86,Château Bel Orme Martial 2015  Bordeaux
"Coarse raspberry and plum aromas are backed by a narrow palate with limited flavors of cherry chewing gum and cough drop. This stays consistent by finishing with a wiry, raw feel.",84,Vega Tolosa 2013 11 Pinos Old Vines Bobal (Manchuela)
"91-93 This feels very juicy, the fruit almost over-ripe. There is a generous new world feel to it, very opulent, super-rich. Open black plum and damson fruits push through the dark, perfumed tannins.",92,Château Pavie 2010 Barrel sample  (Saint-Émilion)
"Mineral-driven and hard on the nose, this features toasty, smoky, chocolaty notes in addition to medicinal berry aromas. It feels juicy but also resiny and creamy, with plum and wood flavors that finish long. This is a ripe, fruity wine with plenty of oak, size and body.",88,Acústic 2010 Vinyes Velles Nobles Garnatxa-Carinyena Red (Montsant)
"From the vineyard once known as Alisos comes this wine, with aromas of soft clove, red cherry and a touch of sage. A strong ginger spice reigns over the palate, which is bitingly acidic, and shows dark strawberry fruit and dark thyme herbs. This wine is still quite wound up, but that acidity will prove mouthwatering for years to come.",90,Casa Dumetz 2014 Flower & VIne Grenache (Santa Barbara County)
"Tightly tannic, this 100% varietal wine comes from the producer's family estate. It's big in blackberry fruit and oak, the tannins generous on the palate. Ripe, plush plums figure into the finish, the wine bound to appeal to fans of Zinfandel for its robust nature.",87,Kunde 2012 Destination Series Malbec (Sonoma Valley)
"Pinker in color than many Provence rosés, this full-bodied wine has ripe strawberry fruits, rich acidity and a touch of caramel. With the weight and smooth texture, it will be better with food.",87,Mas de Cadenet 2013 Arbaude Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Aromas of pencil lead, rubber and spice accent distant red fruit notes. The palate is none too deep, with dilution and bracing acidity. Tastes perky and lightly leafy, with cherry, raspberry, dry spice and finally buttery oak. Whispy but hollow for an '06 reserva.",86,Castillo Clavijo 2006 Reserva  (Rioja)
"The wine tastes and feels important. It has great weight and depth. The tannins are extraordinarily thick, but ripe and smoothly sweet. And then there's the fruit, a detonation of blackberries, cherries, blueberries and cassis, not to mention the oak, which seems as fine as oak gets. This superb wine seems like an obvious cellar candidate. It should ride out the decade effortlessly.",93,Krupp Brothers 2007 Stagecoach Vineyard Synchrony Red (Napa Valley)
"Citrus, melon and saline aromas are quiet in nature. This is fresh and a bit on the plump side, with fruity, almost sweet flavors of honeydew, lime and mango. A flush, easy finish could benefit from more direct acidity. Drink immediately.",87,Peñalolen 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (San Antonio)
"Olallieberries, strawberry blossoms, caramel, maple syrup and cola shows on the complex nose of this blend of 52% Grenache, 31% Syrah, 12% Mourvèdre and 5% Counoise. The palate shows concentrated boysenberry, tar and coffee flavors, proving more tart than the region's usually powerful Rhône bottlings, and a refreshing change of pace.",89,TH 2013 The Pick Red (Paso Robles Willow Creek District)
"Although the bouquet is a bit scratchy, bright, lightly candied aromas of raspberry and strawberry jam are friendly and welcoming. The wine is firm on the palate and well built, with fresh, slightly jammy tasting plum and berry flavors. And it's lasting and fresh on the finish.",88,Viñedos y Bodegas Pablo 2010 Menguante Garnacha (Cariñena)
Le Grillaie offers easy fruit tones of cherry and blackberry with touches of cola and licorice at the back. This simple red white would pair well with a heaping plate of pasta and meat sauce.,85,Celli 2011 Le Grillaie  (Sangiovese di Romagna Superiore)
"Fans of great big wines will like it, but this Petite Sirah is unbalanced, with heat from high alcohol compounding the acidity, making the mouhtfeel prickly. The berry flavors are overripe, running into raisins and chocolate.",84,Mauritson 2008 Madrone Spring Vineyard Petite Sirah (Rockpile)
"Delicate aromas of wisteria, jasmine and a whiff of white orchard fruit mingle in the glass. The bright palate offers tart Granny Smith apple, green pear and lime alongside racy acidity and a soft mousse.",88,Masottina 2014 Rive di Ogliano Contrada Granda Brut  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Exuberantly fragrant of ripe, tropical fruit and florals, this Romanian white blend veers towards confected, but it's pleasantly brisk and apple-y on the palate. A good apéritif for casual, weekday enjoyment.",84,Cramele Halewood 2009 Single Vineyard Selection Scurta Vineyard Viognier-Tamaioasa Romaneasca White (Dealurile Munteniei)
"Fresh-pressed blackberry and boysenberry are lifted by white pepper and anise on the nose of this bottling by Steve Martell. The palate is dark in flavor, with black plum, charcoal, black pepper, prune, dried wisteria and other purple flowers, all presented on a very soft mouthfeel.",91,Kaleidos 2013 Syrah (Paso Robles)
"Not sweet or soft, this assertive dry wine has effusive herb and snap-pea aromas and flavors, bright acidity and medium body. It's a refreshing pour for a hot afternoon or evening.",87,Leese-Fitch 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (California)
"Rich aromas of juicy peach and Damask rose have the lovely and tempering edge of grapefruit zest. The palate gives us the same welcomed counterpoint of zesty aromatic freshness and perfumed opulence. This has lovely fluid freshness, couched in sumptuous flavors. This is exquisitely balanced and finishes just about still dry.",93,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2014 Pfersigberg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Despite it's modest reported alcohol level, this is a plush, rounded example of Chardonnay, loaded with fruit. A whiff of woodsmoke frames pineapple and mango, adding complexity while still allowing the tropical notes to shine through. Drink now–2017.",92,Giant Steps 2011 Tarraford Vineyard Chardonnay (Yarra Valley)
"Smooth and easy-drinking, this medium-bodied wine has the attributes many people enjoy: vanilla and coconut aromas, lightly sweet apple flavors that coat the palate, and a pear syrup quality that lingers on the finish.",85,Dark Horse 2015 Chardonnay (California)
"Apple and grass aromas are clean and basic. For a brut nature, this has a plump feel and fruity roundness. Yeasty flavors of baked white bread and briny apple and nectarine finish mellow and smooth. Drink now.",87,Juvé y Camps 2010 Brut Nature Gran Reserva Reserva de la Familia Sparkling (Cava)
"Nicely fruited with a mix of grapefruit, apricot and melon flavors, this is open and easy to enjoy with a range of dishes. A slight hint of vanilla butter cookie adds interest to the finish.",87,Ancient Cellars 2013 Gilt Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"This pretty expression of Primitivo opens with ripe fruit aromas of prune and blackberry, plus notes of sweet spice and moist pipe tobacco. There's a soft, chewy feeling on the palate, followed by bold fruit flavors.",88,Felline 2010  Primitivo di Manduria
"Rounded and honeyed, this is a wine that shows a sweeter side of Pinot Blanc, buoyed by fresh, juicy white-peach flavor. Full, rich and dense, this is fruity, yet it has a complex structure.",89,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2010 Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
Bright red fruit highlights this soft wine. Acidity and hint of stalky tannins give its red berry flavors a boost. It's easygoing and ready to drink.,85,Fat Bastard 2016 Malbec (Vin de France)
"This is a blend of grapes from a number of Premier Cru parcels. It gives a rich, ripe and fruity wine with a good depth of flavor and strong signs of the wood aging. At this stage, the wood is leaving some bitterness and toast, but this will round out. Drink from 2017.",89,Manuel Olivier 2012 Premier Cru  (Meursault)
"Nico is one of the only wineries in California producing this Italian variety. It's a nice, likeable wine, built along the lines of Pinot Grigio. Dry and crisp with acidity, with bright, intense lime, grapefruit and white pepper flavors, it's an ideal apéritif.",87,Nico 2012 Il Greco Greco (Russian River Valley)
"This shows sweet, plush fruit aromas, with background tones of leather and tobacco. By no means is this wine over the top, in fact, it shows a firm but elegant quality throughout.",89,Degani 2009 La Rosta  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"This closed, reticent wine promises to pack a rich, generous punch in the future. Its potential shows in the botrytis flavor and the touches of smoky wood and apricot jelly. With this leashed power, it promises to be a very fine wine.",95,Château Rieussec 2009  Sauternes
"Winemaker Christian Roguenant makes a strong series of affordable white wines from the Niven family under this label. This Sauvignon Blanc delivers aromas of lemongrass, wet stone, lime zest and white pepper. Flavors recall sipping ice-cold creek water, with refreshing notes of cut grass, honeydew melon, ripe apple and lime juice.",90,Tangent 2013 Paragon Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Edna Valley)
"This is soft and easy in texture, light in flavors and slightly sweet. Light to medium bodied, it has very little tannin or astringency, is low in acidity and quiet on the finish.",84,Murphy-Goode 2012 HomeFront Red (California)
"Made from 59% Cabernet Sauvignon, 36% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc, much of the fruit from the Garvey Home Ranch, this wine impresses with its thick, rich red and black berry, tobacco and dusty gravel flavors. Well-integrated, it shows restraint without sacrificing body, its nuances developing slowly in the glass.",92,Pine & Brown 2014 Proprietary Blend Red (Rutherford)
Juicy and peppery this is everything one could want in a Mourvèdre—smooth and delicious with a backbone of earthy leather.,92,Terre Rouge 2010 Mourvèdre (Sierra Foothills)
"Aromas of acacia flower, toasted nut and graphite lead the nose on this serious white. The structured palate offers mature yellow apple, honey, orange zest and almond alongside soft acidity. It closes on a lemon drop note.",89,Alessio Komjanc 2015 Friulano (Collio)
"Tasted in a flight of other '04 Rutherford Cabs, this one was a little leaner and greener. There's a pepperminty sharpness alongside the cherry and cedar flavors. Best now and for a few years.",88,Frog's Leap 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"Layers of pollen, dusty mineral and spice lend complexity to this concentrated wine full of yellow peach and fresh apple flavors. It's delicate and lithe in texture, yet punchy and penetrating.",90,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler 2014 Bernkasteler Badstube Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"Still closed, this only begins to show its fresh, rounded passion fruit and mango-cocktail flavors after it has had some air. The palate is concentrated and precise. This will come into its own by 2015.",90,Türk 2013 Vom Urgestein Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"This blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot opens with savory aromas of cured meat and dusty black pepper with some black olive, licorice and dried cassis. The wine shows a brawny personality with tight, slightly gritty tannins on the close.",87,Vecchia Cantina di Montepulciano 2008 Poggio Stella Pleos Red (Rosso di Toscana)
"Subdued notes of butterscotch and flaky pie crust mark this Chardonnay's nose. It is a buttery, waxy-textured selection with tame acidity, and it would pair well with steamed lobster in a casual setting.",85,Otium 2011 Chardonnay (Virginia)
"This is a great example of what most would consider a straight-ahead and delicious California Chardonnay. The nose offers aromas of seared pineapple cake, vanilla soda and Meyer lemon, and the palate blends all of the typical elements: lemon juice acidity down the middle, minerality driven by slate and white rocks, apple and a bit of brown spice on the edges.",92,Roblar 2013 Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Unsteady stone-fruit aromas set up a chunky, cidery palate. Flavors of tropical fruits are short and turn toward grassy lime and scallion on the finish. As Torrontés goes, this is decently enjoyable.",84,Ocaso 2014 Torrontés (Mendoza)
"The cool 2011 vintage has kept this bottling from being as ripe as previous wines from this producer. It's certainly leaner, but for all that, it's dry, silky and elegantly complex in its own way, with dried raspberry, tea and white pepper flavors. It could surprise after 2017.",91,Benovia 2011 Bella Una Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"A penetrating mineral streak cuts through layers of honeyed peach and cantaloupe in this intensely concentrated, complex Spätlese. It's lip smacking and succulently sweet, yet balanced by a zesty citrus backbone that pulses long through the finish.",93,St. Urbans-Hof 2014 Goldtröpfchen Piesport Spätlese Erste Lage Riesling (Mosel)
"Dry, spicy and floral smelling, with modest herbal accents. The palate is saturated and fairly rich, with good texture and broad, satisfying flavors of berry and plum. Sturdy, consistent and fresh, with easy drinkability.",88,Santa Alicia 2010 Reserva Merlot (Maipo Valley)
"This wine is bursting with gorgeous cherry fruit, forward and luscious. The tannins are ripe and the acids in perfect proportion, keeping the fruit flavors buoyed upon a textural ride into a lingering finish.",91,Le Cadeau 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"From old vines, at least 50 years old, this shows good concentration, giving a dense, ripe, rounded wine full of green apple fruits, hints of vanilla and streaks of minerality.",89,La Chablisienne 2005 Les Vénérables  (Chablis)
"This Cabernet is immediately succulent, with smooth tannins, gorgeous layers of oak, and intricate flavors of blackberries, black cherries, plums and mocha. The alcohol is high, giving this 100% Cabernet some heat, but it should pair well with char-broiled steak.",92,Rodney Strong 2010 Alexander's Crown Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Perfumed wine, deliciously aromatic but also structured. This is balanced, intently tannic. The fruit is equally important, the black currant juice and refreshing acidity a counterbalance to the tannins.",89,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2006 Syrah-Touriga Nacional Red (Ribatejano)
"From the start this has superb tannins and fine acidity that frame the ripe, complex blackberry, black currant and cassis flavors, finishing with elegance and class. It's hard to resist drinking now, but this should develop over the next eight years.",92,Sabina Vineyards 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"A blend that includes Cabernet Sauvignon as well as Portuguese grapes, this is mineral, with a leathery texture. The red berry fruits are restrained, juicy, laced with light tannins. Ready to drink.",86,Dona Maria-Júlio Bastos 2007 Dona Maria Red (Alentejano)
This straightforward wine is bone dry and brisk in acidity. The pink grapefruit and Meyer lemon citrus flavors are enriched with riper notes of papayas. But there's also a strong streak of tart green gooseberries.,86,Geyser Peak 2012 River Ranches Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley)
"Light to medium in body, with simple off-dry apple and citrus flavors and a hint of peppery spice on the finish. Drink now.",85,eco.love 2009 Riesling (South Island)
"This Croatian white is made from 100% Debit and has aromas of dried apricot, toasted brioche, peach and just a touch of cinnamon in the bouquet. The palate is generous, with delightful flavors of white and yellow peaches and fresh apricot nectar. It's aged for 24 months in French oak; 150 cases produced.",89,Bibich 2010 Lucica Debit (North Dalmatia)
"This nonvintage blend seems to be showing some age with its pale salmon color displaying some bricking. It brings notes of strawberry, cherry and herbs. It's a solid easy drinker that drinks best at room temperature.",85,BBQ Wine Company 2013 Oink! White (America)
"The oak spices (30% new American and French) are at the fore here along with notes of orange peel, game, and vanilla on this unusual blend of Syrah, Malbec and Grenache. It's medium bodied with dry tannins.",85,Canoe Ridge 2010 Reserve Cherry Street Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A soft, easygoing style of Marlborough Sauvignon, the 2009 Ponga exhibits ripe, almost honeyed, stone-fruit aromas that slide easily into melon and nectarine flavors marked by only a touch of grassiness.",89,Ponga 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Here is yet another Washington Riesling that shows how good these wines can be. This is well beyond the sweet and fruity style of the tasting room wines; here are layers of stone fruits, density and weight, length and detail. Once in the mouth this explodes with flavor and keeps bringing the oranges, peaches, apricots, nectarines and apples to the table.",90,DaMa 2006 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Opening aromas of vanilla cookie show a resemblance to Animal Crackers, while the palate is more vivacious and tangy, with flavors of orange, tangerine and apple. We wouldn't call this an elegant or refined wine, but we like its no-issues attitude and citrusy content. Probably good with salads and seafood.",86,De Martino 2007 Legado Reserva Chardonnay (Limarí Valley)
"Tastes frankly sweet, with sugary flavors of pineapple marmalade, vanilla custard and butterscotch. It's clean in acids and spicy in the finish. If this is your style, enjoy.",84,Longevity 2009 Viognier (Lodi)
"Ripe yellow pear is held in check by citrus zestiness, but rich fruit notions keep breaking though the bracing freshness of this wine. A slender body and fine-tuned phenolics add to the appeal of this balanced white.",93,Alzinger 2013 Loibenberg Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
Mild citrus aromas are aided by crushed mineral notes. This rosé feels chunky as it blows up on the palate with a cloud of foam. Apricot and orange flavors finish foamy and yeasty in flavor.,87,Cave Geisse NV Cave Amadeu Rosé Brut Pinot Noir (Pinto Bandeira)
"Jammy berry aromas are baked, horsey and fold in a note of cherry. A gritty palate with full tannins scrapes at your cheeks, while plum and cherry flavors are loud at first then fade away on a raisiny, sweet finish. Tasted twice, this note reflects both tastings.",85,Montgó 2013 Flor del Montgó Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"Aromas of bread crust, pastry cream and toast come together in the glass. The creamy palate offers mature pear, yellow apple and toasted hazelnut alongside a soft mousse.",88,Fratelli Berlucchi 2012 Freccianera Saten Chardonnay (Franciacorta)
"Truffle, underbrush, new leather and chopped herb aromas slowly emerge in the glass. The bright, elegantly structured palate delivers tart cherry, licorice and tobacco alongside vibrant acidity and tightly wound noble tannins. It's still youthfully austere so give it time to develop. Drink 2023–2033.",93,Poderi Colla 2013 Bussia Dardi Le Rose  (Barolo)
"Fermented in open top lagares, this wine shows the smooth and fruity side of Portugal's flagship grape. The tannins are present but muted by ripe black fruit and generous texture. Drink from 2018.",89,Dona Maria-Júlio Bastos 2013 Dona Maria Touriga Nacional (Alentejano)
"A rather simple Chardonnay made in the modern style, with lots of flamboyance and flash, but not much subtlety. Strong and rich in pineapple and peach jam flavors, it's brightened with zesty acidity.",85,Textbook 2009 Fin de Journée Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Honeysuckle, lemongrass and wheat ride a robust wave of ripeness and bold texture in this white wine, which is exuberant in bright lemon-laced acidity.",88,Hawley 2016 Viognier (Sonoma County)
"Whiffs of balsamic vinegar, leather and spice accent this rustic yet elegant Merlot. Ripe red cherry and raspberry flavors brighten the palate, but complexities of tobacco and riding saddle maintain that deeply savory tone. Coarse, fine-grained tannins and brisk acidity lend structure and gravitas.",91,Raphael 2012 First Label Merlot (North Fork of Long Island)
"Wy'east is better than ever in this vintage, a divine balancing act with berry, plum, Asian spices and chocolate all in focus. From the opening scents, laden with complex and perfectly fused notes of blackberry, mineral, coriander and cacao, right on through the extended, captivating finish, this is a wine that is almost impossible to put down, yet will drink well at least through 2025.",95,Sineann 2014 Wy'east Pinot Noir (Columbia Gorge (OR))
"Like it says, this is a sweet bubbly. It has raspberry, strawberry, vanilla and toast flavors that are easy to like. Made from Pinot Noir, Zinfandel, Sangiovese and Syrah, it's a lovely wine for those who like their sparklers on the sweet side.",86,Korbel NV Sweet Rosé Sparkling (California)
"Solid tannins lead into a wine that balances very dry, dark fruits with dense wood textures. It's a solid, chunky, bold wine, richly fruity and still young. Drink this firm, ageworthy wine from 2016.",91,Poças 2011 Vale de Cavalos Red (Douro)
"Barrel-fermented in neutral oak, this is ready to drink, softly flavorful with yellow apple and other yellow fruits, and a warm, autumnal mouthfeel. Drink now through 2018.",88,Ancient Cellars 2014 Old Mill Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"The color is deep, the aromas thick with wood smoke, bacon and dried plums, and the flavors are ripe, like blackberry syrup but dry. This is full bodied and very firm in texture due to mouth-coating tannins that are nearly matched on the finish by persistent and bold fruit flavors. Tasty now, it should age nicely through 2020.",89,Mettler Family Vineyards 2012 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi)
"A huge Graciano is what this is. Hailing from Toledo, this 16% abv heavyweight is seriously fruity and massive on the nose, with a mash-up of blackberry, boysenberry and peppery aromas. Layered blackberry, cassis and blackened toast flavors finish much the same, with juicy, edgy acidity. Drink through 2021.",91,Carmen Lopez Delgado 2013 Latitud 40+ Graciano (Spain)
"The Monarch line is a new venture for Latah Creek. The Zin, from the Coyote Canyon vineyard, offers tart berry fruit, lightly spiced, and a hint of fresh herb. Clean and modest in scope.",87,Latah Creek 2008 Monarch Zinfandel (Horse Heaven Hills)
"This wine is produced from old-vine Pinot Noir planted on flint soil. The wood from the wine's aging does show, giving a spicy, smoky character that is still dominating the red-cherry fruits. This will balance out over the next few months to give a wine with concentration. The aftertaste brings out acidity. Drink from 2017.",89,Domaine Gérard Fiou 2014 Terroir Silex  (Sancerre)
"Honoring the 40th vintage for these vines, planted at Tualatin Estate in 1973, this elegant and subtle wine shows pinpoint varietal character. It charms immediately with scents of dusty baking spices and cherry pie. Flavors follow into a graceful and proportionate finish.",90,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2013 Vintage 40 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Tannins and a red berry flavor combine in this soft wine. It has the structure of the vintage, with a firm core; the fruit and acidity developing slowly. Keep for 2–3 years.",86,Louis Max 2010 Clos la Marche  (Mercurey)
"An enormously rich wine, flamboyant in blackberries, cherries, Dr. Pepper cola, sweet cured meat, anise and black pepper flavors that sink in deep and last long into the finish. An unusual blend of Malbec, Merlot and Syrah, it's powerful in tannins and bone dry. Grill up your best steak and enjoy.",93,Rocky Hill 2007 Richard Dinner Vineyards Red (Sonoma Mountain)
"Anise, dark cherry, coffee grounds and fig aromas compose the nose on this Bordeaux-style blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Medium to full bodied, this wine bears meaty tannins and alcoholic warmth. Dense notes of cigar box, ash and leather surface on the palate.",87,Sunset Hills 2010 Mosaic Red (Virginia)
"This easygoing Sangiovese opens with fruity aromas of red and black berries. The straightforward, enjoyable palate delivers black cherries and baking spices alongside smooth tannins and fresh acidity.",87,Casa Catelli 2015 Sangiovese (Toscana)
"The Black Sears Vineyard has been source to some of Napa's most impressive Zinfandels over the years, for a number of wineries, including Sattui. With this 2011, they've outdone themselves. The wine is so succulent in black cherry, licorice and mocha flavors, it's hard to resist drinking it all right now. Yes, the alcohol is on the high side, but that's the price of such richness.",92,V. Sattui 2011 Black Sears Vineyard Zinfandel (Howell Mountain)
"A really nice, elegant Chardonnay at a good price. The wine is dry and lightly oaked, showing rich pineapple, peach, vanilla and buttered toast flavors enhanced with crisp acidity. Only 731 cases were produced of this lovely, food-friendly wine.",91,Talley 2008 Chardonnay (Edna Valley)
"Made solidly in the modern cult style of fruity ripeness, softness and rich oak shadings, this inaugural red from Gary Heck is a Cab-based Bordeaux blend with a splash of Sangiovese. It has complicated layers of blackberries, cherries, currants and milk chocolate. Quite delicious in primary fruit flavors, it could well be an ager.",90,Pininfarina 2005 Vino Rosso Red (Napa Valley)
"Plump but not overripe raspberry and alpine strawberry notes greet the nose on this bottling, with hints of shiitake mushrooms, turned earth and lavender. There's lots of herbal depth and chaparral character on the palate, with a touch of candied cherry, all presented with zesty energy that buzzes through the sip.",93,Talley 2013 Rincon Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"Honey and pears on the nose. Bone dry, this wine offers bracing acidity, a crisp fruity core, good focus, and a hint of vanilla on the finish. Very pretty nose; fine food wine.",87,Seven Hills 1999 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"This delightful sparkler delivers aromas and flavors of crisp green apple, lime, white peach and a hint of sage. Vibrant acidity and invigorating bubbles offset the fruit flavors.",87,Zonin NV  Prosecco
"Young spring flowers, lemongrass, green melon and dandelion come to mind and color what is a fresh wine with an easy, no-fuss approach. There's no big complicated story here, but that's exactly the point.",85,Colutta 2007 Friulano (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"Reflecting a cool, rainy vintage, this smells gritty, without a lot of ripeness. The fact that it's racy and drawing on the palate follows suit. Flavors of cherry and plum are subdued, while the finish is spicy in flavor and dry and prickly in feel.",87,Milenrama 2013 Crianza  (Rioja)
"This is a deeply rich and concentrated expression of steely Sauvignon Blanc. The wine is ripe, full in the mouth with yellow fruits vying with citrus and capped by the more tense texture. It could still age, so wait until 2015.",92,Roger et Didier Raimbault 2012 Vieilles Vignes  (Sancerre)
"This has aromas that recall leafy underbrush, sawdust and menthol. The dense, oak-driven palate shows licorice, espresso, toast and a hint of bitter chocolate but the fruit has dried up. It abruptly ends on a green note of powdered sage.",85,Paolo Manzone 2012 Meriame  (Barolo)
"Acidity hits the palate like a shard of glass, immediately followed by rich, concentrated flavors of blackberries, cassis and spices. The tannins are strong, too. All the parts simply have not come together. Will it age well? It's not a slam dunk.",88,Frias 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District)
"This vineyard selection blends Pommard and 667 clones, and spent 16 months in one-sixth new French oak. There's a light touch at work here, crafting clean, fresh flavors of raspberries, with a hint of bitter greens. It's a straightforward enjoyable wine, modest in length and concentration, and finishing with a noticeable vein of butterscotch.",89,Torii Mor 2014 Alloro Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"Easy, appealing and frankly sweet, this is very rich in citrus, tropical fruit and honey flavors. A blend of Roussanne, Grenache Blanc and Viognier.",87,Eberle 2010 Côtes-du-Rôbles Blanc White (Paso Robles)
"While Alicante Bouschet is probably more at home in the Alentejo, this wine from the coastal Lisboa region still has much of the dark color, solid, dry tannins and intensely juicy wild-berry fruits. It is ready to drink.",90,DFJ Vinhos 2014 Grand'Arte Alicante Bouschet (Lisboa)
"Aromas of ripe nectarines entice on the nose of this clean, crisp, medium-bodied Chardonnay. While initially quite soft, there's a tartness towards the midpalate that reflects hints of underripe stone fruit and quince.",84,Tousey 2010 Chardonnay (New York)
"This wine is fresh, crisply fruity and toasty without missing the apple and pear flavors that give juiciness behind the texture. It's ripe and is developing well. Drink from 2017.",88,Domaine Ferret 2013 Les Perrières Tête de Cru  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
"Seductive and forward, the Avec Chêne (with wood) boasts intense aromas of vanilla, butter and cream that frame the superripe peach and guava fruits. A touch of honey and sweet spice add depth to the round, creamy-textured palate. Rich but not overdone, with a sweet orange oil lift to the long, evolving finish. Drink 2013-2015.",91,Simonsig 2010 Avec Chêne Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch)
"Solid, ripe, perfumed and tannic, this is a concentrated, dark wine. Hints of mint and wood frame rich black fruits on the palate. It is a powerful wine with a good future, so drink from 2015.",93,Château de Calavon 2009 La Réserve Red (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence)
"Harsh in mouthfeel, this Cab has cherry, black currant and wintergreen mint flavors, wrapped into firm but fine tannins. For the price, it's not bad for everyday fare.",84,Grayson 2012 Lot 10 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Richly textured and full-bodied, a wine to drink now with fine steaks and chops. Almost sweet, it's opulent in cherry and raspberry jam flavors, with a decadent hint of chocolate. But it's fully dry.",89,a-non-ah-mus 2008 Babcock Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
Exceptionally light feet make this delicate spätlese so quaffable. The palate juxtaposes pristine tangerine and peach flavors against savory notes of saffron and pollen and a high-pitched acidic backbone. It's ready to drink now but should hold well through 2020.,89,Weingut Georg Albrecht Schneider 2014 Niersteiner Hipping Spätlese Riesling (Rheinhessen)
"Soft and rich, with vanilla and quince flavors. A very round, open wine, with only a hint of structure.",87,Louis Latour 2006  Beaune
"Its lavish peach, citrus and blossom perfume makes the Westhofen Brunnenhäuschen stand out boldly in a lineup of Wittmann's excellent 2014 GG Rieslings. Its aromatic intensity extends into the palate, brightening its stony, slatey character. Supple yet steely, it finishes with a hint of lime-pith astringency. While elegant now, this wine should intensify in minerality with age.",93,Wittmann 2014 Westhofen Brunnenhäuschen Trocken GG Riesling (Rheinhessen)
"Henry estate, Scott Henry explains, “is more Alsace/Burgundy country, but we feel we are on the ragged edge of pulling these Bordeaux guys off.” A fair and candid assessment. This is a lean, but not too green, Merlot. It shows dark cherry fruit, some stem and wood, and fairly stiff tannins.",85,Henry Estate 1999 Merlot (Oregon)
"Light, minty, savory aromas of Middle Eastern spices accent basic berry aromas. In the mouth, this is a touch flat. Flavors of herbal, peppery plum and berry fruits finish dry but hollow. The blend is 70% Malbec with 15% each of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.",85,Fabre Montmayou 2012 Phebus MMC Red (Mendoza)
"Deep garnet to the eye, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah offers a rich bouquet of cassis, cherry preserves and lightly buttered toast. Tannins are strong but acidity holds its own among flavors of cherry, blackberry, menthol, pipe tobacco, and dried sage. The finish is marked by a nice tart cranberry note and lingering tannins.",92,Makura Estate 2008 Estate Reserve Red (Upper Galilee)
"Wonderful cedar and tobacco aromas, sophisticated cinnamon and dark-fruit flavors, lavish tannins and full body create a gorgeous taste experience. This wine is plush and generous in texture, and exotic and delicious in flavor. It should age well through at least 2020.",92,Di Arie 2011 Estate Grown & Bottled Tempranillo (El Dorado)
"This Coonawarra Cab is dark and earthy, yet a bit herbal and tobacco-y as well, marrying coffee and herb flavors in a firmly built, full-bodied wine that needs a few years in the cellar to develop greater textural richness.",88,Bowen Estate 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra)
"Fresh and jammy in raspberries, cherries and blackberries, this wine trades complexity for sheer fruity power and lusciousness. Drink now.",87,J Ludlow 2008 Kemsley 1550 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Hints of milk chocolate and spice accent this sumptuously rich, silky wine. Ripe black cherry and berry flavors are approachably juicy and fruity, fringed by soft, feathery tannins.",87,The Old Field 2010 Commodore Perry Merlot (North Fork of Long Island)
"A delicious Pinot Noir. Set it beside more expensive bottlings and it stands up well. Silky and rich, with raspberry and cherry purée, cola, sweet vanilla and sandalwood flavors, and a long, spicy finish. Production was 26,000 cases.",87,Cupcake 2008 Pinot Noir (Central Coast)
"The overriding sentiment is that Limarí is too cool for Carmenère, yet this wine, while a bit sour and rhubarby, is still pretty comfy and satisfying. The flavors rest on plum, blackberry and wood, while olive and carob control the finish. Falls off at the end, but good overall. Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company, LLC.",86,Tamaya 2006 Winemaker's Selection Single Vineyard Carmenère (Limarí Valley)
"It's too bad that this blend of 75% Zinfandel, 12% Cabernet Franc and 13% Syrah is only found in Bermuda. Elderberry, tobacco and blueberry-stuffed chocolate power the dense nose, yet the palate shows a fresh lightness, with mint and menthol lifting the cherry juice and tannic grip that structures the sip.",92,Wild Hogge 2010 Moongate Red (Paso Robles)
"Topped with 18% Malbec, aromas of wood spice, vanilla, pencil lead and dark cherry lead to juicy full-bodied dark-fruit flavors that show a lovely sense of balance, despite the wood being forward. It's a very pretty expression of Cabernet.",90,Ambassador Vineyard 2014 Estate Grown Sunset VIneyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"Ott's new lighter, fresher style continues to develop well. This red-fruited rosé is crisp, deliciously fragrant and bright with a light tangy touch that gives a final bite.",89,Domaines Ott 2013 Château de Selle Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"A light, lemony, refreshing quaff. Zippy, citrusy and clean, with a tart, malic finish, this is made to whet your summertime appetite.",85,Campanile 2002 Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie)
"Lovely aromatics greet you from the moment the cork is pulled, showing a brambly blend of black cherry, cassis, cola and a whiff of dusty barnyard. The tannins are well structured with a black-tea finish. Drink now through 2025.",92,Megan Anne 2014 Lachini Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"Dark cola, black fruit and marzipan aromas give this a sweet bouquet. The palate is solid, with medium-strength tannins supporting cherry, blackberry and mocha flavors. Oak is no stranger to this wine, so expect ample vanilla and chocolate throughout. A bit herbal, which is common for Chilean Cabernet.",89,Odfjell 2005 Orzada Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"This opens with smoke, mint, coconut, red berry and graphite aromas. The palate offers dried red cherry and mineral alongside drying tannins. Enjoy it soon to capture the fruit flavors.",89,Tiefenbrunner 2011 Linticlarus Riserva Pinot Nero (Alto Adige)
"Made with partially dried grapes, Tal Lùc is an extraordinary dessert wine. It offers unlimited generosity and lush tones of honey, butterscotch, marzipan and dried apricot. It has thick, sweet density and ends with piquant crispness. Pair this wine with pâté or foie gras.",94,Lis Neris 2005 Tal Lùc Verduzzo (Friuli)
"This highly aromatic wine starts off with bright aromas of white flowers, fynbos, pink apples and white peaches. The lightweight palate offers clean flavors of peach and melon, with zippy acidity and a brisk finish. It's super tasty and easy to like, so enjoy now.",89,Spier 2016 Chenin Blanc (Western Cape)
Firesteed's value-oriented Pinot is a solid and reliable wine that varies little from vintage to vintage. Flavors of rhubarb and strawberry are set in place with a touch of vanilla wafer. Don't cellar this. It's ready to go.,87,Firesteed 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This bottling starts with a pretty nose of peach, melon and nectarine. It's more about the crisp, refreshing mouthfeel than anything, and would partner well with lightly seasoned shellfish or soft cheese.",84,Proulx 2013 Resistance Willow Creek Farm Rosé (Paso Robles)
"Made with equal parts of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Alicante, this has earthy aromas of black-skinned fruit and game. The dense palate delivers prune, toast and tobacco alongside gripping, rather drying tannins.",87,Poggio Verrano 2010 3 Red (Toscana)
"Warm and fruity, this has an open apricot flavor that's balanced by spice and vanilla from the wood aging. Citrus flavors give a fresh, more medicinal finish.",87,Domaine Ellevin 2009  Chablis
"Woodsy cedar and spice tones swirl into layers of vanilla cream in this intensely oaky, yet enticing Chardonnay. Brisk lemon-lime acidity and fresh apple and pear notes freshen the midpalate.",87,Tousey 2013 Chardonnay (Hudson River Region)
"While it does have a tannic structure, this wine is characterized by its ripe fruits, rich texture and softness. Strong plum jelly and spice are nicely combined to give an in-the-mouth fruitiness that's freshened by the final acidity. Drink this wine from 2017.",89,Clos Junet 2010  Saint-Émilion
"This Sierra Foothills-based winery makes a compelling if atypical Sangiovese that offers black cherry, soy, crushed rock and rose petal scents. Upright tannins present strawberry, black plum and loamy soil flavors, finishing on a sweet-savory hoisin sauce note.",91,1850 2014 Sangiovese (Central Coast)
"Sweet and acidic, with strong gooseberry flavors that veer into ammonia.",81,Clayhouse 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles)
"Powerfully tannic, this dense and firm wine is dark in both color and fruit flavors. Tannins dominate the structure, giving a solid core to a wine that will certainly age. It has richness, juicy berry fruits and plums shining with acidity. Drink from 2018.",90,Château Gramond 2011  Haut-Médoc
"A healthy wine with plenty of oak. On the nose, it's charred as well as fruity, with raspberry and plum aromas blending with vanilla. Feels tight and grippy, with dry oak, herbal flavors and fresh red berry and tomato. Finishes clean and snappy, with correct weight and length. Drink now through 2013.",89,Finca del Marquesado 2005 Reserva  (Rioja)
"Dark strawberry and red-cherry fruit shows on the nose of this bottling by the regional pioneer, leveled by scents of violets, rose petals and pencil lead. Graphite and beet juice start the sip, which evolves into black olive, dried basil and bay leaf sprinkled atop cranberry and elderberry juice.",92,Ken Brown 2013 Rita's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"From a hot year with an early harvest, this Sauvignon smells green and ashy, like asparagus mixed with green tobacco. In the mouth, spunky acidity suggests sharpness, while tangy flavors of nectarine and nettle finish with touches of bell pepper and tarragon.",86,Concha y Toro 2012 Serie Riberas Gran Reserva Ribera del Rapel Sauvignon Blanc (Colchagua Valley)
"Black cherry and cola flavors are entwined, with a hint of earth. Assertive and flavorful, though still wrapped up tightly, this shows a darker side of coffee and licorice, all nicely balanced with the fruit.",90,Coelho 2009 Paciência Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Complex aromas have become a Luisa Ponzi hallmark; this one a potpourri of violets, cherry tobacco, clove and cedar, leading into a light, tart palate bursting with wild strawberries. The alcohol rests at 13.5%, but the wine is fully ripe, just not over the top. Graceful, perfectly executed winemaking, in a difficult vintage.",88,Ponzi 2007 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Vivid, tangy fruit flavors like raspberry and strawberry come with a light sweetness in this medium-bodied lightly tannic wine.",85,Emerald Hare 2015 Emerald Hare Red (California)
"A wood-aged Chardonnay from mountain vineyards above the Douro. The wine has spice, yellow fruits and a strong toast character. Acidity is there to add some freshness to the concentrated, rounded taste.",91,Real Companhia Velha 2009 Quinta de Cidrô Reserva Chardonnay (Duriense)
"Baked apple and pear laced in caramel come to mind first, evoked from the aromatics of this wine. A richness of honey beckons, too. Golden in color and creamy in texture, it's balanced by streamlined acidity that keeps it elegant and refined, moving slowly toward a lengthy, drawn-out finish.",93,Marimar Estate 2012 Don Miguel Vineyard Bonita's Hill Unfiltered Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"On the nose, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère and Petit Verdot smells of spicy berry fruits and black plum along with chocolate and cedar. The palate is a touch drawing and tannic, but in no way harsh or impeding. Spicy black-fruit flavors include notes of olive and herbs, while the finish delivers more of the same. Drink through 2022.",92,Alcance 2013 Bravura Red (Maipo Valley)
"Delicious peach and pear flavors light up this full-bodied, soft and well-rounded wine. It has fresh floral aromas and nicely ripe fruit notes on the palate, with a smooth, graceful texture and beautiful, lingering finish.",91,Fenestra 2015 Chardonnay (Livermore Valley)
"This fruit and acidity-driven wine has bright red cherry and raspberry flavors. Young and fruity, it is best drunk now, although waiting until 2015 will soften the fresh tones.",86,Robert Perroud 2013 L'Enfer des Balloquets  (Brouilly)
"The winery shows its prowess with making delicious, affordable larger-production wines with this bright and easy drinking Cabernet, a study in soft tannins, juicy cranberry/currant fruit and composed structure. It's a good one to stock up on at the price and quality.",90,Robert Mondavi 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Inky and black, this dense Amarone boasts thick layers of ripe fruit, mesquite wood, black stone and root beer. The wine has a raw, fresh quality and closes with thick, gritty tannins.",87,Fattoria Garbole 2004  Amarone della Valpolicella
"From a challenging Napa Valley vintage, this red is made in what the winemaker calls a “Right Bank” style, blending 56% Cabernet Franc with 42% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Sauvignon from vineyards such as Hyde in Carneros. The wine is brimming in dark plum and severe chocolate and cherry, with a reasonable amount of grip.",87,Virage 2010 Red (Napa Valley)
"A touch of evolution is immediately apparent: that chamomile lift and dried citrus peel nose gives it away. The  dry palate then serves up notions of ripe but tart apple, incisive lemon freshness and a more generous, fluid rich texture that play off each other beautifully. On the finish it is the lemon that shines, alongside some notions of candle wax and more chamomile. A lovely snapshot of a Riesling on its trajectory. Drink 2017-2027.",93,Cave du Roi Dagobert 2013 Altenberg-Bergbieten Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"This is off-dry, roughly 2% residual sugar, and it nicely balances the sugar and the acids, using the floral and spicy character of the grape to fill out the middle. It's a pretty wine, fruity with peach, melon and grapefruit.",86,Hogue 2007 Gewürztraminer (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a massive, powerful Chardonnay, a New World style that's superripe and heavily oaked. You either like it or you don't. Aficionados of this approach will love the opulence of the honey, pineapple jam, apricot, crème brûlée, vanilla and buttercream flavors. Calls for very rich dishes, like lobster.",92,Sbragia 2006 Gamble Ranch Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Aromas of baked plum, spirits, baking spice and a whiff of blue flower lead the nose on this robust wine. The hearty palate offers dried black cherry, raw cranberry, leather and licorice alongside firm tannins and racy acidity. You'll also detect the warmth of alcohol on the finish.",88,Giacomo Grimaldi 2011  Barolo
"Le Mie Donne has a complex nose of smoked meat, musky fruit and earthiness. Although they carry through to the palate, they come in a less intense form, and the finish is short to medium. Could have used a little more concentration, but a pleasant complex wine.",87,Cascina Adelaide 2004 Le Mie Donne  (Barbera d'Alba)
"Although a flinty touch of reduction still hangs on the nose, freshness and verve await underneath. The palate is juicy, slight, dry and very refreshing. It offers a slender, lemony expression of Pinot Blanc with a clean-cut finish.",89,Strauss 2016 Classic Pinot Blanc (Steiermark)
"This pruny smelling Malbec, Cabernet and Petit Verdot blend hits with a thud. Stewy and overripe, this tastes raisiny and like little else. Similar on the finish.",84,Doña Paula 2013 Estate Black Edition Red (Mendoza)
"This is a blend of Chenin Blanc and Viognier that's zesty in acidity and slightly sweet in honeyed flavor. Immensely fruity, it bears notes of orange, green apple, lime and vanilla. A versatile wine to drink with today's spectrum of ethnic fare.",86,Pepi 2011 Chenin Blanc-Viognier (California)
"This is a ripe wine, with wood aging that has smoothed the fruit intensity while keeping the rich apple and pear flavors. An unmistakable tang of minerality comes from the youthful texture. With its dense character, it's a wine to age. Drink from 2017.",91,Domaine Vincent Pinard 2014 Nuance  (Sancerre)
"This shows plenty of grip as soon as it hits the tongue, with chewy tannins surrounding flavors of tobacco, earth and herb. The fruit is reminiscent of light plum, but it's the earthy, stemmy flavors that dominate, lending bitterness to the finish.",85,Basel Cellars 2009 Pheasant Run Vineyard Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"For those who want classically grassy and energetic Sauv Blanc flavors, this widely available bottling is perfect. Aromas of both boisterously tropical fruit and funky cut grass lead into a zingy palate of white pepper, bell pepper, cement and lime.",89,J. Lohr 2014 Flume Crossing Sauvignon Blanc (Arroyo Seco)
"As a Corton-Charlemagne should be, this is big and opulent. The minerality is quite present, a fresh addition to a wine that has more to do with ripe, racy tropical and yellow fruits that fill the mouth. It is not a wine for aging, maybe 2–3 years, but is certainly delicious now.",93,Albert Bichot 2006 Domaine du Pavillon  (Corton-Charlemagne)
"This is a savory wine whose price makes it a decent value. It's crisp in acidity, with off-dry lemon, lime, tangerine and honey flavors. Easy to drink with almost anything that calls for a slightly sweet white wine.",85,Materra Cunat Family Vineyards 2012 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Oak Knoll District)
"Schloss Vollrad's standard-label Kabinett has a distinctly sheer, almost ephemeral lightness. Juicy white peach and grapefruit flavors shine brightly on the palate, but are edged by angularities of acidity and crushed stone. It finishes long with a lingering kiss of sweetness.",90,Schloss Vollrads 2014 Kabinett Riesling (Rheingau)
"It's not often you find a varietal Piquepoul Blanc outside of the south of France, but this seems to suit well to the hot Texan climate. Striking notes of ripe peach, apricot and white lily carry the nose and palate. There's good tension and texture in this light- to medium-bodied wine, which would lend well to pairing alongside grilled seafood.",88,McPherson 2015 Timmons Ranch Piquepoul Blanc (Texas)
"John Chiarito is the first American to petition for the right to label his wine Nero d'Avola, a variety he grows just outside of the town of Ukiah in eastern Mendocino and a nod to his family's Southern Italian heritage (the grape is native to Sicily). Here he's made an outstandingly intriguing, rustic, big fruit, high-acid red that'll surprise you as it opens, very Old World and definitely worth a try if you can find it. Only 60 cases produced.",91,Chiarito 2007 Estate Bottled Nero d'Avola (Mendocino)
"Briary berry and cassis aromas are spicy and solid. In the mouth, this Carmenère is raw and tartaric in feel. Salty plum, coffee and herbal green flavors finish about the same, with a note of cured meat and residual acidic tang.",85,François Lurton 2015 Hacienda Araucano Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"With brick-colored edges and gritty aromas of turned earth, raw oak, asphalt and berry fruits, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot feels tight, with rubbery tannins. Oak-infused flavors of herbal blackberry, mint and anise finish with notes of licorice and chocolate as well as a touch of heat. Drink through 2021.",92,Cousiño-Macul 2010 Lota Red (Maipo Valley)
"Another wildly complicated Pinot Noir from Bradley Brown, this smells of crimini mushrooms, smoldering chemise and sweet cherry tomato reduction sauce, with a pinch of cinnamon. It's lush with soft red and purple fruit once sipped, with smoky spice on the edges and smashed olives throughout.",91,Big Basin 2012 Lester Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"The wine is attractive with its ripe apple flavors and shot of lemon. It is off dry, with a fruity character that makes it a great apéritif wine. Drink now.",86,Enoport 2016 Vinhas Altas White (Vinho Verde)
"A single-vineyard wine that displays creamed pear and apple flavors, softly touched with wood. It's an elegant wine, although whether wood aging and Grüner go together is a debateable point. Let the wood soften and it will show more of the ripe fruit. Screwcap.",91,Dürnberg 2009 Rabenstein Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"A fifty-fifty blend of native grape Monica and Sangiovese, this fresh, fruity rosato is loaded with ripe cherry, juicy strawberry and crushed raspberry alongside a hint of white pepper. Zesty acidity lends balance and a bright, easy-drinking vibe.",88,Pala 2014 Silenzi Rosato (Isola dei Nuraghi)
"This heavily oaked wine starts closed; only clove and asphalt aromas escape. In the mouth, it's sinewy in feel, with overly demanding wood-based tannins. The flavor profile is all burnt oak and clove, while showing barely any fruit.",83,Bodega Carmine Granata 2010 Tradicional Oak Cask Malbec (Mendoza)
"This wine is showy on the nose, with lilacs, lavender-laced crème brûlée and dense dried-black-cherry aromas that prove inviting. It is elegantly framed on the palate, with lots of lavender, potpourri, dried thyme and oregano set against the rich, dark-red fruits.",92,Justin 2013 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"This spritzy, weird wine opens with grassy aromas that are backed by a coarse, bubbly palate with flavors of banana, lettuce and bitter greens.",80,Tussock Jumper 2011 Moscato (Valencia)
"Focused, deep and rich, this lovely vineyard designate is dotted with notes of charcoal, caramel and mocha. It offers both power and finesse, a rare combination, with persistent flavors, anchored on a substantial core of raspberry and cherry fruit. Drink now through 2026.",93,Sineann 2015 Zenith Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Fine, aromatic wine, very cherry, its structure and bright fruits already integrating well. Acidity is a dominant element, with the underlying tannins pushing through the intense juiciness.",87,Domaine de Leyre-Loup 2010  Fleurie
"Orange marmalade and sweet acidity mark this as a particularly rich style of Beerenauslese. The botrytis is intense, but even this cannot overwhelm the great sweetness and richness.",89,Zull 2006 Riesling Beerenauslese Riesling (Niederösterreich)
"Spritzy, lively and quite dry, this mixes citrus rind phenolics with apple and pear fruit. It's simple, fruity and searingly tart.",86,Buddha Kat 2013 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Sourced from Mount Barker, this is a full-bodied, supple example of WA Shiraz. Concentrated plummy fruit is marked by hints of menthol and peppery spice, then ends in a soft wash of dusty tannins and mouthwatering acids. Drink now–2020+.",91,West Cape Howe 2009 Two Steps Shiraz (Western Australia)
"Fresh and vibrant, with ripe cherry, red currant, cola and cedar flavors wrapped into a silky texture. A bit rough and acidic, though. Could develop in the bottle for a few years.",87,Twomey 2007 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
"This has been barrel-fermented and aged, yet it retains more than a hint of the grape's natural herbaceousness. Sharp-edged and assertive, it might pass for a Quincy from the Loire Valley.",88,Columbia Crest 2011 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Moderately aromatic for the variety, this wine shows aromas of flowers, pear and mandarin orange. It drinks medium sweet with lightly spritzy flavors that need a bit more acid to hold them all together.",87,Januik 2013 Bacchus Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))
"There's a hint of caramelized sugar on the nose of this off-dry Gewürztraminer that gives an edge to all the succulent sweet pear nectar and apple blossoms notes that permeate the palate. Elegantly floral, it finishes with a touch of characteristic orange and clove spice.",85,Knapp 2010 Sunrise Hill Vineyard Semi-Dry Gewürztraminer (Cayuga Lake)
"A weird Cabernet with unfamiliar, odd aromas. Tight as nails and sheering, with sour plum and incongruent buttery oak flavors. Barrel influence shows up on the finish. Needs polish and improvement.",81,Casa Valduga 2007 Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Vale dos Vinhedos)
"Good price for a Cabernet of this quality, and one that's been aged for four-plus years. It's soft and mellow and drinkable now, with enjoyable blackberry, currant, licorice, spice and cedar flavors.",87,Le Vigne 2006 Kiara Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Tight, pure blackberry and cassis aromas are composed. This is a better-balanced wine than the sticky, overly oaked 2012 version. Leading toasty chocolate flavors go well with secondary spiced berry and cassis notes. A note of vanilla comes out on the finish.",91,Montes 2013 La Finca Clos D'Angel Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"Compostable earth marks the entry of this clonal exploration—a robust, full-bodied and ripely warm wine.With mint, pine and black tea accents, it offers wild raspberry and rhubarb fruit, bringing a homemade pie to mind.",91,Davis Bynum 2014 Jane's Vineyard Clone 23 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This ripe, jammy wine is all about fruit. Its red berry flavors burst from the glass and are gently backed by tannins. It is already attractive, ripe and full. Drink from 2019.",88,Domaine les Carmels 2015 Les Vendanges  (Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux)
"This private selection is nicely structured, pitting clean raspberry fruit against tight tannins. Those strong components are accented with touches of cola and earth and a subtle undercurrent of barrel toast.",91,Dois Irmãos 2015 Two Brothers' Private Selection Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This opens with smoke, mint, coconut, red berry and graphite aromas. The palate offers dried red cherry and mineral alongside drying tannins. Enjoy it soon to capture the fruit flavors.",89,Tiefenbrunner 2011 Linticlarus Riserva Pinot Nero (Alto Adige)
"Earthy, meaty notes interwoven with an attractive pine scent make for a sexy nose. The palate is a bit simpler, with straightforward cherry and tart berry flavors. Tangy cranberry notes mark the finish. Drink now–2012.",86,Evans & Tate 2005 Shiraz (Margaret River)
"This blends Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris and Pinot Meunier, with a slightly sweet dosage providing rich creaminess. Soft, moderate acidity leans against a taste of vanilla cream, ripe peach and honey.",88,Mumm Cuvée Napa NV Cuvée M Sparkling (Napa County)
"Only if you enjoy very lean, ultrafresh and tart red wines will this work. It starts with simple punchbowl aromas of red grapes and berry, and then comes a skinny, tart, grating palate that's all acid and no substance. Calling it “traditional” or a “terroir” wine would only be misleading.",81,Torre Castillo 2008 Monastrell (Jumilla)
"From a dependable producer and a fine vintage comes a problematic wine. The fruit is nicely ripe and suggestive of apples and peaches, and it's balanced and dry. Acidity is adequate. The only jarring note is a strongly toasted character, almost like charcoal, which you can both smell it and taste. Even the finish is marred by this burnt flavor.",84,Clos du Bois 1999 Reserve Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"This Dolcetto offers a correct nose with fresh layers of cherry, blueberry and wild berries. There isn't huge intensity here but the wine does offer a full, soft mouthfeel with some mild tannins on the close.",86,Cantine San Silvestro 2009 Primaio  (Dolcetto d'Alba)
"Aromas of blackberry, blue flower, coffee and toast take center stage on this young, forward wine. The palate offers dried black cherry, espresso and black pepper alongside evolved tannins.",87,Tenimenti Famiglia Cavallero 2012 La Fenice Nebbiolo (Langhe)
"A fresh, grassy aroma and lively grapefruit and herb flavors give a lot of zest to this medium-bodied and almost peppery wine.",89,Francis Ford Coppola 2015 Diamond Collection Yellow Label Sauvignon Blanc (California)
"This is a dry, light and easy going wine, made entirely from Pinot Noir. The palate is refreshing in its firm grasp of cherry and raspberry flavors.",87,Educated Guess 2016 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Napa Valley)
"On first sniff you may want to head for the hills; Maturana is a funky smelling grape with strong herbaceous notes. And while that character never subsides, this smells better with time. Flavors of mint, bell pepper and herbal berry fruits finish round, long and saucy. Only 160 cases of this unusual wine were made.",87,Dinastía Vivanco 2010 Colección Vivanco Parcelas  (Rioja)
"With its firm, black fruits, this is a very chunky wine, mineral in character. It has tension, with tannins layered with intense flavors, very structured. It needs aging. One of a series of single-vineyard wines created by Jean-Luc Baldès.",93,Jean-Luc Baldès 2007 Clos Triguedina Les Galets Malbec (Cahors)
"Raspberry, licorice and dark-fruit aromas lead to plump, fleshy fruit flavors. It's an unabashedly warm-vintage wine that brings a lot of drinking pleasure.",90,Full Pull & Friends 2013 Red Willow Vineyard Merlot (Yakima Valley)
"Aromas of white peach, banana, yellow apple and candied lemon peel carry over to the creamy, rather sweet palate along with a confectionery note. Fresh acidity lifts the rich flavors while a hint of almond gives it a slightly bitter finish.",88,Astoria NV Arzanà Dry  (Valdobbiadene Superiore di Cartizze)
"A new label and partnership from longtime local growers Ned Hill and Matt Stornetta, this coastal wine is unoaked and picked to preserve acidity. Lemon zest and candied apple rise on the nose, along with a sense of creamy Nilla wafer, before finishing crisp and clean.",88,Sonoma Collection 2014 District 3 Growers Reserve Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"You'll find ripe plum, forest floor, exotic spice, menthol and espresso aromas in this structured red. The palate is bright and linear with youthful tension, delivering red cherry, strawberry, white pepper and anise notes set against compact, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2020–2030.",91,Pietroso 2012  Brunello di Montalcino
"Dried blackberry aromas include welcome notes of cigar box and tar. This moderately complex Tannat is lush, round and smooth. Flavors of black plum and blackberry are supported by toasty oak, while this tastes blackened and spicy on a silky smooth finish. Drink through 2022.",92,Bouza 2015 B6 Parcela Única Tannat (Canelones)
"This wine appears to mark a departure from Trottevieille's normally strict style, showing more opulence, new wood and ripeness. There is still a touch of austerity initially, but from that point, the wine opens out with a great burst of fresh blackberry jelly and stylish texture.",93,Château Trottevieille 2006  Saint-Émilion
"Pristine Asian pear and lemon perfume on the nose of this full bodied Chardonnay take a slightly darker savory tone on the palate. The mouthfeel is rich and textured, but brambly slightly vegetal notes and a bite of astringency distract on the finish.",85,Heron Hill 2015 Unoaked Ingle Vineyard Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"A very fine example of Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, showing the elegance and complexity wines from that Sonoma County region can attain. Soft and intricate in tannins, the wine shows a mélange of blackberry, currant, cherry, sweet dried herb and smoky flavors that are delicious now, and should hold well for several years.",92,Joseph Family 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Seemingly as tart as a Riesling can get despite having residual sugar of 1.2%, this lemony lip-smacker shows good concentration. It would be a gem with the right foods, but on its own, the searingly tart acids may be too much for most tasters.",87,Anam Cara 2011 Nicholas Estate Dry Riesling (Chehalem Mountains)
"This is a meaty and mature Negroamaro with ripe notes of black olive, earth and leather. It has raw, gritty tannins and chewy succulence with some bitter cherry on the close.",85,Conti Zecca 2006 Donna Marzia Negroamaro (Salento)
"Dark, minty and fiery on first take, this folds in aromas of licorice and oaky lemon peel along with spicy berry fruit. Firm and tightly built, this is spicy, peppery and chocolaty on a canvas of berry and cassis. Powerful, toasty and a touch hot on the finish.",89,Alta Vista 2014 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"This is a good, everyday Zin with some extra features of fanciness. It's dry and tannic and full-bodied, the way you want Zin to be, with modest flavors of cherries, currants, mint, pepper and tobacco.",86,Goats Trail 2007 Zinfandel (California)
"This is classic Cabernet, from the reticent aromas of pencil shavings to the restrained flavors of cassis and cigar box. It's on the full-bodied side of the spectrum, with enough dusty tannins to suggest longevity through at least 2020, despite an already velvety finish.",92,Balgownie Estate 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Bendigo)
"Chewy, chunky, a little buttery and full of milk chocolate, this crowd pleaser is a good introduction to Tuscan Sangiovese. It will work well with simple dishes like pizza and pasta. It's young and gawky, like a teenager going through adolescence.",85,Capezzana 2000 Conti Contini  (Carmignano)
"The success of this wine owes as much to Merlot as to Cabernet. The Merlot has created the ripeness and smoothness of the wine. While the Cabernet keeps it firm and closed up, there is a base of rich, sweet fruit here that will show over the next two years. The style of the wine is moving away from elegance to power under the new regime of owners, Champagne Roederer.",94,Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande 2006  Pauillac
"With its earthy aromas and soft palate, this is a rustic wine, the sort designed for pairing with grilled meat. It has black plum flavors along with spice and bright red fruits. Drink now.",85,Falua 2009 Tâmara Red (Tejo)
"Punchy tannin and oak wrap around brushy sage and a taste of the mountain site, herbal and rocky in a wet stone kind of minerality. Juicy cassis and black currant provide a brightness of fruit and roundedness that offsets the more powerful concentration that just begs to be paired with grilled meat.",90,Textbook 2013 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Made from fruit that's sourced from over 50-year-old vines, this is a rich, concentrated single-vineyard wine. It shows notes of tropical fruit and pear, with just the right amount of crisp acidity. A dash of pepper gives spice to the wine. Showing its origins in the cool region of Weinviertel, the wine ends with a crisp bite of lemon.",91,Dürnberg 2011 Rabenstein Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel)
"This wonderful ruby-colored Riserva delivers notes of ripe cherry, milk chocolate, herbs and pipe tobacco. It has loads of zest and pizzazz, with lingering spice tones, solid structure and silky tannins. It presents a complete and very pretty package.",90,Barone Ricasoli 2005 Riserva Rocca Guicciarda  (Chianti Classico)
"Red violet in color, this wine offers a bouquet of black cherry, raspberry, apple peel and nutmeg. There are flavors of black cherry, eucalyptus, flint and black tea, with a touch of tart cherry. Strong but not overpowering tannins remain on the palate, along with flavors of mint and fresh berries.",92,Dalton 2012 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Galilee)
"Grown on the sandy soil of Tejo, the wine is typically soft and open. It is very accessible—with black fruits and light tannins for this grape. It is ready to drink.",86,Adega Cooperativa do Cartaxo 2014 Bridão Touriga Nacional (Tejo)
"This is an intriguing red, with its nose of dried fennel, eucalyptus, and rosemary, and on the palate, pretty flavors of cassis and anise. Though gentle, the wine has balance and character. Imported by Wine Emporium.",85,Pillitteri 2002 Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Niagara Peninsula)
"There is a wonderfully aromatic element of something floral and tropical on the nose of this unusual Pinot Gris. The fruit expression is very ripe, reminiscent of melon and juicy pear, highlighted with pineapple and fresh lemon, but there also is ample zesty freshness for balance. If you thought you had tasted all that Pinot Gris has to offer, taste this one, which was created from unpruned vines left to their own devices and bearing deliciously few clusters of delicious fruit.",91,Meinklang 2015 Graupert Pinot Gris (Burgenland)
"Briny, cool-coast aromas of pinched plum and berry lead to a full-bodied palate bolstered by high acidity. Tart plum, cherry and herbal flavors finish crisp, short and basic. This is a good, standard Pinot Noir, nothing more or less.",87,Santa Carolina 2014 Reserva de Familia Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley)
"As it ages, Muscadet becomes more like Chardonnay. Here, the wine has developed ripe tropical fruit notes and a smooth, creamy texture. The seven years of age has softened the fruit and acidity, leaving a rich wine that is deliciously ready to drink now.",91,Chateau de l'Oiselinière 2007 Les Grands Gâts Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"Fairly reserved on both the nose and palate, this bottling begins with roasted apple, peach and chalk scents. The palate offers lemon and grapefruit peel and Gravenstein apple flavors.",88,Lucienne 2015 Lone Oak Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"This Sauvignon Blanc from Bulgaria's Thracian Valley has bright aromas of lemon grass, citrus blossom and freshly mowed lawn. It is medium bodied in the mouth, with flavors of freshly cut pineapple, guava and lemon meringue pie. The finish is clean, crisp and fruit filled.",90,Bulgariana 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Thracian Valley)
"Cabernet Sauvignon (81%) takes the lead on this wine with the rest Merlot. Intriguing aromas of dried herb, moist earth, funk and blackberry reveal a palate full of concentrated fruit and savory flavors. It shows a sense of freshness and finesse.",93,Cayuse 2013 Camespelo Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This crisp red blend from the Langhe in northern Italy offers sharp notes of dill and green olive backed by forest berry and white cherry. There's a taut, linear feel that is enhanced by the wine's fine, compact texture.",87,Virna Borgogno 2008 Red (Langhe)
"This is a textured wine with strong minerality as well as ripe white stone fruits. It is still young, full of life as well as intense fruitiness. The herbal hint at the end will integrate as this fine wine ages further. Drink from 2018.",92,Domaine Matthias et Emile Roblin 2015 Ammonites  (Sancerre)
"Woody berry aromas are solid but standard. This blend of Marselán, Tannat and Merlot is hard as nails, with rubbery tannins. Saucy plum flavors are green and spicy, while this shows abrasive residual tannins on a firm but limited finish.",85,Familia Traversa 2015 Noble Alianza Reserva Marselan-Tannat-Merlot Red (Uruguay)
"Scents of pine pitch, tomato, smashed kalamata olive and wild berry combine for a clove-soaked punch experience. Spice hits the palate hard, with oregano, thyme, sagebrush and more pine, set against strong tannins as well. Lay this one down for additional development and maturity, and try after 2018.",92,Mercy 2010 Cedar Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco)
"With significant amounts of Mourvèdre (15%) and Grenache (8%) blended in, this drinks more like a GSM than a Syrah. Cranberry, herb and woodspice aromas are followed by tart, sleek fruit and smoke flavors that linger.",89,:Nota Bene 2012 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Although this is a delicate wine in terms of aroma and flavor, it has a vividly tart texture that's especially refreshing. It smells subdued, resembling cucumber and white pepper, then the flavors add white peach and crisp apple notes. This will make a great match with raw oysters, sushi and other appetizers.",89,Dancing Coyote 2013 Estate Grüner Veltliner (Clarksburg)
"This blend of 40% Sangiovese, 40% Merlot and 20% Malbec is an intentionally beastly wine, with aromas of black cherry liqueur and plum brandy overcoming the nose. It's quite thick on the palate with cherry syrup and licorice flavors, but they are properly laced with decent tannins and acidity.",88,Midnight 2010 Capriccio Italien Red (Paso Robles)
"Pinot Gris, with its pale-pink skin, is the grape of choice in Reuilly for rosés. With a color that matches pale rosés from Provence, the wine is lightly spicy while also dry. Its balanced acidity is just right. Drink now.",88,Domaine de Reuilly 2015 Pinot Gris Rosé (Reuilly)
"Attractive for its rich creaminess, this Chard aims for the popular style and succeeds. It's soft and rich in orange, peach, apricot and mango fruit, with sweet-oak overtones of vanilla and buttered toast.",88,La Crema 2011 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Sangiovese with 25% Merlot for added softness and dimension, this wine boasts pretty notes of cherry, blue flowers, toasted almonds and exotic spice. It has nice elegance overall but is a bit compact in the mouth.",87,Mazzei 2004 Poggio alla Badiola Sangiovese (Toscana)
"The nonvintage blend from this producer reveals the house style with its crisp character, tangy citrus fruits and great acidity. It is floral, fruity while also sitting on the dry side of Brut. Drink this finely balanced wine now.",89,Boizel NV Brut Réserve  (Champagne)
"Fragrant hints of white summer blossom also hold a riper, fruitier, almost tropical promise. The light palate is poised with lemony freshness and more of those enticing aromatic overtones. A perfect, light and utterly appetizing summer wine.",88,Zantho 2015 Muskat (Burgenland)
"Aromas of grilled herb, roasted hazelnut and cured meat follow through to the palate along with leather and a gamy note. Showing the heat of the vintage, this is already evolved and the fruit richness has started to dry up.",86,Renzo Seghesio 2009 Pajana  (Barolo)
"This lightly sparkling, low-alcohol wine is off dry but with bracing acidity. It features a refreshing mix of apple, peach and citrus fruit, making it perfect as a chilled apéritif, or as a mixer for a wine punch or cocktail.",90,Noble Estate 2013 Semi-Sparkling Muscat (Willamette Valley)
"Cherry syrup and wet chewing tobacco aromas make for a unique nose. There is good acidity and decent tannic structure, but the dried cherry flavors are quite light for the strong scents.",87,Cooper-Garrod 2008 George's Vineyard Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"High-pitched in freshness, this white includes 14% Sémillon, which accentuates a backbone of thick texture and measured oak. Light bodied, it offers flavors of fresh green apple, papaya and pear.",87,Whitehall Lane 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford)
"Minty and light, the fruit here does not seem to have obtained optimal ripeness, even for rosé. Scents and flavors suggest pine needle and wintergreen rather than any hint of berry or melon.",84,Underwood 2014 Rosé (Oregon)
"This new Mistral is roughly half Grenache, the rest a mix of Syrah and four other grapes. It's immediately appealing, loaded with brown spices, plum cake, raisins and chocolate.",89,Convergence Zone 2011 Mistral Red (Red Mountain)
"Intensely aromatic of exotic spice, potpourri and dried fig, this dry Gewürztraminer is a bit atypical, but thought provoking and enjoyable. Lemon and apple flavors have a slightly yeasty tone, but brisk acidity and puckering tea-leaf tannins lend elegance and balance.",87,Anthony Nappa 2013 Spezia Gewürztraminer (North Fork of Long Island)
"Coming from a vineyard on the eastern slope of the Salinas Valley near the Chalone appellation, this Santa Cruz-made, 20% whole-cluster wine smells of blackberry, unearthed tree roots and licorice. Core flavors of brown spice are surrounded by ripe raspberry and racy, potent acidity.",91,Big Basin 2012 Coastview Vineyard Pinot Noir (Monterey County)
This unidentified blend is simple and ripe with flavors of cola and cherry candy.,81,Insatiable NV Red (California)
"This crisp, green-fruit-flavored wine has refreshing acidity along with a tangy, citrus texture that is immediately attractive. A mineral edge gives this wine extra bite. Drink now.",87,Domaine Ellevin 2014  Chablis
"Plum and cherry fruit show on the nose of this blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Merlot, 10% Malbec, 10% Cabernet Franc and 10% Petit Verdot, but an iodine character adds a counterpoint to the fruit. Deep black fruit shows on the palate, meshing with savory spice and lifted by boisterous acidity.",91,Midnight 2012 Mare Nectaris Reserve Red (Paso Robles)
"The mouthfeel of this wine is just right—an airy, delicate lacework that glides the flavors over the tongue. But the flavors are just so-so, harkening back to the Kinks famous line, “C-O-L-A cola.” Finishes with some dry tannins and a touch of citrus. —J.C.",85,Nepenthe 1999 Pinot Noir (South Australia)
"Candied fruit, cherry liqueur and a touch of Sherry shape a dense wine with a sour finish. The wine will probably taste too bitter if not paired with a soft, slightly sweet dish that makes use of cream or butter elements.",83,Vino dei Fratelli 2006  Montepulciano d'Abruzzo
"From one of the longest established producers in Montefalco, this gorgeous wine shows the real potential of Sagrantino. It has an alluring fragrance of rose, violet, berry, spice and leather while the palate delivers lush black cherry, blackberry, licorice and white pepper. It has powerful but ripe tannins alongside vibrant acidity, and will develop beautifully. Drink 2015–2029.",94,Milziade Antano 2009  Sagrantino di Montefalco
"This is a simple, straightforward combination of apple and caramel, light-bodied with layers of texture and complexity. A great midweek wine that works for larger gatherings as well, it's a great example of cool-climate fruit that isn't overdone in oak or ripeness.",88,Cuvaison 2014 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Carneros)
"This no-fuss blend of Chardonnay and Fiano offers simple tones of citrus and pear that segue to a crisp, clean mouthfeel. Pair this fresh southern Italian white with insalata di mare (seafood salad).",86,Villa Mottura 2011 Le Pitre White (Salento)
"Clean, crisp and stony aromas of lime zest, nectarine, peach blossom and chalk show on this brisk blend. There's lots of zing on the palate, with flavors of tangerine, lime and an array of citrus.",91,Brecon Estate 2014 Viognier-Grenache Blanc (Paso Robles)
"This is hard and tough, all tannins and extraction.",83,Château de la Vieille Tour 2012  Bordeaux Supérieur
"A return to elegance, this aromatic, inviting wine suggests ripe fruit dusted with cocoa powder. Raspberries pack a juicy wallop, balanced against hints of clean earth and ripe tannins.",91,Ken Wright 2011 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir
"From a 2.4-acre vineyard with vines that are 60 years old, this is a tight, mineral wine, very pure and with a line of acidity and crisp apple flavors. Very perfumed, it is fresh but also densely textured, finishing with tannins and concentration as well as liveliness. Drink from 2018.",93,Domaine Sébastien Dampt 2013 Vaillons Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"With a silky texture and mouthwatering acidity, this is a polished Pinot Noir. It's dry and spicy, with raspberry jam, Dr. Pepper, red plum and sandalwood flavors that finish with an earthy touch of mushrooms. Makes for lovely drinking now, and should age well for eight years.",90,The Gardener 2012 Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"This expression beautifully showcases Moscato d'Asti's typical sweet, musky aroma, along with notes of peach, citrus, white flower and honey.",87,Adriano Marco & Vittorio 2011  Moscato d'Asti
"Restrained but flinty, this is a fresh and mellow wine with enough texture to be serious. Zesty acidity gives a lovely lift.",89,Josef Ehmoser 2012 Hohenberg Grüner Veltliner (Wagram-Donauland)
"Here is a quintessentially luminous and fragrant white wine from southern Italy (made with 100% Chardonnay, two thirds of which was aged in oak) that delivers food-friendly appeal, succulence and a sophisticated approach. The wine is thick and luscious on the palate and offers slightly sweet flavors of exotic fruit, mango and papaya.",88,Tenuta Rapitalà 2006 Grand Cru Chardonnay (Sicilia)
"The wine comes from Symington vineyards in the Douro Superior, recognized as a top Douro region for red wines. This wood-aged wine has spice and some firm tannins giving it richness and concentration. It also has juicy black fruits and acidity that keep the wine crisp and fruity. Drink from 2018.",90,Symington Family Estates 2014 Altano Reserva Red (Douro)
"This blend of 80% Roussanne and 20% Clairette is rich and round, sumptuous and honeyed. It's largely barrel fermented, and carries a hint of tannin through the finish, which actually helps balance out the wine's lushness. Drink now.",91,Château Pesquié 2009 Quintessence White (Ventoux)
"Aromas of prune, raisin and baking spice lead the nose. The youthfully austere, primary palate shows raisin and ground pepper alongside bracing tannins that clench the finish. Give the tannins another couple of years then drink to capture the remaining fruit.",88,Arnaldo Caprai 2013 Collepiano  (Montefalco Sagrantino)
"This vineyard is within the Oak Knoll District, a cooler section of the Napa Valley's southern end. Tart, tangy and richly woven, the wine is salty, with notes of toasted oak, apple skin and oyster shell. This shows a combination of savory spice and lush ripeness.",90,Groth 2015 Hillview Vineyard Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Very light in the glass, this bottling from Richard Sanford's label shows apples, orange rind, scratched lime and tonic notes on the nose. Once sipped, the intriguing texture is grippy, the flavors are tightly wound and the finish is mouthwatering, with lemon, lime pith and kumquat elements.",89,Alma Rosa 2014 Pinot Gris (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Clean, stylish and easy to like, this has apple and green herb aromas. It shows a good weight and mouthfeel, with papaya, thyme and baked apple flavors. Medium long and smooth on the finish, this is a commendable value-priced bubbly.",88,Mas Fi NV Brut Sparkling (Cava)
"Opening with a bouquet of red berries complemented by an earthy element, this Merlot offers more fruit on the palate, together with a spicy note. A medium-weight wine with decent acidity, it finishes dry, with more berry and earth notes.",85,La Palma 1999 Merlot (Rapel Valley)
"This blend of grapes from Bien Nacido, Presqu'ile and Riverbench vineyards is light in color with aromas of turned earth, dust and sliced strawberries. It's elegant and lean on the palate, with lots of slate and graphite minerality warming up toward macerated strawberry sauce. Pair with everything from white fish to pork tenderloin.",92,La Fenêtre 2012 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"A blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, this opens with rich, concentrated aromas of black fruit and milk chocolate. There are savory notes of dark pipe tobacco, clove and cardamom. The palate is masculine and powerful, with firm tannins.",90,Aia Vecchia 2010 Lagone Red (Toscana)
"There is a savory touch of salt and herb amidst the fruity mirabelle plum notes on the nose. The palate shows a lovely background of autolytic richness, akin to sponge and rye bread and also has a piquant salty accent that entices all the way to the lemony bright finish. The mousse is fine and elegant, the finish is long and dry.",92,René Muré NV Cuvée Prestige Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"This is really a nice Cabernet Sauvignon. Soft and polished, it shows herb and cassis flavors, wrapped in rich smoky oak, with a long, dry finish. The tannins are quite strong now, giving the wine a chewy toughness and suggesting moderate aging. Hold until after 2008.",90,Gia Domella 2005 E. Passalacqua Heritage Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"The Momtazi vineyard supplies these grapes. The wine has a sharp edge to it, a sense of raw wood that pushes against tart, stiff red fruits. Whiffs of smoke and salted chocolate add welcome nuances. The winery's AVA series provides interesting, nicely differentiated wines at somewhat moderate (for Oregon Pinot) prices.",89,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2012 AVA Series Pinot Noir (McMinnville)
"There is a distinct nutty smoky impression on the nose. The concentrated palate also comes with shades of vanilla and hazelnut, wrapping its fresh lemon and herbal spice into a warming intriguing cloak. It is the purity of the lemon that shines and lasts longest on the palate. This may be a bit young to drink now, so be patient and drink 2020–2030.",93,Bründlmayer 2015 Lamm Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"Subtle flavors, great balance and some mineral complexity add interest. It is tangy, refreshing and just a bit restrained until the finish, where it opens up and stays with you.",90,Bink 2013 Randle Hill Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Yorkville Highlands)
"Here's a young, vital, impressive 100% Cabernet. It's dry, full-bodied and rich in classic flavors of blackberries, black currants, graphite and minerals, wrapped into silky tannins. Superb oak integration lends notes of vanilla and sandalwood. Just gorgeous in the mouth, filled with class and elegance. Now–2014, at least.",95,Vinifera 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"An overly soft, alcoholic wine. It tastes like the blackberry and cola syrup that goes into soda, before the carbonation is added, and finishes prickly hot.",84,Rosenblum 2005 Rockpile Road Vineyard Reserve Petite Sirah (Rockpile)
"This is a great effort by winemaker Etienne Terlinden, offering dense and deep but bright and lively blackberry, black cherry, cola, graphite and a touch of wild herbs on the nose. Long-lasting flavors of sarsaparilla, shaved licorice, vanilla bean, bay leaf, fennel seed and dark earth meet with more black cherry fruit on the palate, carried by an expert acidity level.",94,Summerland 2013 Bien Nacido Vineyard Proprietor's Reserve Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"A broodingly dark, oaky Syrah, this has a dash of pepper and intense red fruit. Naggiar continues to make promising Rhone-inspired estate wines from rocky mountain soils.",87,Naggiar 2009 Estate grown Syrah (Sierra Foothills)
"The bouquet on this aggressive Malbec is a mix of olive and leather along with black fruits and asphalt. The palate is big but pinched by narrowing acidity. Flavors of blackberry come with heavy oak, and the finish is toasty and dense.",87,Angulo Innocenti 2011 Malbec (La Consulta)
"Dense and dry, this is a tough, extracted wine. It has a hard edge followed by juicy acidity and will probably remain on the dry side.",85,Château Grand Bourgeau 2015  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux
"Quite condensed and woody, with brier and sawdust aromas and some vivacious berry fruit. The palate is deep and pure, with cherry and cassis along with hints of coffee and earth. Yes, it's a bit hard due to firm tannins, but it's also a complete wine with a long, overt finish. Best Buy.",88,Morandé 2001 Grand Reserve Vitisterra Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"A beautiful Cabernet, this has all the hallmarks of a fine wine. It's dry, rich in tannins and elegant, with long, deep flavors of blackberries, currants and dark chocolate. It's already throwing some sediment, so give it a careful decant.",92,Korbin Kameron 2007 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley)
"This is a tropical-scented offering from New Zealand's first carbon-neutral winery. Pineapple and grapefruit flavors dominate the palate, with hints of jicama and jalapeño on the finish.",87,Grove Mill 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Aromas of scorched earth, game, burned rubber and a funky whiff of barnyard waft out of the glass and carry over to the dense palate along with raisin, fig, licorice and a gamy note. It's rustic and extremely evolved with an abrupt, bitter finish.",84,Costa di Bussia 2011 Vigna Campo del Gatto  (Barbera d'Alba)
"Aromas of chamomile flowers, pineapple and a whiff of bread crust lead the way. The bright palate offers ripe golden apple, toasted almond, light pastry cream and a hint of aromatic herbs alongside a soft mousse.",88,Villa Sandi 2012 Opere Serenissima Metodo Classico Sparkling (Vino Spumante)
"The Bennett Valley-based producer employed fruit from its neighborhood for this wine, filling it out with a majority of grapes from Alexander Valley. Rich in caramel and matchstick, it's an integrated wine, balanced between ripe pear sweetness and savory aspects of oak and spice. On the finish, expect vanilla bean and fresh lemon.",90,Matanzas Creek 2012 Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"Yellow-ish in color, heavy on the nose, more oily than in the past, and with an aroma of cheap perfume. The wine has high acidity, a zesty bite, but not much in the middle, and thus the flavors of mango, melon and papaya are wan. Good for quaffing but not on a par with previous years.",86,Tomero 2009 Torrontés (Mendoza)
"Dry and light, an unfocused wine. It has tannins, only light fruit, very dry and ultimately tough.",83,Château Moulin de Canhaut 2007  Médoc
"Medium straw-colored in the glass, this wine offers aromas of orange blossom, white tea and seawater. There is a nice balance of smooth fruit and brightness, with flavors of ripe peach and pear that will cause a bit of a pucker on the side palate right into the lingering peach finish.",90,Dalton 2013 D Series Chardonnay (Galilee)
"Vegetal and a little unclean, with deficient acidity that makes the fruit tastes insipid and sweet. Meanwhile, high alcohol makes it all hot.",81,Peterson 2009 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"This wine starts out a bit reduced before it opens to display aromas of kiwi, pineapple and pink grapefruit. The flavors drink dry and seem quite dilute.",84,Columbia Crest 2015 Reserve Zirkle Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Barrel fermented and aged in American oak for 15 months, this is a big and powerfully oaky Chard with dominating notes of butter, wood-infused stone fruit and apple pie along with a hint of grapefruit oil in the mouth. The finish is toasty  with a lingering vanilla bean note.",85,Casa Larga 2007 American Oak Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"Fragrant hints of bergamot and Seville orange play enticingly on the nose of this beguiling wine. The palate amplifies those juicy, tart and lively flavors, sending them dancing into the finish. It's fresh, fruit-driven, dry and utterly moreish.",92,Eichinger 2016 Strass Riesling (Kamptal)
"An alluring fragrance of rose, aromatic herb, dark berry and a whiff of new leather take shape in the glass. The firm palate delivers ripe, dark berry, grilled sage, mint and sweet pipe tobacco alongside austere tannins that need time to come around. It's well balanced, with a licorice finish. Drink after 2018.",94,Abbadia Ardenga 2010 Vigna Piaggia  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Solidly in the Saxum style, which is to say a high alcohol (15.5%), massively flavored wine of enormous concentration and power. The blackberry, cherry, cassis and chocolate flavors have all kind of overtones, ranging from licorice and vanilla to gingerbread and candied violets. Saxum has become a cult favorite, one of the highest-priced brands from Paso Robles, and wines like this are the reason why. Drink now and through 2008. Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache.",95,Saxum 2005 James Berry Vineyard Red (Paso Robles)
"Intensely herbaceous, this is a crisp, lemon and grapefruit-driven wine. Bright and fruity, it has a touch of minerality to keep it structured. Drink now.",88,Château les Arromans 2013  Entre-Deux-Mers
"A blend of fruit from top sites Boushey (60%) and Red Willow, the aromas are light, with notes of straw, lemon pith and grapefruit. The flavors show an elegant styling, framed by a tart zing of acidity that stretches out the finish. It's all about nuance.",90,Avennia 2015 Oliane Sauvignon Blanc (Yakima Valley)
"This orange-style wine has a cloudy yellow-gold appearance because it spent 30 days on the skins and 100 days on the lees. It has aromas and flavors of aged apple cider and tart apple pie with an astringent finish. This style is not for everyone, but for those who appreciate orange wine made from Chardonnay, this is a solid example.",89,Ross-idi 2015 Orange Nikolaevo Vineyard Chardonnay
"From the mountains above Lake Sonoma, this rocky, robust and ultimately rewarding wine is spicy in cinnamon and clove lined in savory layers of black pepper and leather. Brambly blackberry lies in wait to untangle in the glass, adding to the overall satisfaction of this full-bodied beauty.",92,Mazzocco 2013 Rockpile Reserve Zinfandel (Rockpile)
"Smells clean and mild, with peach and apple aromas. Rather foamy and rough feeling, with tangy flavors of stone fruits, green apple and pineapple. Light, juicy and fruity on the finish, but basic. Made from 100% Chardonnay using the Charmat method.",84,Coiron 2011 Extra Brut Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"A blend that aromatically is dominated by herbal Sauvignon Blanc, this is a crisp wine that is fruity, easy and accessible. Its acidity and citrus flavors are bright, lively and ready to drink.",87,Lieubeau 2016 La Fruitière Vignes Blaches White (Val de Loire)
"Crisp, dry, leafy aromas come with notes of green herbs, mint in particular. Texturally, this feels good, with drying tannins supporting modest berry, chocolate and wood-spice flavors. A tight, toasty tasting finish is minty, drying and a bit high in acid.",85,Lagarde 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Softer hints of chamomile and ripe apple play on the nose. The palate has some of the balmier qualities of chamomile tisane and a lively, friendly apple freshness. Acidity and fruit ripeness are harmoniously aligned, while citric freshness highlights herbal and apple peel glints even more. This is slender but smooth, lively but mellow and delicious.",92,Domaine Marcel Deiss 2014 Riesling (Alsace)
"This rich, spicy Port is full of jammy black fruits, dried prunes and raisins along with a good line of acidity. It is on the dry side of the Late Bottled Vintage spectrum, giving a wine that is structured as well as full of fruit. The aftertaste, with its tannins still in place, suggests it will age at least until 2022, although it is very drinkable now.",89,Quevedo 2012 LBV  (Port)
"Firm and dry, this wine shows more than its 10 years of aging. It has acidity as much as fruit, along with strong wood-aged flavors that push the spirit forward. At the end, it is all about the acidity and old wood flavors.",90,Dalva NV 10-Years-Old Tawny  (Port)
"Fragrant lemon blossom, citrus, beeswax and almond aromas carry over to the bright palate along with juicy lime, nectarine zest and dried herb. It finishes on a tangy saline note.",88,Valle dell'Acate 2015 Zagra Grillo (Sicilia)
"A beautiful rounded wine, full of juicy fruit, but sustained by a strong tannic structure. This dryness suggests good aging potential, as does the ripeness of the fruit and the acidity. Keep for at least 6 years.",94,Pierre Morey 2005 Grands Epenots Premier Cru  (Pommard)
"A complex, ageworthy wine that combines contradictions but somehow is complete and wholesome. The cool vintage shows up in the form of green olives and sweet green peas, a taste that's unusual for Oakville but one that works well alongside the more traditional black currants and sweet oak. The tannins are pure Oakville, rich, ripe and dramatically layered. Beautiful in every respect, this 100% Cab will reward cellaring. Begin popping the cork in 2018.",93,Piña 2010 Ames Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"This rich, fruity wine is packed with ripe apples and pears, and cut with delicious, full-on acidity. It's aromatic, with a lively mousse and a sparkling, lifted character. Drink now.",89,Simonnet-Febvre 2008 Cuvée S Brut  (Crémant de Bourgogne)
"A bit disappointing from veteran winemaker Alan McCorkindale, or maybe this is just sliding past its prime. The modest grapefruit notes, herbal overtones and tart finish are fine, but fail to excite. Drink up.",85,Thatched Hut 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"This is surprisingly light, having dropped significantly in alcohol from the previous vintage. Green-fruit flavors touch on banana and apple, and the wood—31% new and 26% once-used—seems to show a bit of rawness. Give this another couple of years of bottle age before opening.",87,Chehalem 2013 Ian's Reserve Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
"Right out of the chute this is a fresh, lively with scented with fresh cut pears. It's balanced and crisp, with subtle hints of cinnamon spice. A good spring/summer quaffer.",86,Duck Pond 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"The perfect combination of elegance and purity of fruit give this famous wine, a blend of fruit from both slopes of the hills above Ampuis, a great sense of style as well as power. The Syrah perfumes, at their richest and coolest, combine with black fruits to give an overwhelming impression of immense fruit flavors.",94,E. Guigal 1999 Brune et Blonde  (Côte Rôtie)
"This elegant Cypriot white from the monastery of Chrysorroyiatissa offers a blend of complexity and freshness. The clean, lush fruit and citrus flavors are balanced with fresh acidity and a touch of floral sweetness. An intriguing white with class.",87,Chrysorroyiatissa 2007 Ayios Andronicos White (Cyprus)
"This is zippy and refreshing, offering aromas of struck flint, pea shoots and grapefruit. For its abv, it's light on the palate, dancing with vibrant grass and citrus flavors and crisp acids.",90,Palliser Estate 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Martinborough)
"This wine by retired baseball stars Rich Aurilia and Dave Roberts shows both ripeness and restraint in all corners. On the nose, that means star anise and slate layered across black cherry and blackberry fruit. On the palate, the very full mouthfeel packs thyme, crushed herbs and elderberry flavors into an earthy package.",94,Red Stitch 2014 Sierra Mar Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Chocolate and mint notes combine effortlessly in this straightforward appellation wine, accented with rose, cherry and rhubarb. It features moderate acidity, thick tannins and weight.",87,MacMurray Estate Vineyards 2015 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Leather-boot black in color, this fine Petite Sirah is distinctive in herbal, almost eucalyptus aromas and intensely huge blackberry fruit. Earthy and soft with curtains of tannin, the wine is a complex version of the variety, rich. Age it until 2017–2021 and see if the eucalyptus mellows or intensifies.",92,Sean Thackrey 2010 Sirius Eaglepoint Ranch Petite Sirah (Mendocino County)
"Generous aromas of baking spice, clove and vanilla lead to quite tart, tangy cranberry and cherry flavors, with the oak and the fruit playing off each other.",88,Almquist 2009 Milbrant Vineyard Syrah (Wahluke Slope)
"There's good concentration in this ripe, rounded Sauvignon style wine, with white fruit flavors just touched by the crispness of green skins. The wine revels in the density of texture, while keeping a deft touch of freshness. Age for 2–3 years to be at its best.",90,Fournier Père et Fils 2005 L'Ancienne Vigne  (Pouilly-Fumé)
"Tasted in the late summer of 2010, this Cab was pretty tannic and acidic, despite some very rich and dynamic blackberry, black cherry, currant and licorice flavors. It will hit its peak sometime in the next 2–3 years.",86,Municipal Winemakers 2007 Best Barrel Cabernet Sauvignon (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
"Gravel, chaparral, sagebrush, mulberry and fig aromas show on the nose of this bottling from a distinct row of grapes. The strong herbal profile on the palate ranges from oregano and marjoram to thyme, rosemary and a touch of juniper, all set against black-plum fruit. It's firmly structured, very dry and deftly restrained.",93,Wedell Cellars 2011 The Row Find Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Forward berry aromas are regular but solid. The palate has a ripe but choppy mouthfeel and juicy, firm flavors of blackberry and dark toast. Burns a bit on the finish, with extended toasty flavors and peppery accents.",86,Alma del Sur 2008 Seleccionada Malbec (Mendoza)
"Produced from a selection of old vines, this is a structured firm wine. Its black-cherry fruits and acidity are well integrated into the dense structure to give a spicy wine that is richly packed with fruits. Drink now and until 2020.",90,Domaine Chaintreuil 2014 La Madone Vieilles Vignes  (Fleurie)
"A hint of red currant fruit appears on the nose. The slender, translucent palate then expands into a harmony of tart, fresh berries, restrained smokiness, forest floor and earth. There is something honest and pure about this that lets the exquisite purity of those tart berries shine. You simply crave more.",93,Hillinger 2013 Terroir Pinot Noir (Burgenland)
"A crisp, clean, deliciously fruity wine. It's light, fragrant, touched with red berries and attractive acidity. There's no complexity here, just pure fruitiness and freshness.",86,Mas de Cadenet 2012 Arbaude Rosé (Côtes de Provence Sainte-Victoire)
"Soft and tannic, this polished Syrah has easy, delicious flavors of chocolate, red currants, grilled meat, teriyaki and pepper. It's pure Paso Robles Syrah. Drink now.",86,Venteux 2005 Syrah (Paso Robles)
"While the wine is dominated by flavors of wood aging, it also has fine fruit weight that will come through. Then it will be a powerful and concentrated wine, rich and full of blackberry and black plum fruits. The structure will keep this fruitiness in order. Drink from 2017.",90,Château La Branne 2011  Médoc
"Thin and uninteresting, with vague cherry, berry and spice flavors that taste a little sweet. Gets the basic Zinfandel job done.",82,Rock Wall 2009 Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
"This is a rather big, bulky Vacqueyras, but one that doesn't seem to have the flesh to completely carry its size. The modest cherry flavors blend with dark, earthy notes into a tangle of leather and dried fruit. If it fleshes out in another year or two, this rating may prove conservative. Drink now–2018.",86,Louis Bernard 2010 Domaine de Montbayon Red (Vacqueyras)
"A wood-aged wine, with ripe yellow fruits, spice and a smooth, creamy character, kept firmly in place by apple skin texture and a flinty edge.",90,Quinta de la Rosa 2009 Branco White (Douro)
"There's pronounced power in this Pinot, a selection of 14 barrels given 18 months in 71% new French oak. Complex, it achieves a sense of balance that will come into greater focus over time. At the moment, it offers kirsch notes and sizzling acidity around a core of peppery allspice and toasty brioche, but it will only continue to develop and evolve with age.",94,Donum 2011 Estate Grown Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"The deep ruby color belies this wines cool-climate origins. The nose shows more black fruit aromas than is typical for Pinot Noir. The palate is all Pinot, though, with cherry pie filling flavors made more complex by vanilla from toasty new oak. It finishes with some nice mineral and earth notes. Silky tannins allow for immediate consumption but the wine will gain in complexity after a year or two in the cellar.",85,Wagner 2006 Grace House Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes)
"This is a soft, nondescript wine at first, with mild notes of black cherry, plum and black olive, that's likable and rounded on the palate.",86,Peter Franus 2013 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"This rounded white starts with aromas of lemon peel, orange jam, spice and flowers, followed by appealing flavors of citrus and white fruit. It has body and structure, and will temper spicy food well: think Indian, Szechuan.",88,My Big Fat Greek Wine 2012 Dry White Moschofilero (Peloponnese)
"Wild berry, new leather and thyme are some of the aromas you'll discover in this savory Brunello. The palate doles out juicy black cherry, ripe raspberry, white pepper and tobacco notes, while firm, polished tannins offer support. Drink 2018–2025.",92,Casanuova delle Cerbaie 2011  Brunello di Montalcino
"Lafon-Rochet is an estate that is producing some very fine wines. This second wine is a good reflection of the quality. With its powerful tannins and dark concentration, it is a still young. Blackberry fruits are paired with the dry core of tannin to give a wine for aging. Drink from 2019.",91,Château Lafon-Rochet 2010 Les Pélerins de Lafon-Rochet  (Saint-Estèphe)
"Here's a 100% expression of Sangiovese that opens with jammy fruit aromas of ripe blackberry and strawberry. There are spice, earth and smoke notes at the back but that mature fruit sits firmly in center stage. The mouthfeel is soft, easy and slightly sweet.",88,Antonino Tringali-Casanuova 2008 Sangiovese (Toscana)
"Faint whiffs of dust and saffron are restrained on the nose, but the palate of this off-dry Riesling is brightly layered in grapefruit, peach and honey flavors. The long finish is marked by lingering sensations of salt and dusty slate. Drinks well now but should smooth out beautifully over the next decade.",91,Maximin Grünhäuser 2014 Herrenberg Superior Riesling (Mosel)
"This is a rich, juicy and full-bodied wine. Despite its high alcohol, it has a freshness from the berry fruits that are balanced by acidity. It has softened and broadened out enough to give a sense of its excellent potential. Drink from late 2016.",90,Commanderie de la Bargemone 2011 Cuvée Marina Red (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence)
"There's lots to like in this affordable Merlot, and it's not just the fantastic label of a young, beautiful Marilyn Monroe. The wine itself is dry and firm in tannins, with blackberry and chocolate-covered raisin flavors. The alcohol is a refreshingly low 12.5% by volume. A great accomplishment. Production was 4,000 cases.",88,Marilyn 2011 Norma Jean Merlot (California)
"The bouquet here is not for the weak; it's intense, with cat pee, herbs and some sulfur. Passion fruit, pineapple and green apple flavors vie for first billing in the mouth, while the finish is long and tight. It's a funky wine, one that tastes better than it smells.",87,Lawson's Dry Hills 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Vibrant aromas of pear and apple lead to a creamy, full-feeling palate. It's a strong example of the variety and style.",88,Ryan Patrick 2015 Naked Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The wine is firm and structured although with enough fruit weight to give the wine a good potential for aging. Still full of young energy, it is going to develop balance.",86,Château Lajarre 2014 Cuvée Eléonore  (Bordeaux Supérieur)
"This blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot is powerful, with a blueberry flavor, a mild green note, a balsamic hint and a molasses tinge. It's saturated and clampy in feel, with aggressive flavors of lemony oak, balsamic fruit and baked berry. Warm, oaky and full of licorice flavor on the finish. Drink 2014–2019.",91,Ruca Malen 2008 Kinien de Don Raúl Red (Mendoza)
"Fresh and packed with red fruits, this wine comes from the Faiveley domaine. With raspberry flavors and plenty of acidity, the wine is forward and going to develop quickly. Drink from 2018.",89,Domaine Faiveley 2014 Clos des Myglands  (Mercurey)
"Jammy strawberry and raspberry notes fill the nose and mouth, and a soft accent of chocolate-covered cherry adds just the right amount of decadence. A slight peppery lift keeps things vibrant on the finish.",85,The Frenchhouse 2010 Pinot Noir (Vin de Pays d'Oc)
"Clean and fresh with medium-intense aromas and flavors of watermelon rind, carnation, red cranberry and a touch of green banana. Balanced and straightforward, and easy to find with 5,000 cases imported.",85,Les Jamelles 2010 Cinsault Rosé (Pays d'Oc)
"Already showing some maturity, this is a finely perfumed wine, its fruitiness tempered by secondary aromas and flavors that bring out herbs and an edge of steel. The aftertaste with its juicy acidity, is totally refreshing.",88,Hubert Meyer 2010 Riesling (Alsace)
"This dense, rich and ripe varietal Cabernet Sauvignon is aged in new French oak for 19 months. It shows smoked meat and bacon flavors that last into the finish.",85,Charles Krug 2013 Limited Release X Clones Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
A streak of vanilla winds through the almost-sweet fruit flavors of this medium-bodied and soft-textured wine. Ripe cherry aromas and strawberry jam flavors come with very little tannin and low acidity.,86,Dark Horse 2015 Zinfandel (California)
"Easton's estate Zin is big and lusty in blackberry, currant, licorice and spice flavors that are wrapped into sturdy tannins. It's a little on the superextracted, sweetly jammy side that emphasizes the fruit and pushes the wine's structural elements to the sideline. Could be an ager.",87,Easton 2005 Estate Bottled Zinfandel (Shenandoah Valley (CA))
"Dark black in color, this bold wine is thick and rich in tannin and oak, with traces of dried herb, red currant and cedar, making it seem more like Cabernet. The coffee-laden finish provides further focus.",88,Trinchero 2012 Cloud's Nest Vineyard Petit Verdot (Mount Veeder)
"Here's a spicy wine that opens with aromas of black berries, leafy underbrush, white pepper, clove and whiffs of game. The palate has more spice than fruit alongside firm tannins. Drink soon for freshness.",87,Le 7 Camicie 2012  Rosso di Montalcino
"This Lodi-grown blend of 65% Chardonnay, 25% Sauvignon Blanc and 10% Viognier smells of marshmallow, coconut and bubble gum.",85,Peirano 2009 The Other White (Lodi)
"This is an easy-drinking, roundly accessible vineyard designate, with a depth and breadth of black fruit, cedar, currant and cocoa powder. A juicy midpalate gives way to an integrated finish, unburdened by tannin and oak, despite the mountain provenance and full-bodied power of the wine.",91,Trinchero 2012 Haystack Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak)
"This vintage of Dog Point is unabashedly green without being overwhelming so. There's plenty of fig and melon fruit to provide support for the garlands of cut grass, tomato leaf and fresh herbs. The texture, as usual from this venture, is silky, while the finish is long and vibrant.",90,Dog Point 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"This is a moderately aromatic wine with notes of tangerine, lime and herbs. It's off dry with tart fruit flavors, finishing a touch bitter.",84,Girardet 2012 Estate Grown Riesling (Umpqua Valley)
"New oak takes the lead on the nose of this wine, with notes of vanilla and toffee followed by cranberry and cherry. It's high octane, with a concentrated cherry flavor and alcoholic warmth.",87,La Chanterelle 2012 Syrah (Wahluke Slope)
"This unusual varietal wine has steely, mineral aromas and lively flavors like apricot and white peach, along with a relatively light body and lively acidity.",88,Rock Wall 2015 Fiano
"This wine possesses a dense core of concentrated raspberry fruit on the nose, but not in a jammy way, further entertained by fluffier rose petals, cherry blossoms and a drizzle of vanilla syrup. The high-toned, vibrant palate is also rich in restrained sour raspberry fruit, spiced with a clove cream, making the mouth sing.",93,Cerro Prieto 2011 Reserve Pinot Noir (Paso Robles)
"Made from Negroamaro, this opens with aromas of red berry, apple and a whiff of wild flower. It's bright and refreshing, offering raspberry notes and a hint of white pepper alongside crisp acidity.",87,Masseria Altemura 2016 Rosato (Salento)
"Firm and structured, this still shows much of the ripe red fruit of the vintage. It has a round, warm feel, along with weight and density. Fresh berry flavors cut through the powerful texture. Drink from 2023.",94,Henri de Villamont 2014  Grands-Echezeaux
"Aromas highlight violet, iris, incense and espresso. The lively palate doles out sour cherry, mocha and coffee alongside smooth, rounded tannins.",88,Pelassa 2012 Sot  (Nebbiolo d'Alba)
"Sourced from the excellent Lewis Vineyard, this toasty, chewy Syrah displays black cherry fruit against a strong background of vanilla. At first it seems tart to the point of being almost sour, but as it breathes, the oak mutes some of the acid and balances it out.",86,Frenchman's Gulch 2008 Syrah (Washington)
"Aromas of commercial soap, cherry and crushed stone are candied, pushy and not easy. A choppy mouthfeel with shrill acidity is another tough road to travel. Flavors of cherry cough drop and coffee are hot prior to an abrupt hard-driving finish. Elegance is not a factor in this fruity bullish Italian-style blend of Malbec and Corvina.",85,Masi Tupungato 2014 Passo Doble Malbec-Corvina Red (Valle de Uco)
"Fragrant with floral notes, lemony fruit and hints of apricot, this is a tangy, textural take on Pinot Gris. Fermented in stainless steel and released young, it retains a bright and stylish profile right through a lingering finish, with a touch of sweetness.",92,Ponzi 2011 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"An upright burst of cedar, menthol and molasses on the nose gives this dessert wine a serious edge. On the palate, cinnamon, cigarbox and cedar offer spicy, masculine character. Toasted nut adds to the mix. An intriguing sip.",88,Domaine Foivos 2004 Methyse  (Mavrodaphne de Cephalonie)
"A tough, gritty wine, with overripe, pruny flavors. It's quite dry and tannic, and will not age. Basically a Bordeaux blend with Zinfandel and Syrah.",82,Château Potelle 2007 Explorer The Illegitimate VGS Red (Napa Valley)
"The cool vintage took its toll on this Pinot Noir. It has off-aromas and flavors that suggest barely-ripened, green strawberries, raw mushrooms and some vegetal notes.",82,One Hope 2011 Reserve Pinot Noir (Napa Valley)
"The shy nose doesn't give much away except for a hint of beeswax. The lean palate shows suggestions of mineral and lime alongside bracing, almost crackling acidity.",85,Tenuta La Ponca 2014 Malvasia (Collio)
"Fruit-salad aromas include a note of chewing gum. This feels basic, with tart vapid tomato flavors. A saucy-tasting finish is bland as a board.",83,Bodegas Valdemar 2016 Conde Valdemar Rosé (Rioja)
La Cala is a fun and easy expression of Vermentino from the sunny island of Sardinia that shows bright citrus notes backed by tones of honeysuckle and wild sage. Pair this wine with fried calamari.,86,Sella & Mosca 2008 La Cala  (Vermentino di Gallura)
"A wonderful appetizer wine, dry, clean and zesty in acidity, with appealing citrus, apple, lemongrass, vanilla and honeysuckle flavors. A great restaurant by-the-glass sipper. Production was 136,000 cases.",88,Turning Leaf 2009 Pinot Grigio (California)
"Aromas evoking dark baking spice, forest floor, French oak, dried herb, violet and balsamic menthol are some of the aromas you'll find on this fragrant structured red. The concentrated palate evokes plum, blackberry jam, vanilla and tobacco while firm fine-grained tannins provide the support. Drink 2019–2029.",93,Mastroberardino 2009 Naturalis Historia  (Taurasi)
"One sniff is all it takes to announce that this was barrel fermented; wood, toast and spicy white-fruit aromas are draped all over the bouquet. This feels round and healthy, with modest flavors of resin, salt, apple and nectarine. Saline stays present on the finish, which is fresh but resiny in flavor.",87,Viña Mayor 2011 Fermentado en Barrica Verdejo (Rueda)
"Smells good, with berry- dominated aromas. The palate is solid but acidic at the core, with sharpness on the palate that creates a juicy, crisp set of raspberry and plum flavors. Flattens out on the finish, where moderate oak-based butter notes rise up.",86,Alma del Sur 2008 Seleccionada Bonarda (Mendoza)
"Dusty tannins and juicy fruit reveal the great freshness of the wine. While it does not have great density of flavor, it does have plenty of forward fruit, smoky flavors and black currant acidity. For the medium term.",88,Château les Ormes 2008  Saint-Julien
"Soft, fruity and with a ripe almond character, this is a bone dry Chenin. It has a delicious, juicy feel, crisp with tight acidity and minerality. Drink now for its freshness.",88,Vignoble Brisebarre 2012 Sec  (Vouvray)
"This wine is dominated by darkness, giving aromas of upturned black earth and coffee grinds. The palate trends a tad redder, with lava rocks, but the blackness returns in the form of blueberries, espresso and soil.",86,Sevtap 2012 Pillow Talk Petit Verdot (Santa Ynez Valley)
"This is a ripe wine with raspberry flavor and a tight,steely character. The wine is light, crisp and certainly dry, with the acidity cutting like a knife on the finish.",87,Chanoine NV Tsarine Brut Rosé  (Champagne)
"This reserve-level wine is annotated with interesting highlights of iron, mint and tea leaf, all wrapped around a black-cherry core. There's a streak of cola running through it all, and just a hint of alcohol burn in the finish.",88,Treos 2011 Founders Choice Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"From Verdicchio's leading producer, this is the wine that started the denomination's renaissance into Italy's premier white. The '09 is beautiful, with an intense perfume of yellow flowers and stone fruits. The palate delivers concentrated peach, apricot and creamy lemon flavors, layered with mineral and spice accents. It already has stunning depth, but hold for more complexity. Drink through 2024.",94,Bucci 2009 Villa Bucci Riserva  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore)
"This is the producer's first barrel-aged Chardonnay, made from a blend of two vineyards and two clones, including one from their own estate on Westside Road. Sour and sweet alternatively, it finds a steely path to balance and soft layers of apple, Asian pear and a touch of ginger-topped butterscotch.",88,Bucher 2014 Rio Oro Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This Cabernet shows the winery's signature style of massively extracted, ripe black currant, plum and chocolate flavors with elaborate oak. The finish is thoroughly dry, long and spicy. This is a flashy, showy wine, but it's in somewhat of a slumber right now. Give it another few years to wake up.",90,Vina Robles 2009 Mountain Road Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Funky smelling and unfamiliar, with sweet, candied spice notes and strange candied cherry aromas. Vibrant and bouncy in terms of feel, but follows the nose by tasting sweet and weird. Weak on the finish as well.",82,Bodegas Navarro López 2008 Rojo Granrojo Garnacha (Tierra de Castilla)
"This is a firm wine, tightly-wound, with whiffs of mineral and cement. Plum and cherry flavors mingle with notes of dried herb, earth and brown spice. The wine rolls along into a lengthy finish, with excellent body and balance.",93,Trisaetum 2010 Ribbon Ridge Estate Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge)
"Slightly dusty oak tones of dill, vanilla and sweet spice accentuate the maturity of this barrel-aged Chardonnay. It's a full bodied, densely textured wine with lingering flavors of dried apple and pear. Drink now.",86,Adirondack Winery 2015 Barrel Aged Adirondack Overlook Chardonnay (New York)
"This second, affordably minded label from the Center of Effort team shows caramelized cherries and chipped slate on the nose. Candied red fruits arise on the palate, along with bitter orange peels and a nice acidity, though there's a slightly odd film left on the tongue in the finish.",86,Fossil Point 2013 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)
"With vineyards to the east of Saint-Émilion itself, this chateau has produced a structured, obviously wood-aged wine. It's a wine still in development, bursting with young black-currant and black-plum fruits as well as acidity. The wood is a strong background presence and will soften over the next few years. Drink from 2020.",91,Château Boutisse 2014  Saint-Émilion
"Fresh peach and pear mark the nose and palate. The intensity is bright yet fleeting on the midpalate. Overall this is quite enjoyable, with balanced acidity, making it a quite enjoyable every-day white.",86,Hawthorne 2014 Barrel Reserve Auxerrois (Old Mission Peninsula)
"Flors di Uis is a gorgeous white blend of Malvasia Istriana, Friulano and Riesling Renano that opens with a complex bouquet of yellow flower, stone fruit and spice. The mouthfeel is generous and thick with long-lasting floral nuances spread over the finish.",92,Vie di Romans 2009 Flors di Uis White (Friuli Isonzo)
"This is a plush and upfront wine that offers succulent aromas of cherry, black fruit and plum. It glides clean down the palate thanks to its thick density and soft, smooth texture. The wine has the pulp and density to pair with most winter foods.",86,Pelassa 2005  Barbera d'Alba
"This wine from an ownership team of former pro baseballers Rich Aurilia and Dave Roberts is plush on the nose with dried strawberry, gingerbread and baking spices. The palate offers pomegranate-cherry juice along with graphite and coffee notes.",91,Red Stitch 2013 Soberanes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Enticing aromas of crushed rose, red berry, wild mint, menthol and a hint of oak come together. The linear, focused palate offers raw red cherry, strawberry, white pepper, licorice and chopped sage accompanied by tightly knit, close-grained tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2019–2026.",91,Icardi 2011 Parej  (Barolo)
"This is a bright, edgy Chardonnay. Smoke and roasted nuts complement pineapple and citrus aromas and flavors, while the palate is medium bodied and taut with crisp acids. Drink now–2020.",87,Di Giorgio Family Wines 2014 Chardonnay (Coonawarra)
"Dense woody aromas come with notes of damp earth, coffee grounds and eucalyptus nut. On the palate, this blend of Malbec and 7% Petit Verdot is high in acidity but also resiny from oak treatment. Salty plum and tomato flavors give way to a tidal wave of oak flavor on the finish. Drink through 2025.",89,Luigi Bosca 2013 Finca Los Nobles Malbec Verdot Field Blend Malbec Blend (Luján de Cuyo)
"Some high-toned volatile aromas highlight this wine. People sensitive to this might find that the pungency takes away from the simple, fruity charm. Drink it chilled for best results.",85,Oak Knoll 2014 Müller-Thurgau (Willamette Valley)
"Knowing only time in stainless steel, this light, clear white is zingy in grapefruit, wet stone and melon, its texture and body crisp and focused. The price for this quality is hard to beat.",90,Jax 2015 Y3 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"A pretty bouquet of violets greets the nose, followed by a bolt of black pepper. Boysenberry, black cherry and leather combine to mark the palate, which also reveals cola and anise. Soft and restrained for the variety, this is a food-friendly wine, with a gnarled bite of tannin on the finish.",91,Armida 2012 Petite Sirah (Russian River Valley)
"Punchy citric aromas come with a note of fresh celery. This is zesty and crisp in the mouth, while orange and celery stalk flavors end with a refreshing, cleansing finish.",87,Montemar 2015 Gran Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley)
"The nose isn't very expressive but eventually reveals fig and raisin aromas. The simple palate offers raw, red cherry alongside brisk acidity and firm tannins.",87,Giulia Negri 2010 La Tartufaia  (Barolo)
"This is a particularly fine vintage for the popular Dr. Wolfe's, maintaining the customary blend of Primitivo, Lemberger and Petite Sirah. Dark and smoky, with dense flavors of berry, cassis, licorice and dark chocolate, it is far more substantial than most red blends in this price range.",90,Thurston Wolfe 2009 Dr. Wolfe's Family Red Red (Washington)
"The grapes for this immense, rich blueberry jammy Syrah come from NFL's John Madden's ranch. It's as big and loud as he can be, with not quite enough fruit or acid to overcome the alcohol, which even gets in the way of the nose. With a small percentage of Grenache blended in and the whole aged in 100% American oak (1/3 new), this style may appeal to some;, but can be interpreted as overly voluptuous, even on a second tasting eight hours after the first. Decant or, preferably, give it another 3–5 years.",84,Wood Family Vineyards 2007 Madden Ranch Syrah (Livermore Valley)
"While very flavorful, this wine is more of a dessert drink than a lunch or dinner wine. It smells sweet and earthy, feels unctous and tastes sweet, especially on the finish.",83,Coast 2013 Chardonnay (California)
"Opens with rooty, baked aromas before finding its legs and plenty of ripe, attractive berry fruit. The palate is juicy and solid, with good acidity and nice flavors of wild berry, chocolate and toast. Stylish and very solid. Definitely a food-friendly Malbec.",90,Doña Silvina 2006 Malbec (Mendoza)
"For a big-production wine (33,000 cases) with just 12 months of barrel aging, this is impressive. Sweet but balanced dark fruit and cola aromas are nice, while the palate is forward and tastes of blackberry and cola. Complex and slightly gritty and tannic on the finish, which indicates that it has the structure to age. Drink now through 2013.",90,Emina 2006 12 Meses  (Ribera del Duero)
"This fragrant red opens with scents suggesting aromatic Alpine herb, ripe dark-skinned berry, flint and a whiff of exotic spice. The luminous, elegantly structured palate displays ripe wild cherry, raspberry, mineral and a hint of star anise alongside a backbone of firm, refined tannins. Drink through 2024.",92,Nera 2009 Inferno Riserva  (Valtellina Superiore)
"The latest vintage of one of the original wine brands in the Douro, this bold wine offers great tannins and structure along with the ripe black fruits. Balanced and generous, it is developing quickly. Drink from 2019.",90,Ramos-Pinto 2014 Duas Quintas Red (Douro)
"Full wine, soft on the palate, its berry fruits ripe and forward. It has some weight although the acidity is as fresh as it can be. The aftertaste  is clean, clear refreshing. Screwcap.",87,Château Routas 2012 Rosé (Coteaux Varois en Provence)
"While demure on the nose, this dry, seemingly diminutive Riesling builds in power and concentration on the palate. It's fairly low in alcohol, with an unassuming gradation of flavors ranging from lime to lemon and grapefruit, but its rippling textural expanse lends persistence and gravitas.",90,Boundary Breaks 2013 No. 239 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"This fruity young wine has a ripe spring in its step. It has red-berry fruitiness as well as sweeter candied fruits balanced by an edge of spirit and acidity. This is an easy style of Port, ready to drink at any time.",87,Borges NV Reserva Ruby  (Port)
"Plum, red berry and wild herb aromas combine to create a briary whole. As it airs, the nose turns lemony and hard, while the mouthfeel is tight and limited, with herbal, saucy, red berry flavors. Tomato and basil notes appear on the finish.",84,Tierra Prometida 2008 Clasico Bonarda (Mendoza)
"Stout and dense from the beginning, with blackberry and violet aromas. Despite being a bold and dark Malbec, this is fresh and composed, with sweet blackberry and cassis flavors. Good on the finish, with candied fruit and caramel sweetness.",87,Ruta 22 2010 Malbec (Patagonia)
"A gorgeous Cabernet, and at this price, a bargain. Shows the greatness of the 2005 vintage, with perfectly ripe red and black cherry fruit, sweetly ripe tannins and a fine edge of acidity. Complex for drinking now, it should continue to develop bottle nuances over the next six years until it slowly winds down.",94,Veedercrest 2005 Vintner's Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"At 50% Cab and 50% Malbec, this wine runs outside the mainstream for Argentina. It's dark in color but slightly green and stemmy on the nose. The palate offers a solid mouthfeel with flavors of baked berry fruit, earth and carob. It's sweet at its core, but mildly bitter and candied on the finish. Good but struggles to find a pleasurable sweet spot.",86,Humanao 2004 Finca Humanao Red (Cafayate)
"This wine exudes southern warmth with its rich, soft fruit and ripe tannins. Generous and opulent, it is packed with red and black berry fruits and already drinkable. The aftertaste with its juicy acidity gives the wine a lift.",89,Casca Wines 2010 Monte Cascas Reserva Red (Alentejano)
"Like this one, many of the 2014 Hawke's Bay Syrahs are flashier than their 2013 counterparts. This wine features meaty, bacony elements that highlight plummy fruit, wonderfully silky, supple tannins, and a long finish. Drink now–2025.",93,Sacred Hill 2014 Deerstalkers Syrah (Hawke's Bay)
"Very ripe fruit and a long bottle maturation gives this wine considerable concentration, richness and exotic flavors of ripe apricots, mandarin oranges and an extra layer of spice. The acidity keeps it all  together.",90,Höpler 2001 Privat Reserve Pinot Blanc (Burgenland)
"Lemon and pear take center stage on the nose while the palate presents zesty freshness and wonderful texture. While these Viennese field blends are wonderfully varied, they always are fresh and textured, joyful and food friendly. This wine will lend energy to any repast with its clarion calls of freshness and verve.",91,Stift Klosterneuburg 2015 White (Wiener Gemischter Satz)
"Enticing aromas of white lilies, nectarines, white peach, honey-lime water and chalky stone hit the nose on this wine from a new vineyard on Highway 154 in the likely-to-be-named Los Olivos District. The palate is creamy down the center but with tangy edges, offering flavors of lime yogurt and pink grapefruit pith.",92,Vincent Vineyards 2013 Family Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Lascombes seems to have got into its stride even in a difficult vintage such as this. Ripe black-berry fruits are there along with firm, balanced wood and spice flavors that give promise of some aging. The wood still has to calm down as the fruit develops, so don't drink until 2019.",92,Château Lascombes 2013  Margaux
"This wine hails from the Sonoma Coast sections of the Russian River Valley and Petaluma Gap. It delivers in terms of price-versus-quality by opening with strong scents of earth and black plum baked in cinnamon and clove. Light, it's soft on the palate and finishes lean.",86,R2 2014 Black Pine Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This is a 100% varietal wine sourced from the coveted Oakville Ranch Vineyard on the eastern edge of the appellation. Cedar, herb, meat and soy mingle around a full-bodied weight softened by the wine's classic edge, length and breadth of black fruit and vanilla oak. Drink now through 2022.",92,Aiken 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"From a tiny, three-acre vineyard, this wine is soft, seamless and delightfully floral, offering lithe layers of red cherry, tea and oak, barely able to rein in its savory underbrush of black earth. Crisp, the acidity is pronounced and lengthy and the rose aromatics irresistibly persistent.",93,Arista 2013 Mononi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This simple Chardonnay delivers with buttered toast, butterscotch and pineapple-orange-mango juice flavors. It's on the soft side.",84,Cameron Hughes 2010 Lot 324 Chardonnay (Atlas Peak)
"Smoky aromas give this wine allure, its layers of flavor soft and flowery, accented by red berry fruit. On the elegant spectrum of the variety, the wine is fairly subtle, with an evolving cinnamon spiciness to the finish.",91,Kokomo 2012 Pauline's Vineyard Winemaker's Reserve Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"Classic, ripe Saint-Julien with all its richness, tempered with elegance. It is deliciously fruity, packed with blackberry fruit surrounding the structure.",91,Château Lalande-Borie 2010  Saint-Julien
"Faded black cherry in the glass, this wine offers an aroma of pomegranate and brambles. Flavors of tart cranberry, green pepper and eucalyptus are pleasant enough, but this wine is a bit past its prime.",87,Barkan 2009 Altitude 412 Cabernet Sauvignon (Galil)
"Zesty lemon and lime skins perfume this dry, steely Riesling. It's bold in body yet edged with razor-sharp acidity. The midpalate yields slowly with touches of quince and tangerine that linger nicely through the finish.",89,Prinz Salm 2013 Johannisberg Wallhausen Trocken GG Erste Lage Riesling (Nahe)
"This is a lovely vineyard-designate, floral and crisp in tangy grapefruit and tangerine. With plenty of complexity to its breadth and depth, it maintains effortless acidity throughout, finishing with just the right twist of lemon peel.",92,City Winery of New York 2014 Scopus Vineyard Reserve Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"This barrel-fermented Chardonnay cloaks its thin fruit in aggressive flavors of wood and butter. The wine itself is soft and watery, quickly disappearing into a frail finish.",82,Airlie 2009 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
"Deep and dense, this smells horsey and leathery, with aromas of earthy berries. The palate feels racy with acidity, and the flavors of berry, cassis, cola and vanilla lead to a sweet, jammy finish, with touches of vanilla and caramel.",87,Bodega del Fin del Mundo 2008 Special Blend Reserva Red (Patagonia)
"Soft, light fruit, packed with red cherries and fresh berries, is the star. The tannins are a mere hint, so the wine should be enjoyed soon for its attractive juiciness.",84,Château Denisiane 2009  Bordeaux
"This has a surprising amount of vanilla cream in the flavors, plus soft, seductive raspberry fruit. The fruit comes from the oldest part of the Maresh vineyard—38-year-old self-rooted vines. The wine is a pale rose, yet substantial in the style of a classic Pinot from Eyrie. After some hours breathing it opens up with elegant, seductive aromas and some caramel streaks, delicate and perfectly proportioned.",94,Kelley Fox 2007 Maresh Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"This young wine brings scents of cola, truffle and black cherry. It's light and lively, with those flavors coming along with notes of chicken stock and a juicy mouthfeel. Though not a big wine, it's complex and interesting.",89,Winter's Hill 2015 Block 10 Whole Cluster Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)

"The majority of the grapes for this white that's musky on the nose was stainless-steel fermented, with 20% given time in neutral French oak. The combination provides easygoing texture, accented by notes of grass and herb. A fleck of stone fruit and papaya tease midpalate before an abbreviated finish.",85,Uptick Vineyards 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley)
"Light in color and density, Frappato should be consumed slightly chilled with cold cuts or salads. This is a successful and well-priced expression of the native Sicilian variety that offers small berry aromas with background tones of pistachio, marzipan and cherry liqueur.",85,Paolo Calì 2006 Mandragola  (Vittoria Frappato)
There's a green edge to this wine that struggles with the richer dark berries and fudge cake flavors. Soft and round in the mouth with a short finish.,84,Mont Tauch 2009 Le Dog de Jean Marc Merlot (Vin de Pays d'Oc)
"Earthy baked cherry aromas come across candied and minty. The palate is full-force in terms of acidity, with punchy flavors of strawberry and plum. This finishes light, with strong acidity pushing snappy tartness to the fore.",84,Taron 2008 4M  (Rioja)

"This is a dark chocolate and licorice flavored wine with great tannins and minerality as well as black plum fruits. It is concentrated and powerful and still so young. Dense and brooding, it will need many more years to mature, so drink from 2019.",92,Magnum Vinhos 2011 Baton Red (Douro)
"This is an aromatically subdued wine with notes of peach, pineapple and spice. It's medium bodied, elegant in style with a lightly creamy feel, seeming a bit dilute.",86,Columbia Crest 2013 H3 Chardonnay (Horse Heaven Hills)
"This blend of 50% Grenache, 25% Syrah and 25% Mourvèdre is reasonably light in body. The notes of crushed stone, berries, citrus and spice pick up a hint of brine on the palate, then finish tart and cleansing.",87,Château Roustan 2016 Rosé (Costières de Nîmes)
"A dramatic spiciness infuses this full-bodied wine with complexity from the aroma through the flavors and lingering finish. It has a dominant streak of smoky oak, a generous mouthfeel, mild tannins and plenty of blackberry and black plum notes.",90,Zinderella 2014 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi)
"Quite an impressive wine, especially at this price. A blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon without much oak, it's an interestingly complex white, with good weight and density and intricate flavors of citrus fruits, apricots, peaches and lemongrass. Finishes totally dry, although the acidity is a little clumsy.",87,Frostwatch 2009 Kismet White (Bennett Valley)
"Rich and penetrating, this shows tertiary aromas of crushed stone, cured leather and black truffle. The mouthfeel is polished and smooth.",88,La Giaretta 2005  Recioto della Valpolicella Classico
"Scratchy, minty aromas are the opening on this rough and rugged blend of Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon. In the mouth, this is hard as nails, with extreme tannic bite. Flavors of blackberry and chocolate are ripe and satisfying, while resiny oak, baking spice notes and rough tannnins define the finish.",87,Tinedo 2009 Cala N. 2 Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"This is an attractively perfumed wine. It has fine acidity, ripe wood flavors and spice. The weight of the fruit is enough to balance with the wood. It will be ready to drink from 2018.",88,Château Malbat 2014  Bordeaux Supérieur
"A fine balance between sweetness, acidity and astringency drives this wine forward. Acidity lifts the palate and adds freshness, and botrytis adds a drying astringency. Pineapples, prunes and apricots all add their fruity notes to this rich wine. Drink from 2018.",93,Château Nairac 2010  Barsac
"A dry style of tawny, bringing out wood aging as well as rich mellow fruit. The wine has an old gold feel to it, with butter toffee, butterscotch and final acidity.",89,Croft NV Ten Year Old Aged Tawny  (Port)
"The mouthfeel is linear and delicate with lingering tones of sweet cola, almonds, vanilla and spice over solid red fruit. Silky tannins and ample freshness bring up the rear.",88,Il Borro 2005 Pian di Nova Red (Toscana)
"This offers subdued aromas of vanilla, toasted oak and a whiff of dried orchard fruit. The palate isn't very expressive, displaying buttery notes, white almond and just a hint of citrus peel but it lacks fruit richness to stand up to the racy acidity.",85,Guidi 1929 2012 Aurea Riserva  (Vernaccia di San Gimignano)
"Cedary spice notes accent aromas of raspberry and plum on this firm wine. The palate is big, creamy and blocky, with oaky flavors of vanilla as well as earthy plum and red berry. Cocoa, spice and vanilla flavors are prominent on an oaky finish. Drink through 2017.",88,Valle Secreto 2011 Private Cabernet Franc (Cachapoal Valley)
"Intense aromas of vanilla, smoked nuts and black cherry preserves seduce on the nose of this ripe, richly textured Pinot Noir. It's bold in fruit and oak tones, but penetrating tannins add gravitas to the finish.",88,Atwater 2012 Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes)
"Call it country-style, with the minty sharpness and slightly sweet, candied raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors. The acidity reprises on the finish, accentuating and harshening the tannins.",83,Hahn 2005 Cabernet Franc (Central Coast)
"This wine is much better than most in its class. The blackberry, graham cracker and exotic spice notes are particular to Bosca, while additional notes of bacon, chocolate and nutmeg add to the pleasure. For anyone looking for quintessential Argentine Malbec at a good price, we say start here.",91,Luigi Bosca 2005 Reserva Malbec (Luján de Cuyo)
"Although this wine is labeled Brut, it is in fact right at the driest end of that category. Bone dry, therefore, while full of white fruits and crisp lemon zest flavors. The texture is tight, steely and speaks strongly of the chalk of the soil. It is still young, so this vintage wine can be drunk now for its fruitiness or left until 2016 for a more rounded, toasty character.",92,Pierre Gimonnet et Fils 2009 Cuvée Gastronome Premier Cru Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)
"A bruiser of a wine: dark tannins, brawny structure, tough and hard around the edges. That said, its tannins are true to its Nuits-St.- Georges origins in its dry core surrounded by dense fruit.",91,Domaine de l'Arlot 2005 Clos des Forêts St Georges Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges)
"This opens with aromas of underbrush, leather, oak and crushed black cherry. The palate shows predominantly oak sensations including coffee, vanilla and espresso alongside notes of prune, but it lacks fruit richness. Astringent tannins leave the mouth feeling dried out.",87,Podere Ruggeri Corsini 2010 Bussia Corsini  (Barolo)
"This rich, boldy alcoholic wine has a pepper character that dominates fragrant fruit and spice notes. It should age well, so drink until 2020.",89,Rieflé 2011 Côte de Rouffach Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"This is a soft, tropical-fruit-driven Sauvignon Blanc made in a warm-climate style. It has a clean, fresh character, with an apricot note and a soft touch of orange zest. It's fragrant, fruity and ready to drink.",85,Cortes de Cima 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Alentejano)
"The Sauvignon Blanc style here has gotten more refined and restrained in recent years, less opulent and flamboyant. This hints at snow pea and struck flint on the nose, then delivers primarily grapefruit on the palate, ending on a slightly austere note.",89,Cloudy Bay 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
This steely mineral wine is still young. It has the crispest apple and lemon fruits as well as a tight mineral texture. It obviously needs to age with its nervy character keeping the more generous fruit in check. Drink from 2018.,88,Joseph Mellot 2016 La Chatellenie  (Sancerre)
"Full bodied and plushly textured, this is an opulent wine that's approachable now, but should last through 2025. It's tight and reticent when poured, then opens in the glass to reveal raspberry fruit, with subtle baking spice and cacao.",94,Pierre Henri Morel 2010 Lieu-Dit Pignan Grenache (Châteauneuf-du-Pape)
"A genuine, honest sparkler, this has simple tones of almond paste and lemon soda. The mouthfeel is held steady by foamy cream and bright effervescence.",86,Bellenda 2011 Miraval Millesimato Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Very firm in tannins, this Petite Sirah is astringent and closed right now. It's hard to appreciate the sweetly ripe cherry and licorice flavors. Could improve significantly over the years, but there's no guarantee.",86,Rutherford Grove 2006 Spring Creek Vineyard Petite Sirah (St. Helena)
"Cherry and berry aromas are standard and good. Feels a bit edgy and clipped, with slightly herbal red plum flavors accented by a lot of oak and pepper. Turns real spicy and hot on the finish.",85,Pulenta Estate 2010 La Flor Malbec (Mendoza)
"This big, ripe wine is now past its youth. That is bringing out the toast, yeast and walnut flavors. But the acidity is not far away, coming from the taut texture, and leaving a crisp fresh, raspberry-flavored aftertaste.",88,Domaine des Baumard 2004 Tirage Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay (Crémant de Loire)
"There's a simple directness to this wine. But, the flavors are delicious, consisting of ripe cherries and pomegranates, with a seemingly fruity sweetness that belies the dry finish. There's also plenty of tart acidity and tannins. All of the parts, including the oak, haven't come together, so give it a 3–4 years in the cellar.",90,Bruliam 2010 Deer Meadows Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"This is an elegant Nebbiolo-based wine and arguably the most feminine of Gaja's newest releases. There's extreme balance and sophistication evident in the focused aromas of wild berry, white licorice, pressed violets and polished stone. The mouthfeel is tight, firm and those tannins need at least 10 more years to soften in your cellar. Beautiful.",99,Gaja 2007 Sorì Tildìn Nebbiolo (Langhe)
"Though just five years old, this wine seems advanced, with notes of pencil box, leather, dried orange peel, mesquite and brown spices. There's still plenty of juicy acid to be had that provides interest with some grit to the tannins.",87,Dominio IV 2009 Old Man Looking East Estate Syrah (Columbia Gorge (OR))
"Beautifully pristine on the nose and palate, with concentrated notes of fresh lemon and apple, with hints of waxy white flower and honeycomb. There's significant weight and body on the palate, amplified by notes of sweet cream, smoke and an umami-rich salinity that lingers on the finish. Fermented entirely with ambient yeasts. Drink now.",89,Bedell 2010 Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island)
"Plum, berry and a noticeable oaky streak define the bouquet on this well-built Rioja. Flavors of raspberry and plum are creamy and end with thickness and full-bodied grip that's balanced off by good acidity. This is perfectly good, healthy and adequately fruity, yet woody.",87,Bodegas Bilbainas 2010 Viña Zaco  (Rioja)
"Lots of rich raspberry, cherry and cola flavors in this Pinot Noir. It has a delicate, silky texture and some true complexity, but is a little too soft to age. Drink up.",86,Windward Vineyard 2008 Estate Bottled Monopole Pinot Noir (Paso Robles)
"From a vineyard in southern Oregon that is actually its own, self-contained AVA (Red Hill Douglas County), this is a well-structured Pinot Noir with grip and authority. There is a noticeable smokiness to both nose and palate, not unpleasant, and the fruit is tight and supple. Black cherry and blackberry flavors are set in charred wood tannins, but everything is in proportion and nicely developed.",89,Oak Knoll 2006 Red Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Oregon)
"Named after the pine-tree aromas that come from the trees around the Dão vineyards, this wine is perfumed with structured black-currant fruits and wild-berry flavors. Its tannins and balanced concentration are just right. Drink from 2018.",88,Magnum Vinhos 2015 Pinha Ribeiro Santo Red (Dão)
"Aromas of pressed violet, ripe berry, menthol and a touch of exotic spice emerge on this full-bodied red. Showing its hot-vintage origins, the firm palate doesn't boast a lot of fruit richness but offers licorice, espresso, powdered sage and dried cherry accompanied by bracing, grainy tannins.",89,Pio Cesare 2011 Il Bricco  (Barbaresco)
"A darkly tannic wine, this is very firm and dense. Its red-berry fruit palate shows some of the perfume of Touriga Nacional, and its a concentrated wine that needs at least three-years aging.",86,Quinta da Alorna 2010 Cardal Red (Tejo)
"Light in weight and lacy in texture, this is a savory, subtly flavored Pinot Noir that's ready to drink. Notes of smoke, mushrooms and dried herbs intertwine with tart fruit.",86,Seifried 2009 Old Coach Road Pinot Noir (Nelson)
"This wine's cedar, espresso, herb, spice, vanilla, dark chocolate and black cherry aromas lead to a supple, well balanced palate full of cherry and bittersweet chocolate flavors that carry long into the finish. With its grippy tannins, it shows finesse and elegance, though oak plays a prominent role.",91,Walla Walla Vintners 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This moderately aromatic wine conveys Red Hots, baking spices and red fruit. It's on the lighter side of medium bodied, soft yet full of drawn-out blue-fruit flavors on the finish.",87,3 Horse Ranch Vineyards 2012 Single Vineyard Syrah
"This stand-out Cabernet Franc offers the structure and savory nuance of the Old World, but alongside a palate that's lusciously concentrated with ripe, succulent black fruit. Whiffs of violet and tea leaf reverberate from nose to finish, along with a bold yet velvet frame of tannins. Drinks gorgeously already but should meld in fruit, spice and perfume throughout the next decade.",93,Raphael 2014 Reserve Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island)
"Formerly labeled simply as a Roussanne-Viognier blend, this is now the companion wine to Tranche's Slice of Pape Red. Here is a wine with power, balance and concentration. It's a polished, focused, utterly seductive blend, dominated by the Roussanne, but with the Viognier contributing brightness and a floral top note. There's a riot of fruit flavors, from citrus to tangerine to Macintosh apple and spiced pear, with a slightly saline finish.",94,Tranche 2009 Slice of Pape Blanc White (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Young and vibrant, this is the winery's smaller production from a special selection of barrels. A soft, burly expression of strawberry, raspberry and ripe boysenberry, it is accentuated by generous portions of toasty oak and baking spices, a faint hint of dried herb on the finish.",90,Keller Estate 2012 Precioso Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This tight wine has red fruit acidity without the richness. With its green edge, it's likely to remain full of acidity even as it matures.",84,Pierre André 2011  Ladoix
"Intensely aromatic, this is Oregon Pinot at its most lush. Seductive scents lead into lengthy, balanced flavors of cherry and red plum, highlighted with green tea and tobacco notes. Tannins are smooth and proportionate, and the overall structure suggests aging this wine through 2025–2030.",93,Penner-Ash 2012 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir
"Drink this while it is still showing its youthful fruit. Black and purple berries abound, with excellent depth, some herbal grace notes and a spicy, lengthy finish.",89,Plumb Cellars 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A concentrated and seductive Merlot that's perfect for folks who like 'em big, ripe and oaky. Mulled boysenberries and blueberry compote flood the nose and mouth, with lush notes of milk chocolate, blackcurrant liqueur and dark coffee spicing up the finish. Round and velvet-textured, with medium tannins.",90,Golan Heights Winery 2007 Yarden Odem Vineyard Merlot (Galilee)
"Ripasso is a perfect wine for a chilly autumn evening with roasted meat and a roaring fireplace. Hearty and determined, this shows soft black fruit, with barbecue spice and teriyaki sauce.",88,Monte del Frá 2010 Tenuta Lena di Mezzo  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
"Pithy citrus aromas are heavy and strangely herbal for a white wine. Pulpy and wide in feel, with little midpalate structure, this tastes of citrus rind, white grapefruit and nopal. A zesty note reprises on the finish.",84,Peique 2013 Godello (Bierzo)
"Delicate scents of violet, iris, woodland berry and baking spice abound on this firmly structured red. Made with 95% Sangiovese, the remaining 5% is Colorino and Malvasia Nera. The smooth palate doles out Morello cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon and a hint of chopped herb while a backbone of velvety tannins provides the framework. Drink through 2016.",92,Tenuta Villa Trasqua 2011 Evoluto  (Chianti Classico)
"Generic on the nose, with undistinguished aromas of red fruits and candy. Feels plump and tastes a bit stalky, with generic red cherry, plum skin and candied flavors. Harmless and a touch sweet; drink well chilled.",85,Kaiken 2010 Rosé of Malbec Rosé (Mendoza)
"This aromatic wine offers notes of jasmine, quinine, flowers and peach. It drinks medium sweet with lightly spritzy stone-fruit flavors.",87,Original House Wine 2012 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Scents of Spanish broom, pineapple, orchard fruit and a saline note meld together in the glass. The focused palate offers mature apple, peach, botanical herb and mineral alongside firm acidity.",90,Biondi 2014 Chianta Bianco  (Etna)
"The wine is tight with acidity and red-currant fruits. It has structure and tannins as well as the fruitiness. That means the cru needs to age a few months, so drink from mid-2017.",85,Henry Fessy 2015  Côte de Brouilly
"An attractive floral, appley aroma and generous, ripe apple and herb flavors give this medium-bodied wine plenty of personality.",88,Castle Rock 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino County)
"This tastes a little sweet and a little green and leafy, but there's enough pineapple and orange richness to satisfy. Best of all is the acidity, which is bright and zippy.",86,Dry Creek Vineyard 2011 Fumé Blanc (Sonoma County)
"Softness of tannins makes this wine feel melted in the mouth, yet it has bright, zingy acidity, and the raspberry and cherry fruit is sweet and jammy. The result is simple.",84,Maddalena 2009 Merlot (Paso Robles)
"Ah, this is a wonderfully dry and bracing wine that avid wine drinkers will appreciate for its great balance, sense of reserve and mouthwatering quality. The aromas and flavors are like cucumber, grapefruit and white pepper, the acidity is almost electric and the finish lingering.",91,Bell 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County)
"Light berry aromas mix with brine, cumin and sweet spice on the nose. In the mouth, it's rather lean and juicy, with sharp acidity creating fresh red berry flavors and tang. Turns more piercing and citrusy the longer it airs out.",84,Espuela del Gaucho 2010 Malbec (Mendoza)
"Everything about this wine is big and heavy—including the name, the psychedelic label and the massive bottle with wax capsule—but in spite of all that mass, it tastes great. The color is deep and dark, aromas are full of oaky spices of nutmeg and vanilla, and rich fruit flavors are layered with texture.",90,Galatea Effect 2011 Genception of Giants Syrah (California)
"This is, quite simply, great Riesling. It has all the subtlety that the grape can produce, as well as a sense of longevity. There's an intensity of fruit—apples and citrus—that cuts through the texture, leaving a beautiful, lingering aftertaste. Still young, drink from 2016.",96,Domaine Weinbach 2011 Schlossberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"This is a very stylish and elegant Sémillon, estate-grown and offering tongue-coating, smooth flavors of lemon, lime and dusty, dry honeycomb. Lightly dappled with cinnamon spice, it's an outstanding example of this often-overlooked grape.",90,Basalt 2012 Double River Ranch Estate Semillon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"The Chenin Blanc in the blend gives this wine its nutty fruity character. It is an attractive ripe wine, spicy with a soft texture that is held up by its final acidity. Drink now.",88,Château Gaudrelle NV Vigneau Brut Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay (Crémant de Loire)
"This steely, flinty, medium-bodied wine has spent no time in oak, allowing it to express its peach and pineapple fruit with purity and abundance.",87,Pedroncelli 2016 East Side Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley)
"This particular bottling is a work in progress by veteran Brutocao. It's a step forward in their attempt to master Cabernet. The wine still has a rustic edge, with blackberry jam flavors wrapped into firm tannins, and a sweet finish.",85,Brutocao 2005 Hopland Ranches Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino)
"Dry peppery currant and red-plum aromas are light and nothing you haven't come across before. Plum flavors are a touch baked, with a chocolaty backdrop. A solid finish with savory, spicy plum notes is satisfying.",87,Echeverria 2013 Gran Reserva Merlot (Curicó Valley)
"While the savory nose leads with subdued notes of apple and lemon, this off-dry Riesling shines on the palate, with juicy stone fruit and yellow cherry flavors. Tangerine acidity adds zip and verve, leading into a finish that's fresh with herbal and floral tones.",89,Peter Mertes 2011 Bernkasteler Spätlese Gold Edition Riesling (Mosel)
"This complex white comes from cuttings procured in 2004 from one of the oldest surviving vineyards of this variety, thought to have originated in the Loire Valley, then replanted by the producer onto older rootstock. Lemony acidity meets light, bright floral intrigue around hints of peach, grapefruit and lime, remaining velvety smooth and balanced.",94,Michael Mondavi Family Estate 2014 Animo Heritage Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
The wine is structured and tannic which gives a dry edge that balances the perfumed black fruits and acidity. The aftertaste is fruity and juicy. Ready to drink.,87,Casa Ermelinda Freitas 2013 Reserva Syrah (Península de Setúbal)
"This is an apple-fresh sparkling wine with a lively mousse. It crisp, refreshing and clean, with attractive fruitiness.",87,Domaine du Moulin 2013 Brut Méthode Ancestrale Mauzac (Gaillac)
Crisp notes of freshly peeled pear mingle with a creamier aspect on the nose. The palate is a similarly appetizing and attractive mix of crisp freshness and creamy roundness. The body is very light but clean. The finish shines with fresh lemon.,90,Hugel 2014 Cuvée Les Amours Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
"A beautiful Pinot Noir notable for sheer lusciousness, which is partly due to high alcohol. The flavors are remarkably rich and ripe in cherries, currants and cola, with savory hints of mint and cocoa. Displays a great balance of acids, tannins and oak. Great now and for a decade.",93,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2006 Great Oak Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Still very young with its tannins dominant, this will nevertheless be a richly fruity wine as it develops. The black fruits are all there, along with licorice and bitter chocolate. Final acidity brings a lift to the dense texture.",90,Jean-Luc Baldès 2009 Château de Flore Malbec (Cahors)
"This complete wine has all the elements of delicious rosé right in place. It is fresh and fruity, crisply mineral and with a lively acidity. The texture makes it a good food wine. It comes from vineyards that are certified organic. Drink now.",92,Domaine du Deffends 2014 Rosé d'une Nuit Rosé (Coteaux Varois en Provence)
"Yeasty bread notes mingle with preserved cherry and raspberry tones on this dry, but fruity, Pinot Noir sparkling. It's quite bold on the palate with big, mouthfilling foam, and finishes with a touch of mushroom.",85,Heart & Hands 2011 Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes)
"The soft, silky quality of the tannins, fine acidity, and elaborate black cherry, currant, herb, anise and oak flavors make this elegant young wine fully ready to drink now, with equally fine food. Give it a few hours of decanting.",91,Lancaster 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Minerally apple aromas are dusty and yeasty, but straightforward. This feels juicy and a touch plump, with nectarine, citrus and green herb flavors that carry through to the finish.",87,Emina 2013 Verdejo-Viura (Rueda)
"Nice on the nose, this has a leafy note and a mellow red-berry aroma. Bouncy and rubbery feeling, it has easygoing flavors of raspberry and plum. It's candied and rubbery tasting on the finish, but good overall.",84,Terrenal 2010 Estate Bottled Tempranillo (Yecla)
"Lightly scented with a Riesling-like petrol note, this pungent, grassy Sauvignon Blanc offers a crisply focused mix of celery, green berry and spring herb.",87,Tildio 2011 Lonesome Spring Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))

"Soft herbal berry aromas are minty and green. The palate on this young but raisiny Cabernet has a jammy cushion to it, while flavors of green bean, herbs and carob are not distinguished. A creamy feeling but tannic finish is chewy, chunky and weighty.",83,Aguijón De Abeja 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Argentina)
"Lively and crisp, this has some good concentration and almond and creamy flavors over new wood. It shows ripe fruit, but there is also a zesty lemon character that gives it a lift and vibrancy. Deliciously refreshing.",89,Castello d'Alba 2006 Vinhas Velhas White (Douro)
"Produced from high-altitude (1,800 feet) vines, this wine is ripe while also crisply fresh. Its lime and lemon flavors are balanced by the mineral texture and intense final acidity. Drink now.",86,Van Zellers 2015 Rufo do Vale D. Maria Branco White (Douro)

"This dark, brawny expression doles out lavish aromas of smoked bacon, black olive, molasses, maple syrup and rich blackberry preserves. It's spicy and rich, but also tart and crisp. Those contrasting elements give it a sweet and sour feeling.",90,Monte del Frá 2008 Tenuta Lena di Mezzo  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"A reduced character of diesel and strong oak mark the entry of this vineyard-designated wine. It's ripe and powerful, veering on sweet.",84,St. Francis 2013 Banti Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"Made from fruit sourced from a parcel in Fourchaume, this fruity wine offers green fruit flavors that are cut by the minerally texture. It is crisp, taut and nervy, and it needs a few years to show its best.",89,Domaine Vrignaud 2011 Les Vaupulans Fourchaume Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"Start packing your cellar with 2010 Ribera gems like this wine, which is offering graphite and minerally plum and berry aromas in front of a full-bodied, hard-driving palate. Ripe, extracted blackberry and lightly herbal flavors finish with tons of residual weight and tannins. This is loud, burly and delicious; drink from 2016–2030.",93,Montecastro 2010 Alconte Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)

Firm tannins mark a lengthy, full-bodied finish.",90,Wild Ridge 2012 Annapolis Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)

This has aromas of citrus blossom and lemon pith. There are flavors of green apple and pear in the mouth with an acidic finish.,85,Koblevo NV Reserve Chardonnay (Ukraine)

"A young, 100% varietal and estate-farmed wine, this is a soft, thick and dusty gathering of chocolate and blackberry jam, filled in with wild game and leather. Robust and still tightly wound, it needs to open in the glass to unveil further complexities of texture and black pepper.",90,Montemaggiore 2013 Paolo's Vineyard Estate Grown Syrah (Dry Creek Valley)
"This is a pretty wine, forward and fruit-driven, with orange-juice highlights around cherry fruit. It's as fresh and flavorful as a Cru Beaujolais, ready for immediate enjoyment and best consumed sometime this decade.",88,Child's Play 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"An attractive, fruity wine that is soft and smooth. It does have a crisp edge although the wine is also full of yellow fruits, ripe apricot and melon. The wine is ready to drink.",87,Ollivier Frères 2015 Domaine de la Grenaudière Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"Aromatic with a waft of wax, this dry Riesling is bright with lemon and lime acidity. There's just a suggestion of petrol on the finish.",85,Madroña 2011 Dry Riesling (El Dorado)
"Cedar, pencil and wild mushroom scents accent the nose of this wine—a blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc, 20% Merlot and 10% Sangiovese. Generous tannins give additional weight to the overall concentration. The finish feels dusted with spicy clove.",90,Pure Cru 2012 PureCoz Red (Napa Valley)
"There is the merest hint of chamomile lift on the nose, pulling all the other flavors heavenwards with it. There is apple as well as lemon zest. The palate is wonderfully pure and totally dry. Here and there more herbal inflections show and more mellow hints of baked apple. This is dry, taut and aromatic, but also clean-cut and precise. Lovely now but with definite aging potential. Drink now through 2030.",93,Domaine Charles Baur 2013 Brand Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"The aromas bring notes of herb, sweet tobacco and ash. The plum flavors are tart and full in feel, with the tannins giving a (quite) chalky squeeze.",87,Sawtooth 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon
"There's the ever-so-slight touch of pink to the glass in this bottling by Bruno D'Alfonso, who packs strong and fresh aromas of cider apples, chalk, tangerine zest, pear flesh and light jasmine on the nose. There is tons of energy on the palate, tightening up before unleashing poached Asian pear, lime spritzer and red apple flavors.",92,Di Bruno 2016 Pinot Grigio (Santa Barbara County)
"It opens with aromas of toasted wood, cherry cough medicine, espresso, vanilla, black spices and Mediterranean brush. The muddled palate delivers sweet oak, vanilla extract and caramelized sugar sensations alongside astringent wood tannins. It lacks fruit richness and closes on a bitter, medicinal note.",86,Castelgiocondo 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
"A beautifully structured, ripe wine that's full of juicy blackberry flavors, ripe tannins and a dense texture. The concentration from old vines is a particular character of this firm wine. Age for at least four years to get the full benefits.",92,Casa Cadaval 2009 Muge Vinhas Velhas Trincadeira (Tejo)
"Surprisingly tannic, this juicy wine shows intense structure and a smoky character from wood aging. It feels as though the tannins and extract have smothered the natural fruitiness of the wine. It will need time to come round, so wait until 2017.",85,Casal do Conde 2011 Terras do Vale Colheita Seleccionada Merlot (Tejo)
"From a fine site farmed by Steve Matthiasson, this crisp, delightfully compelling white is tart and tangy in orange and lime.

"Aromas of pressed apples and pears turn fleshier and riper on the palate of this forward, concentrated Riesling. Sumptuous peach and apricot flavors amass a honeyed sweetness on the midpalate, balanced neatly by squirts of tangerine acidity. It's an approachable, fruity wine to drink now through 2017.",88,Peter Mertes 2014 Platinum Riesling (Mosel)
"Defines the Paso Robles style of enormously ripe fruit and softness. Incredibly rich in brown sugar, blackberry jam, chocolate and smoky oak flavors, it's not particularly subtle, but delicious now.",88,Adelaida 2009 Viking Estate Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"This is Syrah from the far northwest corner of the Columbia Valley, a cool region, whose wines show an underlying minerality. The berry flavors are subtle; this is a mélange of leaf, herb, rock and acid. Still young, the tannins are drying and the wine seems to be entering a dumb phase. Give it plenty of breathing time.",89,Nefarious 2008 Rocky Mother Vineyard Estate Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This densely colored wine is still very much on its oak, with toasted coffee bean and sawdust aromas. The palate shows evident wood, vegetal notes and red currant. Green, bitter tannins cut the finish short.",84,Le Regge 2010  Chianti Classico
"This wine shows red plum, Rainier cherry, rose petal and churro spice aromas. The palate is clean and crystalline in its red cherry and cinnamon spice flavors, proving light and easy, with bright acidity and grippy texture.",91,The Farm Winery 2014 The Dish Grenache (Adelaida District)
"This light-bodied Rioja smells of cherry, plum and cotton candy. It's a bit thin on the palate but offers just enough body to be worthwhile. Mild plum and cherry flavors hollow out on the simple finish.",84,Montebuena 2014 Cuvée KPF  (Rioja)
"Juicy cassis fills the palate in this balanced wine, blended with small percentages of Malbec, Merlot and Petit Verdot. With a leathery texture and earthy underbody, it's mellow with supple finish.",88,Stags' Leap Winery 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"While unusually perfumey, this dry, full-bodied Pinot Gris balances pleasant apple and pear flavors with a striking lemon acidity. Robustly structured, a slight warming sensation adds to the finish.",85,Hosmer 2011 Pinot Gris (Cayuga Lake)
"This is complex and compelling. A spicy, minty, thyme-like character comes out in the aroma and continues in the flavor, most likely from some new barrels used in aging the wine. It's an attractive characteristic, and complements the bright cherry flavors, medium body and quite firm tannins.",89,Spann Vineyards 2011 The Classic Four Red (California)
"Feral strawberry grabs all the attention in this wildly fierce, high-acid wine that packs a punch in texture, tannin power and body. Small amounts of Syrah, Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah figure into the blend, which is made in minuscule amounts.",90,Crux 2014 Grenache (Russian River Valley)
"Fresh lemon perfume juxtaposes delicate toast and spice notes on this briskly balanced yet full-bodied Chardonnay. It's not deeply penetrating, but crisp apple and pear flavors brighten the palate. The finish lingers on a silken vanilla tone. Drink now through 2021.",87,Lamoreaux Landing 2014 Reserve Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"The nose is shy but promises development with its heady note of chamomile. The palate reinforces this soothing, herbal and balm-like feeling even more, seemingly dissolving dried chamomile aromas in a sea of fluid, fresh lemon. The palate is absolutely dry and comes with a wonderful lightness of touch. Despite the ripeness of the 2012 vintage this has ease and a spring in its step. This wine is lovely now and will continue to evolve for a long time. Concentration will make sure of that. Drink 2017–2030.",94,Domaine G. Metz 2012 Muenchberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"This expression of Barolo from the Castiglione Falletto area of Piedmont delivers sweet spice notes of cinnamon and clove over a solid base of red fruit, cassis and dried berries. Lighter and more delicate tones of cola and licorice appear in the background and the wine is firm and polished in the mouth.",90,Elio Filippino 2007 Castiglione Falletto  (Barolo)
"91–93. Barrel sample. From the same stable as Léoville Poyferré in Saint-Julien, this is a finely structured, ripe and serious wine. It has dark tannins, big blackberry fruitiness and a generous while firm character.",92,Château Le Crock 2012 Barrel Sample  (Saint-Estèphe)
"This cool-climate Chardonnay offers beautiful aromas of white peach, honey, apricot and exotic fruit. It's silky but fresh mouthfeel should pair with shellfish or sophisticated Thai dishes. Very nice.",90,Kellerei Kaltern Caldaro 2008 Giovanelli Chardonnay (Alto Adige)
"Deep straw to the eye, this wine has a bouquet of lemon curd and apricot. Slightly savory flavors of pear, apricot, lavender and thyme are joined in the finish by the faintest hint of sweetness and a floral note.",87,Ouled Thaleb 2014 White (Zenata)
"Need a recommendation for a good house wine? This medium-bodied red has moderate fruit flavors, good structure from acidity and tannins, and a nice feeling of completeness. It is a catch-all blend of Zinfandel, Pinot Noir and four other grape varieties.",86,Navarro 2013 Navarrouge Red (Mendocino)
"Nice for a warmer-climate Chardonnay, with toast, white fruit, cinnamon and baked notes to the bouquet. Feels healthy and round, with fleshy peach, apple and spice flavors. Falls off a touch on the finish, but overall it runs smoothly.",87,Viña Requingua 2010 Toro de Piedra Reserva Chardonnay (Maule Valley)
"Gold in color and loaded with heavily toasted, resiny barrel aromas. The palate is lush and Burgundian, with lemon, baked apple, woodspice and white pepper flavors. Toasty and well structured for a barrel-fermented Spanish white.",89,Coto de Gomariz 2009 Colleita Seleccionada White (Ribeiro)
"Cooked-down blackberries take on pink peppercorn and new leather aromas in this Malbec hailing from the high-altitude vineyards of Colorado. The dark berry tones of the palate carry shards of graphite, with zippy red currant acidity keeping the full body and grainy tannins in check. It's a bit tight right now and should open up after 2016.",89,Snowy Peaks 2011 Malbec (Grand Valley)
"Red berry, fragrant blue flower, dark spice and a whiff of eucalyptus come together on this one. The taut, structured palate offers dried black cherry, licorice, clove and a hint of grilled sage. Firm, fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide balance and support. Drink 2020–2032.",94,Villa Poggio Salvi 2010 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Consistency is always a virtue, and once again this wine is creamy, fully oaked and more European in style than most Chilean Chardonnays. The nose is like popcorn, with apple and peach in the background. Flavors of banana, coconut, melon and apple carry the rich palate, while the finish is smooth and oaky. This is very good Chardonnay even if it lacks the extra elements required of a great wine. Drink now for its freshness.",88,Miguel Torres 2002 Maquehua Chardonnay (Curicó Valley)
"Smells great, with complex scents of black pepper, bacon and ripe wild blackberries, just the way Syrah should. But it turns soft and sweet in the mouth, with simple jam flavors.",85,Three Saints 2008 Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)
"A lush, flavorful Cabernet that offers plenty of richness. It floods the mouth with ripe blackberries, cherries, black currants and cassis, with hints of chocolate and mushu plum sauce. The thick tannins need a good steak to play against.",87,Dogwood 2006 Meritage (Mendocino)
"Aromas of toasted oak, espresso, chocolate and mocha echo on the palate, along with notes of chocolate and mocha. But it lacks fruit richness and can't stand up to the astringent wood tannins.",86,Prinsi 2011 Gallina  (Barbaresco)
"The label does not bear the name Angela Vineyard, but the fruit is estate grown. This is a tight, focused, young red wine, with tangy raspberry fruit that touches on black cherry. Vivid and penetrating, it needs plenty of time to breathe, and as it does it reveals subtle layers of mocha and caramel. This has the bones to age. Drink now through 2030.",92,Angela Estate 2013 Pinot Noir
"Caparzo delivers a consistent and clean expression of Brunello year after year. This shows a touch of bright acidity, formed thanks to a cooler than average growing season, and is backed by aromas of forest fruit and cola. Full flavors of tobacco and spice carry the wine smoothly over the palate.",91,Caparzo 2008  Brunello di Montalcino
"Aromas of honey, passion fruit, peach and natural rubber appear on the nose. There's a soapy, floral element as well but the wine ultimately ends on a dry, crisp note.",88,Abbazia di Novacella 2010 Praepositus Sylvaner (Alto Adige)
"This bold Cabernet Sauvignon from Tuscany offers thick layers of chocolate folded within equally thick layers of black cherry. The wine is dense and rich with smooth tannins and a succulent, chewy finish. Drink it with grilled meats marinated in olive oil, garlic and rosemary.",90,Tenuta di Trecciano 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Toscana)
"Blueberries and blackberries are the dominant themes here, with some smoky notes playing a supporting role. Bright, tart and fruity, this doesn’t appear to have the depth for aging. But it is an immensely attractive wine for early quaffing. There are some slightly drying tannins on the finish, so try it with rich or fatty foods for best effect.",88,Domaine des Entrefaux 1999  Crozes-Hermitage
"Pie cherry and raspberry fruit flavors open, with gentle barrel notes of toast and caramel. Balanced and light, this has a pleasing elegance, though a quick finish suggests a lack of depth.",87,Brandborg 2008 Love Puppets Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley)
"There's a touch of wood to this wine, but the primary emphasis is on citrusy, pineapple-scented fruit. Apple flavors provide roundness, while the wine finishes citrusy and fresh without being sharp.",87,Andrew Peace 2006 MasterPeace Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia)
"With some weight behind it, this is a rich wine, spicy and ripely fruity. The red berry fruits offer a sweet edge, with a tannic character that turns the wine very food friendly. A rosé for cold weather.",88,Domaine de la Chapelle Saint-Victor 2010 Rosé (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence)
"Almost too much of a good thing, Passo is a thick, jammy and modern blend of traditional Italian grapes and international varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. This is a bold, big wine with a thick, chewy mouthfeel that should be paired with aged cheese or succulent meat.",88,Stefano Accordini 2008 Passo Red (Rosso del Veronese)
"Importer Robert Kacher has an impressive stable of rosés from the southern Rhône at terrific pricing. this one, from the undervalued right bank of the valley, features 70% Cabernet Franc. Peaches, cherries and hints of peppery spice combine easily, then end on a note of wet stones. Drink now.",89,Domaine des Cantarelles 2012 Rosé de Fayel Rosé (Vin de Pays du Gard)
"Pristine flavors of cassis and black cherry give an elegant floral quality to this dry, full-bodied Cabernet. Crisp with acidity, it's balanced and impeccably crafted. It finishes long on a delicious coffee-inflected note.",87,Domaine Boyar 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Thracian Valley)
"Here's a Cortese-based white wine that rests on the lees for extra texture and richness. The wine is redolent of peach, apricot, honey and exotic fruit. It feels fresh and linear on the close.",86,La Scolca 2007 White Label  (Gavi)
"Crushed strawberry aromas, followed by flavors that are fresh, sweet and a palate that has the delicious prickle of a young wine. Screwcap.",84,Aveleda 2009 Casal Garcia Rosé (Vinho Verde)
"Heavy duty purple aromas of blackberry chiffon and blueberry pudding are lifted by a strong dill element on this darkly layered bottling. Baked blueberries meet with black olives, more dill and cut oregano, held together by a strong tannic structure.",92,Jade Moon 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"The nose tells of the crisp green freshness of tart apples, the palate counters this with more generous, riper but still very fresh fruit and a wonderfully balm-like creaminess. It all comes together on the midpalate: rounded but unobtrusive autolysis embraces the tart briskness and rounds it all out. Totally refreshing, and does not take itself too seriously.",89,Bolney Wine Estate NV Bolney Bubbly White (England)
"Fully oaked, and you can tell via the aromas of coconut, resin, vanilla and latex that sit on top of tobacco and floral berry scents. Feels tight and high in acid, with herbal-leaning red berry flavors. Fresh and basic on the finish, with lasting acidity.",87,Piattelli 2009 Grand Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Tupungato)
"An open-book Cabernet medium in tannin structure and expressive in plum, blackberry and tobacco. Juicy with a rustic edge.",85,Loken Cellars 2010 Penn Valley Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Sierra Foothills)
"Lean and easy, this has bright peach, apricot and lemon-lime aromas. A bright note of tangerine skin appears on the finish.",86,Conte Brandolini 2010 D'Adda Pinot Grigio (Friuli Grave)
"Thirst-quenching, lean and tangy, it would make a good match with shucked oysters. It shows lemon and green apple aromas, plus fresh and crisp citrus flavors. Medium in body, the texture is pleasantly lean while the finish is refreshing.",88,Clos du Lac 2013 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Amador County)
"Wet stone and a chalky underbelly of crisp, clean and low-oaked fruit entices in this food-friendly wine, elegant in lemon, lime and green apple. Juicy and well-rounded, it's an easily enjoyable wine at a fair price that will please a range of palates.",90,Schug 2013 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"Violet, ripe black berry, vanilla and tilled soil aromas take center stage. The palate offers dense and juicy black cherry layered with chocolate and mocha alongside polished tannins. It's straightforward, savory and accessible. Enjoy now.",89,Fattoria Tregole 2009 Le Pigole  (Chianti Classico)
"From a replanted single vineyard, single clone site, the first vintage since that replanting in 2009, there's a youthful awkwardness still at play here, though the wine is quite juicy in black cherry and a lingering suggestion of soy. The oak and tannin are fairly firm and pronounced.",90,Iron Horse 2013 Q Pinot Noir (Green Valley)
"This sparkling rosé has raspberry on the nose, with mid-range autolytic character and a little nuttiness. The palate contains more fruit, specifically strawberry, peaches and raspberry. There is a note of sourdough. Soft petillance and edgy acidity finish off the experience.",86,Trump 2010 Sparkling Rosé  (Monticello)
"This wine is 100% varietal. The aromas are locked up at present, with notes of luxurious French oak treatment and cherry. The flavors are dense and concentrated, but the tannins show a fair amount of grip, providing some distraction. There are good things going on but the oak is intense at present.",89,Fidelitas 2014 Quintessence Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"Vibrantly fruity, it offers aromas of currant, raspberry, celery stalk and spice. The palate has tart cranberry flavors, finishing a bit short.",86,Foris 2012 Maple Ranch Estate Pinot Noir (Rogue Valley)
"A blend of 40% Sangiovese, 20% Syrah, 20% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit and cooking spice. The firm savory palate doles out sour cherry, cinnamon and tobacco alongside smooth tannins. Drink through 2020.",89,Borgo Scopeto 2014 Borgonero Red (Toscana)
"You can taste the wood in this red, fruity wine. It gives a spicy character to the cherries and red currants, adding both complexity and the potential for aging. The end shows the fresh acidity of the year.",88,Georges Duboeuf 2011 Château des Capitans  (Juliénas)
"It's unclear why this wine's bottle has to be so heavy. After all, the wine inside is ripe, fruity and very ready to drink, certainly not for aging. Black fruits have matured into a leather texture and smoky flavors. The wine is ripe and full in the mouth with just a touch of pepper at the end from alcohol. Drink now.",86,Marcolino Sebo 2010 QP Colheita Seleccionada Red (Alentejano)
"Merlot and Cabernet Franc make up the majority of this blend. The aromas of dried herbs, pencil lead, cherry and spice are subdued while the palate brings a somewhat elegant style, with the tannins seeming a bit bunched up.",88,Telaya 2013 Sruth Boushey Vineyard Red (Yakima Valley)
"Neutral for the most part, but this light-framed white slips in pear, orange and spice notes while maintaining a nice, juicy profile. Nothing more than a refreshing, lime-infused dandy. But what's wrong with that?",85,Valentin Bianchi 2007 Elsa Bianchi Torrontés
"While this shows its youthful tannins, it also bears blackberry fruit and juicy acidity. The chateau has produced a stylish wine that's rich while still keeping plenty of freshness and acidity. Age for 3–4 years.",88,Château Maison Blanche 2010  Médoc
"This is a new wine from this negociant house that specializes in limited production wines. It is a smooth and rounded wine, ripe with apples and yellow fruits as well as being cut with acidity. The wine is refreshing and crisp at the end with a touch of minerality.",87,Roche de Bellene 2014  Saint-Véran
"Rich, juicy and structured, this firm wine has great power and concentration along with a dark, dry core. It's almost too much of a good thing, very flamboyant and ripe. It still needs to age to be fully balanced.",89,Château le Reysse 2010  Médoc
"This is a big-flavored wine, aged sur lie, and about 30% was barreled in new French oak. There are pleasant vanilla, lime andapricot flavors, a creamy mouthfeel and a toasty edge to the finish.",87,Torii Mor 2000 Pinot Blanc (Rogue Valley)
"An almost tropical overtone of passion fruit precedes the zesty, herbal notes that fizz away on nose and palate. Citrus zest frames the palate which is streamlined, light-bodied but concentrated. This offers verve, clean-cut refreshment and zesty length.",92,Eder 2015 Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"Sweet oak dominates, making it taste like buttered toast dipped into wine. The pineapple and orange fruit underneath all that wood is just fine.",84,VML 2010 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"With concentration and a sense of structure, this is a solid wine with great potential. It has firm tannins under the attractive raspberry fruits. The wine is dense and certainly needs aging. Drink from 2018.",90,Roche de Bellene 2012 Vieilles Vignes  (Savigny-lès-Beaune)
"Here's a fresh, densely concentrated Barbera with a dark purplish hue to its ruby color and bright aromas of blueberry, raspberry and black cherry. There's not much complexity here, but the point of this wine is to be informal and a good partner to home cooked meals.",86,Silvio Morando 2008  Barbera del Monferrato
"Medium ruby in color, this Pinot has an overripe bramble berry aroma, with a slightly stemmy quality in the background. The light-bodied palate boasts juicy red fruits, zippy acidity and sandy tannins.",85,Wyncroft 2012 Avonlea Pinot Noir (Lake Michigan Shore)
"Lush flavors of cherry jam, red currants and licorice are enhanced with new French oak to make this wine softly delicious. A few drops of other red varieties, including Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, add to its structure and depth.",88,Sebastiani 2011 Merlot (Alexander Valley)
"This wine is ripe, full of yellow fruits that are balanced with crisp acidity. That gives a balanced wine that is juicy, perfumed and rich. The aftertaste is equally attractive, showing lemon-zest flavor.",88,Chanson Père et Fils 2014  Mâcon La Roche Vineuse
"There's a sharp, hard edge to this Barbaresco that makes it a good candidate for succulent meat dishes with cream sauce. But this wine also delivers an immediate, upfront style that makes it more approachable than most.",88,Adriano Marco & Vittorio 2008 Sanadaive  (Barbaresco)
"Spice and saltiness are corralled into a tight frame of citrus freshness. The palate is zesty while the varietal white pepper and herb notes of Grüner shimmer here and there. Very slender with a refreshing, lively palate.",90,Hirsch 2014 Grub Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"A fragrant, sherbety cloud of spring meadow and lemon hovers above the glass. Grassy freshness frames the bright, pure lemon notions that dominate nose and palate. This wine is utterly fresh, citric and brisk. The mouthfeel is taut and slender, with only the slightest edge of autolytic notes and a structure of freshness and purity. It almost has a cleansing quality on its superbright, clean finish.",91,Bolney Wine Estate 2015 Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (England)
"Much of a piece with its companion releases, this is done in a lighter style, with plum and berry fruit, dried herbs and a short, simple finish.",85,Glen Fiona 2006 Puncheon Select Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Except for being just a bit linear, this is a really good Cabernet for the price. It offers rich blackberry, black currant liqueur, anise and cedar flavors that are wrapped into firm tannins. The balance is really impressive. It's throwing some sediment already, so decant it.",90,Firestone 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley)
"This is a full and generous Friulano (a native grape of northeast Italy) that shows ripe aromas of peach, melon and pear. It is smooth and rich on the palate and would pair with creamy seafood risotto.",89,Volpe Pasini 2008 Zuc di Volpe Friulano (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"Whiffs of herbs and green florals persist from start to finish on this elegant off-dry Riesling. The palate is lush with ripe white-peach flavor, but blossomy and bright with a streak of lemon-lime acidity. Finishes long with a delicately lacy sweetness.",91,Boundary Breaks 2012 Ovid Line North Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"The aromas of herbs, pink grapefruit and guava don't seem entirely knitted together on this young wine. It's dry and fleshy in feel but doesn't have the concentration to bring it all together.",86,Jones of Washington 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Ancient Lakes)
"The wine is rich and full in the mouth with ripe fruit from the deep clay soil of this premier cru. It is beautifully concentrated and ripe. The fruit is so crisp and juicy that this yellow and white-fruit flavored wine could be drunk now. That would be a shame, because it will be even better from 2018.",93,Jean-Marc Brocard 2015 Butteaux Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"This is the winning Mourvèdre of the vintage for Ryan Pease, one of the few winemakers to do multiple bottlings of the Rhône varietal. Exotic olallieberies, black peppercorns, vanilla cookies, nutmeg and black rocks show on the nose, while the palate delivers tighter boysenberries, cracked pepper, Sichuan peppercorns, wet gravel and crushed asphalt. This one's built to last.",93,Paix Sur Terre 2014 The Other One Glenrose Vineyard Mourvèdre (Adelaida District)
"A young and fruity wine that is soft with gentle tannins and juicy black currant fruit flavors. It is ripe, fresh and balanced with generous acidity at the end. Drink now.",85,Casa de Cambres 2014 Colheita Red (Douro)
"The Suremain family winery in the main street of Mercurey has cellars going back to the 17th century. This wood-aged wine will have been kept here, where it has developed into a structured and firm wine, full of dry tannins as well as ripe red-berry fruits. Drink from 2023.",92,Domaine de Suremain 2015 Les Crêts Premier Cru  (Mercurey)
"Already a modern classic of the Douro, this red wine from Niepoort, with its baked apple and blackberry aromas, is intensely fruity and rounded with sweet wood, black plum and jelly flavors. The texture is smooth, soft, perhaps just missing a grip of tannin.",89,Niepoort 2005 Vertente Red (Douro)
"Red berry, dried rose, leather, eucalyptus and baking spice aromas slowly take shape in the glass. The ripe, juicy palate offers black cherry extract, raspberry, anisette and clove alongside firm, refined tannins. A tobacco note wraps up the finish. Drink 2017–2022.",93,Viberti 2010 La Volta Riserva  (Barolo)
"Fresh and easy, this delivers fruity aromas of Golden Delicious apple, apricot, honey and yellow flower. A drying mineral note renders a clean, polished finish.",86,Tenuta di Pietra Porzia 2011 Saula Carta Nera  (Frascati Superiore)
"Concentrated and dark in color, this wine reveals itself slowly, sharing vibrant layers of raspberry and citrus around burly tannins. It's an all-in-all juicy wine that balances Napa exuberance against a sense of elegance.",92,St. Supéry 2011 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"Dry and stalky, this wine from the eastern Alentejo is structured and firm. It has ripe black fruit flavors along with acidity, both of them dominated by tannins from the fruit. The wine needs to age; drink from 2017.",87,Herdade dos Machados 2013 Santos Jorge Red (Alentejo)
"Excellent modern Rioja at a fair price. Smells solid, with crusty minerality and toasty oak to go with black fruit aromas. Feels flush and voluminous, with jammy blackberry, baked fig and coffee flavors. Toasty, meaty and dark on the finish. Drink now through 2014.",90,Señorio de Uñuela 2006 Reserva  (Rioja)
"The ripe, spicy strawberry and orange fruitiness of this wine is immediately attractive. It has lively acidity within a rich framework. Drink this refreshing wine now.",87,Herdade da Malhadinha Nova 2016 Monte da Peceguina Rosé (Alentejano)
"Tonella has 16% Merlot within, from the estate vineyard around the winery. Cedar, currant and dried herb greet the nose and palate before allowing chalky, dusty tannin to season layers of chocolate and black cherry, staying structured and bright from start to finish.",90,Sequoia Grove 2012 Tonella Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"This highly unusual expression of Verdicchio clocks in at a whopping 15% alcohol and it shows. Despite a subtle hint of lemon drop flavor, the palate lacks fruit richness to support the alcohol and it shows signs of oxidation.",82,Sartarelli 2010 Balciana  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore)
"Meaty, dusty aromas of leather, cigar box, old books, roasted lamb, tobacco smoke and purple flowers make for a compelling nose on this wine. The palate is quite leathery, with beef crust, wood smoke and incense ash flavors, delivered in a smooth manner.",88,Firestone 2011 Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Waxy stone-fruit aromas come with a shot of butterscotch but also a whiff of chemical cleanser. In the mouth, this blend of Viura and Malvasia is full-bodied and braced by sharp acidity. Flavors of walnut, baked peach and citrus peel finish with nutty notes and angular acidity. At six years of age, this is showing some gaps in its fiber.",86,Casado Morales 2009 Reserva White (Rioja)
"Fragrant, fresh and floral, this textbook Rosso di Montalcino offers lovely aromas of wild berries, violets, pressed powder and cake spices. The delicious palate doles out juicy red cherry and crushed raspberry accented with notes of cinnamon, all wrapped up in an elegant, silky-smooth texture. Enjoy over the next few years.",92,Le Chiuse 2012  Rosso di Montalcino
"Not bad for basic Argentine Chardonnay. The nose has banana and tropical fruit aromas to go with dried hay, while the soft-bodied palate has enough acidity to keep it flowing. Flavors of melon, banana and vanilla are solid even though it flattens out and shows mild bitterness on the finish.",85,Finca La Niña 2009 Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"Waxy, weird aromas of lemon and ham are all over the map. This feels heavy, with a sense of sugary weight. Chunky flavors of cured pork and creamy melon finish plump but amorphous.",84,Enate 2014 234 Chardonnay (Somontano)
"Aromas of coffee bean, mocha, plum and damp soil lead the nose. The palate offers toast, espresso, licorice, dried black cherry and tart red currant alongside a backbone of zesty acidity and dusty tannins.",88,Gianni Gagliardo 2013 La Matta  (Barbera d'Alba Superiore)
"Delicious scents of honey, apples and petrol lead to a luscious, full-bodied palate full of smoke and honey with a gripping lime skin astringency on the finish. Rich in honey tones, yet quite dry, the palate is balanced with a bracing acidity.",87,Château Bela 2008 Riesling (Muzla)
"A Blanc de Noirs from Malbec, this aromatic wine has just a hint of tannins from the grape skins along with attractive acidity. It's a surprisingly fresh and fruity wine in the context of Malbec. Drink now.",86,Château de Gaudou NV Gaudou Exception Brut Malbec (Vin Mousseux)
"A darkly colored, tannic Cabernet whose dry astringency keeps it from being thoroughly enjoyable now. Despite the astringency, however, it showcases an immaculate core of blackberries and black currants. Elegant and classy, it should age well throughout the decade.",93,Cardinale 2007 Red (Napa Valley)
"Made by the team from Château Lynch-Bages, this estate crafts wines in the same generous style. A firm, tannic edge gives structure to the juicy acidity and black currant flavors. Drink from 2018.",91,Château les Ormes de Pez 2013  Saint-Estèphe
"A relatively pale color and rather delicate plum and red cherry aromas suggest a light, elegant wine, but these are followed by richer flavors and a very tannic texture that dries the teeth like strong tea. It's made from 50% Mourvèdre, 40% Grenache and 10% Petite Sirah.",85,Legendre 2012 Tailrace Red (Amador County)
"Dominated by new wood, this wine has not yet found its true character. It will likely become rich and juicy, with black plum and spice flavors coming forward in 2–3 years. For the moment, it is all about firmness and dryness.",89,Château Grand Destieu 2006  Saint-Émilion
"This wine reeks of intensity, from its powerful aromas of musk and dried pineapple to its somewhat monolithic honeyed fruit flavors and enormous sugar levels. It's impressively concentrated—enough to stand up to almost any dessert you choose to throw at it.",90,Castell 2006 Casteller Schlossberg Trockenbeerenauslese Silvaner (Franken)
"Beautifully packaged in a simple bottle with a red seal, this fresh Barbera d'Alba (aged only in stainless steel) offers bright, sharp acidity that would cut straight through butter- or cream-based dishes.",86,Gianni Gagliardo 2008  Barbera d'Alba
"Made as an ice wine, this sweet treat smells nutty, honeyed and a touch earthy It tastes rich, like salted peanuts coated with toffee and apricot syrup. The texture is viscous, palate-clinging and persistent, holding unctuous flavors for a long finish.",90,Mt. Konocti Winery 2015 Vin de Glace Muscat (Lake County)
"This wine is 40% each of Grenache and Mourvèdre with the balance Counoise. It's lighter in color, with aromas of plum, boysenberry, herbs, flowers and peppery spices. It's palate-coating with silky, sweet fruit flavors that linger.",89,Tamarack Cellars 2013 Spicebox Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This wine, with its gentle wood aging and ripe fruits, is the more accessible early of the two wines made at the estate. It is full of ripe berry fruits, while having a background of firm tannins and a dusty texture. The wine should be ready from 2018.",87,Château Grand-Maison 2012 Cuvée Sélection  (Côtes de Bourg)
"The unfolding layers of aroma on the nose of this bottling—sesame, white pepper, rose and wild berry, to name a few—keep one coming back for more. The palate is textured and finishes on an uplifting note, showing raspberry, dried flowers, fresh herbs and a hint of menthol toward the end.",93,Talley 2014 Rosemary's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"Petite Sirah makes up 60% of this wine, with the rest equal parts Syrah and Grenache. It brings aromas of herb, cherry, black licorice and spice. The palate is dense and structured, with layers of dark fruit flavors.",92,Two Vintners 2013 Oliver Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This wine remains astringent in tannins, with a lockded-down mouthfeel that's hard to get past. But it's very rich in blackberry and cherry fruit. Is it worth aging? It's hard to tell if 10 years will be of benefit, but the tannins seem likely to outlast the fruit. Drink up over the next 5–6 years.",87,Markham 2008 The Altruist Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Made from biodynamically grown grapes, this wine is remarkably floral, high-toned and rewarding—a complex commingling of anise, green apple and grapefruit flavors. A gravelly texture gives it context and supports the lingering, succulent acidity.",94,Quivira 2015 Refuge Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley)
"Made with organic grapes, this easygoing Merlot is designed for health-conscious vegans and vegetarians. The wine offers sharp berry and cherry flavors with a thin, citrusy close.",83,Pizzolato 2009 Terra Summa Merlot (Piave)
"This intriguing stickie is predominantly (94%) Chardonnay—an unusual choice for a botrytized wine. Dried apricot and ripe pear aromas lead the way, with the flavors leaning toward intensely honeyed apricot preserves. It's full-bodied, lush and candy-sweet, with a mouthcoating finish.",91,D'Arenberg 2006 The Noble Chardonnay-Semillon (Adelaide)
"This is a peppery, almost dry wine, with pear and green plum flavors. It is soft and light, and its lively, zesty acidity makes this a refreshing apéritif style.",85,Robert Klingenfus 2011 Signature Sylvaner (Alsace)
"This is a bright and fruity, red-fruit flavored wine. It has a touch of tannins to give some texture, along with bright acidity and a crisp aftertaste. Drink now.",86,Wolfberger NV Rosé Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"A majority of new French oak nestled this wine, contributing to its dark golden color and oak intensity on the nose and palate. Slightly sweet in ripe apple and vanilla, it will benefit greatly from the enjoyment of food alongside.",88,Hill Family Estate 2012 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Ripe and creamy in texture, this is a pear and peach flavored wine. A touch of butteriness gives a rounded texture and a hint of vanilla. Drink this fruity wine from 2015.",86,Château Philippe-le-Hardi 2012  Mercurey
"Aromas suggesting underbrush, toast, leather and dried herb lead the nose while the brawny, one-dimensional palate offers cherry marinated in spirits and licorice. The heat of evident alcohol throws it off balance.",87,Girolamo Russo 2014 Rosso  (Etna)
"Buoyant berry notes jump out of the glass in a very direct and vertical manner. You'll recognize aromas of black cherry, red apple and cassis berry. But there's also a slight notes of nut or spice at the back followed by soft, sweet fruit flavors.",87,Silvio Morando 2007  Barbera del Monferrato Superiore
"This lightly herbal wine is crisp and has a tangy mineral character. It's tight, green and full of citrus fruits. The acidity is right up front, keeping the wine fresh and bright at the end.",85,Le Val 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de France)
"Supple and layered, this nicely captures the scope and scale of this superb vintage. It's still young, tight and quite compact, but shows threads of tobacco, anise, stone and pencil lead, along with full, fleshy, plum and cassis fruit. Great structure and dense, ripe tannins. This is a perfect illustration of why Washington Merlot can claim to be the best in the world outside of Pomerol.",93,J. Bookwalter 2007 Foreshadow Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A distinct note of honey hovers above the ripe, tart apple fruit. On the palate the apples have the rounded richness of baked fruit and the zing of lemon freshness, making for a friendly, approachable, zesty Riesling with a clean finish.",90,Kuentz-Bas 2014 Eichberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"This complex wine has a touch of sweetness allowing the fruit to be ready to drink sooner. At the same time, it has structure, strong minerality and a floral, fragrant character. Drink from 2015 or wait for the full effect until 2018.",88,Biecher & Schaal 2013 Schlossberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"Like all Jurançon, this wine brings together great richness and great freshness. The honey and peach fruits are laced with acidity to give the wine poise, while hints of dry botrytis promise aging. This is a ripe, full wine that should be drunk from 2017.",92,Château Jolys 2012  Jurançon
"This bottling, which is balanced by 16% Cabernet Franc and 9% Merlot, rides the savory edge of the grape, with aromas of underbrush and dried herbs giving depth to the black-olive and black-currant aromas. The palate offers a mix of red and darker fruits, including cranberry, plum and blackberry, with touches of thyme and anise.",92,Chateau Margene 2014 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"This Brut expression of Prosecco is easy and tight in the mouth with fresh floral fragrances of jasmine and white rose as well as fruity tones of stone fruit and lemon. The mouthfeel is tight, sharp and compact.",86,Il Follo NV Cuvée Rustot Brut  (Prosecco)
"The nose isn't very expressive but eventually yields subdued whiffs of toasted oak and honey. On the shy palate, suggestions of mature apple, lemon drop and a briny note come through before a rather abrupt finish.",86,La Cappuccina 2015 San Brizio  (Soave)
"This is half Cabernet Sauvignon with the balance Merlot (38%) and Syrah. Aromas of vanilla, leafy herbs, barrel spices and dried cherries lead to full bodied fruit flavors with the oak showing prominently.",87,Koenig Vineyards 2011 Cuvée Alden Private Reserve Red
"Cherry and black plum aromas are oaky and smoky. Full, blocky and a bit awkward on the palate, this Garnacha tastes of minty, oaky clove, roasted plum and black currant. A saucy, semi-oaked finish is solid enough.",85,Bodegas Aragonesas 2013 Dom Ramon Imperial Garnacha (Campo de Borja)
"A blend of mainly Syrah, with Grenache, Mourvèdre and Viognier. Opens with brilliant, beautiful aromas of berries and fruit, chocolate, violets, herbs and spices, and smoky oak. In the mouth, there's fabulous complexity and an opulent, velvety smooth texture. Very dry and elegant, and the sweet, spicy finish goes on forever.",94,Io 1997 Red (Santa Barbara County)
This Roero from the Canale area of Piedmont exhibits lactic notes of creamy spice and cinnamon yogurt over ripe berry and earthy tones. The mouthfeel is slightly bitter and sharp.,84,Marco Porello 2007 Torretta  (Roero)
"Though very pale in the glass, this wine holds no shortage of interest. Honey and roasted marcona almonds consume the nose, and the palate blends bright citrus, lemon curd and cinnamon, all propped up by a perfect, judicious use of oak.",95,Talley 2012 Oliver's Proprietor Grown Chardonnay (Edna Valley)
"The nose is jammy and candied smelling, but it finds its stride and delivers aromas of licorice, leather and concentrated berry after airing. Crisp and fresh in the mouth, this has clacky tannins leading to lightly herbal flavors of tomato, thyme and wild berry. It shows some warmth on the long, solid finish. Drink now–2015.",89,Santa Carolina 2009 Dry Farming Carignan (Cauquenes Valley)
"A good, dry Cabernet whose fruit flavors are balanced with rich tannins. Offers upfront flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries and cocoa. Good price, considering the elegance",87,Valley of the Moon 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"Spicy clove, pepper and a crunch of tannin characterize this full-bodied, 100% varietal wine that feels both leathery and herbal. Cassis and red currant notes add crispness and a wisp of fruit that grows darker and more chocolaty as it finishes.",92,Provenance Vineyards 2013 Barrel Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"Whiffs of nuts and smoke mingle into blackberry and bramble in this dry, slightly herbal wine. Light bodied, it has a refreshingly brisk, cutting mouthfeel that's pleasant.",86,The Old Field 2014 Blush de Noir Pinot Noir (North Fork of Long Island)
"Overtly herbal on the nose, green peppercorn, anise and tarragon mask aromas of underripe mixed berries. There's a decent weight to this wine—smooth and almost thick—yet the red-berry palate is overtaken by geranium and green-stem flavors.",85,Casanel 2013 Petit Verdot (Middleburg)
"This is a lovely wine to drink over the next 3–4 years, from one of Napa's masterful winemakers. It has the hallmarks of Napa Cabernet, being dry and tannic, with subtle oak influences on the blackberry and currant flavors. Give it an hour or two in the decanter before serving.",91,Crossbarn by Paul Hobbs 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This opens with lightly perfumed red-fruit aromas of raspberry and plum, with a bright palate that shows mostly red plum, raspberry and cherry flavors. This is a basic, clean wine comprised of 75% Garnacha and 25% Tempranillo.",85,Bodegas Aragonesas 2008 Castillo de Fuendejalon Crianza Red (Campo de Borja)
"This vineyard high up toward the Blue Mountains is best known for its Syrah. Aromas of garden herbs and cranberry lead to a tart, lightly grippy palate. It needs time to stretch its legs but the balance is there.",89,Burnt Bridge 2013 Les Collines Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Hints of honey lend warmth to zesty aromas of lemon, lime and tangerine on this dry, steely wine. The palate is delicate, with tart notes of yellow peach and quince, but textured with streaks of mineral. Honed lemon-lime acidity leads a long, bracing finish.",92,Baron Knyphausen 2011 Erbacher Michelmark Erste Lage Riesling (Rheingau)
"The latest Métier is 100% Viognier, all from Ciel du Cheval on Red Mountain. The lack of Roussanne in the blend takes away some subtle level of complexity, and this wine, though ripe and extracted and quite seductive, seems a bit one-dimensional. It's a really, really good dimension however, with lush peachy fruit and generous dollops of vanilla cracker and toast.",90,Doyenne 2007 Métier White White (Red Mountain)
"Early aromas of sea water, mushroom and rubber integrate into a more pleasant whole. The flavors are sweet and candied, while on the finish a mild vegetal hint comes on. That said, the wine is decent in the mouth, where the texture is pleasant.",82,Vino de Eyzaguirre 2001 San Francisco de Mostazal Reserva Especial Syrah (Colchagua Valley)
"Alluring scents of hay, white flower, stone fruit and citrus zest take center stage on this one. The refined palate is a bit more reserved when compared to the nose, offering grapefruit, white peach, nectarine and mineral buoyed by bright acidity. It finishes clean and crisp.",89,Conti Formentini 2014 Caligo Sauvignon (Collio)
"This rich wine shows sweet, luscious cherry, green herbs, medicine cabinet and leather aromas and flavors. It doesn't bring a lot of complexity but yields plenty of enjoyment. Drink now.",87,Revelry 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"For those wondering what minerality means in a red wine, this bottling is the answer. Against the black cherry and dark strawberry on the nose rise powerful crushed slate and smashed graphite aromas. The palate starts with cranberry and pomegranate, but the slate and rocky-soil flavors swing back in, giving backbone to the hints of bay leaf and herbs.",92,Bernardus 2015 Soberanes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"This lush wine leads with rich aromas of vanilla-infused blackberry, raspberry preserves and plum sauce. The medium-weight palate is plush and velvety in texture, with supple blackberry and plum flavors that carry through to the medium-length finish.",85,Kiwi Cuvée 2015 Bin 168 Malbec (Vin de France)
"Robust and fleshy, this is soft, easy and slightly sweet. It has pie-filling flavors of blackberries and peppery spices.",83,Rubberneck 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"This iconic Syrah is big and gripping in every sense: a dark, boysenberry and raspberry fruit-infused bouquet; a spicy, deeply flavored palate; a thick and chewy texture with superb strength. Luckily, there's enough acidity and supporting elements of earthy tobacco and wild animal to keep it balanced and lifted enough. Decant if drinking now, or hold for another couple of years.",91,Boekenhoutskloof 2008 Syrah (Coastal Region)
"Grapefruit, lemon and star anise aromas lead this refined but friendly wine. On the palate, lush, rounded flavors of melon and tropical fruit are supported by brisk acidity. Great combination with richer poultry or pork dishes.",89,Greek Wine Cellars 2015 Assyrtico (Santorini)
"A forest-like earthiness mingles with yeasty baked bread aromas in this soft, well-built Mourvèdre- and Petite Sirah-dominant field blend. Fig, black pepper and tar flavors show through a tightly knit foundation of powerful tannin and texture, seasoned with Asian spice.",93,Carlisle 2014 Two Acres Red (Russian River Valley)
"Plump black raspberry and blackberry notes mix with vanilla and baked licorice on the fruit-driven nose of this blend of 67% Cabernet Sauvignon and 33% Syrah. The tannic tension and strong acidity of the palate overwhelms the flavors at first, eventually revealing dark purple fruit and a vanilla-laced finish.",90,Cloak & Dagger 2013 The Assassin Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Paso Robles)
"Some superripe notes give this wine a raisin-skin bitterness, but there's no denying its immediate lushness. Softly tannic, it has fantastic flavors of black currants and sweet toasted oak. If you drink it now, give it a few hours in the decanter.",89,Alpha Omega 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"The Lurtons get their fruit for this wine from the Carcassonne region, the coolest part of the Languedoc. That explains the simple freshness of the red fruits, the acidity and the supple but dry tannins. Screwcap.",86,J. & F. Lurton 2006 Les Bateaux Merlot Merlot (Vin de Pays d'Oc)
Cedar and coconut aromas rest comfortably atop ripe black fruit scents. In the mouth this is juicy pure and well structured. Big chocolaty flavors of mixed black fruits show strong notes of charred wood and grilled meat on a toasty chocolaty finish. Drink through 2022.,92,Anier 2012 Vendimia Seleccionada  (Ribera del Duero)
"Wild berry, mature black plum and orange zest aromas lead the nose on this brawny wine. The palate delivers black cherry, mushroom, black pepper, tobacco and licorice alongside big but rounded tannins. It's not an ager so enjoy soon.",88,Sesti 2012  Rosso di Montalcino
"Longoria brings a deft touch to this Pinot Grigio. The grapes were briefly fermented in tank, then bottled when the wine was only about four months old. The result is exceptionally fresh and lively, with tangy acidity brightening citrus, lemongrass, vanilla and white pepper flavors.",91,Longoria 2012 Pinot Grigio (Santa Barbara County)
"This is fresh, light and very crisp. Citrus fruits dominate the grassy, herbaceous texture. There is perfumed white-currant acidity on the finish.",87,Michel Redde et Fils 2011 Petit Fumé  (Pouilly-Fumé)
"Here's a fresh and fruit-forward selection, brimming with bright aromas and flavors of white peach, clementine, yellow florals and a hint of fresh hay. Balanced and refreshing, the medium acidity provides good lift to the ripe fruit flavors on the palate and keeps the finish light and clean. Drink up.",88,Binyamina 2012 Reserve Unoaked Chardonnay (Judean Hills)
"This is a beautiful brut, easily worth its price. It shows the fancy elegance of more expensive bubblies, with its refined texture and rich but subtle flavors of strawberries, peaches and brioche. Made from Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, and easy to find, with 25,000 cases produced.",91,Scharffenberger NV Brut Sparkling (Mendocino County)
"Forest floor, leather, fennel and woodland berry aromas lead the nose. The vibrant palate delivers crunchy red cherry-berry, eucalyptus, sage and a balsamic note alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink 2017–2025.",94,Querce Bettina 2010  Brunello di Montalcino
"This dry Silvaner balances a crisp, lean fruit profile of white peach, lime and green apple, with a palate that's full, voluptuous and weighty. It's intensely minerally, with a slight mineral-oil slick, but finishes clean with brisk lemon and citrus pith notes.",88,Castell 2011 Trocken Silvaner (Franken)
"This is a top wine from the Borba cooperative. It has all the right richness and fruitiness followed by great concentration, solid texture and dark tannins. The finish shows acidity, with touches of tar and perfume.",90,Adega Cooperativa de Borba 2009 Premium Red (Alentejo)
"This wine is ripe, rounded with a smooth vanilla and spice texture that complements the yellow fruit and rich pear flavors. The wine is generous and likely to age quickly. Drink from 2019.",89,Domaine Pierre Guillemot 2015 Dessus des Golardes  (Savigny-lès-Beaune)
There is an attractive orange-zest tang to this rounded wine. It brings out ripe yellow fruits that have acidity to add to the mineral texture of this balanced wine. It is ready to drink.,86,L. Tramier & Fils 2015 Collection  (Saint-Véran)
"Perhaps the best of a stellar lineup from Trisaetum, this off-dry estate bottling is packed with grapefruit and pineapple flavors. They run tart and deep into the palate, full and focused, with the vineyard's signature minerality.",94,Trisaetum 2011 Ribbon Ridge Estate Riesling (Ribbon Ridge)
"Marked by immediately likeable fruit in the form of raspberries and cherries, this pleasant Pinot has a rich coating of sweet, smoky oak. It's the most accessible of Williams Selyem's new releases.",88,Williams Selyem 2009 Eastside Road Neighbors Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Brunello Poggio Banale is a soft, succulent expression of Sangiovese Grosso with sweet cherry and smooth vanilla aromas. The mouthfeel is plush, rich and creamy but there's a touch of balanced acidity that brings those lively fruit tones into crystalline focus.",94,La Poderina 2006 Poggio Banale  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"A light- to medium-bodied Sauvignon, the 2009 Discovery is more delicate than many of its counterparts, with hints of stuck flint, accenting stone fruit and citrus flavors. Turns chalky and crisp on the finish. Drink now.",87,Discovery 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (East Coast)
"Notes of honey and cinnamon combine with a slightly musky spice note to give this sweet auslese added interest. It's round in the mouth without being soft or flabby in the slightest, with lingering notes of baked apple on the finish.",89,Gräflich von Hohenthal'Scher 2007 Graacher Himmelreich Auslese Riesling (Mosel)
"A smooth and rich wine that is already delicious. It has ripe berry fruits, soft tannins and a full, juicy feel. A streak of acidity cuts through this generous wine. Drink now.",87,Wines & Winemakers 2012 Companhia das Lezírias Catapereiro Tinto Red (Tejo)
"The vineyard source is in the cooler part of the valley. The wine is nicely crisp, giving a refreshingly clean mouthfeel that balances the very rich, extracted pineapples, apricots, pears, green apples and peaches. Lots of new oak adds vanilla, butterscotch and sweet cream.",87,David Arthur 2007 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)

"Grapy berry and plum aromas set up a fresh tannic wiry palate. Popping plum and berry flavors are lively and toasty, while this Tannat, with its black pepper notes, tastes good and spicy on the finish. Drink through 2020.",89,Bouza 2014 Reserva Tannat (Uruguay)
"Riccardo Talenti, grandson of Pierluigi Talenti, the grand old man of Montalcino, currently makes one of the finest Brunellos with the help of consultant Carlo Ferrini. They are now using new wood for aging, and the extra layer of richness this brings is apparent in the comparative accessibility of this wine. Yet it is also huge, with classic tannins and intense, concentrated flavors of sweet blackberry jelly.",95,Talenti 1997  Brunello di Montalcino
"Dense and rich, this wine has concentrated flavors of botrytis and floral honey. The wine gives the impression of sweetness, with balancing acidity and a core of dryness. Weighty and dense, it's likely to age.",94,Château Coutet 2009  Barsac
"A 50-50 blend of Pinot Bianco and Chardonnay, this offers enormous intensity both in terms of its aromas and its natural structure. It shows soft, enduring tones of stone fruit, honey and exotic fruit, and there's a bright touch of acidity on the close that pulls the wine nicely together.",90,Niedermayr Josef 2009 Hof Zu Pramol White (Alto Adige)
"One of the properties owned by Jean-Michel Lapalu, the wine comes from the far north of the Haut-Médoc appellation. It is tight with firm tannins and a dry core that will need time to soften. The fruit is going to become more generous as the wine fills out. Drink from 2020.",88,Château Lieujean 2014  Haut-Médoc
"Not as intense as other Tolaini wines, this Sangiovese (with 15% Merlot) doles out measured portions of prune, plum, black cherry, leather, resin and tobacco. In the mouth, it has cherry flavors, dense tannins and a long finish.",88,Tolaini 2004 Al Passo Sangiovese (Toscana)
"This is very light, in both flavor and body. The aromas are earthy, with a faint suggestion of blackberries, and the mouthfeel is thin. These aren't terrible flaws, but the wine just lacks substance.",81,Château Maine-Gazin 1997  Bordeaux
"Flowery lime and vanilla cookie aromas are varietally on target. A fresh, citric, medium-bodied palate and flavors of tropical fruits and citrus finish with weight and acidity. Drink now.",87,Colomé 2014 Torrontés (Salta)
"This Pinot starts out tight, but after some time in the glass opens up to reveal black raspberry, mushroom, cola and exotic spice notes. It's dry, yet silky, in the mouth.

"Toast, berry and espresso aromas lead the nose and follow through to the palate along with sour cherry, bitter chocolate and a hint of licorice. Astringent tannins leave a firm finish.",88,Marchesi di Barolo 2011 Tradizione  (Barolo)
"This is a very young wine, still dominated by its wood aging. It is spicy, with layers of red-berry fruits under the strong wood flavors. Let this wine develop over the medium term and drink from 2020.",85,Quinta dos Avidagos 2015 Reserva Red (Douro)

Soft peach and vanilla flavors finish with spicy oak.",84,Lindemans 2001 Bin 65 Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia)

The wine offers complexity and unfolds nicely on the palate. A white that can handle rich dishes and can age.",85,Lakewood 2006 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"Powdery on the nose, with aromas of sweet pear and lime. The palate is round and melony, indicating a warmer origin. Tastes a lot like basic Pinot Grigio; peach and green melon are the lead flavors. Finishes solid but soft, with lasting sweetness.",85,Viña La Rosa 2010 La Palma Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Cachapoal Valley)

"This pure expression of Nero d'Avola has bittersweet aromas of almond and cherry that are set against notes of soda, cassis and wet earth. The wine is aged in stainless steel to maintain the purity of its aromas.",87,Tenuta di Fessina 2010 Ero Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"A youthful, fruity expression of Nebbiolo with roses, gardenia and candied orange dominating the nose while worn leather and mulch flavors back up cherry fruit in the mouth. This wine's strongest point is its long, rose-flavored finish. Best now through 2011.",88,Tenute Cisa Asinari dei Marchesi di Gresy 2007 Martinenga Nebbiolo (Langhe)
"There's a lusciousness to this Chardonnay that makes it really easy and fun to drink. It's rich in orange marmalade, honey, buttered popcorn and vanilla flavors, brightened with crisp acidity.",87,Mirassou 2011 Chardonnay (California)
"This bottling, which is bolstered by 9% Merlot, 4% Petit Verdot and 1% Malbec, shows zesty blackberry, boysenberry, thyme and cedar on the fruit-driven nose.

"New leather, red cherry and fresh herb aromas follow through to the firmly structured palate, along with cinnamon and white pepper notes. A young and racy wine, it already boasts finesse thanks to taut, refined tannins.",90,Cantina del Nebbiolo 2014  Barbaresco
"The second wine of Jorge Moreira's Poeira is rich and smooth, the bright berry fruits sinking into a cushiony texture. The acidity and smoky wood provide a counterpoint to its firm, youthful tannins.",90,Poeira 2008 Pó de Poeira Red (Douro)
"Wheaty, flat aromas are indicators that this is losing its luster. The palate is chunky, with melon, mango and canned peach flavors. Best to wait for a newer vintage.",83,Serra da Estrela 2012 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Violets, blackberries and espresso beans whirl together into a delicious, silky nose on this wine by Josh Baker and Matt Brain. It's similarly luxurious on the palate, soft and sensual with lots of boysenberry and olallieberry. It also shows a peppery licorice spice, boosted by focused acidity that enlivens every part of the tongue.",94,Baker & Brain 2012 Le Mistral Syrah (Monterey County)

"Herbal plum and leather aromas are tight and earthy. This is juicy, with green-leaning plum and rhubarb flavors that have a peppery note. The finish is minty.",84,El Circulo 2012  Rioja
"Valmur is considered to produce a generous style of Grand Cru, and this wine lives up to that. It's warm and rounded while never losing touch with the crisper side of a great Chablis. The ripe white and yellow fruits are on the rich side, cut with citrus acidity and underlined by wood aging. Drink from 2018.",93,Domaine Christian Moreau Père et Fils 2012 Valmur Grand Cru  (Chablis)
"Corte Lenguin's Amarone is less intense aromatically and laid-back in general with measured aromas of ripe fruit, resin, tar and mesquite. It offers more in the mouth however, in terms of density and taste, with a broad texture and bright cherry flavors.",87,Corte Lenguin 2004  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
This full-bodied Chardonnay from the Abruzzo region of central Italy offers sun-drenched tones of mature peach and exotic fruit. The wine is dense and naturally creamy and would stand up to butter- and cream-based pasta dishes.,85,Farnese 2007 Chardonnay (Terre di Chieti)
"The Gil family understands how to make fully loaded reds that are balanced and highly enjoyable. Look for a saturated, rich nose with brandied plum, blackberry pastry and toasty oak notes.

Drink now–2015.",92,Bodegas Ateca 2009 Atteca Armas Old Vines Garnacha (Calatayud)

Imported by Superior Wines and Specialty Cellars.",90,Ciabot Berton 2009 Roggeri  (Barolo)
"A tremendous Petite Sirah, among the finest from Paso Robles. It's a big wine, with massive flavors of blackberries, currants, leather, mocha and smoky oak, with an ultralong, spicy finish. Yet the wine is totally dry, with refined, silky tannins. Yes, the alcohol's high, but it's completely balanced. Best now and through the next decade.",93,Vina Robles 2007 Jardine Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)

It tastes like old vine fruit should—subtle, supple and balanced.",94,Ross Andrew 2009 Old Block Boushey Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))

Christopher 2012 Nuages Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)

"This Cab is drinking very dry, tannic and austere in its youth. It really needs time in the cellar to soften and throw some sediment, and allow the heart of black currants and dark chocolate to emerge. Should begin to show interest after 2013.",92,Maroon 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville)
"Reedy green-leaning aromas of plum and raspberry feed into a creamy palate. This tastes primarily of herbal red-berry fruits that finish oaky, dry and spicy.",85,Trapiche 2014 Oak Cask Malbec (Mendoza)
"Rustic and country-style, this Cab has juicy berry flavors wrapped into rough, green tannins. Turns sugary sweet on the finish.",81,Stephen Vincent 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Dusty mineral and saffron notes persist throughout this complex auslese. Preserved peach, lemon and dried apple tones are richly concentrated on the palate, but there's an unusually dark, steely elegance that persists through the finish.",91,Paul Anheuser 2012 Kreuznacher Krötenpful Auslese Riesling (Nahe)
"A slightly bitter tobacco note frames black-cherry fruit. The tannins need more time to smooth out, and that bitter streak is a bit worrisome. But that said, this powerful deep compact wine may explode with flavor if you have the patience to cellar it. Drink after 2020.",92,WillaKenzie Estate 2014 Triple Black Slopes Pinot Noir
"Made using classic Port grape varieties, this is rich and sweet, with chocolate, coffee, orange, plum and spice flavors. Crisp acidity provides needed balance. It shows a complexity that lifts it above the ordinary. Drink now–2015.",93,Williams Selyem 2006 Mistral Port (Central Coast)
"Fairly reduced, leaving gaseous aromas to struggle with earthy fruit. Talk about chunky ripe fruit and soft tannins: this has almost no detectable grip or grab, thus the structure is flabby and there's zero bite. Conversely, the flavors are deep and the richness is up there. Drink now.",86,Luca 2006 Malbec (Altos de Mendoza)
"This field blend is produced from old vines. It is rich and smooth with touches with spicy wood. The wood is showing strongly, perhaps not leaving enough room for fruit, however, that could improve as the wine ages more. Wait until 2017.",89,Casa da Passarella 2013 O Fugitivo Garrafeira Branco White (Dão)
"Although a flinty touch of reduction still hangs on the nose, freshness and verve await underneath. The palate is juicy, slight, dry and very refreshing. It offers a slender, lemony expression of Pinot Blanc with a clean-cut finish.",89,Strauss 2016 Classic Pinot Blanc (Steiermark)
"Pure Cabernet Sauvignon, this wines comes from the same region as Bordeaux. It has black currant flavors, balanced acidity and a touch of wood aging. Drink from 2018.",85,Terre de Vignerons 2016 Le Phare Cabernet Sauvignon Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlantique)
"The wine is ripe and smooth, with rich if still dry tannins. Its juicy black fruit and acidity are balanced with a structure that will allow it to age further. Drink from 2019.",88,Château Ducros 2015 Clos Bourbon  (Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux)
"Smoky clove and rose petal aromas underlie a delicately complex fruitiness in this wine, its cranberry and pomegranate flavors complemented by cardamon, dried herb and savory black tea. Light-bodied and fresh, it offers an indelible silkiness on the palate.",95,Williams Selyem 2014 Foss Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"At the age of nearly five years, this Cab still is immature. It's comprised of equal parts sweet, smoky oak, ripe black cherries, plums, cassis and rich, intricate tannins. Already throwing sediment, it needs at least another four years for optimal drinking.",90,William Knuttel 2006 Trio Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A ripe wine, full of red berry fruits contrasted with soft tannins. It is spicy from the wood aging, yet the fruit shines through strongly. It will be ready to drink from 2017.",87,Herdade do Esporão 2015 T Trincadeira (Alentejo)
"A delicious Pinot Noir to drink now with upscale fare. It's very fruity, offering a burst of raspberries and cherries, together with a coat of sweet, smoky oak. But crisp acidity and smooth, silky tannins provide a balanced structure.",90,J. Lohr 2009 Falcon's Perch Pinot Noir (Monterey County)
"A shock of ripe raspberry and grenadine marks the entry of this sexy wine, which is tingling in cinnamon spice and forested earth. Softly layered and smooth, it offers both structure and weight, and is approachable now.",91,Kastania 2012 Jaden and Keira's Cuvée Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This is MLG's entry-level Shiraz, but it's no slouch. Plum and blackberry fruit, hints of black olive and espresso, decent weight and dusty tannins provide plenty of bang for the buck. Drink now–2020.",90,Mount Langi Ghiran 2013 Billi Billi Shiraz (Victoria)
"A brawny, cherry flavored Zinfandel, big shouldered all around with dense, leathery spicy aromas and flavors, with hints of licorice and bittersweet chocolate. Estate bottled and grown in Napa's Chiles Valley.",86,RustRidge 2007 Estate Zinfandel (Chiles Valley)
"Woody, heady black-fruit aromas are charred and minty. The palate is dense and tannic, while charred, earthy black-fruit flavors show herbal after tones prior to a dry and woody finish. A bit of time in the cellar should help this integrate and fully come together; drink after 2018 and through 2022.",90,Alpasión 2013 Malbec (Mendoza)
"Not all that expressive on the nose; about all you get is basic yellow fruit and lettuce. The palate shows more intensity, but the flavors of lemon and tropical fruits are basic at best. Chunky, sweet and common on the finish. Good for Argentina but still it leaves you asking for more.",86,Trapiche 2009 Broquel Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"Aromas of coffee, chocolate and fresh herbs are followed by grainy dark fruit flavors. The tannins need some time to stretch their legs.",89,Purple Star 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a soft, simple, light and fruity wine. Its lively acidity is refreshing and crisp. It has a fragrant perfume and is ready to drink.",85,Saget la Perrière 2016 La Petite Perrière Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de France)
"Toasted oak, espresso, new leather and steeped plum aromas waft out of the glass. The bracing palate offers grilled herb, licorice, toast and dried berry flavors, framed by grainy tannins that grip the finish.",88,Gracciano della Seta 2012 Riserva  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano)
"A dark, chunky wine with cola, cassis and beet-like aromas. The palate is extracted but gritty, with big blackberry fruit that doesn't change or improve in the mouth. Deep as night but dull-edged; it flat-lines on the finish.",85,Oveja Negra 2008 Cabernet Franc-Carménère Red (Maule Valley)
"Light in color and body, this restrained, classically styled red is tart in fruit character and acidity, with a thickness of concentration that surprises. A hint of reductive oak meanders through.",87,Ampelos 2015 Ampelos Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Not showing well, with a heavy fullness of jammy berry-cherry fruit and strong tannins. Sweet oak sticks out like a sore thumb. Its future is hard to predict. Most wines that age gracefully start out impressive. This one just tastes overwrought. The score reflects crossed fingers for improvement.",87,Penché 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This firmly structured wine brings out the spiciness of Blaufränkisch, boosting its structure. Beck's entry-level wine is finely crafted, the tannins and ripe berry fruits balancing well with the freshly grated nutmeg and final sweetness. Screwcap.",87,Judith Beck 2007 Blaufränkisch (Burgenland)
"Aromas include oak extract, yellow flower, citrus zest and Mediterranean herb. The palate offers butterscotch and vanilla but not much fruit richness or freshness.",85,Signano 2011 La Ginestra Riserva  (Vernaccia di San Gimignano)
"It's labeled simply Columbia Valley but in fact it's made from all Red Mountain fruit. Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon dominant, with a splash of Petit Verdot, this is quite ripe and sweetly juicy—like a big bowl of blackberries. Aged in once-used French oak, it has picked up some char and graphite notes.",91,Gorman 2009 Zachary's Ladder Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a sweet, rich Port. Its aromas are of soft berry jelly, with a ripe herbal character. To taste, it is concentrated, but the sweetness of the fruit masks its density. Berry and dried fruits make an attractive blend, leaving a firmer structure in the aftertaste.",88,Quinta de la Rosa 2004 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port)
"A lush fruit bowl of a wine, this brings delicious flavors of melon, peach, apple and pear, along with a buttery finish. There are some pleasing spicy highlights, and a residual smack of butterscotch invites the next sip.",90,Tinhorn Creek 2013 Pinot Gris (Okanagan Valley)
"A blend of Arinto and Antão Vaz, this is refreshingly fruity. It has pineapple as well as citrus flavors, an attractive blend of freshness and crispness. The aftertaste is bright, full of lively acidity.",86,Magnum Vinhos 2014 Maria Mora Branco White (Alentejano)
"A bit disappointing from veteran winemaker Alan McCorkindale, or maybe this is just sliding past its prime. The modest grapefruit notes, herbal overtones and tart finish are fine, but fail to excite. Drink up.",85,Thatched Hut 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Pale in color, this is a fruity slightly herbal wine. It has plenty of young fruit and crisp acidity, lively and with an attractively spicy aftertaste. Drink now.",88,Château Coussin 2016 Rosé (Côtes de Provence Sainte-Victoire)
"Appealing black-fruit aromas include notes of tobacco and chocolate. This is a brooding, deep Tinto Fino with grippy tannins. Ripe berry, plum and cassis flavors are flush, while this wine finishes dark, with a reprise of young, rubbery tannins. Best from 2019–2030.",92,Dominio de Atauta 2015 Parada de Atauta  (Ribera del Duero)
"From a mix of Walla Walla and Willamette fruit (hence W3,), this limited-production wine is firmly rooted in a base of apples and acid. Grace notes of spice and butter (from barrel fermentation and aging in French oak) give it added body and length, and it glides into a finish of cinnamon toast and apple butter.",89,Citation 2008 Citation W3 Chardonnay (Oregon)
"Cheerful, fragrant and bright, this opens with aromas of lemon blossom, white almond and stone fruit. It shows tonic, firm bubbling.",85,Botter NV Spago  (Prosecco)
"Black fruit and taut structure are joined with black currant acidity and a core of the driest tannins. The wine has the cool 2007 feel to it, and is certainly ready to drink now.",88,Clos d'Yvigne 2007 Le Rouge et le Noir Red (Bergerac)
"Fresh and lively, this opens with vibrant scents of crisp green apple, white melon and lime. The palate offers riper flavors of pear, guava and nectarine, while brisk acidity keeps the mouthfeel bright and the finish mouthwatering. Drink now.",86,Jadix 2015  Picpoul de Pinet
"Soft, perfumed wine that has fresh red berry fruits, ripe tannins and a juicy fragrance. This is fruity and ready for drinking in the next 2–3 years. Screwcap.",86,Johanneshof Reinisch 2011 Pinot Noir (Thermenregion)
"Nuances of bramble and grain lend earthy complexity to this otherwise deeply fruity Riesling. Lemon-lime acidity pierces the midpalate, cutting through layers of ripe yellow-cherry and even berry flavors. The finish is lip smackingly sweet. Drink now.",90,S.A. Prüm 2012 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Kabinett Grosse Lage Riesling (Mosel)
"From its youth, this is obviously an ageworthy wine. The tannins, firm black-fruit flavors and intense acidity all point to this wine's longevity. It shows great balance, with its fruit melding into its dry structure. A beautifully polished wine.",91,Niepoort 2009 Vertente Red (Douro)
"If you must open this now, let it breath for a while because it’s dumb, as they say, on opening. Airing and swirling reveal more earthy things than fruit. There’s a hint of truffles, of bark, and you almost have to close your eyes to imagine the blackberries and cherries buried deep down inside, but they’re there. You can taste them in the midpalate, and the finish lasts for a long time. Cellar this beauty and drink the regular Mondavi Pinot now and for the next five years.",93,Robert Mondavi 1998 Reserve Pinot Noir (Napa Valley)
"There is an almost tropical touch to the apple and lemon fruit: this is almost like vanilla-spiced apple tart with lemon zest. Very appetizing with that unusual vanilla-edge and more of that tropical lychee. Overall, this is balanced and very fruit-driven.",89,Domaine Moltès 2014 Steinert Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"Pear, arugula, white pepper and apricots take turns in dazzling nose and palate. A serious, concentrated and mineral vein of power also courses through this sleek wine, which holds even more future promise.",94,Allram 2012 Gaisberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"It's a pleasure to find a sipping wine that gracefully displays a mix of honeysuckle blossoms, light apple, pear and peach, and a gentle wrap of firming acids. Elegant right through the finish.",88,Tildio 2007 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Light brown and slightly translucent in color. Aromas lean toward raisin and prune, but there's orange zest and molasses on the bouquet as well. Bores straight ahead on the palate, with sweet flavors of burnt brown sugar, caramel and prune. Satisfying and balanced even if it's not overly complex.",90,Alvear 2008 de Añada Pedro Ximénez (Montilla-Moriles)
"The Sylvaner's essential spice and pepper quality is well brought out in this stylish wine. The pear and quince flavors come through strongly, finishing with acidity.",87,Kuentz-Bas 2009 Trois Châteaux Sylvaner (Alsace)
"This wine offers attractive layers of green apple built around a lush palate of pear and tropical pineapple. Its richness is met by complementary structure, balance and a subdued construct of oak that supports without distraction.",90,Hess 2015 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Smooth, svelte and utterly delicious, this glossy, seamless Petit Verdot is packed with bright flavors of berry, cherry and plum. The management of the fruit is perfect, and the barrel aging adds proportionate streaks of espresso and mocha. The finish is long and creamy.",93,Rasa 2009 Living in the Limelight Petit Verdot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"From the celebrated Ravera cru, Elvio Cogno delivers a classic and elegant expression of Nebbiolo with tight tannins, long aging potential and nuanced aromas of small berry fruit, cola, leather, licorice and smoky cedar tones. Save this wine in your cellar 10 years or more.",93,Elvio Cogno 2007 Ravera  (Barolo)
"Lees notes take the lead on this unusual wine, followed by aromas of apricot, almond butter and cream. It drinks a hair off dry with a lightly creamy feel.",87,Rasa 2013 The Composer Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Campo Leòn has herbal or green aromas that are unusual in Amarone. Those leafy elements are backed by ripe fruit, spice and toasted almond. It's round and full on the close with lingering berry flavors.",88,Latium di Morini 2003 Campo Leòn  (Amarone della Valpolicella)
"There's an unparalleled woody intensity on the nose of this offering, with cigar box, myrrh, incense and bay leaf decorating the black peppercorn, herb-laced salt, dark chocolate and black plum aromas. The palate's leathery flavors are woven into fine-grained tannins, revealing flashes of elderberry, violet and gravel. Drink 2019–2033.",95,Mount Eden Vineyards 2013 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Friendly and animating notes of ripe Amalfi lemon, ripe pear and fresh greenery come together in this immensely appetizing white. Focused citric softness makes this a serious pleasure to drink. The peppery aftertaste lingers dangerously long.",91,Steininger 2013 Loisiumweingarten Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"The nose on this Garnacha Blanca is funky and blends aromas of cured ham and salami with lees and citrus. The palate feels right, with solid acidity. Flavors of tangerine, gooseberry and nectarine end pulpy and citric, with a touch of green herbs.",87,Zerran 2012 Garnatxa Blanca Garnacha Blanca (Montsant)
This herbal wine has grassy plum aromas and a touch of cowhide on the nose. Aggressive tannins and sharp acidity run alongside leafy plum and raspberry flavors. Chocolaty oak with vanilla sweetness helps things along.,84,Cielo y Tierra 2009 Celador Malbec (Mendoza)
"Made from the Moreto grape, this light and fruity wine is a perfect summer rosé. It is crisp with red currant and raspberry fruits, with a delicious layer of acidity. Drink now.",88,Luis Duarte 2016 Rapariga da Quinta Colheita Seleccionada Rosé (Alentejano)
"With grapes coming from southern Burgundy, this is a ripe, full wine. Its fruits are right up front along with almond and light toast flavors. Pineapple and peach fruits show the warmth of this rich wine. Drink now.",87,Vincent 2015  Bourgogne
"From six vineyards across the Central Coast, Josh Jensen's annual cuvée shows black cherry, cola and nutmeg on the straight-ahead nose. Solid herbal backbone shows on the sip, with juniper, bay leaf and pine needles giving tang to the sour cranberry fruit. A menthol character carries in to the finish.",91,Calera 2015 Fortieth Anniversary Vintage Pinot Noir (Central Coast)
"The latest releases from Clos Triguedina aim to create wines for early drinking. Elegant is soft, juicy and fruity—perhaps so soft, it has lost any sense of Malbec character. Even so, it is a gentle red wine that is ready to drink.",84,Jean-Luc Baldès 2012 Elegant Malbec (Cahors)
"Another delicious Mourvèdre from Fenestra's estate that's invitingly earthy, spilling over with dark plum and sweet blackberry aromas and a taste of spicy cardamom. Very bright and light in taste, the wine's body has enough heft to pair with big-boned meals and a lot of spiciness. Drink now.",89,Fenestra 2008 Estate Mourvèdre (Livermore Valley)
"A pleasant sipper with some real depth and varietal character. The plummy, blackberry flavors have a nice streak of mocha and dried herbs, and are wrapped in fine, easy tannins. Feels good and clean through the spicy finish.",86,Kendall-Jackson 2000 Vintner's Reserve Merlot (California)
"Made with 57% Syrah and 43% Petit Sirah, this aromatic brooder offers aromas of cherry, dried herbs, baking spices and freshly tilled soil. The flavors are full bodied, rich, layered and tightly coiled, needing extended time in the cellar or a day-long decant to show their best. Drink after 2021.",92,Corvus 2011 Syrah-Petite Sirah (Red Mountain)
Intense aromas of ripe apricot and exotic fruit lead to a creamy palate bursting with yellow stone fruit and candied lemon drop. A note of bitter almond lends depth to the finish.,89,Corte Mainente 2015 Tovo Al Pigno  (Soave Classico)
"Seamless and soft, this medium-built expression of clove, tobacco and dark red plum offers integrated tannins and a punch of oak, before settling into a whispered finish.",88,Clos Pegase 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Named after an Arabic battle cry and now an expression that's shouted at wine festivals, the wine is lightly wood aged, ripe although with a stalky edge. It's easy and ready to drink.",84,Quinta do Conde 2016 Algazarra Red (Lisboa)
"Harkens back to the value days of the Diamond Label—but the style has been updated to reflect more freshness and focus. Pineapple and melon notes display cool, citrusy overtones, picking up just a hint of caramel on the finish. Drink now.",86,Rosemount 2011 Diamond Label Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia)
The wine is both dense and fruity. It has fine tannins that are dark and concentrated. The berry flavors are balanced with acidity and touches of wood-aging spice. Give it until 2018 and consider opening for an hour before tasting.,88,Château Berthenon 2014  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux
"For a wine made from young-vine fruit, this is reasonably concentrated and structured. Ample tannins support black-cherry and mocha flavors, then finish long and dusty in texture.",89,Clos Henri 2015 Petit Clos Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
"Very young, the wine gives out pure fruitiness, very fresh and lively. Good juiciness offers a riper view of this already very drinkable wine. Drink from 2015.",85,Fiuza 2013 Native Touriga Nacional-Cabernet Sauvignon (Tejo)
"Baked cherry and cranberry fruit kick off the nose of this bottling, followed by then wild thyme and touches of dust and smoke. The palate is light and zesty, with hibiscus and tea flavors along with cranberry fruit and more fresh herbs on the finish.",90,Two Sisters 2014 Lindsay's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Penetrating notes of melon, stone fruit and white florals set apart this lavish Riesling from Anthony Road. Semisweet in style with honeyed fruit flavors, it's balanced by bracing lime acidity and crushed-stone minerality that extends the finish.",91,Anthony Road 2009 Martini Reinhardt Selection Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Initially closed, this releases subdued aromas suggesting toasted nut, menthol, wild berry and blue flower after a hearty swirl. The palate is equally shy, offering red cherry and white pepper hints, with racy acidity and taut tannins that lend a firm finish. Give it a few more years to unwind, and drink after 2020.",88,Fontanafredda 2014 Coste Rubin  (Barbaresco)
"Produced with grapes from Aube vineyards in southern Champagne, this wine is dominated by Pinot Noir. It is full in the mouth, ripe and with a rich texture that gives fruitiness as well as a more mineral, tangy texture. This well-balanced wine is ready to drink.",88,Montaubret NV Brut  (Champagne)
"Bramble and dusty mineral tones lend a savoriness to this zesty lime-tinged wine. It's still tightly wound, showing more earth than fruit, but it's a fresh citrusy wine with vitality. The finish is just a shade off dry.",87,Lamoreaux Landing 2016 Yellow Dog Vineyard Estate Bottled Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Blossom honey, a touch of melon and fresh, fragrant red-apple fruit make for an appetizing nose. On the palate these alluring flavors are joined by the generous, rounded notion of sponge cake. Towards the finish the pure freshness of bright lemon takes over, and fine bubbles offer fruit and creaminess. It's a balanced and appetizing rosé with a lasting, beautifully yeasty finish.",92,Hush Heath Estate 2013 Balfour Brut Rosé Sparkling (England)
"Showing classic Santa Lucia highlights of enormously ripe cherries, Asian spices and acidity, this wine flatters the palate with the sheer force of its fruit and new oak. It's a young, fresh, vibrant wine that's at its best now.",90,Bernardus 2005 Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Despite being a bit rough on the nose, this Tempranillo-Garnacha blend offers solid berry, plum and cherry aromas. A bright juicy palate delivers plum, currant and raspberry flavors along with a touch of dry spice. For everyday red, one shouldn't complain about this.",86,Finca Manzanos 2014 Joven  (Rioja)
"White pepper and vanilla bean aromas give this richly textured, concentrated and subtly fruity wine a spicy start. It has a bright yellow-gold color and has gained complexity through extended aging before release. Savory consomée and dried herb characteristics accent its substantial core of apple butter flavor.",92,Skinner 2014 Seven Generations White (El Dorado)
"Perfumed and off dry, this rich wine has spice, structure and a floral character. It is so young with its white fruits, hint of lychee and lime-juice acidity. The wine needs to age to reveal its potential. Drink from 2018.",91,Domaine Rieflé-Landmann 2012 Seppi Landmann Zinnkoeplé Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"Black licorice, cola and cherry liqueur open the nose and segue to black currant and crème de cassis aromas, then forest floor, bramble and Spanish cedar. This wine is linear, crisp and tight on the palate, with firm tannins. Give the wine five more years to soften.",91,Tenute Silvio Nardi 2007  Brunello di Montalcino
"Gigantic, huge. Just erupts with the most intense cassis, chocolate and smoky new oak. Classic Howell Mountain structure, with dense, sweet young tannins and firm acidity. So immature, it's sappy and jammy now, and is sorely in need of cellaring. Don't touch before 2011, and should provide enjoyment for many years after.",94,Beringer 2005 Bancroft Ranch Vineyard Merlot (Howell Mountain)
"Represents a big improvement over last year's Califa; this one returns to dryness thanks to the cool vintage. Edna Valley acidity brightens cherry, root beer, vanilla bean and oak flavors. Dry and complex now, the wine should peak in a year or so, then hold through 2010.",88,Domaine Alfred 2005 Califa Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)
"Earthy game, truffle, underbrush, used leather and dark-skinned fruit aromas lead the nose. They carry over to the taut, tightly wound palate, where austere, dusty tannins leave a drying finish.",88,Belpoggio 2012  Brunello di Montalcino
"There's no doubt this is 100-percent Petite Sirah, full of dark plummy fruit and an earthy element that's close to mushrooms and dirt. Aged over two years in French oak the wine even has a slight hint of game and caramel. The tannins are soft but ample.",86,McCay Cellars 2008 Petite Sirah (Lodi)
"Sharp and green, with a minty, chlorophyll taste. High acidity makes the finish searing.",82,Norman 2006 Reserve Chardonnay (Edna Valley)
"A very ripe, rather high alcohol blend of Syrah, Petite Sirah and Grenache that's superrich in fruit, but lacks some elegance and finesse. Flatters the palate with flavors of blackberry and cherry pie filling, cassis, chocolate, anise and pepper. Probably not an ager, so drink with a nice grilled pork chop.",87,Paul Dolan 2006 Deep Red Red (Mendocino)
"Cola, beef jerky, roasted meats and dried purple berries hit initially the nose, follow by aromatic woods and black pepper. The flavors are distinctly interesting, with sandalwood, stewed plums, peppered chocolate, soy-braised beef and a tiny bit of reductive tar.",93,Mattina Fiore 2011 Murmur Vineyard Syrah (Santa Maria Valley)
"This is a very good price for a Zinfandel this fine. It's fairly delicate in mouthfeel for a Zin, with a light silkiness, and the tannin-acid architecture is elegant. As for the actual flavors, they're intense in red fruits, currants, sweet licorice and pepper. Hard to imagine a better wine for drinking over the next few years with barbecue.",90,Balletto 2009 Estate Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"This wine, made as the second label under the very reliable Talley Vineyards, is a solid purchase, offering black currant and herb-crusted roast pork aromas on the savory nose. It's juicy while smoky once sipped, with nice herbal touches that last deep into the finish. Drink now.",88,Bishop's Peak 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"A heavyweight, dominated by candy and toffee aromas. Its lack of acidity is redeemed by the concentration of the fruit and by the intensity of the wood and spice, which make a firm background.",84,Saxenburg Estate 2000 Private Collection Chardonnay (Stellenbosch)
"This Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend, with 25% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc, is complex and intriguing. It boasts a full profile of ripe fruit tones, expressed in layers of baked cherry, plum and rhubarb cake that are accented by notes of cured bacon, leather and pressed purple flowers. The palate is surprisingly smooth and silky, thanks to resolved, approachable tannins and a lingering sweet-smoke hit on the finish.",90,L'Avenir 2014 Classic Red (Stellenbosch)
"The descriptor Deep Red perfectly captures the essence of this blend of Petite Sirah, Zinfandel, Syrah and Grenache. It's rich and full-bodied, with expressive, complex red wine flavors of red and black currants, spiced red plums, crushed pepper and hints of dark chocolate and anise. The tannic structure is wonderfully soft and intricate. Drink this beautiful wine now and for the next several years.",92,Paul Dolan 2005 Deep Red Red (Mendocino)
"Lots of fresh, zingy acidity in this dry, young Chardonnay, and the steely minerality gives it a tang of cold metal. There are tantalizing hints of ripe citrus fruit and apricots. Give it 4–5 years in the cellar to come around.",92,Hanzell 2008 Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley)
"This large-production Zin has lots to like, beginning with the smooth, dry tannins and continuing through the classic flavors of black currants, briary forest berries and exotic spices. It contains some Petite Sirah, which gives it added body and depth. Drink now with barbecue, beef tacos and pepperoni pizza.",88,Seghesio 2011 Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
"From 40-plus-year-old vines planted on old rootstock, this wine is tangy in pomegranate, rhubarb and kirsch, but marked most by an irresistible depth of earthy truffle and black tea. Fine, dusty tannins add to the complexity of the mouthfeel and finish, with a hint of cinnamon at the end.",93,Lynmar 2013 Quail Hill Vineyard Old Vines Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Crisply fruity, this light, bright wine is designed for immediate drinking with its acidity, lemon fruits and lightly herbaceous touch.",85,Herdade da Comporta 2013 Comporta White (Península de Setúbal)
"Aromatically intense, with notes of dried peach, orange cream and vanilla, this blend of Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer and Malvasia aims to push the envelope with its rich, almost-fluffy texture, and its penetrating red-berry, stone-fruit and citrus flavors. The grapes were crushed by foot, and skin contact was employed during fermentation. This is a decadent, unusual, oak-aged orange wine.",90,Channing Daughters 2009 Envelope White (Long Island)
"Ripe berry fruit and gritty oak aromas lead to a full-bodied blocky palate with grating tannins. This is a heavily oaked blend of Syrah, Tempranillo and Merlot. Flavors of blackberry, vanilla and wood spice finish with barrel char and depth. Drink through 2023.",90,Venta del Puerto 2013 No. 12 Selección Especial Red (Valencia)
"A blend of predominantly Merlot and Syrah, this wine offers aromas of raspberries, herbs, plum and vanilla. The flavors are sweet, plump and juicy, delivering a lot of bang for the buck.",88,14 Hands 2013 Hot to Trot Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Made from 100% Cab, this wine pours inky black, and feels softly ripe in the mouth, with pie-filling blackberries, cherries, mocha, plums, tobacco and sweet dusty spices. Shows a tannic astringency that strongly suggests cellaring, although it's flashy now. Best after 2011 and beyond.",94,Whitehall Lane 2005 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This is very dense, with concentrated, dusty tannins and powerful blackberry flavors. It is rich and full of blackberry fruits along with acidity and a beautiful perfumed aftertaste. Drink from 2027.",94,Quinta dos Murças 2015 Vintage  (Port)
"This is a fresh, open and very accessible wine. Crisp acidity cuts through the green apple flavors and tangy, mineral texture. With juicy fruitiness, it is a light wine that is ready to drink.",87,Domaine Gérard Duplessis 2014  Chablis
"Youthful and bright, Oltremé gives a new perspective to the Susumaniello grape. This demonstrates an informal style, which emphasizes the integrity of the fresh fruit flavors—cherry, blackberry and plum—which are surrounded by a soft, velvety texture.",88,Tenute Rubino 2011 Oltremé Susumaniello (Salento)
"Bright berry fruit is reinforced by oak-driven aromas of spice, vanilla and tobacco. Give this wine a year or two to integrate. The smoothness and thickness of its texture promise to pair with either meatloaf or pasta with ragù sauce.",89,Tenuta La Tenaglia 2007 1930 Una Buona Annata  (Barbera del Monferrato Superiore)
"Made with the indigenous Negroamaro grape found in southern Italy, this bright rosato shows sweet aromas of pink rose, grapefruit and crushed mineral, followed by a linear texture and fresh forest-berry endnotes.",86,Tenute Mater Domini 2011 Marangi Negroamaro (Salento)
"Nicely balanced for dinner time, this dry wine is not too fat and not too lean, but just right. It has raspberry aromas, fresh berry flavors and a touch of fine tannin to add grip to the texture.",88,Big Smooth 2014 Zinfandel (Lodi)
"On the south side of the village of Chablis, the Vaillons vineyard is on the cool, left bank of the river Serein. It is fruity with a creamy texture and a line of steely acidity that often marks out the premier crus, giving this wine the chance to age. Drink from 2017.",91,Domaine Louis Moreau 2014 Les Vaillons Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"Rustic, farmyard aromas follow through to a wine that has let the Baga tannins dominate. It is tough, chewy, offering few concessions to fruit.",83,Quinta de Baixo 2008 Colheita Red (Bairrada)
"Light bodied and nicely dry, this is a lean and refreshing wine that tastes like crisp apples and raspberries, has great balance and a clean tangy finish. It's very bright and appealing.",87,Kokomo 2016 Grenache Rosé (North Coast)
"A beautiful Gewürz that could get more people to drink this Alsatian variety. It's dry and crisp, with rich flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, honeysuckle flowers, lychee nuts, vanilla and Asian spices.",90,Dutton-Goldfield 2008 Dutton Ranch-Green Valley Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Green Valley)
"Made with 85% Sangiovese and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of black-skinned berry, underbrush and bell pepper. The straightforward palate shows black plum, tobacco and baking spice alongside round tannins. Drink soon.",87,Trerè 2015 Sperone Red (Romagna)
A light and somewhat racy Pinotage with good vibrancy to the strawberry and ripe pomegranate seed notes throughout. A kiss of vanilla on the close adds a touch of decadence to this otherwise straightforward wine.,85,Simonsig 2008 Pinotage (Stellenbosch)
"Given the great potential of the 2015 vintage, it's reassuring to see that some big brands have scored successes like this. Explosive aromas of lime, tangerine and pink grapefruit burst from the glass, followed by ample citrus flavors. There's a hint of herbaceousness that grounds it in Marlborough, along with a long, passion fruit finish.",89,Brancott 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Full bodied and rich with white- and yellow-fruits, this structured wine is still very fresh and fruity. There's a density of texture and concentrated flavors deep in the core of the wine that gives the palate weight and depth. Drink through 2022.",94,Henriet-Bazin 2007 Millésime Carte Or Brut Premier Cru  (Champagne)
"Bright, clean and linear with pretty accents of spice, blackberry, leather and lingering tobacco, Villa al Cortile Riserva is the kind of wine you'll want to pair with a hearty meat dinner. The wine shows velvety, soft texture in the mouth.",91,Piccini 2005 Villa al Cortile Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Peach and apricot aromas are a touch grassy, as if some alfalfa or sweet grass were blended into the Moscatel. The palate is juicy and quite high in acidity, while it tastes of tangerine and other citrus fruits. Sharp on one hand but fresh and flavorful on the other.",90,Jorge Ordóñez & Co. 2007 Old Vines No. 3 Moscatel (Málaga)
"The Rock Star Red is a 50/50 Cabernet/Syrah blend. The two grapes work well together in many wines, but here they seem a bit at odds. The Cabernet carries some green, herbal, pickle barrel flavors; the Syrah brings in pepper and spice, but neither has the ripeness to flesh out the wine sufficiently. There are flavors of plum and cooked cherry, then it hits some chewy tannins and stops short.",85,Cathedral Ridge 2007 Rock Star Red Red (Columbia Valley (OR))
"Leesy, bready aromas are ripe and fruity. This is soft in feel and a touch heavy, which may be a reflection of the warm 2009 vintage. Nectarine and other ripe flavors finish full and sweet. This almost tastes like a brut Cava despite being a brut nature.",89,Juvé y Camps 2009 Brut Nature Gran Reserva Reserva de la Familia Sparkling (Cava)
"Subdued notes of clove and pepper mixed with tart cranberry make this an appetizing, fresh-faced red. The body is light but packs lots of flavor. What you see is what you get—in the most charming way possible.",89,Höpler 2011 Pinot Noir (Burgenland)
"Domäne is the everyday range of wines from Schloss Gobelsburg. This 100% Zweigelt is in a fresh, fruity style, emphasizing red berry fruits and light tannins. The acidity gives a crispness to the wine, which balances the intensity of fruit flavors.",86,Schloss Gobelsburg 2006 Domäne Gobelsburg Zweigelt (Kamptal)
"The aromas are smoky, toasted, and spicy, while the flavors blend sensations of bright notes cranberry alongside baking spices, light herbs and grilled beef. It's an excellent, chunky, beefy wine, with full body, ample tannins and a nicely astringent mouthfeel.",90,Noble Vines 2013 337 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi)
"Sweet with raspberry jam, cherry liqueur and vanilla cream flavors, this is a good dessert wine. But it could be a lot better if it were more intense. The finish trails off a little.",86,Clos Solène 2010 Sweet Clémentine Grenache (Paso Robles)
"Here's a pretty and bright Pinot Grigio with sensations of green apple and pear. This is simple but well made, and while it makes a refreshing apéritif, it will also pair nicely with pasta al pomodoro or lightly seasoned fish dishes.",85,Canaletto 2012 Pinot Grigio (Venezie)
"Crushed slate minerality drives the nose of this bottling, with boysenberry and dried beef touches. That meaty character carries into the palate as well, rich with iron and a tad bitter, accenting dried blueberry, thyme and oregano flavors.",87,Sarzotti 2014 Cabernet Franc (Paso Robles)
"A floral nose of violets offers an intriguing start to a wine that's both a value and a fun find. On the palate, red wild berry, spice and smoke are balanced, and though this has a rusticity that tells of its terroir, overall, it's simply pretty. Imported by Cape Wine Ventures, LLC.",85,Tall Horse 2005 Shiraz (Western Cape)
"This ripe wine comes from organic vineyards in the village of Brochon, next to Gevrey-Chambertin. It shows plenty of structure, a tantalizing smoky character from wood aging and juicy red fruit character. This will be a delicious wine to drink from 2018.",90,David Duband 2014  Côte de Nuits-Villages
"The perfume of the Moscatel grape shines through this wine that also has Fernão Pires and Alvarinho in the blend. Ripe and fruity, full of apple and melon flavors, the wine is lightly textured and ready to drink.",85,Quinta do Casal Branco 2016 Lobo e Falcão Branco White (Tejo)
"Genuine, clean and simple, this bright Rosso di Montalcino offers aromas of cedar wood and cherry cola over loads of wild berry fruit. There's a raw, simple quality to the wine and fresh fruit abounds.",86,Ciacci Piccolomini d'Aragona 2008  Rosso di Montalcino
"Honeycrisp apples come to mind at first sip, along with dollops of peach, lemongrass and caramel. The mouthfeel is fresh and flavorful, with excellent texture and length.",90,Buty 2012 62% Sémillon-21% Sauvignon-17% Muscadelle White (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Roughout is a fun wine, with a burst of sweet cherry fruit opening into a wild side that veers toward bramble and forest flavors. It's not a big red, but highly gulp-able and perfect for a burger night.",87,Cadaretta 2010 Roughout Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Candied berry fruits are earthy but come with a note of sweet plastic. This feels grabby and firm, with palpable acidity. Salty plum and berry flavors finish warm and long due to lively acidity.",86,Borsao 2015 Monte Oton Garnacha (Campo de Borja)
"Pungent grassy aromas vie with passion fruit on the nose, while the flavors lean more toward the tropical fruit side of things. This is a medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc that plays it safe, offering a comfortable drink at a reasonable price.",86,Seven Terraces 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"The wine is rounded and fat with an oily texture. Its ripe apple and rich pear flavors only allow a small place for the acidity and crisp texture. It comes across as full bodied, rich and easy to drink now.",85,Quinta da Ribeirinha 2016 Vale de Lobos Fernão Pires (Tejo)
"Citrusy aromas revolve around pink grapefruit and rose blossom. In the mouth, this is a bit flat for such a young rosé, with pithy and bitter flavors and notes of red plum and red-apple skins.",84,El Coto 2012 Rosado (Rioja)
"This brut-style bubbly is comprised of 67% Pinot Noir and 33% Chardonnay and shows aspects of both varieties. It's fairly full bodied, with raspberry, strawberry, lime, brioche, vanilla and toast flavors. Feels elegant, complex and lush in the mouth, and should develop additional bottle notes over the next six years.",90,Gloria Ferrer 2005 Royal Cuvée Sparkling (Carneros)
"One of Portugal's priciest table wines, this vintage boasts cherry and plum aromas that just don't seem all that intense, followed by bright cherry flavors accented by modest cedar. The long finish is evidence of its quality, but it turns astringent and one wonders whether the fruit will outlast the tannins.",87,Quinta do Fojo 2000 Fojo Red (Douro)
"Tar, tobacco and smoke can't mask the green tomato leaf characteristics on this ruby red Sangiovese. There are some interesting spice notes, but not a lot of ripeness or concentration in the fruit.",81,Ventosa 2007 Sangiovese (Finger Lakes)
"This wine is blessed with velvety texture and bombastic ripeness, which leaves its plum and cherry fruit feeling baked and prune-like. The brawny fruit profile is accented with leather, tobacco and black pepper, finishing with a touch of heat.",87,Mira 2013 Hyde Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley)
"This is quite crisp and clean, with fairly typical flavors for Washington Pinot Gris. Which is to say, not nearly as fleshy as the wines from Oregon, with less of the juicy pear character. There's plenty of acid, more like green apple than ripe pear. It's a soundly made wine, clean and fresh, but less varietally distinctive than one would hope for.",85,Mercer 2007 Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Rich and soft, this Castelão-based rosé seems to miss out on freshness and acidity. Instead, it is broad, full in the mouth and heavy. It could work with food.",82,Wines & Winemakers 2013 Pegos Claros Rosé (Palmela)
"Usually one of Yarra's top Pinots, the 2006 YS Reserve is a medium-bodied, rounded wine with extremely soft tannic structure. The aromas hint at brown sugar, coffee and cola, with flavors of roasted root vegetables and a touch of mushroom. Supple and silky on the finish. Drink now.",88,Yering Station 2006 Reserve Pinot Noir (Yarra Valley)
"Let this Syrah open, but once it does, it is full of raspberry, black pepper, oak and gamy goodness, medium-bodied, elegant and nicely in balance.",88,Sierra Vista 2008 Red Rock Ridge Syrah (El Dorado)
"One of the more interesting Grenaches out there, among a field that has struggled in California. It's dry and crisp in acidity, with a light, silky texture. The flavors veer toward ripe red cherries, red currants and baking spices, with notes of bacon and sandalwood. Drink now.",89,Transcendence 2011 Harrison Clarke Vineyard Grenache (Santa Ynez Valley)
"A full, earthy, warm wine that has a strong herbal character as well as rich caramel and red fruits. It has a rare density for a rosé, textured and ripe. Try aging this wine for a  few months.",90,Domaine les Fouques 2012 Cuvée de l'Aubigue Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Aromas that recall stewed prune, cherry steeped in spirits, baking spice, toast and a whiff of menthol lead the nose and carry through to the firm palate along with notes of coffee, grilled sage and clove. Bracing tannins provide the framework. Give this a few more years to unwind then drink up. Best after 2020.",89,Germano Angelo 2011 Vigna Ruè  (Barolo)
Complexing notes of botrytis are interspersed with an unusual pine aroma. The palate is bit simple but gives way to a very long finish with focused flavors of petrol and lemon.,89,Gustave Lorentz 2004 Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"Winemaker: Morné Vrey. A new addition to the CWG lineup, this selection shows great balance and magnificent control over ripeness and freshness. Aromas and flavors of honeydew, clementine and pineapple are balanced by ample acidity to cut through the concentration and add verve through the finish. Hints of citrus pith and lightly toasted oak add complexity through the close. Drink 2020–2025.",93,Delaire Graff 2016 Cape Winemakers Guild Banghoek Chardonnay (Stellenbosch)
"Trapiche has never bottled much Sauvignon Blanc, but this one is true to its name: Pure. Easy citrus aromas are mild and clean. This feels medium in body, with a touch of weight. Orange and other dry citrus flavors are steady across the finish.",86,Trapiche 2016 Pure Sauvignon Blanc (Uco Valley)
"Just a tad honeyed, but crisp acidity helps to provide balance. The apricot, tangerine, lime and vanilla flavors are easy to like.",85,Noble Vines 2012 Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey)
"Grapefruit peel and tart lemon combine for a memorably savory beginning to this crisp wine. This one integrates its acidity with a medium weight into a clean, dry and lengthy package of flavor and bite.",90,Luna 2016 Minuet Sangiovese Rosé (Napa Valley)
"A blend of half-and-half Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a solid wine. The tannins are still quite dominant although they are ripe and will integrate well into the red and black berry fruits. Acidity at the end keeps the wine fresh and fruity. Drink from 2017.",88,Château Tour Haut-Caussan 2012  Médoc
"Soft apple- and honey-flavored wine that has dry botrytis and a spiced texture. With flavors of lemon curd and peach, it is more in a light Barsac style, fruity as well as sweet.",88,Château Hallet 2009  Sauternes
"Fatter than any Loire Sauvignon Blanc, this has some rich fruit, flavors of currants, an oily texture and intriguing candy flavors. There is a structure of green apple skins, but the wine is essentially light, fresh and instantly pleasing.",84,Simonnet-Febvre 2006 Sauvignon de Saint-Bris  (Saint-Bris)
"New leather, menthol, ripe berry and Asian spice aromas emerge in the glass while the firm palate offers dried black cherry, pomegranate, star anise and a hint of game. You'll also notice a green note of powdered sage. Assertive, close-grained tannins squeeze the finish.",87,Fattoria di Petroio 2011 Lenzi Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"Red plum, dark cranberry, composting rose petals, dried ginger and earthy mushrooms show on the slightly funky, slightly sweet nose of this bottling. The palate begins with a sour plum skin and tart raspberry kick, then leads into a core with hints of pine needle, juniper and turned loam.",92,Lincourt 2014 Annie Dyer Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"This peppery, fruit-flavored wine has a ripe character and wild strawberry flavors. Drink this full, spicy wine now.",86,Domaine Maestracci 2015 E Prove Rosé
"A chunky wine, this offers big, blocky flavors of oak, apple butter and melon. Round and forward, this is straightforward and perfectly enjoyable.",88,Lujon 2015 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
"Pretty dark and full-bodied for a rosé, and too extracted and heavy in cherry-berry flavors to be considered elegant. It's almost a red wine you could drink at room temperature.",82,Little Black Dress 2006 Syrah Rosé (California)
"Fresh citrus and pear flavors are highlighted by racy streaks of lime and tart pineapple in this unusually zippy Grauburgunder, or Pinot Gris. It's light in body yet creamy in texture with a long, lingering finish marked by crushed stones and salty minerality.",91,Thörle 2016 Trocken Grauburgunder (Rheinhessen)
"Not much going on beyond simple jam, currant and chocolate-covered raisin flavors. It's dry and tannic.",84,The Full 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This wine opens with aromas of blue flower, mature black fruit, vanilla, cake spices and toasted sensations. The dense palate delivers ripe red cherry, vanilla, plum, oak and bracing tannins. It lacks freshness and essential energy, so enjoy over the next few years.",87,Tornesi 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
"A vivid yellow-gold color grabs the attention and creamy, tropical fruit flavors deliver the goods in this medium-bodied but full-blown wine. Pineapple, grapefruit, fig and almond are layered in an almost unctuous texture, but supported by vibrant acidity that keeps everything in great balance.",91,Senses 2013 B.A Theiriot Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"A bold, chewy expression of the variety, Summit exhibits its 15% whole-cluster fermentation. It also is given more oak, a chance to tame its wild black cherry and lush cola spice. Black tea and a trace of red fruit play into the personality of the wine, adding a brightness to what is otherwise a decadent, full-throttle wine, barely tamed at that. Drink now through 2023.",93,Lynmar 2013 Quail Hill Vineyard Summit Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This appealing wine is already five years old but could use more time to show its best. The aromas of black pepper, licorice and blackberry are generous. Taut and tart fruit flavors come with a pleasing mouthfeel and a finish that lingers. Best from 2018 to 2021.",91,Basel Cellars 2010 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"There's an intense punch of sweet yellow peach on this lip-smackingly delicious Spätlese. Hints of savory spice and struck flint, and a deep, rippling minerality adds complexity and depth through the finish.",92,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler 2011 Graacher Himmelreich Spätlese Riesling (Mosel)
"Dry and mellow, this easy Merlot gets the job done. It has cherry and blackberry flavors that are a touch green and minty.",84,Black Box 2011 Merlot (California)
"This opens with unusual aromas of moist soil, hay, truffle, underbrush, baked bean, molasses and black-skinned fruit. The palate offers prune, espresso, dried black cherry, thyme and anisette alongside bracing tannins.",88,Fattoria di Lamole 2010 Le Stinche Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"On the ripe side of herbaceous, this is a full and rounded wine. It has citrus flavors along with richer tropical fruits, a mineral edge and delicious, juicy acidity. The wine can be drunk now, but will be better after 2015.",87,Château Ducasse 2012  Bordeaux Blanc
"A lightweight Pinot that's actually marketed as a rose, this wine nevertheless manages to pack in decent flavors of apple skin, red berries and cinnamon, capped off by some leathery, meaty notes.",83,Castello di Borghese NV Fleurette Pinot Noir (North Fork of Long Island)
"Delicate scents of ripe orchard fruit, acacia and a whiff of honey guide the nose while the round palate offers apricot, yellow pear and a hint of pineapple. A light almond note closes the finish.",88,Fattoria Zerbina 2015 Bianco di Ceparano Albana (Romagna)
"This fairly rich and heavy rosé is produced and bottled for Xavier Flouret by Domaine de Rimauresq. It does have attractive peach and melon aromas, but the flavors are weighty in the mouth and could use a touch more zest and zip on the finish. Best with meaty dishes. A blend of 45% Cinsault, 25% Tibouren, 25% Grenache and 5% Syrah.",85,Xavier Flouret 2006 Nationale 7 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Made from 100% Montepulciano, this opens with aromas of blue flower, blackberry and espresso. Juicy fruit notes take center stage on the palate, along with notes of vanilla and chocolate, yet ends on a dry, tannic note. Not much complexity here so enjoy this soon.",86,Garofoli 2010 Piancarda  (Rosso Conero)
"Beautifully balanced, this wine is both fresh and creamy. It is still young and at its crispest, needing some time. Acidity, citrus and green plum fruits are there along with a tight, mineral texture. The future will bring out more of the wine's creamy character and soften it. Drink from 2017.",92,Aubry 2011 Ivoire et Ebène Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne)
"A lush fruit bowl of a wine, this brings delicious flavors of melon, peach, apple and pear, along with a buttery finish. There are some pleasing spicy highlights, and a residual smack of butterscotch invites the next sip.",90,Tinhorn Creek 2013 Pinot Gris (Okanagan Valley)
"Broad and ripe, this comes across heavy on the nose, with fig and chocolate cake aromas. The palate is huge and tannic but also jammy. Fig, baked berry and tobacco flavors finish hot and toasty, like espresso.",89,Emina 2010 Prestigio  (Ribera del Duero)
"Woodsy earthy berry aromas share the nose with fresh-cut oak scents. This Carmenère-Syrah blend feels lively and juicy, not heavy or flat. Dark spicy berry and plum flavors include notes of olive and oak, while the finish is spicy and tastes of olive and tobacco.",90,Ventisquero 2012 Vertice Apalta Vineyard Carmenère-Syrah (Colchagua Valley)
"Gregory Graham's first Lake County Chardonnay, this wine has notes of vanilla custard, lemon and toasty oak.",85,Gregory Graham 2011 Wedge Block Chardonnay (Lake County)
"Firm, ripe and fruity, with a nice mix of plums, berries and earth. The mountain fruit shows good acids, some mineral elements, and a long, complex finish with a fair amount of earth and barnyard. A distinctive, earthy style.",91,Peterson 1997 Bradford Mountain Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"Bruised apple notes precede a friendly, easy, soft, apple-scented wine with a light and dry body. Drink soon while aromas last.",85,Willm 2015 Gentil White (Alsace)
"Made from organically grown grapes, this is a new wine from Barton & Guestier, a fresh, very herbaceous Sauvignon Blanc. It is bright with pear and green fruits to go with a big twist of lemon. Screwcap.",85,Barton & Guestier 2008 Originel Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de Pays du Val de Loire)
"This brawny wine has attractive oaky, smoky, spicy aromas, generous fruit and spice flavors, full body and a good, gripping layer of tannin to add texture.",88,"Vasco Urbano 2013 Norm, Marina Ranch Grenache (Livermore Valley)"
"With its high percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon (60%), this gives an initial serious structure, topped with rich, ripe black fruit flavors. The tannins are calmed by this richness, with spice, blueberries and blackberry juice much more dominant.",89,Château Brown 2006  Pessac-Léognan
"Based in nearby Cornas, Colombo has fashioned a medium-bodied Condrieu that's a bit oily in texture while remaining very drinkable. Mint, melon and apricot notes mark the aromas and flavors, while the finish is clean and refreshing.",90,Jean-Luc Colombo 2012 Amour de Dieu  (Condrieu)
"This is a soft, gentle Cabernet for drinking now. It's pleasantly rich, offering blackberry, cherry, chocolate and cedar flavors, wrapped into easy tannins.",87,Aquinas 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Here's a fresh-tasting sparkling wine from northern Italy with pretty aromas of peach, stone fruit and even a touch of melted butter. It has a sophisticated and rich side that is accented by natural sweetness and intense peach flavors.",86,Monte del Frá NV Custoza Spumante Brut White (Veneto)
"Young and forward, this pleasant wine brings black-cherry fruit front and center—a good start, but it doesn't really develop any further. It just does a quick and quiet fade out.",86,Second Growth 2015 Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"This is a beautifully ripe wine, full of melon and apricot fruits as well as fine crisp acidity. There is a little touch of pepper to give the wine piquancy. Drink this attractive wine now.",87,Ollivier Frères 2016 Domaine de l'Olivier Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"Peach, melon and brown sugar aromas make for a pleasant and full bouquet. This is plump and healthy on the tongue, with fleshy peach tones that finish dusty, round and a touch sweet in flavor. Drink now.",87,Borsao 2013 Rosé (Campo de Borja)
"Dusty, jumbled aromas of fleshy melon and stone fruits are not terribly defined. This has a soft mouthfeel and flavors of papaya, peach and bitter citrus pith. Drink immediately; contains 10% Viura.",84,Emina 2014 Rueda Verdejo-Viura (Rueda)
"This full-bodied wine smells jammy and tastes superripe, like blackberry syrup, so it has a broad, soft texture and a mash-up of late-harvested fruit flavors that are very tasty.",88,Ferrari-Carano 2014 Sky High Ranch Pinot Noir (Mendocino Ridge)
"Organically grown grapes are put to fine use in this rich, crisp Chardonnay that is highly attuned with acidity. Pressed whole-cluster, the grapes yield a wine that tends toward sour green apple, balanced with a texture that lends it some heft.",87,Horse & Plow 2012 McFadden Farm Chardonnay (Mendocino)
"Aromas of underbrush, porcini mushroom, scorched earth and prune lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. The concentrated palate offers blueberry extract and black plum, while notes of mocha and black pepper add depth. It's still young, with big, chewy tannins and enough fresh acidity to age another decade or more. Drink 2015–2024.",92,Tedeschi 2009 Capitel Monte Olmi Riserva  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"A zesty, citrus-accented wine that features aromas and flavors of lemons and limes, piecrust and minty herbs. Finishes clean and refreshing—a racy wine that nevertheless isn't lightweight.",87,Andrew Harris 1999 Premium Chardonnay (Mudgee)
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Zinfandel offers lots to like at the price. It's soft, rich and finely tannic, with savory berry and spice flavors that straddle the border between dry and sweet.",85,Kendall-Jackson 2008 Vintner's Reserve Summation Red (California)
"A tad riper, fuller and richer than the 2009 vintage, this wine is deep, subtle and complex, with a myriad of fruit and mineral flavors. Cassis, olive, fresh herb, toast, caramel and coconut are all in play, balanced and layered. The wine is young, tart and full of promise for the long term; hold at least 10–15 years.",95,Force Majeure 2010 Collaboration Series I Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red (Red Mountain)
"This is a fun and lively blend of 38% Grenache, 24% Cinsault, 21% Syrah and 17% Petite Sirah, with aromas of fresh wild berries and white pepper. The flavors are berry punch-like, with intriguing clove, licorice and anise.",89,Robert Hall 2013 Cuvée de Robles Red (Paso Robles)
This does not offer much in terms of aromas other than measured tones of stone fruit and shadings of white mineral. It is equally as easy and informal in the mouth.,83,Vino dei Fratelli 2007 Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie)
"Ripe and immediately attractive, this is an apple and lime flavored wine. Weight from the Pinots in the blend gives a rich, full-bodied backdrop. There is just a hint of toast in this bottling, showing it is very ready to drink.",89,Charles Ellner NV Qualité Extra Brut  (Champagne)
"The caramel character of this wine is less attractive than its background of red fruits. The two sides need to come into balance for it to work completely, so wait until late 2016.",84,Producta Vignobles 2015 Cabane aux Oiseaux Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
"Aromas of black cherry, tilled soil and a hint of dark spice lift out of the glass. The palate offers juicy wild cherry, cinnamon and white pepper while smooth tannins lend a polished texture.",89,Poggio Stenti 2013 Tribulo  (Montecucco)
"The second wine of Château Montrose is at a high level. With its ripe chocolate and sweet black currant flavors, the structure comes from dark tannins, which, as so often in Saint-Estèphe, are dry, but not hard, and have delicious fresh berry fruits to envelope them. A wine that is great for aging over 4–5 years.",90,Château Montrose 2006 La Dame de Montrose  (Saint-Estèphe)
"Generous flavors of red and black cherry, and a nice, firm coating of fine tannins make this full-bodied wine good and substantive. Those dark fruit flavors are fairly deep and concentrated, and linger on the finish.",87,Lyeth 2013 Merlot (North Coast)
"For Roussanne, this is surprisingly neutral on the nose. It's marginally more expressive on the palate, where it offers hints of paraffin and toasted marshmallow. Still, it's plump and mouthfilling, with an attractive hint of ginger on the long finish.",90,Yalumba 2014 Samuel's Garden Selection Roussanne (Eden Valley)
"Although this wine opens with a lively ruby color, it segues into tired, somewhat lifeless aromas of resin, tar, cherry liquor, earth and deep toasted notes. The wine seems to be very influenced by the wood it aged in.",87,Monte Faustino 2001  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"Hints of smoke and toast mingle enticingly amidst ripe black plum and cherry in this rich, lusciously textured wine. It's bold and a bit brawny on the palate, but reined in elegantly with a cool mineral tone and bright acidity. It finishes long with a ruffle of soft tannins.",89,Pflüger 2012 Friedelsheimer Pinot St. Laurent Red (Pfalz)
"The Black Eyed Peas' singer Fergie and renowned winemaker Joey Tensley present an in-your-face Viognier, deeply yellow, nearing brown in color, with aromas of dried apricot, honey-roasted nuts and smoky mezcal with lime. Lush flavors of burnt orange peel, smoke and Scotch whisky make for an intriguing drink, certainly not for those seeking a dainty white wine.",88,Ferguson Crest 2010 Viognier (Santa Ynez Valley)
"There's a lot to like on this bold, fragrant wine, starting with aromas of leather, scorched earth, grilled herb and ripe black-skinned fruit. The hearty palate offers mouthfuls of juicy black cherry, raspberry jam, licorice, vanilla and cinnamon framed in robust, velvety tannins. The fruit richness seamlessly offsets the hefty abv. Drink 2018–2025.",95,Uccelliera 2010 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"There's slight effervescence in the glass of this wine that offers tart green-apple skins and pear-cider notes on the nose. Yellow pear and sour apple skins also show on the palate, lifted with nuances of lemongrass.",87,La Crema 2015 Pinot Gris (Monterey)
"A super Tuscan blend of Sangiovese, Merlot, Syrah and Alicante, this shows some of the cheerful, funky and lively characteristics that identify this wine with Maremma, Tuscany. This velvety effort offers notes of chocolate, blackberry, chewy cherry and tobacco.",88,Mocali 2009 Mirus  (Maremma)
"The Hunter's almost tropical climate shows in this wine's aromas and flavors of roasted cashews, grilled peaches and superripe tangerines. It's medium in body heading towards full, but silky in feel and with mouthwatering grilled notes on the finish. Drink now.",89,Hope Estate 2014 Mountain Wash Chardonnay (Hunter Valley)
"Rustic, rubbery, leathery aromas are highly suggestive of animal hide and stalky berry fruits. This is hard as rocks on the palate, with an astringent mouthfeel. Briny, leathery berry and plum flavors end with a stalky aftertaste.",83,Doña Paula 2012 Estate Malbec (Uco Valley)
"Aromas like new leather, tobacco and spices lead to vivid cranberry and raspberry flavors in this lively, fine-textured, authentic-tasting wine. It has a medium to light color, medium body, firm tannins and a great mouthwatering character partly because of its relative leanness.",90,Rubino Estates Winery 2012 Riserva Sangiovese (Livermore Valley)
"Soft in texture and semi-sweet, this simple Merlot has sugary cherry and blackberry flavors.",82,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi 2010 Merlot (California)
"Luscious blackberry and cherry flavors take center stage here, showing just a glaze of nuttiness and roundness from judicious oak aging. Tart cranberry acidity and fine but slightly puckering tannins frame the palate squarely.",89,Bedell 2014 Malbec (North Fork of Long Island)
"A touch of redcurrant plays on the lemony nose of this rather pale rosé. The zesty palate has an edge of white pepper and is both light and dry. Zippy with a crisp, appetizing finish, it's almost thirst-quenching.",89,Martinshof 2016 Zum Martin Sepp Rosé (Niederösterreich)
"Round and rich, this has delicious acidity and touches of tropical fruits. It's ripe and full bodied, with an attractive hint of wood.",87,Henri de Villamont 2009 Prestige  (Bourgogne)
"Tart and sleek, this estate-grown fruit  has appealing elegance. The fruit is almost transparent, but not invisible, with very clean, high acid flavors of green berry, apple and pear. There is a layer of butterscotch that fills in the finish, without taking away from the finesse.",87,Tsillan Cellars 2006 Estate-Barrel Select Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Quite a good Cabernet, showing the elegance and ripe fruitiness you expect from Napa, in a style for drinking now. Drily tannic, it shows classic blackberry and blueberry flavors.",89,Trailhead 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Mandarin zest and the tenderest suspicion of rose petals hold lots of promise. This satisfying aroma continues on the medium-sweet palate where sweet citrus flesh meets spicy, aromatic orange peel. Lightness of touch marks this as a paradigm of subtlety, and its purity lingers.",91,Henri Schoenheitz 2014 Holder Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Fresh, fruity cherry, citrus and rose aromas are light and airy. This feels a bit raw and scratchy, while currant, red plum and brown sugar flavors finish juicy, snappy and uncushioned. This has all the requirements of a good picnic Pinot Noir.",85,Alfredo Roca 2015 Fincas Pinot Noir (Mendoza)
"This black-colored crianza delivers big, toasty aromas of charred oak, setting the stage for a massive palate, the equivalent of an 18-wheeler. Blackened flavors of burnt wood, coffee and berry fruit lead to a smacking tannic finish. Drink 2020–2025.",91,Balbas 2014 Ardal Crianza Vendimia Seleccionada  (Ribera del Duero)
"Warm berry-rhubarb pie notes mix with black pepper and an appealing, shy layer of green bell pepper on this blend of 50% Merlot, 28% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot from three vineyards. Stewed plums, cherries and strawberries dominate the tasty palate, with a proper acidity and woody bitterness as balance.",89,Carhartt Vineyard 2012 Fourplay Red (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Aromas of café au lait, woodspice and dark fruit lead to full-bodied, hedonistic coffee flavors. The style is rich, mixing fruit and barrel.",90,Watermill 2012 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR))
"This expression of Dolcetto is packed tight with loads of bright berry and black fruit aromas, but also has a polished mineral vein at the core. This is a lively, cheerful wine with good intensity, sour cherry flavors and firm tannins. Drink now.",87,Marchesi di Barolo 2008 Madonna di Como  (Dolcetto d'Alba)
"This opens with aromas suggesting underbrush, crushed herb and blue flower. The palate is tightly wound and rather closed, showing hints of orange zest and raw cranberry. Racy acidity and austere tannins clench the finish.",87,Ca' del Baio 2013 Pora  (Barbaresco)
"This is a unique wine that not everyone will like. It definitely has personality and complexity and is completely unlike the commercial passitos flooding the market. Aromas include cola, root beer, caramel, dried mint, chestnut and apricot. There's also a musky side of earth and white mushroom. It is thickly concentrated and syrupy in the mouth. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers.",88,Ferrandes 2004  Passito di Pantelleria
"A broad, ripe and very accessible wine. Spiced by nutmeg and vanilla, it is based on solid, chunky black fruits and distinguished layer of tannins. Ready to drink, or keep for one year.",88,Ramos-Pinto 2008 Duas Quintas Red (Douro)
"Smoky and earthy on the nose, this remarkably complex Beerenauslese highlights bright, sunny stonefruit flavors with layers of minerality. It's delightfully flinty, but lip-smackingly honeyed as well. Finishes briskly with a delicate saline note.",94,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler 2011 Bernkasteler Badstube Beerenauslese Riesling (Mosel)
"While the wine is clean, it tastes yeasty and heavy despite its low alcohol. There is strawberry fruitiness and final acidity, although the sweetness remains intrusive.",83,Aveleda 2014 Casal Garcia Rosé (Vinho Verde)
"An easy Cabernet, delivering plenty of ripe, juicy blackberry jam and dark chocolate flavors. It finishes a little on the sweet side.",85,Decoy 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa County)
"A wondrous bottling of delicately handled, incredibly complex wine, this bottling shows tangy cranberry, black raspberry, butter cookie, wet sage, rosemary, menthol and green peppercorn on the nose. Once sipped, the soft, savory yet amply fruited palate shows plum, fig and mulberry that are seasoned with pencil shavings, graphite, incense and sandalwood.",96,Laetitia 2013 La Coupelle Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"This is an intensely minerally, dry Riesling that showcases an array of crushed stone and earth elements against a backdrop of heather floral and yellow stonefruit flavors. It's richly textured and finishes long with a feathery touch on the palate.",92,S.A. Prüm 2010 Wehlener Sonnenuhr GG Old Vines Dry Riesling (Mosel)
"From a beautifully exposed southwest facing vineyard with views of the Pyrenees, this is a serious and impressive wine. There is no holding back on the powerful structure and rich fruit or the dense texture and the layers of spice from the 16 months of wood aging. Balanced and generous, it will age for many years, and will best be drunk from 2022.",96,Vignobles Brumont 2010 Château Montus La Tyre Tannat (Madiran)
"This wine, which comes from thin, granitic soils, is lean, taut and dry. Hints of lime blossom and green apple on the nose and palate give it a springtime feel, while the finish is crisp and refreshing.",89,Fowles Wine 2014 Ladies Who Shoot Their Lunch Riesling (Victoria)
"With soft tannins, gentle acidity and herbal flavors of blackberries and cherries, this dry Cabernet displays classic Alexander Valley character. It's a little simple now, but should develop interesting bottle complexities over the years.",89,Souverain 2006 Winemaker's Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Browned butter, roasted almonds and walnuts, kumquat cream and iodine show on the nose of this oxidative style from Bill Foley's large portfolio. The palate is rich with toasty brioche and peanut-butter notes.",87,Foley 2013 Bar Lazy S Ranch Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Bright and fresh wine, but with delicious depth of apricot and green plum flavors. It's full with outstanding richness, while the fruit flavors have a great lift. Part of Schloss Gobelsburg's Tradition series, in which wines are aged longer before release.",91,Schloss Gobelsburg 2005 Tradition Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"A tasty Sauvignon Blanc, with crisply acidic grapefruit, pineapple and lime juice flavors, touched with oak. A nice appetizer sipper, with some complexity. Good with asparagus risotto, bruschetta with goat cheese, a nice roast chicken with sautéed new potatoes and rosemary.",88,Gary Farrell 2009 Redwood Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County)
"Big, dry and tannic wine, this is a dense and structured wine. Black chocolate and coffee flavors suggest extraction shows strongly in the tough texture. The wine will be filled out as the black fruits develop, so wait until 2018.",88,Espaço Rural 2011 Poento Tinto Reserva Red (Alentejano)
"Soft, sweet and simple in structure. Many wine lovers will enjoy the cherry, raspberry, vanilla and chocolate-cinnamon flavors that taste like a dessert pastry.",83,Arger-Martucci 2005 Syrah (Atlas Peak)
"Barrel fermented and put through full malolactic with regular batonnage, this superbly balanced, graceful Chardonnay is orchestrated around a complex mix of pear, tropical fruit, biscuit, cream soda and light baking spices. The acidity carries a hint of mineral, and the palate impression is lively and smooth.",92,Alloro 2011 Estate Chardonnay (Chehalem Mountains)
"This wine mostly hails from Les Collines, with a splash of fruit from Upland Vineyard (12%) rounding it out. Aged in neutral oak, it displays brooding aromas of black pepper, plum, smoked meat, parsley and fresh violets. The plum and savory flavors bring a rich textured feel all the while displaying exquisite freshness.",92,Kerloo 2014 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Pale orange-pink in color, this is fruity and light. It coveys a bright, fresh character that is both refreshing and very crisp. Drink now.",85,Château la France 2014 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
Disagreeable for its harsh acidity and vegetal streak that mars the cherries and suggests a bitter green herb. Disappointing.,82,La Crema 2008 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Perfumed and pert, this elegant entry-level Spätburgunder offers surprising bang-for-your buck. Sumptuous blackberry and cherry flavors are ripe and concentrated, accented by hints of dried herb, cedar and anise. It's supple in texture with a sprightly streak of acidity. The finish lingers on soft, pleasantly astringent tannins. Drink now through 2022 to enjoy its fresh perfume.",91,Carl Ehrhard 2013 Rüdesheim Kirchenpfad Spätburgunder Trocken Pinot Noir (Rheingau)
"From the new estate run by Giovanni and Paolo Bulgari (of fashion and jewelry fame), this pure expression of Sangiovese shows very interesting aromas of bright red cherry, perfumed blue flower and a touch of sweet spice. The wine is focused, compact and crisp on the close.",90,PoderNuovo a Palazzone 2009 Sotirio Sangiovese (Toscana)
"Simple melon and vanilla aromas and flavors in a lightweight wine. It'll go fine with carryout rotisserie chicken on a busy weeknight, when something else might be overkill.",83,Cockatoo Ridge 2000 Chardonnay (Australia)
"In this 100% varietal wine, tire rubber, spice box and flower aromas are followed by seamless dark fruit flavors backed by firm but well integrated tannins. It shows a pleasant balance that sustains through the finish.",88,:Nota Bene 2013 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Merlot (Red Mountain)
"Richness and ripeness combine with just enough juicy acidity in this wine that smells lemony, figgy and buttery. Tastes recall ripe pears and fig bars without being sweet. It's an appealing wine with personality and good balance.",87,Josh Cellars 2013 Chardonnay (California)
"Full-bodied and intense, this delicious wine opens with aromas of woodland berry, star anise, chopped herbs, underbrush and a whiff of light oak. The firm palate doles out ripe black cherry, licorice, sage and chopped mint alongside big, velvety tannins and fresh acidity.",94,Elio Grasso 2011 Ginestra Casa Maté  (Barolo)
"This is a big, ripe, distinctly New World Merlot that shows off its terroir to perfection. A long, sunny growing season has given explosive currant, blackberry jam and mocha flavors, while cool nights have preserved vital acidity and firm tannins. Drink now, with grilled steak topped with a blue cheese and brown butter sauce.",91,Greenwood Ridge 2006 Estate Bottled Merlot (Mendocino Ridge)
"An extremely, deep, almost black color is the first sign that something unusual is going on in this bold but not heavy wine. It smells like dark berries and baking spices and tastes like boysenberry jam while staying dry in style. Abundant layers of fine tannins make the texture grippy and prepare the wine for the richest proteins on the table.",89,Noble Vines 2013 The One Black Red (North Coast)
"A full-bodied wine, with acidity and ripe white fruits. It is soft, lightly sweetened and easy to drink.",83,José Maria da Fonseca 2006 Periquita White (Terras do Sado)
"This refreshing and light-bodied Grüner also has a rounder, riper aspect, referencing flavors of red apple and green pear. While the nose does not give away that much, concentration characterizes the midpalate before an easy, super-clean finish.",89,Markus Huber 2014 Hugo Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"Raspberries cooked in butter with a clove spice appear on the nose of this wine from Monterey County. It's rich with sage-tinged blackberry juice flavors on the palate, also showing a plum-skin tartness and pencil shavings.",85,Lockwood 2013 Pinot Noir (San Lucas)
"This blend of the two classic grapes of Vinho Verde, Loureiro and Alvarinho, is packed with fruit. Apples, lemons and a touch of ripe pear just fill the palate. It is a dry wine, refreshing and crisp with a mineral aftertaste.",90,Aveleda 2015 Quinta da Aveleda White (Vinho Verde)
"A wonderfully drinkable sparkling wine that appeals immediately for its balanced texture and rich flavors. Easy to like for its array of raspberries, limes, vanilla, toast and yeast. The sour lees note is nicely balanced with the sweet liqueur of dosage.",90,Gloria Ferrer NV Sonoma Brut Sparkling (Sonoma County)
"The nose on this wine by oil worker-turned-winemaker Ert Sevtap offers lifting aromas of blueberry and mint. The spearmint notes carry to the palate as well, which also shows blackberry fruit and roasted beef meatiness.",87,Sevtap 2012 Zig-A-Zig-Ahh Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Aging in large casks gives this wine structure without adding invasive wood sensations. It's loaded with white flower, mature Bartlett pear, tart green apple, mineral and finesse. The creamy palate is energized by crisp acidity.",90,Weingut Stroblhof 2012 Strahler Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
"Nicely balanced, full of tasty fruit flavors, and accented by light vanilla and nutmeg, this is a seamless wine that has lots of appeal. At this reasonable price, it will make a great go-to choice—the kind to stock by the case.",90,Parducci 2014 Small Lot Blend Chardonnay (Mendocino County)
"This is a very drinkable Gigondas despite being very much in the savory-spicy style. Leather, garrigue, cinnamon and clove are the dominant notes, softened by silky tannins and modest cherry fruit. Drink now–2015.",88,Andrieux & Fils 2009  Gigondas
"Edelzwicker is an Alsatian term meaning noble blend, and is applied to any blend of white wine grapes. Here, it is Gewurztraminer, Pinot Gris and Riesling, capturing the floral aromatics and lightly oily mouthfeel of the former, along with the citrus and pear flavors from the latter two components. All in all it's an aromatic, floral, broadly flavorful and distinctive white wine.",88,Big Table Farm 2014 Wirtz Vineyard Edelzwicker White (Willamette Valley)
"Very light, could almost be a rosé.",82,Mount Baker Vineyards 2006 Barrel Select Sangiovese (Yakima Valley)
"Lots of fruit flavor and light spicy touches make this medium-bodied, dry and moderately tannic wine very attractive. Black cherry meets clove and cinnamon, while ample acidity joins with a touch of tannin for a well-balanced texture.",89,Parducci 2014 Small Lot Merlot (Mendocino County)
"Now well-established as a Douro classic, this latest vintage of Chryseia shows the same concentration and dense tannins while bringing an extra element of elegance and balance. This gives the wine obvious aging potential, over at least 6–7 years.",93,Prats & Symington LDA 2008 Chryseia Red (Douro)
"A superior Syrah for its dryness, firm texture and restrained yet powerful flavors. Feels really fine in the mouth, with complex, rolling tannins that support waves of blackberry, bacon and sandalwood flavors, as well as something floral—violets, perhaps. Distinguished all the way through, it's fine for drinking now with foods like duck, game, steak or roasted chicken.",92,Longoria 2009 Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"This medium-bodied wine climbs several notches up the quality scale from a typical California AVA Chardonnay. It blends ripe pear and butter aromas, pleasing peach and pear flavors, a texture that is soft and easy, and a slightly buttery finish.",88,Ironstone 2012 Chardonnay (California)
"Soft, open wine, with some attractive perfumed character as well as light acidity. It is somewhat unfocused, missing structure. Screwcap.",85,Château Suau 2010  Bordeaux Blanc
"Tough in tannins, with a gritty mouthfeel, although it's also soft and jammy sweet. A blend of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, this rustic wine is a little hot in alcohol. Drink now.",85,Villa San Juliette 2007 Chorum Syrah-Cabernet (Paso Robles)
"This 100% varietal, barrel-fermented wine from the hallowed site delivers a grip of tension and balanced weight, providing power within its layers of texture. Earthy and pungent with tobacco and herb scents, it offers leather, cedar and black cherry flavors in equal amounts, finishing with length and grace.",97,Alpha Omega 2012 Beckstoffer To Kalon Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"From almost 92% Pinot Noir with the remainder Chardonnay, this is a dry, elegant, fairly priced sparkling wine tasting of ripe stone fruit. The finish ends sweet, begging for spicy food to complement.",88,Gloria Ferrer NV Sonoma Brut Sparkling (Sonoma County)
"Round and accessible, this smooth straightforward Aglianico offers flavors of juicy blackberry, wild cherry, ripe plum and baking spice framed in supple tannins. There's not much complexity, but it is delicious. Drink through 2019.",88,D'Aione 2010  Taurasi
"Aromas of dried herbs intertwine with dill, vanilla and other barrel spices on this blend. The cranberry flavors have a tart zing, with slightly drying tannins providing the frame.",88,Pondera 2011 Cuvée Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"An intensely juicy wine, this needs time to bring together all the part of the blend. The richness and wood flavors show power, sweetness and dark berry and plum flavors spiced with cinnamon and toast. Give it a year for the extreme juiciness to calm down.",89,Gernot and Heike Heinrich 2006 Pannobile Red (Burgenland)
"A little sluggish on the nose, but if you concentrate on the feel and overall balance the wine grades out fairly well. The flavors run from pickled raspberry to salty plum, and never is the wine very sweet or rich. Conversely, it settles on tight and lean, with juiciness rather than pulp.",84,Lar de Paula 2005 Añada  (Rioja)
"This wine is a blend of Sémillon (55%) and Sauvignon Blanc from Cave B and Mercer Estate vineyards. Aromas are reticent at present, with notes of reduction, grass, herb and spice. The palate is flavorful, with citrus and tropical-fruit flavors. It delivers a lot of enjoyment.",88,Lauren Ashton Cellars 2016 Cuvée Meline White (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Prima Volta (“first time”) is a fresh and easy wine, with medium intensity and bright aromas of honey, peach and white flower. The mouthfeel is lean and compact, but the persistent perlage keeps it lively.",86,Giavi 2011 Prima Volta Millesimato Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Aged for two years in Hungarian Tokaj barrels, this wine is fresh and appealing with notes of dark plum, spice and green herbs. The fruit flavors are sweet and succulent and backed by more tannic structure than usually seen for the variety.",88,Lantz 2010 Malbec (Rattlesnake Hills)
Woody and toasty aromas overlay the broad dark fruit and black olive notes. Jumbled flavors on the midpalate lead to a chewy finish.,84,Bluestone 2010 Meritage (Virginia)
"Big and forward on the bouquet, this has loud, fiery black-cherry and berry aromas. Like most Lurton wines of Spanish origin, El Albar is chewy and ripe, with a syrupy feel and flavors of blackberry, stewed plum and spice cake. The finish is chocolaty, beefy and concentrated.",88,François Lurton 2009 El Albar Lurton Barricas Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)
"A good, standard Pinot Noir, dry and crisp in acidity, with cherry, cola and pomegranate flavors accented by smoky oak. Drink now.",86,Mahoney 2009 Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"Named after the sector in the Morgon cru where this wine comes from, it is ripe and balanced with acidity and solid tannins as well as juicy blackberry fruits. The wine needs to age. Drink from 2019.",88,Domaine de Gry-Sablon 2015 Douby  (Morgon)
"This wine is an intrigue of lavender, rose and kirsch, young in firm tight tannins and tension. Black pepper, cherry and a light-bodied weight provide smooth drinkability and elegance, just waiting for the tannin to settle down. Drink now through 2020.",91,Byington 2014 Smith Vineyards Grenache (Dry Creek Valley)
"Aromatically, this wine is still shy on nose and palate. Underneath that the linearity and inherent slenderness of ripe tangerine flesh and zest come though, enriched with an earthy notion of ripe pear. The palate is dry and energetic, but also still rather closed. The true colors are revealed on the finish, with a lasting pear note bundled on the concentrated, linear palate. Drink 2019–2030.",93,Julien Schaal 2016 Sommerberg Grand Cru Granite Riesling (Alsace)
"Sharp and grapey, with sweet, jellied flavors of cherries, blackberries and chocolate. With a production of nearly a half-million cases, lots and lots of folks will happily wash down their meats and pasta with this easy red wine.",83,Fetzer 2005 Valley Oaks Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Produced on a small family-run estate that is surrounded by Bordeaux first growths, this wine is structured and firm. It has dark tannins and black currant fruit, together giving a ripe, smoky wine. The 40-year-old vines add to the concentration of this wine. Drink from 2019.",91,Château Gaudin 2012  Pauillac
"Aromas of blue flower, dark berry, scorched earth and a whiff of oak spices come together in the glass. The palate offers dried cherry, game, ground pepper, toast and espresso alongside grippy, drying tannins.",88,Fattoria Mantellassi 2012 San Giuseppe  (Morellino di Scansano)
"Candied raspberry and plum aromas are ripe and simple. This feels quite tannic and rubbery, while flavors of cherry, mixed berries and chocolate convey a sense of sweetness. A fresh but rough finish clocks this out.",86,Calcu 2012 Reserva Cabernet Franc (Colchagua Valley)
"This concentrated Sangiovese opens with aromas of underbrush, toasted oak, vanilla, mature plum and ripe berry. The firm palate offers fleshy blackberry extract, clove, licorice and oak-driven spice alongside a backbone of bracing tannins. Drink 2017–2022.",92,Poggio Scalette 2012 Il Carbonaione Sangiovese (Alta Valle della Greve)
"A restrained nose with hints of hazelnut, banana and peach leads to a juicy but restrained palate where texture is as important as flavor. This wine is balanced and structured. A slight touch of residual sugar rounds out the fruit and creates a just off-dry finish.",90,René Muré 2015 Signature Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"This white blend of Gros Manseng and Petit Courbu, both local grapes for Saint-Mont, produces a ripe, floral wine with touches of honey. It is refreshing as well, with lime juice acidity that sails right through to the end.",86,Producteurs Plaimont 2013 Hat Trick  (Saint-Mont)
"Rich while firm, this wine is structured and dense. It has great fruit potential that is still developing through the tight texture and the concentrated structure. It will be a fine wine, but give it time. Drink from 2020.",93,Chanson Père et Fils 2013 Perrières Premier Cru  (Meursault)
"Made to benefit the exploratory organization, this high-toned stunner exudes flavors of Gravenstein apple followed by a slight richness of marzipan. Moderate acidity and weight makes it a fine companion for the table, finishing with a sense of welcome fullness.",92,Iron Horse 2013 National Geographic Ocean Reserve Blanc de Blancs Sparkling (Green Valley)
"This is a simple, soft wine which has some sweetness as well as easy fruit. There is some perfume and a spicy edge as well as rounded orange flavor. Drink now.",84,Dopff & Irion 2011 Gentil White (Alsace)
"Copper-orange-pink in color, this wonderfully summery wine offers tart citrus and gravelly minerality, a taste of wet stone coated in just the right amount of sweetness.",88,La Pitchoune 2015 Vin Gris of Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Soft and delicately sweet, Moscato Bosc Dla Rei opens with a light, foamy appearance and plush layers of peach cream and lemon mousse. Fragrant, fresh and sweet, pair it with fruit salad.",87,Beni di Batasiolo 2010 Bosc Dla Rei  (Moscato d'Asti)
"Hints of dusty mineral and caramelized sugar lend complexity to deep, penetrating layers of honey, peach and yellow plum in this light-footed, yet resounding, kabinett. Delicately sweet and puckering with lemon-lime acidity, it's a deftly balanced wine that resonates long on the finish. Drink now through 2021.",93,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt 2014 Scharzhofberger Kabinett Grosse Lage Riesling (Mosel)
"This is a rich, flamboyant Viognier, showing lots of ripe, fruity flavors and a nice burst of acidity. It's high in alcohol, which gives some prickly heat, but the pineapple custard, tangerine and crème brûlée flavors are frankly delicious.",91,Chalk Hill 2010 Viognier (Chalk Hill)
"Well-priced from estate-grown vineyards, Shannon Ridge's Chardonnay is smooth in lemon, ripe apple and pear, and easygoing and clean with a finish of pineapple and vanilla oak. A great go-to wine for white wine lovers.",88,Shannon Ridge 2012 High Elevation Collection Chardonnay (Lake County)
"A fresh, off-dry wine with a year's aging is unusual for a Vinho Verde in this style. The result is that although the wine has lost some of its startling fruit and acidity, it has smoothed out, giving more room for the apple flavors. Drink now.",84,Vidigal 2014 White (Vinho Verde)
"Heat and earthy, leathery aromas are the initial blast here. This is a zesty, raw Pinot with punchy, tart raspberry and red plum flavors. Throughout this runs bright and juicy, with tangy acidity creating a citrus-like finish.",85,Apaltagua 2012 Reserva Tricao Valley Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Curicó Valley)
"This is a vibrantly energetic wine, explosive in raspberry and cherry, with a weedy, herbal undertone that gives it intrigue. Concentrated on the midpalate, with well-ingrained tannins, it finishes in a highlight of toasted oak.",90,Les Voleurs 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This extracted wine opens with aromas of toasted wood, coffee, mushroom, chocolate and vanilla. The dense, one-dimensional palate offers thick, jammy black fruit and oak extract.",86,Vesevo 2008  Taurasi
"A gorgeous blend of Friulano and Ribolla Gialla, this dense and rich white would pair with crab or lobster. It opens with creamy tones of stone fruit and citrus mousse, followed by slight touches of spice and vanilla.",90,Le Due Terre 2009 Sacrisassi Bianco White (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"Brooding smoke, purple fruit and violet aromas are followed by sumptuous fruit and barrel flavors in this Syrah. Barrel notes linger on the finish, feeling a bit raw but not detracting from the overall enjoyment.",90,Novelty Hill 2014 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"For a Riesling, the Julius is no lightweight. It's medium-weight, with pretty flavors of yellow fruit, resin, honeysuckle, even olive oil. Petrol and minerally notes play on the nose. A very good wine, and one with enough range of flavor to keep you guessing.",89,Henschke 2001 Julius Riesling (Eden Valley)
"Complemented by 9% Sémillon, this concentrated, creamy young wine is generous in pear, peach and subtle pineapple. Tart, it remains fresh and focused in the glass, with a lushness that's memorable and compelling. An impactful finish wraps things up nicely.",91,Groth 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"It's very rare to find a 100% Petit Verdot, the Bordeaux variety that adds a percentage or two of spice to wines in the Médoc. The color is dark, almost black, while the wine's tannins are sweet, chocolaty and flavored with toasty spice. With its big blackberry jam texture, this is dense and solid, a powerful, ripe wine.",91,Azamor 2005 Petit Verdot (Alentejano)
"This wine reveals the intense acidity of the 2007 vintage, while managing to balance that juiciness with solid tannins. With its acidity, it can age for over 3–4 years.",91,Domaine de Cause 2007 Notre Dame des Champs Malbec (Cahors)
"Meaning “The Thief,” Il Ladro blends 90% Sangiovese, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot. A silky smooth blockbuster of a wine, it dances in acidity with bright cherry, clove and spice throughout. The tannins are well-behaved and in the background, the finish exceptionally long.",90,Fields Family 2011 Il Ladro Red (Lodi)
"This wine has the lightest of rosé colors, so fresh and light and fruity. With crisp acidity, raspberry and red currants, it just dances on the palate.",89,Commanderie de la Bargemone 2013 Rosé (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence)
"Intensely honeyed, this silky wine abounds with sweet tropical fruit and citrus tinged with savory hints of saffron and tea. The palate is rich and sweet with bright orange and tangerine flavors cut with searing acidity and a slightly astringent finish.",86,Heron Hill 2011 Late Harvest Vidal Blanc (Finger Lakes)
"This wine still shows its youthful tannins. Juicy acidity brings up the blackberry and blueberry. A touch of bitterness will blow away, giving an attractive, fruity wine by 2016.",86,Henrique José de La Puente Sancho Uva 2012 Alfaraz Colheita Seleccionada Red (Alentejano)
"Fruity and perfumed, this is an attractive, juicy wine. Red berry and red currant fruits from the 27-acre estate give the wine freshness, gently underlined by the tannins. Drink from 2017.",86,Château les Charmes Godard 2012  Francs Côtes de Bordeaux
"Aromas of tomato, herbs, plastic and berries are decent but minimal. This feels chunky due to modest acidity, while lightly baked, herbal plum and berry flavors are regular through the finish.",86,Aymara 2016 Malbec (Mendoza)
"From the excellent 2001 vintage, this opulent and intense Vin Santo (a traditional dessert wine from Tuscany) reveals layers of honey, almond paste, dried apricot and butterscotch. There's great complexity and elegance here and the wine would pair with an assortment of aged cheeses.",93,Volpaia 2001  Vin Santo del Chianti Classico
"Offers what folks have begun to identify as pretty standard Marlborough Sauvignon, combining a struck-flint character upfront with grassy notes, melon and fig fruit and followed by a citrusy finish. Seems a touch soft; drink now.",86,Saint Clair 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"This is a thin, acidic wine, and it's not quite ripe, to judge from the green, grassy, ammonia notes. It's wonderfully dry and crisp in acidity, but that lack of richness makes it difficult to like.",83,Coquerel Family Wine Estates 2009 Terroir Coquerel Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"A bramble patch of aromas and flavors comes to mind in this blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot: spicy raspberry, blackberry and green stems are prominent. The palate is silky and round in feel, with soft tannins melding against a veil of vanilla and butter.",86,Winery at La Grange 2013 Meritage (Virginia)
"Clean and crisp aromas of Asian pear, lemongrass, honeysuckle, passion fruit and green plum show on the nose of this blend of 64% Sémillon and 36% Sauvignon Blanc. The palate would go down very easy on a hot day, with just a touch of acid-carrying flavors of gardenia, guava, mango and kaffir lime leaf.",88,Bonny Doon 2015 De Propio Gravitas White (North Coast)
"From grapes grown near the town of Los Alamos comes this wine from a San Diego-based family. Complex aromas suggest red cherry, blackberry, shiitake mushroom and black peppercorn. The palate is tighter, with cranberry, tart yet dark raspberry, iodine and sanguine flavors.",91,j.brix 2013 Audire Kick-On Ranch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
"Truffle, dried herb, espresso, new leather and balsamic aromas come together on this along with a whiff of wood shop. The firm tightly knit palate shows cranberry, sour cherry, clove and thyme framed in assertive close-grained tannins that leave a rather raspy finish. Drink after 2023.",88,San Biagio 2013 Capalot  (Barolo)
"From the up-and-coming Chianti Rufina area (an historic wine zone that is currently experiencing a revival of sorts) comes this plush and modern Riserva. The nose generously delivers aromas of black cherry, powdered chocolate and sweet spice.",88,Fattoria di Grignano 2007 Riserva  (Chianti Rufina)
"With its softness and medium-dry character, this is a great food wine for pâtés or blue cheese. It is finely in balance, its acidity giving a lift to the tangerine, peach and dried fruit flavors. The aftertaste is perfectly clean, creamy, lifted by acidity.",89,Bailly-Lapierre NV Exception Exquise Demi-Sec  (Crémant de Bourgogne)
"Grassy and scattered on the nose, with alfalfa, mint, berry and a note of agave or Tequila. It feels sticky at first but solid, with an herbal, minty flavor that is copied on the finish.",85,Spirit of the Andes 2010 Organic Wine Malbec (Tupungato)
"Slick and supple upfront, this Cabernet Franc gains muscle as it evolves toward the tangy, savory finish, which comes with a hint of mocha.",84,Lost Creek 2011 Cabernet Franc (Virginia)
"Rubbery and meaty smelling, with a certain chunkiness conveyed. The palate is tight as nails, with grabby tannins pushing savory plum flavors that come with a good dose of dill and herbal accents. Drying and a bit scratchy on the finish, with smack-down grip.",85,Bodegas Abanico 2008 Eternum Viti  (Toro)
"Get past the meaty aromas and the wine is smooth, caramel and spice flavored. The wood flavors are prominent suggesting the wine has been aged well. At the end, berry fruits and acidity come through.",86,Borges NV Porto Tawny Reserve  (Port)
"Black cherry, clove and smoked meat aromas are rolled up into one wondrously savory scent in this 50-50 blend of Mourvèdre and Syrah. Flavors of beef roasted in blackberry and Sherry sauce sprinkled with oregano and marjoram entertain the complex palate.",94,II Moons 2011 Ardor Red (Paso Robles)
"Ripe and creamy, this is full of rich pear and green plum fruit. It has weight and is layered with acidity, with a spice note and a taut, mineral texture. This is complex and age worthy.",92,Eichinger 2011 Wechselberg Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"Roasted aromas of tomato and red plum are spicy. This has a chunky, blocky mouthfeel that's searching for its groove. Herbal plum and tomato flavors finish a bit raw in feel and salty in flavor.",88,Marqués de Vargas 2014 Crianza  (Rioja)
"Elegant, integrated and balanced, this Bordeaux blend from lauded winemaker Miles Mossop offers an Old World-style experience that is both subtle and stylish. A touch of spice and oak on the nose lead into taut but tasty flavors of smoky spice and fruit.",85,Miles Mossop 2004 Max Red (Coastal Region)
"There's a lot a personality here thanks to perky aromas of lemon zest, chopped herbs, fresh sage, yellow pepper and cheerful crisp flavors. This is textbook Sauvignon—easy Italian style—with an emphasis on smoothness.",86,Vidussi 2006 Sauvignon (Collio)
"Straightforward and accessible, this has delicate aromas of red berry and kitchen spice. The firm, no-frills palate offers dried cherry, tart cranberry, sage and clove alongside solid tannins. Enjoy through 2019.",87,Castel Boglione 2012  Barbaresco
"Sourced from the Kiona vineyard on Red Mountain, and vinified in Oregon, this features a brambly, berry-strewn mid-palate with dried leaves and spices adding further interest. It rolls pleasantly across the palate into a tart, fruity finish.",88,Hawkins Cellars 2011 Reserve Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Spicy plum and berry aromas are full and fresh. This is Carignan from Cariñena, and it's chunky and lively on the palate with salty rustic leathery berry flavors that fade away on a juicy, tight finish.",86,Bodegas Paniza 2015 Cariñena (Cariñena)
"Inky black color makes it evident this is a varietally distinct wine, rounded in tannin and plenty ripe, that shows flavors of plum tart, mocha and vanilla. Soft and velvety on the palate, it imparts big fruit and concentration in a well-made style.",90,Frank Family 2013 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley)
"Tight, snappy aromas of citric red fruit and lemon peel set up a driving, tight palate with brambly berry, spice and herbal flavors. This shows chocolaty oak on the finish and juicy acidity that ensures freshness and long-lasting flavor.",86,Santa Julia 2013 [+] Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"This new designation from Rex Hill is a bit reticent aromatically, but full on the palate, with plummy fruit and a light hint of barnyard. Good texture and nicely threaded flavors roll onto the smooth, lingering finish.",91,Rex Hill 2010 Old School Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Layers of mint and earth are slightly out of proportion in this leathery wine, the finish leaving a somewhat sour taste.",83,Muscardini 2011 Gracie Creek Vineyards Syrah (Sonoma Valley)
"This soft, creamy wine is fruity, with attractive herbal and gooseberry flavors. It is light, crisp and ready to be drunk.",84,Bougrier 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Val de Loire)
"This is pure Mourvèdre from Heart of the Hill and Ciel du Cheval vineyards. The Red Mountain terroir is on display in the form of a spicy cherry-pie flavor that is set off by minerality and dense, earthy tannins. A kiss of chocolate seals the deal.",90,Syncline 2010 Mourvèdre (Red Mountain)
"Smells vegetal and unripe, with broccoli aromas that turn medicinal sweet in the mouth.",80,Bocage 2006 Merlot (Monterey)
"Profoundly beautiful aroma on this Cab, a perfect union of oaky char and vanilla with ripe blackberries and cassis. Hard to exaggerate the beauty. Powerful, yet never pushy, with classic Napa balance. Rich, sweet, almost meaty, with massive tannins that are refined and smooth. Very great density and weight. Really defines the vineyard, and should age effortlessly for 20 years",98,Araujo 2007 Eisele Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Frankly sweet, with sugary raspberry and cherry jam flavors. That sweetness may be the result of excessively high alcohol, residual sugar or, more likely, both. Either way, it's not a dry table wine, but it is a good wine that lots of Zin people will like.",83,Minassian-Young 2009 Will's Hill Vineyard Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"There's some richness in this chocolate- and cherry-flavored wine, but it really falls off quickly, leading to a thin finish. Lacks the sweet concentration this winery's Port-style wines used to have.",85,Prager 2005 Royal Escort Paladini Vineyard Port (Napa Valley)
"This is a ripe and fruity wine, with soft tannins and rich raspberry fruits. Already accessible, it's very full in the mouth, wonderfully juicy and jammy, yet with some freshness at the end.",88,Bouchard Père & Fils 2011  Monthélie
"Soft notes of apple compote perfume the nose. The palate has the same soft but distinct freshness of ripe, juicy apple. The friendly aromas could do with more definition on the palate, but this is a simple, clean wine.",86,Vieil Armand 2014 Tradition Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
"Delicious aromas of yellow cake batter, lemon and a touch of butter greet the nose on this wine by Mike Sinor. The palate proves much more delicate than the nose suggests, with yellow pear fruit and rain-on-cement minerality.",88,Sinor-LaVallee 2014 Pinot Gris (San Luis Obispo County)
"Subtle notes of crushed mineral and lime on the nose contrast the lush tangerine and orange flavors in this off-dry, concentrated wine. It's harmoniously sweet, balanced neatly by strikes of steel and acid that tighten the finish. Drink now through 2019.",89,S.A. Prüm 2015 Essence Riesling (Mosel)
"This ripe, fruity wine has soft tannins and a generous, warm character that makes it already drinkable. Better, however, to wait until its full potential is realized, from 2019.",90,Château du Pitray 2015 Premier Vin  (Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux)
"This wine is pale pink in color. Lightly reduced aromas of dried herb and cherry are followed by an elegantly styled palate, etched with orange-peel flavors. It brings intrigue but the concentration doesn't always seem all there.",87,Cloudlift Cellars 2015 Lucy Rosé of Cabernet Franc (Yakima Valley)
"Seems a bit on the woody side for now, boasting aromas of dark roasted coffee backed by hints of plummy fruit. The cedary, coffee-tinged oak continues on the palate, where it imparts a slightly dry, tannic edge to this otherwise supple, rounded wine. Give it a year or two to see if the oak integrates with time.",86,Grove Mill 2007 Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
"Aromas suggesting pressed yellow flower, dried stone fruit and a whiff of toasted nut carry over to the straightforward palate. A hint of almond underscores yellow apple and a citrus note while tangy acidity lends freshness.",87,Cappella Sant'Andrea 2015  Vernaccia di San Gimignano
"The wine has a stalky character, with bitter cherry fruits and light, lean acidity. Very textured, its tannins give a dry feeling to the finish. Drink from 2014.",85,Roche de Bellene 2011 Vieilles Vignes  (Bourgogne)
"While earthy mineral and fennel pollen notes abound, there's plenty of plump yellow plum, peach and lemon flavor in this luscious Riesling. Full bodied yet crisply balanced, it's a straightforward dry white with wide appeal. Drink now through 2019.",88,P.J. Valckenberg 2015 Weingut Liebfrauenstift Riesling (Rheinhessen)
"A rich, voluptuous nose gives way to crisp layers of lemon, pineapple and quince flavors in this barrel-kissed and full-bodied white. The ripeness of the fruit is brightened by stony minerality, allowing for a floral bite of apple blossom.",94,Benovia 2014 La Pommeraie Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Made from organically farmed Sangiovese, Barbera and Sagrantino, this bold blend opens with notes of tilled soil, violet, rose and spice. The palate delivers lush blackberry and red cherry accented by cinnamon and clove. Delicious now, but will continue to develop; drink 2015–2021.",90,Di Filippo 2011  Montefalco Rosso
"From the highest-elevation spot within the producer's Conn Creek vineyard, this wine is sticky and grippy in coffee, red cherry and billowing tannins that reach a soft, round approachability. The finish is part chocolate, part vanilla, both in proportion and in balance, the wine ultimately full of grace.",92,Neyers 2014 AME Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Standard aromas of cantaloupe and lees feed into a bright, lively palate with bracing acidity and good overall balance. Nectarine and citrus flavors are basic but hang in there on a lasting finish.",87,Muga 2014 Rosé (Rioja)
"Soft and rounded, this has plenty of warm fruits, but misses the acidity, crispness and texture. There is a pepper note on the finish.",85,Andrieux & Fils 2011 Cuvée Victoria Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Shafer consistently produces one of the biggest, fruitiest Chardonnays in California, and yet the wine remains balanced and interesting. The 2009 Red Shoulder Ranch is gigantic in pineapples, pears, mangoes, tangerines and honey, yet so minerally and crisp that somehow it finishes dry.",96,Shafer 2009 Red Shoulder Ranch Chardonnay (Carneros)
"From 90% Syrah and 10% Zinfandel, this is a fairly dark-colored wine, aged in stainless steel. It shows moderate acidity and highlights of wild strawberry, watermelon and jam, finishing with a tease of sweetness.",88,Pech Merle 2016 Ivy Rosé de Syrah (Sonoma County)
"Here's a fun, screwcap Pinot Grigio that opens with peach, pineapple and lemon zest followed by light mineral shadings. It's fresh, easy and compact overall.",85,Esperto 2006 Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie)
"Tough and tannic now, although it's fully dry, and the tannins are finely sculpted. Shows deep flavors of blackberries, currants, cocoa and spices. There's a hint of funkiness that may detract from ageability.",85,Grasso 2006 Olive Ridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Tuscany's Mazzei family delivers a wonderful Chianti Classico from their Fonterutoli estate that would pair perfectly with grilled meats or oven-roasted pasta. This is a soft, lush wine with bright cherry and spice notes, which drive a long, velvety finish.",90,Mazzei 2009 Fonterutoli  (Chianti Classico)
"This bubbly from Schramsberg has a deepish, salmon color and peach, melon and ginger cookie aromas. It combines crispness and finesse, fruit with complexity. Hints of almond, walnut and subtle spices come out on the lingering finish.",90,Mirabelle NV Brut Rose Sparkling (California)
"This is a fine value in weeknight Cabernet, showing supple tannins, regionally distinct aromas and flavors of currants, sage and bay leaf, and subtle oak. Drink this fruit-driven, silky wine through 2020.",89,Xanadu 2013 Exmoor Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River)
"A fine, firm, structured wine that shows richness along with elegance. Fresh, black fruits ride over dry tannins and acidity, allowing this to be a food-friendly wine that could benefit from some aging. To finish, the lifted, vibrant fruits leave a ripe, clean taste.",89,Messias 2003 Grande Escolha Red (Douro)
"Fans of Barbera will find the hard acids and thick tannins they love in this rustic Italian variety. The flavors are all dry: dried blackberries and cherries, dried leather, cured tobacco leaf, beef jerky, star anise. Yet there's a fruity sweetness that's charming. Great with almost anything starring sausage.",87,Montevina 2005 Terra d'Oro Barbera (Amador County)
"This is a rich, fragrant and luscious-tasting dessert wine. Wonderful honey, orange blossom and peach nectar aromas waft from the glass, and concentrated, luxurious, sweet fruit and floral flavors wash over the palate. The mouthfeel is rich and viscous, leaving a long finish that echoes the sweet honey aromas.",91,M2 2014 Belle Etoile Blanche White (Mokelumne River)
"Aromas suggesting dried rose petal, woodland berry, chopped mint and kitchen spice come together on this. The tight palate isn't quite as expressive as the nose, offering sour cherry, tart cranberry and a hint of clove alongside bracing tannins that grip the finish.",88,Bel Colle 2013 Montersino  (Barbaresco)
"Lipsmacking currents of raspberry and cherry offer a refreshing brightness and juicy profile to this silky wine that's also well-integrated in terms of acidity and oak. Medium bodied and restrained in alcohol, the finish is abbreviated, but spicy.",90,Woodenhead 2011 Ritchie Vineyard Cinder Cone Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Touches of heat and ripe cherry fruit give this bold wine a big impact on the nose and the palate. It delivers intense aromas of chocolate, leather, cured meat, cedar and cola.",88,Gamba 2009 Campedel  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
"This is done in a wide-open, instantly drinkable style that makes it an excellent, everyday quaffer. Young Oregon Pinots often need more time, but not this one. Strawberry, coffee and cola flavors combine into a broad and flavorful midpalate, fresh and inviting.",88,Hundred Suns 2015 Old Eight Cut Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"At five years, this Cabernet is not aging well. It's soft and simple, with the black cherry fruit flavors thinning out, letting hot alcohol show through.",84,Autry Cellars 2008 Tertian Harmony Red (Paso Robles)
Brachetto d'Acqui is a sweet sparkling red wine that would pair with chocolate-based desserts or savory foods such as sliced salami and cold cuts. This expression is packed tight with lively berry fruit.,85,Rinaldi 2009 Bricco Rioglio  (Brachetto d'Acqui)
"A wealth of oak and tannin marks the entry of this wine, a blend of 62% Malbec with 30% Merlot, 6% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot. It mellows on the midpalate, providing a more supple experience of baked plum, raspberry and coffee, finishing with a full-bodied flourish of vanillin toast.",89,Tyler Florence 2013 Blending Sessions Meritage (Sonoma County)
"Breathtakingly blossomy from nose to finish, this is textbook Mosel spätlese. On the palate, pristine white peach and apricot flavors are cut by a razor-edged streak of acidity. Shimmering minerality and a delicately filigreed sweetness linger.",94,St. Urbans-Hof 2013 Leiwener Laurentiuslay Spätlese Erste Lage Riesling (Mosel)
"This structured firm wine is full of tannins as well as ripe fruit. It is concentrated, showing smoky wood flavors as well as plenty of red berries. The wine will develop slowly, with the rich fruits coming through to give a generous wine. Drink from 2024.",94,Albert Morot 2015 Les Teurons Premier Cru  (Beaune)
"Accolades to the winery for holding this wine back longer than most wineries dare to. It's just beginning to soften and develop bottle nuance, but is still marked by ripe raspberries and cherries. It's really lovely now, with brisk acidity brightening the fruit, and should continue to mellow over until 2020.",90,En Garde 2009 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This is one of the better Temecula Valley wines in recent memory, with dried blackberry, leather, tar and condensed purple flowers on the nose. There's a kiss of herbs upfront on the palate, followed by layers of tangy boysenberry, caramel and salt and pepper flavors. The structure is apparent but not in the way, and the acidity is lively.",93,Lorenzi Estate 2013 Estate Grown Syrah (Temecula Valley)
"This meaty, oaky Sauvignon Blanc, with a trace of Semillon, is slightly bitter with grassy and lemony aromas and flavors coming to the fore.",84,Martin Ranch 2011 J.D. Hurley Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Clara Valley)
"Sophisticated and vibrant with chewy succulence and firm tannins, the top wine of this up and coming Bolgheri estate boasts plush concentration, a nice linear quality and generous aromas of black currant, cedar, licorice, green herb and toasted nuts. There's good complexity and personality here due to the wine's many aromatic nuances and deep layers of fruit. Drink after 2012.",91,Tenuta Argentiera 2004 Argentiera  (Bolgheri Superiore)
"Aromas recall overripe pear, tin, pineapple, grass and mineral. The lightly tropical flavors seem dilute backed by green apple-like acidity.",84,Zero One Vintners 2013 Copper Lily Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The wine shows many of the characteristics of the vintage; slightly overripe and plummy, not much definition and plenty of alcohol. On the palate, there is plenty of raisiny fruit is at the front of the palate, but little else and the wine is hot and a little unbalanced, and there is slight bubblegum aftertaste.",83,Ca'Romè 2003 Vigna Cerretta  (Barolo)
"Charred and oaky smelling at first, this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend transitions to caramel and marshmallow aromas as it breathes. Hard tannins pinch like a vise, while herbal dark-berry flavors show a note of juniper and green in front of a toasty, long, rugged finish.",88,Jordi Miró 2012 Ennak+ Red (Terra Alta)
"A fine red wine, full-bodied, tannic and spicy, with juicy berry and tobacco flavors. The jug-shaped bottle is one of the cutest in California.",87,Martin Ray 2009 Red Red (California)
"A blend of six varieties, this is a perfumed wine, with flavors of wood aging to go with the yellow fruits. and a soft, rounded mouthfeel.",86,Quinta das Maias 2010 Branco White (Dão)
"Slightly stalky, roasted aromas of earthy plum and berry lean in the direction of compost. This feels light and somewhat hollow, but easy. Stalky, oaky flavors of tree bark and rooty berry fruits carry onto the finish of this slightly herbal crianza.",87,Bodegas Franco-Españolas 2011 Rioja Bordón Crianza  (Rioja)
"The top wine from Château Chambert is huge and densely concentrated. It has a solid, black fruited feel to it along its immense tannins. It's richness has given its structure a sweeter almost jammy finish. The wine will certainly age many years.",92,Château de Chambert 2009 Grand Vin Malbec (Cahors)
"While dry in style and subtle on the nose, this fruity fresh rosé offers loads of concentrated raspberry, melon and peach flavors. Light on its feet and imminently quaffable, it's an irresistible warm-weather sip at an approachable price.",89,Villa Wolf 2016 Pinot Noir Rosé (Pfalz)
"This is an attractive, soft blend of Arinto, Viosinho and Antão Vaz. With white fruit flavors and a warm, ripe texture, it's crisp, fruity and ready to drink.",86,Dona Maria-Júlio Bastos 2015 White (Alentejano)
"Plump, fleshy and colorful, which is really the most you should expect from an under-$10, cutely packaged wine like this. The variety is Tempranillo, and while it's sort of bulky and roasted, it offers a ton of soft blackberry aromas and flavors along with cassis and kirsch. Broad with some faux-butter flavors to the finish.",86,Vizorro 2007 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)
"A caramel note combines with soft yellow-fruit and spice flavors. It's rich and rounded, with hints of toast and orange jelly.",86,Domaine Christophe Camu 2010  Chablis
"This is a textural, bracing study in how to layer a Chardonnay. Green berries, apples, Asian pears, jicama, cucumber, wet stone and creamy lees flavors all combine seamlessly, placing the small percentage of wine aged in new oak in an appropriately light supporting role. Excellent length and perfect balance.",92,Lauren Ashton Cellars 2012 Reserve Chardonnay (Washington)
"Savory sage- and cress-like herbal notes mingle with ripe pear and yellow plum fruit on the nose of this winie. The palate delivers that rich fruit in a slender frame, making for a juicy, refreshing experience.",89,Steininger 2016 Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"Herbal, green aromas suggest bell pepper and salad. This feels jagged, with zesty acidity and hard tannins. Flavors of herbal berry are pushed by racy acids, while the finish offers tobacco, green notes and a healthy-feeling fade.",87,Apaltagua 2009 Grial Carmenère (Apalta)
"Amfora's copper-ornage color is completely unique in the wide world of contemporary wine. There's a luminous brightness to the wine's appearance that defies its many years of age. Matured in clay amphorae, this pure expression of Ribolla Gialla delivers a softer approach than Gravner's Breg (a white blend) and amazingly intense aromas of resin, pine nut, caramel, graham cracker and candied fruit. Firm structure and determined flavors mark the long close. You can drink it now or hold 10 more years.",94,Gravner 2005 Amfora Ribolla Gialla (Venezia Giulia)
"Layers of wet stones and smoke pervade this dry, deeply mineral wine. It's full in body, yet gossamer in mouthfeel and marked by searing lemon-lime acidity. Tightly wound still, it's a structured, complex wine likely to improve after 2018.",90,Prinz Salm 2013 Felseneck Wallhausen Trocken GG Erste Lage Riesling (Nahe)
"Novelty Hill's estate-grown Cabernet Sauvignon displays notes of brambly berry and plenty of barrel spice. The sweet-tasting spice accent rolls into streaks of licorice, earth and herb on the peppery finish.",89,Novelty Hill 2009 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The Beckett brothers' 50-50 blend of Tempranillo and Zinfandel is one of their top wines, and it lives up to its reputation, with plump black cherry, baked plum and campfire aromas. The palate is softly layered with chalky tannins that carry waves of berry-powered acidity as well as savory notes of teriyaki, chocolate ganache and minty freshness on the finish.",90,Chronic Cellars 2013 El Perfecto Red (Paso Robles)
"Basic aromas of apple and melon feed into a solid round palate with good acidity. Salty flavors of popcorn and tropical fruits finish flush, balanced and with notes of melon and papaya.",88,Ossian 2015 Quintaluna Verdejo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)
Citrus and match-stick aromas are basic. This feels plump and a bit low on energy. Generic flavors of melon with peppery green notes finish with low acidity.,85,Sombras del Sol 2015 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Colchagua Valley)
"Despite being only medium bodied, this is a firmly tannic, structured wine. Subtle French oak scents of cedar and vanilla accent mixed berry fruit, while the finish is youthful, crisp and unyielding. This needs a minimum of two more years in the cellar. Drink 2018 through 2025.",90,Brokenwood 2013 Shiraz (Hunter Valley)
"This wine is beautifully rendered, with pear and melon backed by hints of citrus. The length, persistance, balance and tension are superb, and the mouth-puckering finish will have you reaching for another glass.",91,Anam Cara 2013 Nicholas Estate Dry Riesling (Chehalem Mountains)
"Gold in color, this sweet, spicy wine is full of ripe, opulent fruits and textures. Very honeyed, it exudes richness from the apricot and spiced orange fruits. It is delicious now, but will be so much better, so drink until 2022.",93,René Muré 2011 Clos Saint Landelain Vorbourg Grand Cru Vendanges Tardrives Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"There's a fleshy mouthfeel and a taste of green olive that make this Zinfandel atypical, but which add to its appeal. The varietal flavors show up in the form of ripe, robust blackberry, cola, tobacco and spice, while Napa's lovely tannins give it an elegant framework. Drink it over the next few years for maximum freshness.",90,Hendry 2009 Block 28 Zinfandel (Napa Valley)
"This is 68% Shiraz, 32% Grenache. Compared to the straight Shiraz, this is spicier, showing more leather, clove and pepper. It's still a full-bodied, rich wine, but maybe a bit less plush, with brighter acids.",92,Angove 2013 Warboys Vineyard Shiraz-Grenache (McLaren Vale)
"Clean and well made, but underwhelming. There's basic blueberry and blackberry flavors riding on a medium-bodied palate, but overall the wine is more generic than specific. It's easygoing and causes no red flags to go up, however at the end of the day it doesn't show much personality.",85,Rutini 2007 Trumpeter Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"This wine is soft and round, with attractive acidity as well as a light sense of structure from tannins. It features considerable acidity along with wild strawberry flavors that keep it lifted and aromatic. Drink from 2017.",91,Louis Latour 2012 Vignes Franches Premier Cru  (Beaune)
"A toasty nose of vanilla with a touch of grass leads this New York Chardonnay. Rich fruit flavors with a touch of sweet oak are appealing, if somewhat simple. Chilled with a plate of oysters on a warm night, this is a fun dinner choice.",83,Bloomer Creek 2006 Block 97 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"This is an eccentric wine, showing oaky flavors along with marzipan and oranges. It's quite dry and acidic, with a steely tang. But it seems tired and a little oxidized. Drink up.",83,Nobelle 2012 Belle Rivière Marsanne (Monterey)
"Produced by the Meursault-based Comtes Lafon, this smooth and creamy wine is beautifully poised between acidity and exotic yellow and tropical fruits. It is crisp, more about fruitiness and lively acidity subtly cut with minerality. The wine is ready to drink in its fresh and fruity state.",90,Les Héritiers du Comte Lafon 2013  Viré-Clessé
"This blend of Chardonnay and Gewürztraminer opens with pungent aromas of peppermint, dried apricot and caramel candy. Loads of honey and yellow fruit flavors follow on the palate, backed by a rich, almost chewy, consistency.",88,Ceralti 2011 Lunarae White (Toscana)
"Troon is going all in on Tannat, and this latest release—all estate-grown—marks a dive into natural winemaking. That means hand-picked, foot-stomped, native yeast and no additions during fermentation. Smooth, almost burnished to a fine gloss, this has dense fruit flavors of blueberry, boysenberry and blackberry. A dark streak of espresso, graphite and charcoal adds extra weight and length.",90,Troon 2014 Estate Tannat (Applegate Valley)
"Fresh cracked peppercorn, dense black and purple fruit and a cedar tone carry through the nose of this lavish yet nuanced bottling from a South Coast winery that practices extended aging before release. The elderberry fruit is hung on a strong tannic structure, bolstered by woody cigar box, incense, juniper and espresso flavors.",90,Gershon Bachus 2009 Erato De Portola Trail Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Temecula Valley)
"Tasty but mild cherry and cinnamon flavors framed in a smooth texture make this full-bodied wine easy to enjoy. Hints of cranberry and clove add complexity, while a good structure of mild acidity and fine tannins add a little grip on the palate.",91,Maggy Hawk 2014 Jolie Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"This is a structured wine, firm with tannins as well as bursting with ripe red fruits. Its acidity is well integrated into the rich fruitiness. It could well age for another few months, so drink from 2016. Jean-Yves Perraud, the fifth-generation winemaker, uses old vines on sandy granite soil for this wine.",88,Domaine de Foretal 2014  Beaujolais-Villages
"Scents and flavors suggest cherry pipe tobacco, along with streaks of dried leaf and lemon oil. It's a rough and tumble, every day red, with some chewy tannins.",86,Cliff Creek 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Southern Oregon)
"Rippling layers of candle wax and honey lend roundness and richness to this spry, citrusy Riesling. A late-release bottling, it offsets fresh, concentrated tangerine flavor with dusty spice notes and a delicious mineral oil sheen. The finish is long and quite dry.",94,Matthias Müller 2012 Alte Reben Bopparder Hamm Feinherb Riesling (Mittelrhein)
"Done in a svelte style, with modest alcohol and zippy acids, this delivers crisp fruit flavors of apple, pear and nectarine. About 20% was fermented in neutral oak, the rest in stainless steel.",90,St. Innocent 2013 Freedom Hill Vineyard Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley)
"Viognier is clearly a strong suit at Cowhorn, a biodynamic vineyard and winery in the Applegate Valley of southern Oregon. The aromatic nose is wreathed in seductive scents of flower and fruit. Flavors are a mix of citrus and stone fruits, with a taste of honey that brings added depth, but not sweetness.",93,Cowhorn 2011 Viognier (Applegate Valley)
"Root beer, cola nut, black cherry, black raspberry and anise seed combine for an exciting nose on this bottling from a winery near Morgan Hill. The mouthfeel is full, with graphite and lively fennel-bulb spice mixing with blackberry fruit and an earthy elegance on the pleasing palate.",90,Clos LaChance 2012 Murphy's Choice Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Shiraz has aromas of cherry and green pepper. Minty tones and a touch of green pepper hold sway over flavors of cherry and cranberry, continuing into the cool, peppery finish.",87,Titora 2010 Petitora Red (Judean Hills)
"This estate is right in the south of the Vinho Verde. That gives the wine extra weight, with added richness from the Avesso grape. The aftertaste brings in crispness.",88,Solar de Pinheiro 2009 Avesso White (Vinho Verde)
"The Indelicato family's vineyard is basically the entire appellation. This hearty blend of Syrah, Grenache, Petit Verdot and Viognier shows it off well, with fruit-driven aromas of grape juice, grape seeds, olallieberries and sandalwood. The palate shows decent structure as well as blackberry fruit, dried oregano, beef jerky, peppercorn and sanguine flavors.",90,Diora 2012 Three Crowns Single Vineyard Red (San Bernabe)
"Heady aromas of honeysuckle, orange blossom and yellow stone fruit lead the nose on this lightly sparkling dessert wine. The bright palate offers yellow peach, apricot and candied citrus zest alongside a foaming mousse.",87,Cà Bianca 2015  Moscato d'Asti
"This opaque, thick-looking wine opens with crusty, toasty aromas on top of an array of ripe berry notes. This is a blocky, saturated blend with flavors of herbs, tomato sauce and salt. A solid feeling finish with mild heat and burn is the lasting impression.",87,Melipal 2010 Malbec-Petit Verdot-Cabernet Franc Red (Mendoza)
"This concentrated, herbal wine has a good balance between the great fruit and the tangy, zesty texture. With its fruity character and spicy aftertaste, it's already a pleasure to drink.",87,Château le Grand Verdus 2016  Bordeaux Blanc
"There's just a touch of oak on this Chardonnay, enough to give it hints of smoke and buttered toast. The palate is dominated by flavors of tropical fruits, citrus, peaches and green apples, balanced with crisp lime-juice acidity. It's an elegant, dry Chard at a good price.",88,River Road 2012 Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"A multidimensional wine, this delicious example made from 130-year-old vines combines depth, breadth and length. It smells like ripe blackberries, tastes fruity and layered, feels luxurious and supple but at the same time firm in fine tannins and balanced by lively acidity. Medium to full bodied, it tastes great now and will improve through 2020.",94,Terra d'Oro 2013 Deaver Vineyard Zinfandel (Amador County)
"The flavor expression is neutral on nose and palate—there is however a seam of fresh, lemony acidity at the core and some of that lovely midpalate texture of Chardonnay. This is fresh and has backbone, drink soon.",89,Strauss 2014 Gamlitzberg Chardonnay (Südsteiermark)
"Deliciously fruity, with its apple and fresh grapefruit, this is a forward, ripe wine. It has a crisp layer of tight acidity that highlights the immediate attractiveness of the wine. Glass stopper.",88,Weszeli 2012 Langenlois Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"This is a wiry, scratchy wine with generic red-fruit and mild green aromas. A grabby, hard palate contains soft berry and plum flavors. A finish of carob, herbal notes and oaky spice is an adquate ending.",83,Príncipe de Viana 2011 Roble Tempranillo (Navarra)
"In almost any other producer's lineup, this would be deemed a success, but in the context of Rippon's exalted reputation, this is a bit of a disappointment. Ripe pear, melon and citrus flavors are off dry and marked by floral notes, finishing clean and mouthwatering, but don't have much of the expected complexity.",87,Rippon 2014 Gewürztraminer (Central Otago)
"Rooty, spicy and baked on the nose, with aromas that lean towards raisin. The palate is more gritty and acidic, with raisin, cola and spice flavors. Darkens up on the finish, which is long and peppery, with adequate juiciness and a final note of tomato.",86,Bodegas Franco-Españolas 2005 Rioja Bordón Reserva Tempranillo  (Rioja)
"Cherry and berry aromas are standard and good. Feels a bit edgy and clipped, with slightly herbal red plum flavors accented by a lot of oak and pepper. Turns real spicy and hot on the finish.",85,Pulenta Estate 2010 La Flor Malbec (Mendoza)
"Thin, dilute, with a minty, unripe character, and hard-as-nails tannins.",83,Johan Vineyards 2007 Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Big, lush and tightly structured, with cola and mocha aromas along with serious black fruit power and brightness. A pure and delicious Malbec-Cabernet wine with the full allotment of berry character, cola accents, dark spice and clarity. Drink now through 2014.",92,Mendel 2007 Unus Red (Mendoza)
"With a little airing, this wakes up to reveal dark red cherries held in a taut and firm body that nonetheless has a generous core. There is some gentle grip and frank, firm acidity. It's a very honest wine without any baroque frills—but bags of forthright appeal.",90,Boeckel 2013 Les Terres Rouges Pinot Noir (Alsace)
"Half barrel-fermented and half done in stainless steel, this classy effort seems to overdeliver. It starts with good fruit, but the feeling is that winemaker Jessica Munnell did everything right, and maxxed out the complexity. It's a sensuous mix of grape and barrel, steel and butterscotch, with a lively, lingering finish.",91,Mercer Canyons 2013 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Expertly integrated aromas of black plum, vanilla cola, light clove, pralines and a touch of caramel cream show on the nose of this bottling by a Sta. Rita Hills producer that sourced from up north. Wild berries, red cherry and black raspberry pop on the palate, where an earthy tension of chipped slate meets with a baked goods richness.",91,Zotovich Cellars 2013 Grenache (Paso Robles)
"This is clean and brisk in lemony acidity, and it offers concentrated, complex flavors of honeyed pineapples, limes, oranges and mangoes. It's dry and finessed.",90,MacRostie 2011 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"Hints of smoke and toast add warmth to the fresh pear and blossom aromas. An easy-drinking blend of stainless-steel- and barrel-fermented wine, it's bright with fresh fruit, but it's lusciously textured on the palate.",86,Hosmer 2011 Chardonnay (Cayuga Lake)
"Lovely and fresh, this piles on flavors of Bosc pear, with the texture to match. It's a wonderful expression of the grape coming from the eastern Washington region, accented with lovely, delicate baking spices.",87,14 Hands 2012 Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Plump and round on the palate, this is a bit soft and lacking bite, but does offer a reasonably complex array of pungently herbal notes and melon and fig flavors. Drink now.",86,Twin Islands 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Made with organically grown Sangiovese grapes and without added sulfites, this offers aromas of blackberry, black tea and thyme. The juicy savory palate tastes of blackberry jam, raspberry and clove framed in smooth, supple tannins and fresh acidity. Drink soon to enjoy the succulent fruit flavors.",90,Tre Monti 2015 SoNo Sangiovese (Romagna)
"Tar, ink and rubber aromas dominate this Syrah's nose. Mouthfeel is thin and the palate is a bit hollow, with generic mixed-berry flavors plus a little earth. Finishes tannic.",82,Morandé 2001 Pionero Syrah (Central Valley)
"Shows classic Zinfandel flavors of exotic spices, ripe cherries and cola, red currants and an umami touch of bacon. The alcohol tastes high, the acidity feels low, and the finish is a little sweet with flavors of white sugar.",85,Bianchi 2010 Heritage Selection Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"Jadot's take on Burgundy Chardonnay is fruity and creamy. Juicy, intense acidity comes from the crisp apple and white peach fruits. A touch of wood aging softens the fruit and broadens the character of the wine. Drink now.",86,Louis Jadot 2013  Bourgogne
"A full load of berry fruit in the nose, black-currant flavors and extremely even balance. It features an attractive set of cherry and cassis flavors, and the heavy tannins that hit home on the long finish, while fairly starching, don't stand in the way of the overall pleasure it gives.",92,Clark-Claudon 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This wine has lots of fruit, a good dash of spicy oak, a very firm structure, and a great sense of depth and polish. It will be very tasty with a grilled steak or smoked brisket. While fun to drink now, it will improve through at least 2020.",91,"Nottingham Cellars 2013 Casa de Vinas, Micro-Lot Reserve Cabernet Franc (Livermore Valley)"
"This wine shows the chilly vintage in it's linear, focused palate. It has black cherry flavors, infused with notes of mushrooms and tannic green tea. The structure is elegant, but the wine is likely not ageable.",87,Trinchero 2010 Cloud's Nest Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder)
"This is an ancient 13th-century fortified castle with an impressive keep. The wine is more in a modern style, full of crisp fruits and with attractive balanced tannins. There is a smoky edge from the wood aging and intense black-currant acidity. Drink from 2020.",86,Château Fontesteau 2014  Haut-Médoc
"This wine was crafted by Napa veterans Bill and Dawnine Dyer, from grapes grown on the estate Coombsville vineyard. It defines the modern style of ripe, soft, luscious Napa Cabernet, yet brings a firm structure that suggests the cellar. Give it 6–8 years, and it could still be going strong at the age of twenty. A mere 75 cases were produced.",95,Sodaro 2009 Doti/Sodaro Blocks 2 and 6 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Unusually complex for a wine in this price range, marrying grilled peaches with hints of toasted hazelnut and bacon fat, and wrapped in a layer of cedary, vanilla-scented oak. Medium-bodied, with a long, subtly oaky finish.",90,Chateau Reynella 2005 Chardonnay (McLaren Vale)
"This light-footed Sauvy is opens with attractive aromas of green melon, fresh-cut grass and lime leaf. The palate is bright and refreshing, with zippy acidity and a mouthwatering finish. Drink now.",87,Delaire Graff 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape)
"Minty oaky aromas include a strong whiff of clove and white gumdrop. A widegrabby chewy palate is a bit hot, while flavors of carob, mint and clove outweigh dark-fruit notes prior to a thick toasty heavily oaked finish.",86,Haarth 2012 Premium Selection Bonarda (Argentina)
"Light salmon in color, this has aromas of pineapple, passion fruit and tangerine. It feels tangy and zesty, with pithy, crisp flavors of citrus fruits and red berries. It's juicy, but not overly flavorful on the finish.",86,François Lurton 2011 El Albar Rosado Rosé (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)
"Light and earthy, with welcoming aromas of forest floor and black tea, this is a wisp of wine, delicate and soft, lightly spicy and enjoyable. Cherry and raspberry round out its profile, an elegant representation of Russian River Valley Pinot.",90,Chasseur 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Crafted principally from estate-grown fruit, this has the complexity and downright panache of a far more expensive bottling. Mixed brambly red fruits combine seamlessly, punching through to a lingering finish etched in minerals. What a terrific value!",91,Coeur de Terre 2014 Oregon Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"An unmistakable buttery, butterscotchy aroma makes this wine stand out from the pack. The flavors are also very buttery, with ripe pear, honey and nutmeg thrown in, while the texture is soft and body full. A good find for those who like lushness.",90,Darcie Kent Vineyards 2014 Hoffman Vineyard Chardonnay (Livermore Valley)
"This wine presents as elegant and remarkably earthy, laced in a distinct tartness of cranberry and citrus. Lighter styled, it is integrated in tannin and oak, allowing for a smooth texture.",89,Bucher 2014 Bucher Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This is a golden, mature and sweet wine that comes from the white wine appellation of the Madiran region. It balances ripe apricot and honey with intense acidity to create a beautiful wine. The zesty marmalade and final crispness are delicious. Drink now.",92,Château de Gayon 2009 Gouttes de Soleil  (Pacherenc du Vic Bilh)
"Ripe, dense and smooth from wood aging, this is a modern view of Margaux. At the same time, it shows a beautiful black-currant flavor from the Cabernet Sauvignon, and the Petit Verdot adds great color.",92,Château du Tertre 2010  Margaux
"Not very intense, the sharp citrus and chalky pencil shaving aromas are followed by minimal fruit flavors of barely ripe apple and stone fruit skin.",82,Abarbanel 2006 Estate Bottled Kosher Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
"With all of the fruit coming from Gamache Vineyard, this wine brings aromas of lees, butterscotch and butter. It's elegant in style with a lightly creamy feel and flavors that linger.",87,Three Rivers 2013 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Showing moderate body and made in a drier style, the wine offers a hint of earthiness that's followed by pretty melon, peach, herb and citrus flavors. Crisp and clean on the finish, with a toasty, fruity hint at the end. More complex than   many of the local Rieslings.",87,Anapamu 2001 Riesling (Monterey County)
"Dark and charred like so many of TerraNoble's red wines. There's lemon peel, black coffee, black fruit and herbs on the nose, while the palate shows tomato, herbs, smoked meat, basic black fruit and a snappy texture. A little more racy than most, but heavily oaked and blackened.",88,TerraNoble 2008 Gran Reserva Carmenère (Maule Valley)
"This bright, juicy red offers rose, dark berry, baking spice and new leather scents that mingle together in the glass. On the palate, crushed raspberry, wild cherry, licorice and clove notes are bolstered by chewy tannins and fresh acidity. It's delicious now but will reward a few more years in the cellar.",92,Cantina del Giusto 2013 San Claudio II  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano)
"The winery's first release of this variety offers aromas of apple, chamomile, spice and lees. On the palate, the green-apple acids are tart and bracing, needing some food to tame them.",89,Kerloo 2015 Celilo Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Gorge (WA))
"Rizzi's fresh and floral Moscato d'Asti opens with aromas of pressed flowers, citrus, stone fruit, honey and scented candle. The foamy bubbles feel great in the mouth and form a lasting impression of fullness and creaminess.",85,Rizzi 2009  Moscato d'Asti
"Savory notes of saffron and pressed apple are countered by heady blossom and honey on this elegantly balanced Riesling. The palate is unctuously fruity with flavors of sweet peach and hibiscus nectar, but cut with a shock tangerine acidity that reverberates through the finish.",91,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef) 2012 Berncasteler Doctor Spatlëse Riesling (Mosel)
"Raw oak, coconut and roasted coffee bean aromas carry over to the palate along with licorice and espresso but it lacks fruit richness. Astringent, grainy tannins clench the bracing finish.",85,La Bioca 2013 Lurens  (Barbaresco)
"A flabby nose of muddled citrus and bruised pear carries to the perceptibly sugary palate. This is a light and lithe Pinot Grigio, best enjoyed in casual settings.",82,St. Julian 2013 Reserve Pinot Grigio (Lake Michigan Shore)
"Still young and tight, this cassis-laden wine has a softness, complemented by herb and dusty tannin. As it opens, more ripeness comes to the fore, almost like grenadine, with a braised meat streak to the aroma.",87,Aiken 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"This wine's most outstanding quality is the elegant and delicate manner with which the bouquet slowly reveals itself. This vineyard-designate wine is a traditional blend of Sangiovese and Canaiolo, opening with subtle aromas of red cherry, dried violet, moist earth, vanilla and cured meat.",92,Lungarotti 2007 Rubesco Riserva Vigna Monticchio Red (Torgiano)
"This is a herb-driven, savory and relatively light Syrah, with crushed thyme, marjoram and black peppercorns spicing up the elderberry jam aromas. The chaparral spices take center stage on the sip, where wild sage and oak forest undergrowth play against the dark fruit. Very quaffable.",89,Municipal Winemakers 2014 Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"This linear white opens with delicate aromas that recall citrus blossom, citrus peel and orchard fruit. The racy palate offers green Anjou pear, lime and a note of bitter almond alongside a backbone of firm acidity.",87,Montecappone 2014 Mirizzi  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico)
"Reduced oak makes for an intense beginning. Then spicy acidity and plenty of earthy loam provide varietal character in this medium-bodied, textured wine.",87,Director's Cut 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"On the nose, this Cabernet-led blend deals telltale Chilean aromas of herbs, pepper, spice, berry, tomato and forest floor. Derivative of a cool year, the palate feels tight, with snapping acidity. Hard-hitting acid-driven flavors of spiced berry and black currant finish dark, toasty and oaky, but pulling. Drink through 2025.",91,Undurraga 2013 Altazor Red (Maipo Valley)
"All stainless steel fermented using Dijon clones. A clean, delicate style, but with an elegant touch and nuances of honey, clove. Very well balanced and textured, with a light but long progression of flavors.",88,Paschal 1999 Chardonnay (Rogue Valley)
"Densely rich, very sweet wine. It has some smoky tannins that give structure, along with a dark core of dry raisin and wood flavors. It has concentration and an opaque texture.",93,Château La Conseillante 2009  Pomerol
"This is a sophisticated and toasted expression of Pinot Grigio that offers thick tones of exotic fruit, apricot, butter, almond and butterscotch. The mouthfeel is creamy, soft and beautifully intense.",90,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano 2010 Sanct Valentin Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige)
"Impressively dry, medium bodied, very firmly tannic and showing complex fruit flavors, this Zinfandel-based wine needs time to mellow. It smells like fresh raspberries and blackberries, and tastes concentrated and mouthcoating, while the astringent tannins hold everything back just a bit. It contains 34% Syrah and 21% Petite Sirah, and will be best after 2018.",89,Golden 2012 Coro Mendocino Red (Mendocino)
"A blend of 58% Merlot, 18% Cabernet Franc, 11% Malbec, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 3% Petit Verdot, this harmonious and well-balanced wine is ready to be enjoyed now. Dark, lush fruit tones of blackberry, boysenberry and plum are laced with enticing hints of licorice, menthol and cocoa, while notes of cigar box and leather hang on through the long finish.",90,De Toren 2011 Z Red (Stellenbosch)
This impressive wine is full of potential. Powerful wood flavors are currently masking the fruitiness of the wine. However the weight of fruit and the rich texture promise good long-term aging.,92,Château Smith Haut Lafitte 2013  Pessac-Léognan
"This is a fruity wine with lively acidity and a brisk, zingy character. Freshness shoots through the wine, making it lively with hints of yellow fruits. The aftertaste is crisp and ripe.",89,Chanson Père et Fils 2014 Premier Cru  (Montagny)
"Juicy at first, this wine begins to dull on the palate, offering not much in terms of flavor, with plenty of powerful tannin.",83,Owl Ridge 2012 Syrah (Russian River Valley)
"Dense and hearty, this has subtle aromas of stewed prune, espresso and French oak. The brawny palate offers blackberry extract, licorice, ground pepper and the heat of evident alcohol alongside tightly packed, close-grained tannins that leave an astringent finish. Give the tannins another year or two to unfurl then drink up before the remaining fruit dries up.",87,Le Bèrne 2011 Riserva  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano)
"Volatile and sharp, this well-aged (though current) release tastes of vanilla, maple syrup and cut tobacco. After lengthy aging (48 months) in 60% new oak, the wood flavors have taken over.",83,EdenVale 2007 Syrah (Rogue Valley)
"From this Southern California appellation, a spicy, rustic wine that's very dry and full of charm. Flavors of wild berries are strong and tannins are supple. It's not very varietal, but it's a nice, friendly wine.",84,Mount Palomar 1999 Syrah (Temecula)
"While the nose is shy at first, the palate reveals abundant red and green apples, with some juicy yellow pear around the edges. Texture and structure strike a balance with the lovely, clean fruit. It's a delicious, textured, earthy Riesling made for food.",89,Ruhlmann 2014 Cuvée Jean-Charles Riesling (Alsace)
"This is a lovely, orange blossom special. Sweet and tart, penetrating and long, with lovely peaches, apricots and oranges lighting it up.",89,Trio Vintners 2006 Lewis Vineyards Riesling (Yakima Valley)
"This shows simple, candied raspberry and cherry flavors, with a nice spiciness. The mouthfeel is creamy and silky.",85,Pennywise 2011 Pinot Noir (California)
"Broadly fruity, with a palate of mixed red berries and cherries. Light and balanced, this is well-made, of medium length, and ready to drink right away.",87,Lujon 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Peaches, red apples and a spray of fresh citrus come together on an earthy, textured and rounded palate that nonetheless is wonderfully light. These old vines give verve, concentration and lots of depth.",91,Arndorfer 2013 Von Den Terrassen 1979 Roter Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"Bursting with fruity aromas of peaches, peach ring candies and orange blossom, this is a fresh wine. Juicy mango and more peach unfold on the palate. The feel is thin and isn't able to compete with the intense flavors and aromas, while the finish is tart and saccharine.",83,Trump 2015 Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Monticello)
"The texture of this wine is dense and concentrated while keeping the fresh fruit and acidity well in balance. It has ripe blackberry flavors that offer great fruitiness. The firm background of tannin structure is balanced by a juicy, fruity aftertaste. Drink now.",91,Royal Oporto 2010 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port)
"This full-bodied, velvet-textured wine has an exotic aroma like a pine forest and tastes like a bowl full of blueberries. Ripe, almost jammy flavors coat the tongue, and vibrate with black currant on the finish. Fine-grained tannins give the texture lots of grip, and support the ripe fruit flavors so they stay dry and appetizing sip after sip.",92,Hoopes 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This is a fine wine with its old-gold character marked by the wood aging and just hints of fresh fruit. Caramel, spice and dried fruits dominate along with milk chocolate. The wine is smooth, balanced and ready to drink.",92,Blackett NV 20 Years Tawny  (Port)
"Pure, ripe strawberry flavors are pierced with acidity. The texture is soft, with a dry side. The raspberry acidity cuts right to the end.",89,Joseph Drouhin 2008  Chambolle-Musigny
"This red-label cuvée is made exclusively from estate-grown fruit. Lively and aromatic, it carries a streak of beetroot threaded through blackberry fruit. It's tight and tense, like a coiled spring, suggesting that some additional bottle age will help to open it up. The concentration is impressive, and the flavors continue on through a lengthy finish, with a suggestion of gunmetal as it subsides.",91,Le Cadeau 2015 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This is a big, ripe, oaky Pinot Noir. Considering how cold the vintage was, it was quite an achievement to produce such powerful raspberry, cherry and plum fruit flavors. The wine is dry, elegantly tailored and vibrant in acidity, and should peak by 2017.",91,Pali 2011 Windsor Oaks Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"The wine is ripe, still young with its fresh fruits and acidity. The elements are all there to produce a dark and dense wine that has fine structure. It's a complex blend of Alfrocheiro, Syrah and Touriga Nacional, all of which will allow the wine to age over a good few years. Drink this impressive wine from 2017.",91,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2013 Reserva Red (Tejo)
"The vineyards of this estate take their name from their hillside (Puy) position. The wine is still very young with its generous black fruits and acidity still bubbling with energy. With tannins in the background, it will be a wine that develops relatively quickly, certainly ready to drink by 2019.",87,Château Puy Rigaud 2015  Montagne-Saint-Émilion
"An attractive, red-fruited wine, lightweight with acidity and smoothed with wood. It is fresh, with coffee and black cherry flavors, now ready to drink.",87,Rozes 2008 Quinta do Pégo Red (Douro)
An unusual and wonderful blend of grapes has produced a simple and fruity wine. Touches of caramel broaden the crisp red berry fruits and bright acidity. It should be drunk now.,84,Château Coutinel 2014 Rosé (Fronton)
"Aromas of blueberry, baking spice and a whiff of leather lead the nose of this blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot. The firm palate offers black plum, raspberry and black pepper alongside smooth tannins. It finishes on a note of mouth-puckering sour cherry.",88,Tenuta Sette Cieli 2014 Yantra Red (Toscana)
"Cullen's Kevin John remains one of Margaret River's (and Australia's) benchmark Chardonnays. Scents of grilled peaches lead into flavors of pineapple, vanilla and smoke, but more importantly, the palate is balanced just right. It's not too broad, not too lean; not overly sharp, but not soft. The finish is long and harmonious.",92,Cullen 2009 Kevin John Chardonnay (Margaret River)
"The cold conditions of the 2011 vintage are evident on this hard, gritty wine with olive and tarry aromas. This feels rough and grating, with burnt, peppery flavors of olive and dried fruits. A tart finish with leaf and asphalt flavors fails to redeem the wine.",82,William Cole 2011 Columbine Special Reserve Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"This full-bodied red opens with aromas of ripe plum, vanilla and a hint of charred topsoil. The warm, chewy palate has flavors of ripe black cherry, licorice, baking spice and coffee bean while a note of bitter almond signals the finish. Drink through 2020.",89,Tenute Soletta 2010 Keramos Riserva  (Cannonau di Sardegna)
"As always, Loios is a bright and fruity wine that is ready to drink young. With peach, grapefruit and red apple flavors, it's a soft wine with a crisp streak. It is ready to drink now and will be better at the end of 2014.",85,J. Portugal Ramos 2013 Loios Branco White (Alentejano)
"This is made from 100% Cabernet grown in the St. Helena estate vineyard. The wine is exceptionally pure and delicious, rich in black currant, chocolate, black cherry and lots of toasty new French oak. The all-important tannins are exquisitely ripe and as fine as velvet. Nowhere near ready, this wine wants a good eight years in the cellar, and will gradually evolve through the mid-2020s, at the very least.",95,Venge 2011 Bone Ash Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Different vintages favor different sites, and this Goosepen Block offering, though perfectly made, is not quite as dense the other vintage offerings from Sokol Blosser. A wash of milk chocolate surrounds raspberry and cherry fruit. Smooth and supple, with a streak of cola and red licorice, it fades gently into a finish tinged with flavors of clay.",90,Sokol Blosser 2012 Goosepen Block Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Lemon and herb aromas suggest a lean, crisp wine but the flavors are fairly ripe and the texture is rich and soft. Appley, floral and not at all tart, this is pleasant to sip.",85,Gnarly Head 2013 Authentic White (California)
"Very few wines present such intense florality as does this bottling that smells like a potpourri sachet, full of dried violets, dried lavender and eucalyptus, with touches of dust, chipped slate and black plum. Those flowers carry to the palate as well, where lavender, blossoming thyme and green peppercorns show.",93,McIntyre Vineyards 2014 Block 3 Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Pungent jasmine and orange blossom take hold of the nose right away, ensuring that this won't be one of those flavorless Pinot Grigios to forget. On the palate, roasted pear and slight toffee tones mingle with lemon-lime acidity, making this wine a nice fit for backyard gatherings featuring shrimp on the barbie.",86,Castle Rock 2012 Pinot Grigio (Monterey County)
"Nicely differentiated from the companion Stewart bottling, this Athena is a sharp and spicy affair, with tight, tart cranberry and raspberry fruit. Native yeast fermentation and extended sur-lie aging add some snap to the finish. Try after 2016 for optimum enjoyment.",88,Boedecker Cellars 2011 Athena Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Only disgorged in 2007, this fine vintage wine has preserved all its freshness. There are white fruits, pear juice, a crisp texture. They combine well to create a wine with considerable minerality, flinty, but full in the mouth. Age over the next 4–5 years.",93,Philipponnat 2000 Réserve Millésimée Brut  (Champagne)
"J. Lohr dives into the dark side of Pinot Noir, presenting a deeply hued wine with black cherries, slate and yeast on the nose. Licorice and blackberry power the palate with sage as the prevailing herb, all balancing out well despite the relatively high alcohol content.",92,J. Lohr 2012 Highlands Bench Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Penetrating veins of slate and smoke meander through crisp cantaloupe, lemon and lime in this elegant semidry Riesling. Racy and taut with acidity, the palate is punctuated by a lingering honey and steel finish. Drink now through 2025.",91,Maximin Grünhäuser 2015 Herrenberg Spätlese Grosse Lage Riesling (Mosel)
"Estate grown, crisp and nicely defined, with a pretty mix of apple, pear, peach and apricot flavors. The fruit is framed with citrus rind (orange and grapefruit) and keeps the wine tight and focused through a clean, lingering finish.",90,Hawks View 2009 Pinot Gris (Chehalem Mountains)
"Earthy and yeasty like baked bread, this wine is aged in both French and American oak with no toast, allowing light-bodied cherry and pomegranate to speak. A metallic tinge mars the finish.",83,Garnet Vineyards 2014 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Typical of early-maturing, Merlot-based wines from this vintage, this is rich, swirling with black-berry fruits and generous tannins. The fresh, almost crisp aftertaste is already attractive. Drink from 2019.",91,Château Dassault 2013  Saint-Émilion
"Showing some maturity in its dried fruit notes, this is neverhtheless an attractive heavyweight for near-term drinking. Chocolate fudge and prune notes pick up hints of cinnamon and dried herbs, then end long and softly dusty. Drink now–2020.",91,Sélection Laurence Féraud 2011  Gigondas
"This wine pops with aromas of blue and black fruit, vanilla, orange peel and cocoa. The palate is full of restrained, supple-feeling cranberry and cherry flavors that draw out on the finish.",91,Dunham 2011 Lewis Estate Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This young winery has made huge strides with its red wines, as this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon demonstrates. Young, tight, tart, and expressive, it takes the cranberry and cassis components from cool-vintage, cool-climate grapes, and turns them into a complete and complex wine. High acid, with well-integrated nuances of mushroom, earth, and smoke.",89,Airfield Estates 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley)
"When it comes to sheer extracted power, Zinfandel doesn't get more massive than this. Several things come together. Zin's wild, briary flavors of currants and raisins are here with fantastic concentration, along with notes of licorice, bitter dark chocolate and exotic spices. Howell Mountain's famously hard tannins co-star. The alcohol is high and heady, and discloses itself with jalapeño pepper heat. Not for everyone, but a great evocation of its style.",91,V. Sattui 2010 Black Sears Vineyard Zinfandel (Howell Mountain)
"After it oozes rubber and bacon on the nose, berry fruit and mild medicinal aromas settle in. Feels full, tight and structured, with meat, black cherry and wild berry flavors. Finishes warm, chocolaty and lightly roasted. Well-made, and impressive for the price.",91,Martín Berdugo 2008 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"A pert, savory Sauvignon Blanc, this is brisk with acidity. A tart gooseberry touch shines against a backdrop of pink grapefruits, peaches and limes. A bit of ripeness on the finish will pair well with Vietnamese fare.",88,Malk 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Lean red-cherry and briar scents lend an elegant tone to this brisk, medium-bodied Cabernet Franc. The palate is a shade riper, with black cherry and plum flavors, countered with hints of earth, green leaf and ripe but coarsely grained tannins that linger.",85,Wagner 2008 Estate Bottled Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes)
"This blend offers notes of nori, olive, cherry and tire rubber. The full-bodied flavors are sweet and palate-coating, with abundant savory notes and lightly grainy tannins.",88,Koenig Vineyards 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah
"So soft and sweet in fruity, chocolaty richness, it's almost like a Port, without the fortification, although the alcohol is a high 15.5%. The tastes are of melted chocolate and cherry pie filling, spiced with cinnamon, nutmeg, salt and pepper.",87,Pride Mountain 2006 Syrah (Sonoma County)
"Shows some pungent, aggressive Sauvignon aromas that verge on vegetal, then pulls back on the palate, where it develops flavors of melon and nectarine and a slightly creamy texture. This is nicely balanced and easy to like, with a long, nettle-y finish.",88,Groom 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills)
"This is rounded, rich, missing some acidity but with the compensation of ripe yellow fruits layered with pineapple and spice from wood. With all its sweetness, it is not for aging.",87,Domaine Faiveley 2009 Clos Rochette  (Mercurey)
"This glorious, evocative wine calls up a rich and sensuous catalog of scents and flavors. Black truffle, sea salt, clean earth, fungus, strawberry, liquid rocks, umami, tar...? the words pour out with each sniff and swallow. It's detailed, substantial and refined, gathering itself for a long, generous, captivating finish. Drink now through 2030.",97,Cayuse 2011 Widowmaker En Chamberlin Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (OR))
"Sand (sable) is indeed the color of this palest of rosés. The style is intense, as much wine as sparkling wine, flavored with raspberries and red currants, and some pear spice. It is definitely for food, with its acidity and fine freshness.",90,Aubry 2002 Sablé Rosé Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne)
"This is a mouthfilling, plush-textured, copper colored bubbly with hints of cherry and raspberry in the ripe flavors, firm acidity to balance them and tiny bubbles to keep it all lively. Made with 60% Pinot Noir and 40% Chardonnay, it finishes with a slightly sweet sensation.",90,Roederer Estate NV Brut Rosé Sparkling (Anderson Valley)
Lifted citrus- and pear-scented refreshment describes this wine's purpose. Zesty lemon peel balanced by lots of green pear fruit makes a winning combination.,88,Tinhof 2013 Neuburger (Burgenland)
"Vista Hills is in a sweet spot in the Dundee Hills, with neighbors including DDO and Domaine Serene. This puts the fruit front and center, a panoply of berries and melon, lightly edged with toast. Warm, forward and palate-friendly, it rolls into a finish with a hint of sassafras.",90,Vista Hills 2008 Tusculum Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"This ripe, fruity wine is developing a fine balance between fruit and structure. Its black currant flavors are bright, juicy and crisp, sustained by a core of dryness and delicious acidity. It will benefit from another year of age, so wait until late 2018 before drinking.",90,Château Larrivaux 2012  Haut-Médoc
"Pure purple aromas of boysenberry jam and Concord grapes swirl amidst melted dark chocolate, maple-drizzled bacon and touches of beef carpaccio on the nose of this bottling from a coveted vineyard. Starting with strong blueberry and blackberry fruit, the palate then sizzles with acidity through the fine-grained tannic structure. The midpalate shows meaty depth with roasting herbs and minty lift throughout.",94,Nicora 2013 Russell Family Vineyard Syrah (Paso Robles Willow Creek District)
"Pretty much as good as Paso Robles Syrah gets. Shows incredibly fine tannic structure and ripe, luscious flavors of blackberry and cherry pie filling, cola, cocoa, bacon and sweet, smoky sandalwood from oak barrels. Pull it back a little in fruit, and it's near perfect. Drink now.",91,Adelaida 2006 Reserve The Glenrose Vineyard Syrah (Paso Robles)
"Although this wine is labeled as dry, its honey and smooth apple character suggests a definite sweetness. Rich, full and concentrated, it brings in spice, ripe tropical fruits and just a touch of acidity at the end.",91,Château la Varière 2010 Clos de la Division Chenin Blanc (Anjou)
"Lusty and ripe, jam-packed with upfront raspberries and cherries. A little lacking in complexity, but likeable for sheer deliciousness.",87,Chanin 2009 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
This is an aromatic floral Torrontés with hints of air freshener and bath oil on the nose. A palate with zesty acidity frames crisp flavors of citrus pulp and peel. A racy finish tastes of lime before showing patented varietal bitterness.,87,Chakana 2016 Maipe Torrontés (Mendoza)
"Peachy, crisp aromas are mild but standard. It feels puckery and tight, with some spritz. Flavors of tangerine, orange and lemon are tangy but not sour, while the finish is long and chalky in feel. Drink immediately.",86,Arregi 2011 White (Getariako Txakolina)
"What stands out about Confluence most is its wealth of plush mushroom and woodsy earth accenting the otherwise rich, ripe, black cherry flavor. Powerful, it offers Anderson Valley's nuances, a dash of spice and bright acidity.",92,Goldeneye 2010 Confluence Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Very fresh, crisp and green, packed with the crispest apples and lime zest. The Colombard adds a perfume of warm apricot skins, while the acidity and weight come from the Ugni Blanc.",85,Château d'Aydie 2008 Aramis Ugni Blanc-Colombard (Vin de Pays des Côtes de Gascogne)
"A generous wine, this features intense dark fruits, ripe strawberry and an almost -weet character. It's packed with spice, richness and beautiful concentration. Great acidity gives a wine that is developing freshness and weight. Drink from 2020.",94,Louis Jadot 2013 Les Boucherottes Premier Cru  (Beaune)
"Aromas of cranberries, raspberries and herbs lead to broad rich flavors. The tannins bring a little astringency but it offers enjoyment.",86,Castle Rock 2013 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Quite the floral wine, with blueberry and violet aromas that distinguish it from others. But the palate is sharp and choppy, with high acidity that lends sharpness to the black cherry and raspberry flavors. Stirs interest because it breaks the mold of heavy, black fruit-dominated Syrahs. But it's also strange and not fully in gear. Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company, LLC.",85,Tamaya 2008 Reserva Syrah (Limarí Valley)
"A powerful and concentrated blend of Touriga Nacional, Syrah and Aragonez. Solid blackberry flavors give the wine strength, while tannins and hot pepper bring out bitterness and spice. It's not a wine for the faint-hearted.",85,Herdade da Gâmbia 2011 Red (Península de Setúbal)
"A spiced fruitcake note dominates this blend of Riesling, Seyval and Vidal Blanc, while a subtle note of button-mushroom cap adds dimension. A wine that tastes slightly off dry and feels easygoing, this offers a flavor of sliced green apples and pears dusted with sugar.",84,Veramar NV Tres Blanc White (Virginia)
"Bright aromas of raspberry and dried rose petals highlight this wine from the southwestern corner of the county, along with black tea, sage and shiitake mushrooms. The flavors are supple and elegant, with light strawberry, pencil shavings and sagebrush making for a fun, energetic wine that really lets the vineyard shine.",92,Sarah's Vineyard 2012 Reserve Pinot Noir (Santa Clara Valley)
"Another clean and tasty bottling from this label's numbered series, this shows light nectarine and lemon aromas on the nose. The texture is grippy and bright in acidity, offering crunchy Asian pear flavors that prove quite refreshing, with decent length.",91,Noble Vines 2016 152 Pinot Grigio (San Bernabe)
"Tasty and easy to drink, this has blackberry, black currant and cola flavors that finish seemingly sweet and oaky. It's an intense wine that doesn't seem likely to make gains with age, so drink up after an hour or two in the decanter.",87,Kunde 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley)
"This has the great aromatic complexity you expect from Rugiens. Generous and full textured, this is a full-bodied, rounded wine. Sweet red fruits, touched by spice, are well balanced with a streak of acidity. Wait for four years, at least.",94,Domaine de Courcel 2007 Les Rugiens Premier Cru  (Pommard)
"Like most California Tempranillos, this one's dry, acidic and rich in red cherry fruit, cola and beef jerky flavors. It's a pleasant wine, with a silky, light mouthfeel. Try as an interesting alternative to Pinot Noir.",87,Bella Luna 2008 Tempestuous Tempranillo (San Benito County)
"Aromas of cornbread, hay stack and tropical fruits are fairly standard for Chile. This feels round, with good acidity keeping things on an even keel. Flavors of melon and apple are a bit stalky, while oak flavors transition to mild bitterness on the finish.",87,Santa Rita 2011 Medalla Real Gran Reserva Chardonnay (Leyda Valley)
"This wine is creamy, lactic and jammy on the nose, with flat, earthy, baked berry aromas. It's grabby and sort of gummy and soft feeling, with lactic strawberry and plum flavors that set up a creamy, sticky finish.",83,Picos Pardos 2010 Garnacha Fusión Red (Calatayud)
"This has a dark-smelling nose that's a commingling of char, licorice and bitter chocolate scents. Espresso-like in its bitterness and pungency, the palate feels ultraslender, lacking vital extract.",82,Narmada 2009 Yash-Vir Red (Virginia)
"A nice, fairly rich wine made from this classic blend of two varieties. It's dry and crisp, with zippy citrus fruits made more complex with notes of peaches and pears and a touch of spicy vanilla.",86,Buttonwood Farm 2008 Devin Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Santa Ynez Valley)
"A little reticent and cool at first; patient airing allows it to open up and display raspberry, cola and herbal aromatics, followed by spicy black-cherry fruit. It's a very clean, pure, proper wine that will competently grace most dinner tables.",89,Shafer 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This smells roasted, leathery and earthy, with a mouthfeel that's solid if a bit scratchy. It delivers an intense wild-berry aroma and some of Cafayate's signature complex herbal character. Oaky vanilla and dill notes accent the finish.",85,Altos de San Isidro 2009 Reserve Barbera (Salta)
"Light and easy to drink, with just enough apple and lime to keep things interesting. Makes a fine apéritif.",84,Barone Fini 2002 Pinot Grigio (Valdadige)
"Eighteen months in wood plus long bottle aging have produced a serious, dense and rich wine. It is perfumed and dark, certainly ready to drink, full of black fruits and hints of wood. There is a dark core of solid tannins surrounded by the generous fruits. Drink now.",91,Quinta de Lemos 2008 Touriga Nacional (Dão)
"This is a wine that tastes of the wild herbs and pines that surround the vineyard. It is spicy, perfumed with the contrast of the crisp green fruit. Low-yielding vines have produced a wine with concentration and plenty of tangy citrus and lime zest. Drink now.",87,Château Rimauresq 2016 Cru Classé White (Côtes de Provence)
"Earthy aromas of leather, coffee grounds and blackberry are convincing. This feels full and ripe. Toasty plum and blackberry flavors offer notes of licorice and toast on a long, balanced finish.",89,Chilcas 2012 Reserva Syrah (Maule Valley)
"A dark, rich, ripe Syrah that defines the California style, and preserves the fine structure that this cool-climate region lends to red wines. The wine is dry and tannic, and the flavors, of blackberries, cherries, blueberries, dark chocolate and sweet, smoky oak, are just delicious. Now and for a few years.",92,Hahn 2007 SLH Estate Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands)
Aromas of pear and yellow apple are at the fore. It drinks off dry with full feel. There's enjoyment to be had but the varietal is hard to discern.,83,Westport Winery 2013 Shorebird Conner Lee Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A round, full-bodied wine that goes for the generous, opulent fruity aspect of red Burgundy with its big, blowsy red fruits, just kept in check by tannins. The acidity is lively and fresh, keeping pace with the intense vibrant fruits. Screwcap.",93,Jean-Claude Boisset 2005  Chambertin
"Pretty good Merlot, with varietally correct scents of black cherries and mocha leading into flavors of blue and black fruits. It's medium in body, with ample fruit and hints of chocolate and coffee on the finish.",87,Hugh Hamilton 2008 The Ratbag Merlot (McLaren Vale)
"Definitely on the ripe side, this aged Cabernet offers aromas of green pepper, chocolate, vanilla bean and black cherry. It delivers a pretty, modern approach and a nice, gritty texture in the mouth.",86,Falchini 2001 Campora Cabernet Sauvignon (Toscana)
"Waxy to the max, with baked apple, dry spice and plenty of oak on the bouquet. Thick and mouthfilling in terms of texture, with creamy melon and sweet apple flavors. Turns pithy, stalky and bitter on the finish.",84,Ricardo Santos 2010 Sémillon (Mendoza)
"This is a young, wild and dense wine, intense in oak and strong-willed red cherry and strawberry fruit. Full-bodied and still smoothing out its rough edges, the big tannin structure should allow a length of aging through 2020.",90,En Garde 2012 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This opens with aromas of ripe black plum, tilled soil, blue flower, leather and game. The palate is still very tight but offers black cherry and bitter prune accented by notes of black pepper, clove, graphite and nutmeg. It's all supported by a backbone of assertive tannins. Drink after 2019.",90,Terredora 2009 Pago dei Fusi  (Taurasi)
"Dry and hot, with a brittle feeling in the mouth, like chewing on plastic wrap. Shows Lifesaver candy flavors of sour cherries, oranges and raspberries, finished with a hit of tart acidity. Drink now.",85,Hearthstone 2008 Pinot Noir (Paso Robles)
"This has a fruit-filled bouquet of black cherry and ripe peach. Flavors of cherry, blueberry, leather and smoke linger on the palate, and soft tannins make way for a smooth smoky finish.",89,Clos de Gat 2015 Chanson Rouge Red (Judean Hills)
Dark color and a severe tartness make this wine challenging on the palate. It's overripe in terms of tropical fruit and bogged down by a sourness that's hard to shake. Let it open and pair it with creamy foods like goat cheese to get it to behave.,84,Envy 2013 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Calistoga)
"A vivid coral color, aromas like cotton candy, and floral, jammy flavors make this wine tasty. It is light in body and lightly sweet, with a soft, bubbly texture.",87,Ca' Momi NV Ca' Rosa Sparkling (California)
"Mostly Merlot, with Syrah and Cab Franc filling in the rest, this pleasant, everyday red has forward, clean, but simple fruit flavors. It adds light streaks of vanilla, cut leaf, and a suggestion of moist earth. A good companion for a simple burger.",86,Murphy's Law 2008 Red Red (Yakima Valley)
"Made with grapes from 50-year-old vines, this has a lush veneer of caramelized cherry lavished on top. Aromas include blueberry, leather and exotic spice; it's hard to imagine what to pair this sweet wine with other than aged cheeses.",87,Vigne & Vini 2004 Chicca  (Primitivo di Manduria)
"Seemingly light and elegant, this conveys the cherrylike, cinnamonlike flavors and vibrant balance that Pinot should. It is actually medium to full-bodied, quite smooth but with a touch of acidity to keep it appetizing. This could well improve with age, considering its great balance. Best now–2019.",88,Davies 2012 Ferrington Vineyards Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"This barrel selection has long been Signorello's best Chardonnay, and it still is. It elevates Napa Valley, not the most natural home to Chardonnay, to its finest expression. Earthy but complex, it has intricate citrus, tropical fruit and oak flavors, as well as a firm minerality. Drink now.",93,Signorello 2009 Hope's Cuvee Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Vincent Couche has a specialty with very dry Champagne. This wine, with some bottle age, is rich, warm and generous, yet quite dry. A touch of toast adds complexity to ripe apple fruits.",88,Vincent Couche NV Perle de Nacre Extra Brut  (Champagne)
"Light in color and texture, it offers inviting perfumed violet aromas before weavings of raspberry and just-ripe cherry take over on the palate. Approachable and easygoing, a wine to enjoy now.",88,Trueblood 2012 Pinot Noir (Carneros-Napa Valley)
"Oak extract dominates the nose on this wine together with aromas of Golden Delicous apple and lemon zest. The palate offers lemon, oak, vanilla and clove, but it lacks the fruit richness needed to support the oak.",87,Elena Walch 2011 Beyond the Clouds White (Alto Adige)
"A light, fruity and fresh wine, it shows attractive black currant fruits. With just a touch of Cabernet Franc to give perfume, it is well balanced with tannins underlying the juicy fruit and acidity. Drink from 2016.",86,Château Tour Canon 2011  Canon-Fronsac
"Showing tightly crisp grapefruit and citrus flavors, with an intense dryness and acidity, this is classic Muscadet, fresh, very bright and green.",86,Domaine de Beauregard 2009  Muscadet Sèvre et Maine
"Made entirely with Petit Verdot, this opens with aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit and cooking spices. The straightforward palate shows black currant, vanilla and nutmeg alongside firm tannins. Enjoy soon.",88,Terre di Talamo 2012 PerCecco Petit Verdot (Toscana)
"The prestige cuvée from La Gordonne is full and rich, packed with raspberry and red plum fruit. As a balance, there is a taut, crisper side to the wine, leaving a bright lemon zest aftertaste.",88,Château la Gordonne 2011 La Chapelle Gordonne Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"From vines close to the Sainte-Victoire mountain, the wine is crisply textured, with tangy red currants. It is a bright stylish wine, finely balanced and lifted with acidity and fruitiness. Drink now.",88,Domaine Sainte Lucie 2016 MiP Made in Provence Classic Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Fully mature, this mouthfilling, supple Shiraz shows off Clare's savory side, beginning with beefy notes of bouillon and soy, then adding leather coffee and black olive to the mix. The long finish gracefully blends sweet and savory, then adds a dusting of fine tannins to keep everything in place. Drink now–2015.",91,Wakefield 2002 St. Andrews Shiraz (Clare Valley)
"From a single vineyard, this wine has structure and dense tannins. It is still young and the lean stalky character needs time to open up. Look for the black currant fruit to become richer over the next year and drink from 2017.",86,Quinta do Casal Branco 2014 Quartilho Tinto Red (Tejo)
"Comes down firmly on Zin's wild and wooly side. The brambly berry and pepper flavors are accompanied by savage tannins, not big and heavy, but jagged and rustic. High alcohol creates a hot aftertaste, and the wine is fermented to dryness. Finishes with a tart bite of acid.",86,Stonehedge 1999 Zinfandel (Napa Valley)
"This is a firm wine with solid tannins as well as layers of juicy black currant and cherry fruits. Acidity and a good sense of structure are still developing, meaning the wine needs to age longer. Drink from 2018.",90,Château de Lescours 2012  Saint-Émilion
"Nearing four years of age, this Pinot is delicious to drink now. It's mellow and silky, with just enough acidity to give the raspberry and red currant flavors zest. This is Waterstone's most complete Pinot Noir in many years.",89,Waterstone 2009 Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"Tasted blind, this wasn't particularly different from the other Rieslings in its flight, which were predominantly South Australian. It's got those same wet stone and citrus tendencies and is made in the same medium-bodied, dry, high-acid style. There's a touch of pineapple as well, plus a long, dry crisp finish.",90,Leeuwin Estate 2015 Art Series Riesling (Margaret River)
"A super-structured, incredibly textured Syrah from the Sierra Foothills, this is Bill Easton's best of the best lots, aptly named Ascent, that he puts out every year to showcase his deft handling of age-worthy Syrah. This one will continue to develop its earthy, dusty, bacon fat and cigar box qualities over time. A truly beautiful bottle of wine.",94,Domaine de la Terre Rouge 2008 Ascent Syrah (Sierra Foothills)
"This big, jammy Syrah from the Maipo Alto is typically leathery and spicy smelling. The body on this wine is fat and weighty, while flavors of buttery oak and spiced berry meld together if given time in the glass. On the finish, this is oaky and herbal tasting, with a creamy feel.",88,Viña Pérez Cruz 2010 Limited Edition Syrah (Maipo Valley)
"The ancient vineyard of Tour Carnet, first planted in the 15th century, is into a renaissance. This wine, which showed too many tannins when in barrel, is now coming to life. The balance, the acidity and the seductive perfumes promise plenty. So does the structure, just hinting at bitterness, a function of its youthfulness. Keep for 5–8 years.",91,Chateau La Tour Carnet 2004  Haut-Médoc
"Made entirely with Trebbiano di Soave, this vibrant white offers enticing aromas of white flower and citrus blossom. The linear palate delivers juicy yellow peach, pear, kiwi and mineral alongside firm acidity.",91,Suavia 2012 Massifitti Trebbiano (Veronese)
"Here's an exceedingly friendly and approachable Barbera d'Asti Superiore with compact and clean aromas of mineral, tart fruit, hazelnuts and wild mushroom. The mouthfeel is fresh and there's a touch of sweetness here that offsets the sharpness of the natural acidity.",87,Alfonso Boeri 2007 Martinette  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore)
"Mature plum, aromatic herb and a whiff of cocoa lead the nose. The dense palate offers toasted oak, blackberry extract and espresso alongside fine-grained tannins that leave a firm, drying finish.",87,Caruso & Minini 2012 Cutaja Riserva Nero d'Avola (Delia Nivolelli)
Good balance and slightly lean fruit and spice flavors make an agreeable combo in this medium-bodied and nicely tangy wine. Whiffs of cinnamon and earth go with cherry and rhubarb flavors.,86,Peltier 2014 Hybrid Pinot Noir (Lodi)
"With 58% Mourvèdre, 20% Syrah, 20% Grenache and 2% Counoise grapes from the dry-farmed, head-pruned Old Oak Vineyard (formerly Sheep Camp Creek), this wine shows dried black cherries, pencil lead, uncrushed cloves and nutmeg on the nose. The palate is flatter, with cooked cherries as well as other dried purple and red fruits.",88,Lone Madrone 2013 Oveja Negra Red (Paso Robles Willow Creek District)
"Graciano is just getting started in Washington but this bottle shows much promise. It's aromatically generous, with notes of coffee and heaping amounts of black pepper along with citrus twist. The palate is silky soft in feel and shows elegance and restraint that keep you coming back for more.",92,Pomum 2011 Reserva Graciano (Snipes Mountain)
"Initial medicinal notes of cherry cough syrup partner with scents of cherry Jolly Rancher and red rope licorice. The smooth, slick palate feels overdone, offering more of those sweet red-fruit flavors, but it finishes fast.",81,L'original French Kiss NV Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de France)
"Made with 80% Nero d'Avola and 20% Syrah, this opens with aromas of mature black-skinned fruit, toast, leather and Oriental spice. The firm palate offers ripe black cherry, raspberry jam, vanilla and oak-driven spice alongside fine-grained tannins.",89,Zisola 2012 Doppiozeta Red (Sicilia)
"This terrific Rosato represents a dynamic blend of Pinot Nero, Lagrein, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. It opens with a bright pink color, a dry mouthfeel and spicy after notes of dried raspberry, cherry and cinnamon stick.",87,Kellerei Kaltern Caldaro 2011 Signé Rosato (Vigneti delle Dolomiti)
"Reduced aromas of cassis and blackberry come with a whiff of wet dog. This foamy sparkling red is heavy on the palate, without much delicacy. Black cherry and boysenberry flavors are candied but not cloying, while a foamy, blocky finish is fruity yet ponderous due to low acidity.",85,Bocopa NV Marina Espumante Gran Selección 10° Monastrell (Alicante)
"Powerful and structured, this has dense tannins that will always be an important part of the wine. The juicy, fresh fruit gives a perfumed character to the wine and brings out acidity as well as the dry texture. It needs to age, so drink from 2018.",87,Château Lalaudey 2012  Moulis-en-Médoc
"This affordably priced bottling is quite solid for the cost, showing deep black cherry, blueberry, cedar shavings, tobacco leaf and ash, cocoa and slight bay leaf on the nose. Chalky tannins show first on the sip, and then unwind to offer blackberry fruit, woody pencil shavings and a decent density.",89,Clos LaChance 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast)
"This blend of four varieties boasts notes of almond skin, orange zest and honeydew melon in a full-bodied, slightly warm wine. The long finish shows ample concentration and a hint of bitterness.",90,Domaine du Pegau 2013 Cuvée Réservée White (Châteauneuf-du-Pape)
"The floral and citrus-rind aromas are light, not yet fully showing themselves. The palate, in contrast brings a rich mouthfeel of fruit flavors, providing a lot of appeal.",88,Idilico 2015 Albariño (Yakima Valley)
"Ripe plum, spiced blueberry, cedar, toasted oak and tobacco are some of the aromas you'll find in this structured blend of 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon. The full-bodied palate delivers blackberries, black currants, clove, espresso, ground pepper and licorice while assertive but fine-grained tannins provide support. Drink 2016–2025.",92,Banfi 2010 Excelsus Red (Toscana)
"This opens with aromas of chamomile flower and ripe Bartlett pear. The lively easy-drinking palate offers green apple, white peach and a juicy citrus note alongside tangy acidity.",89,Andriano 2015 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige)
"Dry, soft and simple, with pleasant flavors of grilled cherries, raspberries, cola, red licorice, red currants and smoky oak. The texture is nice and silky. Drink now.",86,Calcareous 2007 Pinot Noir (York Mountain)
"Unfiltered and made in what the producer calls a traditional ancestral way, the wine is certainly intense and full of spice as well as fruit. The wine, with its tangy citrus and concentration, needs to age. Drink from 2018.",88,Hubert Brochard 2015 Aujourd'hui Comme Autrefois Non Filtré  (Sancerre)
"This Syrah is considerably lighter in body than you'd expect for a variety that's often heavy and full bodied. It has the silkiness of a Pinot Noir, and it's dry and complex in wild berry, leather, black pepper and cedar flavors. It shows lots of elegance throughout, and could even pick up bottle notes over the next six years.",90,Carr 2009 Morehouse Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Great vibrancy and depth lift this medium-bodied wine above the crowd. It nearly bursts with ripe and vivid fruit in the aromas and the flavors, bringing red and black cherry, hints of mint and fresh raspberry kicking in on the finish. Despite all that generous fruit flavor, it also maintains a taut balance via moderate tannins and firm acidity. It will be best after 2020.",94,Domaine Anderson 2013 Dach Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"This wine sources from both Montecillo Vineyard in Sonoma County and Georges III in Napa, bringing together one barrel of each for an herbal, savory and edgy experience. Cedar, clove and a healthy dose of fresh herb make it compelling in a classical sense.",90,Keating 2013 Encomium Cabernet Sauvignon (North Coast)
"This winery has made its mark over the years exclusively with blended wines, yet here is a single-varietal, single-vineyard offering. The aromas are expressive with notes of black cherry and high-toned herbs along with spice accents. The dark fruit and licorice flavors are tightly wound with a core of firm tannins and lively acids.",91,Brian Carter Cellars 2011 One Shaw Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"Some cedar and olives accent an earthy nose. Cassis and some cherry make up the pleasant palate, which features nicely integrated oak as a high point. Fairly long and drying on the back end, with ever-so-slightly prickly tannins.",90,Bell 1997 Baritelle Vyd Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"The aromas suggest notes of herb, vanilla, wood spice, plum and dark fruit. The palate is restrained in style, full of dark-fruit and barrel flavors and lightly grainy tannins.",90,Airfield Estates 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley)
"This wine is two-thirds Syrah with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese. Reticent aromas of vanilla, woodspice, cigar box and plum lead to elegantly styled fruit and barrel flavors that trail toward the finish.",88,Plumb Cellars 2012 Plumb Crazy Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Luminous and fresh, this opens with aromas of red berry, violet, chopped herb and a whiff of baking spice. The vibrant, linear palate offers red cherry, strawberry, white pepper and star anise alongside racy acidity and polished tannins. Enjoy through 2018.",90,Vignavecchia 2013  Chianti Classico
"There is only a handful of Kosher sparkling Proseccos out there, and this is one of them. Lively and bright, the wine shows citrus, stone fruit and dried hay aromas.",84,Banero NV Banero  (Prosecco)
"Dark ruby in the glass, this wine has a nose of lingonberry and pomegranate with a hint of pine needles. It offers well-integrated fruit and cooling herb flavors, notably blueberry, cherry, mint, tarragon, and fennel. Ultimately fruit reigns over coolness on the velvety finish.",90,Binyamina 2012 Yogev Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Samson)
"This is an excellent wine comprised of Sangiovese and Syrah from the Boushey and Candy Mountain Vineyards, and Cabernet from Stonetree Vineyard—all top-tier vineyards. Bright and generous, with plenty of toasty barrel flavors, it's highlighted with cut tobacco, citrus, herb and floral hints. There is an underlying minerality as well, making this one of Washington's most complex “Super Tuscans.”",92,Saggi 2010 Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"There is much of the perfumed character of Touriga Nacional in this wine that goes with the ripe, juicy black fruits and acidity. At this stage, there is a strong spice from the wood aging and this needs to soften before the wine will be ready to drink. Wait until 2018.",87,Adega Cooperativa de Borba 2014 Senses Touriga Nacional (Alentejano)
"A palate-pleasing combination of ripe plum and cherry fruit, gently applied baking spices, with a peppery bite and firm, focused tannins. Impeccable balance, with just enough ripeness to suggest ageworthiness.",90,Siduri 2010 Hawk's View Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Made from a blend of organically farmed Grechetto, Procanico and Sauvignon blanc, this charming single-vineyard selection offers up a floral fragrance of acacia flower accented aromatic herbs. The palate delivers ripe pear, mint and thyme flavors, with crisp acidity.",87,Sergio Mottura 2012 Tragugnano  (Orvieto)
"This widely available, bargain-priced tawny remains an Australian classic, offering toffee and walnut aromas and flavors along with dust-covered leather and just a hint of fresh fruit. It's lighter in weight than you might expect from a Port-inspired New World wine, but offers a tasty drop on a wintry evening. Imported by Pacific Wine Partners.",88,Hardys NV Whiskers Blake Classic Tawny Port (South Eastern Australia)
"Scratched lemon skin and sliced-apple aromas meet with a light petrol character on this nice and easy-smelling white wine. The palate starts slightly sweet then grows more so, showing flavors of orange soufflé and lemon syrup.",86,Fazeli Cellars 2014 Riesling (Temecula Valley)
"Ripe and forward, this is powered with a generous mix of Asian spices, brown sugar and ripe, plummy fruit. A whiff of cedar accompanies pleasing complexity as it weaves along to a full-throttle finish. Drink now–2020.",91,Aubichon Cellars 2012 Armstrong Vineyard Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge)
"Already the velvet texture is broadening out to give a wine that shows solid fruits, bright and sweet, never heavy, but with plenty of ripeness and polish. Inside this suave character, there is a core of tight tannins, promising medium-term aging.",91,Château Langoa Barton 2007  Saint-Julien
"Light and informal, this simple sparkler offers suggestions of candied citrus peel and yellow apple. Bright acidity refreshes the finish.",85,Lamberti NV Extra Dry  (Prosecco)
"This is a simple, fruit-forward Nebbiolo with ripe notes of strawberry and raspberry jam backed by light shadings of tobacco and spice. The wine shows bright acidity and clean, polished tannins.",87,Cascina Bruciata 2008 Usignolo Nebbiolo (Langhe)
"The best wine from this bodega. It's focused and spicy, with black fruit and depth to the nose and none of the weird, rubbery, roasted characteristics that are sometimes found in Uruguayan wines. Round on the palate, with black cherry and cassis. A good option for grilled meats.",87,Gimenez Mendez 2008 Identity Cabernet Sauvignon (Canelones)
"Firm and tannic, this is a dense wine. Its weight and richness promise a good future. It is juicy, full of red-cherry flavors and with plenty of perfumed acidity. The wine will be ready to drink from 2023.",93,Albert Bichot 2015 Aux Clous Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune)
"Fresh and lean as a sea breeze and tautly wrought in tense acidity, this memorable wine is bright and crisp. The palate shows earthy flavors met by subtle notes of black cherry and strawberry.",92,Metzker Family Estates 2015 Laurent Fort Ross Vineyard Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview)
"A strongly briary old vine Zin from Lodi that's strangely restrained, with a taste of just-ripe blackberries that delves into bacon fat and mocha before falling off a tad at the finish. Decent volume and body on this wine, which is priced fairly and probably fairly easy to find.",86,OZV 2008 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi)
"Grass and gooseberry are prominent on the nose and palate in this crisp SB, bright in dialed-high acidity. That sense of vibrant freshness mellows somewhat midway through the wine, allowing it to finish with a lushness on the tongue.",87,Coquerel Family Wine Estates 2012 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Calistoga)
"Made entirely with organically farmed Sangiovese, this opens with aromas mature black-skinned fruit, French oak, exotic spice and a whiff of blue flower. The vibrant palate is both elegant and structured, delivering juicy black cherry, pomegranate, mocha, licorice and a potpourri of cooking spice. It's well balanced, with bright acidity and fine-grained tannins. It already dazzles, but hold for even more complexity. Drink 2018–2028.",93,Fontodi 2013 Flaccianello della Pieve Sangiovese (Colli della Toscana Centrale)
"Aromas of berry fruit, wet cement and chewing gum struggle to make their case. This feels sticky and confected, while flavors of candied berry, mint and spicy oak finish with herbal notes and sweetness.",84,Bodegas Paniza 2015 Agostón Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon (Cariñena)
"90—92 Barrel sample. Dry botrytis is the theme here, with richness rather than sweetness. Somewhere under all that dryness is acidity and flavors of sweet pears, but these are a long way off.",91,Château Suau 2006 Barrel sample  (Barsac)
"Lightly herbal and light in body, with earthy aromas that include leather, tea and dried fruits. This is medium-bodied in style, with elegance. Problem is, there isn't much substance to it and compared to Chile's better Cabs, it pales in flavor and generosity. Also, the finish is kind of scratchy and thin.",84,Apaltagua 2007 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"Here's a simple but savory red that delivers fruity aromas and flavors of wild cherry, crushed strawberry and juicy raspberry. Vibrant acidity and soft tannins lend an immediate, easy-drinking quality.",86,Bartali 2013 Bozzetto  (Chianti)
"After you've had oceans of Chardonnay and don't think there's room for a drop more, along comes a wine like this to change your mind. It's not just the peach, pear and tropical fruit, or the honeyed, vanilla-scented buttered toast, or the oriental spices, or the clean acidity, or the rich, creamy texture. It's all of these together, in a balanced package.",90,Château Souverain 1998 Winemaker's Reserve Chardonnay (California)
"Here's a savory, delicious and varietally true Pinor Noir that drinks well right away, but has the structural integrity for the cellar. With crisp, dry flavors of cherries, pomegranates, cola, tobacco and Chinese five-spice, it appeals for its exotic immediacy, but has the density to evolve for 5 or 6 years.",92,Pessagno 2006 Lucia Highlands Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Crafted from six vineyards within the Dutton family's holdings, this is a pretty wine, smooth and supple with a balance of acidity and light body. Citrus and apple vie for attention with a slight tropical note and expansiveness of ginger cookie and toffee.",93,Dutton-Goldfield 2014 Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Grapes come from both the Knights Valley and Napa County for this wine, named by former model and Real Housewife Brandi Glanville. Bold as Brandi, it shows a hit of oak around thick waves of anise, vanilla and melon, ready for anything.",86,Unfiltered Blonde 2014 Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"Sweet and ripe while powerfully structured, this is a wine with the concentration for a long life. Solid tannins and ripe berry flavors come together into an intense and dense wine. The finish brings out just a hint of freshness.",93,Barros 2011 Quinta Dona Matilde Vintage  (Port)
"Plum and berry aromas are a touch prickly, as if there were notes of herbs and wild pasture infused into this Garnacha. Tight and drawing on the palate, this tastes of black fruits, chocolate and savory spices. A firm, tannic, rubbery-feeling finish maintains the wine's integrity.",87,Legado del Moncayo 2015 Old Vines Montaña Garnacha (Campo de Borja)
"This estate, owned by the same family since 1787, has amazing stocks of old sweet wines maturing in its cellars. With red apple, honey and apricot aromas, this wine, mature and yet so fresh, is proof of the aging ability of Chenin Blanc. It is the balance between the ripe honeyed flavors and the intense acidity that keeps it so vibrant. Drink this superb wine now.",95,Moulin Touchais 1996 Chenin Blanc (Coteaux du Layon)
"A light cedary, floral aroma starts this full-bodied wine on an interesting note, and similar flavor complexity continues. It feels nicely astringent on the palate, as fine tannins and good acidity keep it lively.",88,Andis 2013 Grenache (Amador County)
"From a small vineyard in Los Olivos, this wine offers boysenberry, lavender, rosemary and a touch of oak on the nose. Intriguing pine tar, bay leaf and eucalyptus resin show on the palate, which gives depth to the deep black fruit.",91,Bernat 2010 Eloquent Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Grapefruit peel, salty miso and white pepper create a savory and appetizing nose. The palate is slender and zippy, full of these spicy notes and enlivened by fresh lemon and green pear. It's a wonderfully easy but exciting Grüner: light but authentic, with lasting pepperiness.",90,Felsner 2016 Moosburgerin Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"This shows a bold and modern personality, with spicy oak tones behind bright notes of cherry, chocolate and chewy raspberry. It shows savory endnotes of pipe tobacco, leather and prune.",88,Poggio Nardone 2010  Morellino di Scansano
"This good, basic wine offers herb and cherry aromas, mostly crisp fruit flavors and a firm, tannic texture.",85,California Republic 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"This opens with textbook Nebbiolo aromas of new leather, forest floor, red berry, culinary spice and a whiff of blue flower. On the savory palate, taut, fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity support Marasca cherry, raspberry compote, star anise and white pepper flavors that should integrate after a few more years in bottle. Drink after 2022.",92,Pertinace 2014  Barbaresco
"From one of the rising stars in Beaujolais, this ripe wine has both a tense minerality and rich black fruits from vines that average 60 years. It is balanced between the very fresh acidity and a dry edge that will allow it to age. Drink from 2016. The vineyards are certified organic.",91,Richard Rottiers 2014 La Sambinerie  (Beaujolais-Villages)
"The blend is 37% Marsanne, 33% Grenache Blanc, 20% Picpoul and 10% Roussanne. Among McCrea's Rhône-inspired white wines, this is the most complete and complex. The stony, textural underpinning adds a lot of depth while the fruit mixes citrus and melon with hints of just-ripe green banana and papaya. It's a juicy yet subtle wine, with aging potential over the next half decade or so.",91,McCrea 2007 Boushey Vineyard Sirocco Blanc White (Yakima Valley)
"Aged for at least five years in the Lanson cellars before disgorgement, this is a blend of Grand Cru wines from the Côte des Blancs. It has signs of maturity in the hints of toast and almonds while showing a crisp, tightly mineral texture. It's a great food wine, very fresh with good depth of flavor. The acidity at the end is bright and refreshing.",93,Lanson NV Extra Age Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)
"Here's a lighter, less bulky expression of Recioto that opens with a dark ruby color and pretty aromas of wild berry and dark cherry. It tastes sweet and thick, ending with a slight tannic nod that is firm without being astringent.",87,Corte Sant' Alda 2006 500ml  (Recioto della Valpolicella)
"A blend of Sangiovese, Canaiolo and Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas suggesting mature dark-skinned fruit, toast, sunbaked earth and cooking spice. On the polished, straightforward palate, hints of clove, orange peel and anise back up a core of dried black cherry while close-grained tannins provide the framework. Drink through 2018.",88,Tenuta Cappellina 2012  Chianti Classico
"A powerful, impressive wine. It combines dark, brooding tannins and firm fruits with such an elegant structure and texture. Solid and full of juicy black-plum flavors, it finishes with dry yet voluptuous tannins.",92,Alain Brumont 2008 Château Bouscassé Red (Madiran)
"Aromas of dark berry, baked earth, game and forest floor come together in the glass. The palate offers ripe black cherry, crushed strawberry, mint, clove and white pepper alongside compacted tannins and fresh acidity. Give this another five or six years to unwind.",92,Michele Chiarlo 2011 Cannubi  (Barolo)
"Brisk acidity contributes just what this jammy wine needs. The white peach, tangerine, Meyer lemon and oak flavors have a honeyed sweetness that would be cloying without that tart finish.",87,Girard 2011 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Flinty at first, then becoming more perfumed, with hints of herbs and berries. This lovely rosé is round and ample in the mouth, delivering a blend of fruit, herb and mineral flavors. Nicely balanced spice notes mark the finish. Drink now.",91,Mas des Bressades 2010 Cuvée Tradition Rosé (Costières de Nîmes)
"Wild barnyard notes dance among the rich dark fruit and berry core. Garrigue and bramble accents add more character to the smooth and silky mouth, while the medium finish lands on a softly oak-kissed flavor. Drink now.",87,G. Moulinier 2009 Tradition Red (Saint-Chinian)
"A blend of Negroamaro and Malvasia Nera, this opens with aromas of underbrush, violet, clove and spicy plum. The straightforward palate delivers mature blackberry and allspice alongside brawny tannins.",87,Castello Monaci 2013 Liante Red (Salice Salentino)
"There are plenty of tannins in this still-young wine. Wood as well as fruit tannins are firm and concentrated, and still developing. Beside this structure, the fruit is also impressive: a rich medley of dark plums, ripe berry fruits and fine acidity. Drink from 2018.",93,Famille Laplace 2013 Odé d'Aydie Tannat (Madiran)
"This win is dense and dusty, with ripe ripe red and black fruit, meat and earth. The palate follows with fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. A plush, powerful Shiraz.",87,Mr. Riggs 2015 The Gaffer Shiraz (McLaren Vale)
"Made from dried Negroamaro grapes, this robust wine opens with earthy aromas of tilled soil, hay, leather, game and mature black fruit. The palate delivers dried date, bitter prune and licorice alongside astringent tannins.",87,Agricole Vallone 2010 Graticciaia Negroamaro (Salento)
"The blue bottle with the banana-colored cork is almost iconic in Oregon. The wine, as always, is far less flashy but perfectly serviceable. It gives fair flavor for your 10 bucks, keeping it simple, sweet and slightly tropical. Don't look for complexity, but if you want a decent, tasting room Riesling, this does the job nicely.",85,Bridgeview 2006 Blue Moon Riesling (Oregon)
"A ripe, red berry-fruit flavored wine, highlighted with sweet cherries. At this young stage, it shows more fruit than structure. Tannins are here, likely to flesh out the wine as it develops. For the moment, enjoy the great swathes of sweet fruit.",94,Domaine Chandon de Briailles 2006 Ile de Vergelesses Premier Cru  (Pernand-Vergelesses)
"This is an aromatically brooding wine with notes of herbs, pepper and brown spices. It drinks quite sweet with a lightly chalky feel.",86,Lagana 2013 Minnick Hills Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Produced by the Terravant facility in Buellton, this shows lots of smoked pork and bacon fat against a boysenberry-fruit frame on the nose. Flavors are quite sanguine, with iron and blood elements, as well as more smoke and some dried herbs.",88,Tines 2013 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)
"This is a full, ripe wine, with elegant impressions of toast. Robust notes of melon and peach show strongly, giving a rich, warm feel that is brightened with acidity. Drink now through 2017.",88,Château Routas 2011 Coquelicot Viognier-Chardonnay (Vin de Pays Var)
"The nose isn't overly expressive but eventually reveals suggestions of tropical fruit, chopped herb and a whiff of stone. The straightforward, slender palate offers grapefruit, a hint of peach and mineral accompanied by crisp acidity.",87,Alois Lageder 2014 Lehen Sauvignon (Alto Adige)
"The wine comes from a 14-acre estate owned by the producer. Its fruitiness and texture are both important elements in the wine at this young stage. They give a tightly textured wine that is still bright, crisp with lemon fruit and crispened with considerable acidity. Let the wine soften and drink from 2018.",90,Joseph Mellot 2016 Domaine des Emois  (Sancerre)
"A touch of mushroom and vegetable unripeness runs through this Pinot. It's not entirely unpleasant, but it does interfere with your enjoyment of the fruit. Drink this silky, dry wine now.",85,Bennett Valley Cellars 2011 BIN 6410 Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"With firm tannins allied to smooth wood flavors, this young wine is going to develop its fruitiness over the next year. It has a ripe body, black fruits in the back waiting to come forward. Wait to drink until 2016.",87,Exem 2012  Bordeaux
"Oak, herb, fennel, hay and wild berry aromas lead the nose. The firm palate offers Morello cherry, oak, cinnamon, clove, Mediterranean herb and a confectionary note alongside tightly knit and austere tannins that need to unwind. Drink 2018–2030.",90,San Polo 2010  Brunello di Montalcino
"The nose on this reserva is roasted and meaty, with dark berry accents. The palate delivers a flush feel and volume along with flavors of roasted plum, herbal raspberry and salt. There's tobacco and pimiento on the finish, and for a subpar vintage the wine is still very good. Drink now through 2017.",88,Sierra Cantabria 2007 Reserva  (Rioja)
"The deep black color of this wine suggests that it spent a lot of time on the skins, and 20 months in American oak added further grip and grit to the tannins. Cherry tobacco, espresso and plenty of oak flavors lead into a chewy finish with some residual bitterness.",86,Weisinger 2012 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Rogue Valley)
Funky flowers and dandelion fringe the citrus core of this rounded but precise Riesling. They hint at a ripe core of stone fruit that vies for attention with zesty acidity.,89,Markus Huber 2013 Engelsberg Riesling (Traisental)
"While grassy, herbal aromas dominate the aromas, plenty of white grapefruit comes through on the palate to provide for a crisp, refreshing mouthful. It's medium in weight, with some leafy and citrusy notes on the moderate-length finish.",87,Oyster Bay 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Even tasted blind, this wine comes across as a bit warm. The 15% alcohol imparts a thick, rich consistency in the mouth, while the flavors stay true to the site, showing notes of ripe peaches, citrus and hints of home heating oil. It's certainly impressive, but the alcohol shows through a bit on the finish, suggesting near-term consumption.",88,Schloss Johannisberger 2006 Grünlack Spätlese Trocken Riesling (Rheingau)
"There's so much sweet guava and mango in this juicy, intensely tropical Riesling, it's hard to believe it's labeled kabinett. Striking tangerine acidity lends vibe to the concentrated, superripe palate, leading to a long, fruit-kissed finish.",90,Maximin Grünhäuser 2011 Abstberg Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"This blend of 41% Chardonnay, 26% Marsanne, 18% Roussanne and 15% Viognier shows notes of grilled sweet corn on the cob and Golden Delicious apple. It's broad in feel but seems to only have one trick to show.",87,Patterson 2013 Mélange Blanc White (Columbia Valley (WA))
"An interesting, well-made blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Tannat that deals lemony oak, spice, coconut and ripe berry aromas. Stocky and firm, with nice balance and bold tannins framing flavors of lemon peel, clove, herbs, toast and berry fruit. A complete package; drink now through 2014.",90,Benvenuto de la Serna 2007 Trisagio Red (Uco Valley)
"With its slight vanilla aroma, this is a broad style, with ripe acidity, a fresh green fruit character, rounded by the toast edge. There is a good final crisp texture.",87,Domaine Eugène Meyer 2008 Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
"The winery's second vintage from this site, Calegari is medium-weight, with structured oak and a silky palate. It's a ripe expression of anise and red cherry that's juicy, spicy and complex, with pretty violet aromas.",95,Williams Selyem 2012 Calegari Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This great-value SB from Lake County hits it out of the park on all sorts of fronts, including price. It's got subtle aromatics of pear and lemon, and is a little generic and simple, but at $10 it's so perfectly drinkable who cares? All in a colorful package. Best Buy.",87,Line 39 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County)
"This full-bodied wine has a strong stamp of sweet-seeming oak in the aroma and flavor, dominating its lighter raspberry and red cherry notes. Vanilla and brown sugar nuances emerge and continue into the finish.",86,Gnarly Head 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Smooth and rich, this wine is made from fruit that's sourced from 65-year-old vines. It has fresh acidity that gives a bright quality to the ripe fruit. For an entry-level Bourgogne, this has complexity and weight.",88,Roche de Bellene 2010 Vieilles Vignes  (Bourgogne)
"The nose offers up just a bit of intrigue, with gardenia, musk and white rose scents, but the focus of this wine is really its core of baked apricot flavors that turn just a bit jammy on the finish. Sweet, but not out of balance, good as a summer apéritif.",85,De Bortoli NV Emeri Moscato (South Eastern Australia)
"Light in color while full of fruit, this is a ripe and jammy wine. A good core of tannins are surrounded by ripe cherry and strawberry-flavored fruits. There is a good future for this dense wine, so drink from 2017.",89,Louis Max 2013 Vignes du Domaine  (Mercurey)
"This soft and seductive wine is reminiscent of a good Chassagne-Montrachet from a relatively warm year. It has the same ripe, lightly tropical fruit, inflected with citrus and buoyed by firm acidity. The use of oak is restrained, the balance perfect, and the finish long and satisfying.",91,Hamacher 2007 Cuvée Forêts Diverses Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
"Made from equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, with an additional 20% Malbec, this is a spicy, sturdy, full-bodied wine rich in restrained red fruit, leather and a healthy dose of tannin.",90,Round Pond 2013 Proprietary Red (Rutherford)
"Jean-Christophe Yung is driving this family property with a crisp and refreshing wine. The wine is light, bright and lively with plenty of citrus flavors topped by spice and zesty orange, this is a mineral textured wine. Its fruit is right up front, full of acidity and rich apple flavors. Drink from late 2016.",89,Château Les Hauts de Palette 2015 Château du Barail  (Bordeaux Blanc)
"Mocha and bitter chocolate are dominant on the nose, and while the body is rich, fresh acidity outlines the contours of a slender body. Blueberries follow later while soft tannins make this a versatile player on the table.",87,Iby 2011 Hochäcker Blaufränkisch (Mittelburgenland)
"Zerba's crowd-pleasing Wild Z blends Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah about equally, with a splash of Cabernet Franc to finish it off. It's a ripe, full, forward, chocolaty mouthful. It keeps the red fruit tart and tantalizing, while loading in the barrel flavors (French and American) to round off the finish. A fine follow-up to the excellent 2006.",88,Zerba Cellars 2007 Wild Z Red (Walla Walla Valley (OR))
"Ripe earthy berry aromas are supported by more than enough oak and sawdust. Following the nose like a map, this Malbec from San Rafael feels resiny. A mix of toasty spicy oak-based flavors blends well with boysenberry and salty notes, while this finishes full and with a draping of toasty blackened oak.",90,Valentin Bianchi 2013 Particular Malbec
"With layers of honeyed botrytis, this is an open, generous sweet wine. Melon and creamed apple give a fresher side to what is a seductively opulent wine.",88,Robert et Bernard Plageoles 2008 Muscadel (Gaillac Doux)
"This structured wine opens with an unusual blend of aromas that includes ripe black fruit, dill and chocolate. The palate offers velvety tannins and notes of tart blackberry, black cherry, fig and mature plum sprinkled with notes of cocoa.",90,Duca di Salaparuta 2008 Duca Enrico Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"From a small parcel at the base of the hill of Beaune, this is a delicious wine with a touch of vanilla. It is rounded, smooth and rich, bringing out both fruit and toasty wood flavors that are integrated well. Drink from 2016.",90,Louis Latour 2011 Clos Saint-Désiré  (Beaune)
"Made entirely with old Nerello Mascalese vines between 80 and 100-years-old, this has aromas of blue flower, ripe berry, exotic spice and a whiff of French oak. The elegant linear palate delivers red cherry, raspberry, chopped herb and star anise alongside fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity. A mineral note closes the finish. Drink 2018–2025.",92,Pietradolce 2013 Vigna Barbagalli Pre-Phylloxera Rosso  (Etna)
"Murrieta's wines have been on a good run in recent years, as evidenced by this saturated, fleshy Reserva. The nose delivers berry and cherry aromas, with ample oak. The palate is a full-volume bonanza of berry flavors framed by briary spice and toasty oak. A naturally spicy, ripe finish confirms its excellence; drink 2018–2026.",92,Marqués de Murrieta 2012 Finca Ygay Reserva  (Rioja)
"All is proper and well done in this Cabernet, from the dryness and smooth tannins to the flavors of blackberries, currants and cedar. It's a little thin, but the price is pretty good.",86,Kirkland Signature 2009 NAPA Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa County)
"A balanced wine, with softness that indicates a relatively high dosage. There is no complexity, but the wine is light, creamy, flavored with green plums and kiwi, just edged with bitterness.",85,Vranken NV Demoiselle Tête de Cuvée Brut  (Champagne)
"Made with organically grown grapes, this opens with aromas of dark berry, violet, truffle and leather. The round chewy palate offers juicy black cherry, cinnamon and a balsamic note alongside soft acidity and supple tannins.",90,Campinuovi 2012 Riserva  (Montecucco)
"A medium-bodied Aglianico, it's softly textured and light in red cherry fruit and plum flavor, with a hint of rose petals on the nose. Ready to enjoy now, the light imprint of this wine won't get in the way of food flavors, accenting something meaty or gamy that's not overly rich or overdone in sauce.",86,Monte Volpe 2010 Aglianico (Mendocino County)
"Dark red-violet in color, this offers aromas of cherry, seawater and molasses, while flavors suggest cherry, cranberry, smoked meat, mocha, mint and eucalyptus. Cool notes outweigh fruit flavors, leading to a sense that something is off balance. Strong tannins back off on a bright finish that fails to diminish the minty notes.",88,Montefiore 2011 Karem Moshe Red (Judean Hills)
"Solid berry and oak spice aromas turn darker and more rubbery as this airs out. A strong-boned, grabby palate holds medicinal berry and mild hickory flavors. On the finish, this is big but also tannic and bumpy.",88,Benvenuto de la Serna 2016 Mil Piedras Malbec (Vista Flores)
"This soft wine has fresh acidity that lifts the peppered pear flavors. It's ready to drink, very fruity while keeping its mineral and chalky texture. The aftertaste is ripe and also fresh.",88,Alexandre Monmousseau NV Vigneau Brut  (Vouvray)
"Still closed and firm, this is a dry, tannic and smoky wine. With the dark tannins, it will take a while to bring out the juicy fruits that are underneath. Drink this rich wine from 2020.",88,Lima Smith 2014 Quinta das Tecedeiras Reserva Red (Douro)
"This crisp Swiss white grape is rarely seen in the U.S. and that's a shame. Spritzy, racy, fresh as a mountain stream, it possesses impressive minerality under lemony fruit. Bone-dry, low alcohol, and surprisingly dense, it has a pleasing finish with a light almond note.",90,St. Hubertus 2013 Chasselas (Okanagan Valley)
"A crisp, off-dry Vinho Verde with a good prickle on the tongue. Flavors of lemon and green apple are well balanced in this ready-to-drink summer wine. Screwcap.",83,Viniverde 2011 Estreia White (Vinho Verde)
"Grassy aromas include a note of crushed vitamin. This is basic at best, lacking at worst. There's not much to the palate, while salty grassy grapefruit flavors fail to stir excitement. An unfriendly note of onion appears on a tart green finish.",82,Apaltagua NV Extra Brut Costero Sparkling (San Antonio)
"Tenute Folonari has produced a Bordeaux blend that is definitely on the ripe side. The wine is a touch jammy, with mature cherry, strawberry, plum, blackberry tart, tobacco and chocolate fudge. The mouthfeel has a dense, gritty texture.",88,Campo al Mare 2005  Bolgheri
"A big, soft, ultrarich style of Zinfandel. It has very high alcohol, with flamboyant flavors of milk chocolate, oozingly ripe blackberries and blueberries, anise liqueur and black pepper. The finish is totally dry. Lusty and heady.",88,Wilson 2007 Diane's Reserve Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"Quite dark and dense, generous and ripe, this Grenache offers a mix of red and black fruits. The flavors continue onto a finish that's rich with kirsch and coffee.",90,J. Scott Cellars 2010 Grenache (Rogue Valley)
"Showing youthful oak tones that still need time to integrate, this wine is a bit sour and ripe at the same time. Black cherry, tobacco, leather and spice aromas are nice, but the tannins are firm, and the wine shows a bright point of acidity on the close and a gritty, cooked-fruit finish.",88,Ferrero 2007  Brunello di Montalcino
"Three things characterize this 100% varietal wine. It's crisp with acidity, fruity with lemons, limes and tropical fruits, and honeyed on the finish. Easy to drink it with slightly sweet, salted, smoky pork dishes.",87,Beltane Ranch 2012 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Valley)
"The nose on this slightly cloudy wine is ruled by lemon-lime soda and chalky candy, which is interesting but one-dimensional. It's easy to drink and smooth enough, with a slight green apple skin tartness, but somewhat flat on the palate.",84,Indigené 2012 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Carmel Valley)
"This attractive and fruity rosé is very dry and rich. With red fruits, a sense of texture and just a hint of tannin, this is a food rosé, firm and ready for summer 2014.",86,Herdade do Rocim 2012 Olho de Mocho Rosé (Alentejano)
"One of the top wines from this producer, this blend of at least 10 grape varieties comes from its estate. The wood aging has added sophistication to this already concentrated wine. With black fruits to the fore and firm tannins, it will age well. Drink from 2019.",92,Casa Santos Lima 2014 Confidencial Reserva Red (Lisboa)
"White spring flower and orchard fruit aromas lead the nose. The lean, rather evolved palate still retains fresh acidity, but drink soon to capture the remaining yellow apple and lemon peel flavors.",85,Ascevi Luwa 2015 Grappoli Pinot Grigio (Collio)
"CVNE's top wines from 2010 are outstanding across the board. This sun-baked wine is bursting with black cherry, blackberry, spice, vanilla and cedary aromas. A tight, exact and fresh palate blends richness and balance, while ripe blackberry, cassis and black pepper flavors finish with a pure feel, a touch of buttery oak, and nuances of licorice and herbs. Drink this modern beauty through 2025.",95,CVNE 2010 Pagos de Viña Real  (Rioja)
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot doesn't seem to have fully ripened with prominent herbal notes that lean into the green, along with green olive and saline. It tastes quite sweet, giving the perception of lingering residual sugar.",82,Sawtooth 2011 Skyline Red
"Produced from a single clone—Dijon 777—this late release has a hint of leather around candied cherry fruit, mixed with sweetened cranberry. It's concentrated and rounded off, with brown spice highlights. Drink now to 2020.",91,Arbor Brook 2012 Estate 777 Block Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"Not a lot of American importers bring in Coonawarra Shiraz, as the region is better known for its Cabernet. This is a fine example of the former, offering a hint of eucalyptus or mint alongside vanilla, mocha and raspberries. There's a fine, silky texture and a long supple finish.",91,Di Giorgio Family Wines 2013 Shiraz (Coonawarra)
Tangy red fruits are the hallmark of this Cabernet/Merlot blend (there's also a tiny bit of Syrah in it). Juicy strawberry and cherry candy flavors meld with a touch of earth and darker streaks of coffee.,88,Dunham 2006 Trutina Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This wine is ripe, full of black fruits and soft tannins. With plenty of acidity to keep it crisp, the wine has a cool, flavorful character topped off by berry fruits. It's ready to drink.",85,Parras Wines 2015 Terra Grande Red (Alentejano)
"Earthy with hints of roasted nuts and dried herb, this is a uniquely savory Sauvignon that would pair well with herb-accented fowl and fish. The palate is round and rich, but balanced with brisk lime acidity and a characteristic grassiness on the finish.",84,Ciringa 2011 Fosilni Breg Sauvignon Blanc (Slovenia)
"While the nose on this sweetie isn't deep, it's lush, inviting and peachy as they come. The palate feels fresh and straightforward, and the flavor profile blends tropical fruit flavors with spice and honey accents. Overall this seems natural, easygoing and expressive.",90,Montes 2010 Late Harvest Gewürztraminer (Curicó Valley)
"Mint, cedar and clove aromas are followed by pepper, clove and black fruit flavors. It's not overly complex, but it offers distinctive indigenous character, and it will pair nicely with grilled meat.",84,Vaeni 2007 Xinomavro (Naoussa)
"Aromas of wet cement, spicy oak and generic berry fruits make for a rubbery, earthy whole. This wine is jammy and flabby in feel, with peppery berry and oak spice flavors. It lacks character.",83,Camina 2016 Tempranillo (La Mancha)
"Baked apple and buttercup aromas get it going in a good way, but the palate doesn't really keep the momentum. It's citrusy but low in acid, while the flavors are simple and narrow as they revolve around citrus fruits. Chunky and soft on the finish.",84,Four Aces 2009 Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"Delicious now for its rich array of black cherry jam, raspberry tart, mocha, cola, anise and vanilla-cedar flavors, wrapped into an easy, silky mouthfeel. Feels elegant and good, and probably best now through 2011.",89,Foursight 2007 Charles Vineyard All In Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"This Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux-style blend is extraordinarily rich, with flavors of raspberry and cherry tart, milk chocolate, red licorice and sweet oak, plus soft, gentle tannins. It shows a direct deliciousness that makes it easy to like.",89,Trione 2008 Geyserville Ranch Red (Alexander Valley)
"This well-balanced wine tames the tannins and brings to the table a relaxed texture plus layers of fruit, spice and oak flavors. Still it has great underpinnings of ripe cherry and raspberry, plus a sense of completeness and reserve.",91,Spann Vineyards 2012 Tempranillo (Lake County)
"Pronounced wood and toast notes open this rich, oaky Chardonnay. The palate boasts bright lemon and caramel-apple flavors, but hints of unripe stems and leaves distract.",84,Benmarl 2012 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island)
"A big, bold and ripe wine, this is rich and packed with dark fruits. Firm tannins are well cushioned by the berry fruits and the acidity. It is a generous wine that comes from the region south of Lisbon. Aged in wood for 12 months, it is now ready to drink.",91,Wines & Winemakers 2013 Pegos Claros Grand Escolha Castelão (Península de Setúbal)
"Saracina makes dazzling white wines, but this intense red is outstanding too. Dark fruits like blackberry mingle with bright raspberry in this hefty, substantial wine that's full bodied and handsomely tannic. It's dry, very textural in the mouth and concentrated well enough for a lingering finish.",92,Saracina 2013 Pick and Shovel Zinfandel (Mendocino County)
"Packed with black plum and blackberry fruits, this is a firm yet ripe wine. It has wood, smoke and spice flavors that complement the fruit and tannins. Age for three years.",89,Château Mille-Roses 2009  Haut-Médoc
"A dilute and scratchy wine that lacks the body and depth of good Cab. Frankly, it's sour, lean and tough, with tart plum and pie cherry flavors. Dry as a bone on the finish.",81,Espuela del Gaucho 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"This is a rich, juicy, solid wine. The tannins of the Tannat have been mitigated by the more juicy Cabernets in the blend to give a structured while fruity wine. The black fruits and the intense acidity promise aging. Drink from 2018.",90,Château d'Aydie 2013 Aydie l'Origine Tannat-Cabernet (Madiran)
"A textbook Prosecco Superiore, with soft, foamy bubbles and bright aromas of exotic fruit, spring flower and dried herb. It's easy going, with refreshing acidity on the finish.",87,Le Manzane NV Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Collin Cranor remains one of Livermore's most promising young winemakers and this wine proves the point, a blend from three vineyard sites. This has a very pretty raspberry nose and is well-balanced throughout, with blackberry, oak and black tea flavors giving it an intensity of purpose. Will age well over the next couple of years.",90,Nottingham Cellars 2009 Micro-Lot Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley)
"Winemaker: Bartho Eksteen. This wooded Sauvy shows incredible restraint, harmony and balance. It opens with attractive notes of ripe gooseberry, apple flesh and green melon rind. The palate offers more just-ripe tropical-fruit tones, with a pleasantly pithy texture and lime-rind flavors that hang on through the lingering finish. Enjoy now for the bright acidity, though it should mature well through 2020.",91,Bartho Eksteen 2016 Cape Winemakers Guild Vloekskoot Wooded Sauvignon Blanc
"In this strongly wood-aged wine, the spice and toast is as important as the fruit. As the wine matures over the next two to three years, the ripe apricot and pineapple fruit flavors will come through more vividly. Drink from 2015.",88,Château de la Vieille Chapelle 2012 Les Grands Blancs  (Bordeaux Blanc)
"In this inaugural release, winemaker James MacPhail travels to the far reaches of Annapolis to source grapes from the true wilderness, the site next door to Goldrock Ridge Vineyard. Made in a full-bodied style, this wine is intriguing in dried herb, black pepper and forest floor, with a healthy, lengthy seasoning of savory black tea.",92,Tongue Dancer 2014 Putnam Vineyard Pinot de Ville Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Slight reduction still obstructs this wine's nose. The palate, however, is both zingy and rich—spiked with citrus and rounded with ripe, mellow apple fruit. There is verve and life at its core and tone to its medium body. The dry finish is appetizing.",90,Zahel 2016 White (Wiener Gemischter Satz)
"There is a tantalizing hint of perfume in this 85% Sauvignon Blanc and 15% Muscadelle blend that makes the wine both ripe and textured. With a touch of pepper as well as crisp apple, the wine is rich and ready to drink.",88,Château les Bertrands 2015 Cuvée Tradition  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"This fresh, crisp, textured wine has pepper as well as red fruit flavors. It offers a touch of spice, ripe strawberries and delicious final acidity.",88,Château Cavalier 2014 Réserve de la Familie Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Aged in French oak, this offers rich flavors of black fruit and plum followed by a medium, bright finish. Pair this wine with pork or grilled lamb chops.",89,Alois Lageder 2007 Lindenburg Lagrein (Alto Adige)
"This young, precocious wine is still knitting together, but is already quite tasty. Vanilla custard and tart red-berry flavors combine in the core, then smooth out through a silky, chocolatey finish.",92,Hyland 2014 Pommard Pinot Noir (McMinnville)
"A very dark color, tons of ripe fruit aromas and abundant black-fruit flavors give a lot of wallop to this full-bodied but not overly sweet or fat Rhône-style blend. Ripe blackberry, stewed plum and a touch of smoke hang on a big structure of firm tannins and good acidity. It will be best after 2019, but it's difficult not to drink up at this price.",91,Naggiar 2014 Dahlia Noir Red (Sierra Foothills)
"This blend of Tempranillo, Malbec, Dolcetto, Merlot and Syrah could have turned into a generic red, yet it is seamless and nicely proportioned. It's a real crowd-pleaser, with a ripe red-fruit flavor and generous new-barrel-derived toast and spice notes.",90,Abacela NV Vintner's Blend #12 Red (Southern Oregon)
"This light, bright and juicy wine from estate vineyards exalts in the goodness of red cherry and cola spice. Not fussy, the wine has medium body and acidity. It finishes clean and restrained on the palate, making for an easygoing quaff.",88,Nicholson Ranch 2012 Estate Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Made with 60% Grechetto and Procanico, 35% Sauvignon and 5% Sémillon, this offers heady aromas of dried peach and sweet almond. On the enveloping palate, notes of acacia honey and orange peel add depth to dried apricot.",89,Decugnano dei Barbi 2013 Pourriture Noble  (Orvieto Classico Superiore)
"Impressively delicate but also generous in aromas, this bottling shows lemon curd, caramelized apple and a touch of baby powder on the nose. There's a sharp line of salty acidity on the palate, with flavors of candied apple and Meyer lemon.",91,Wrights Station 2013 Backwards Block Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Simply constructed, this has flavors of orange, mango and buttered toast. This will appeal to many who like their white wines with some sweetness.",85,Jade Mountain 2009 White (California)
"Made with organically farmed grapes, this crisp, savory white opens with aromas of wildflower, stone fruit and an earthy whiff of flint. The linear, vibrant palate offers fresh peach, crunchy Granny Smith apple and a citrus note. It's balanced by tangy acidity and closes on an almond note.",90,Poggio Alloro 2014  Vernaccia di San Gimignano
"A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot and 8% Syrah, this offers aromas of cassis, cedar, leather, black pepper and grilled herb. On the palate, coffee, chocolate, toast and a hint of powdered sage accent the blackberry and dried cherry core. Polished tannins make this already accessible. Drink through 2019.",90,Caccia al Piano 1868 2011 Levia Gravia  (Bolgheri Superiore)
"In this straightforward quaffer, aromas of pear, melon and apple lead to off-dry fruit flavors with a full feel. The flavor concentration is light but it still provides easy drinking enjoyment.",85,Goose Ridge 2014 Estate Bottled Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Ripe, rich apricot and peach flavors are accented by touches of bramble and earth in this slightly rustic yet elegant Chardonnay. Tangerine acidity jolts the midpalate, leading a fresh, crisp finish.",87,Domaine LeSeurre 2014 Unoaked Cuvée Classique Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"Rustic, hearty aromas of tar, cola, herbs and burnt rhubarb make for an intriguing nose on this entry-level bottling from Testarossa. The sips feature cola and cherry flavors, with a very quick finish.",84,Testarossa 2012 Cuvee Los Gatos Pinot Noir (Monterey County)
"This is a delicately fragrant Moscato d'Asti with feminine aromas of jasmine, honey and white peach. There's a citrusy, lemongrass-like note that adds a fresh, almost spicy note to this creamy, sweet and delicious wine.",87,Saracco 2006  Moscato d'Asti
"Made from organically-farmed Nerello Mascalese, this simple wine does show true varietal characteristics of wild fruit, dark mineral and cola. The aromas are mild and the mouthfeel delivers medium intensity.",85,Di Giovanna 2009 Nerello Mascalese (Sicilia)
"From a walled vineyard once owned by the local bishop, this wine is structured and firm while also having great red cherry and berry fruit. It's one of a number of Premier Crus from this producer—and certainly the most expressive with its generous fruit and balanced tannins. Drink from 2018.",91,Domaine Jeannin-Naltet 2014 Le Clos l'Evêque Premier Cru  (Mercurey)
"This is a full-bodied and intensely fruity wine with jammy aromas and ripe cherry and raspberry flavors. It is smooth textured and has soft tannins, so the effect is easygoing in spite of high alcohol.",86,Cosentino 2013 The Zin Zinfandel (Lodi)
"Bready, dusty aromas of baked apple come across loud and chunky. The palate is juicy at its core but low on bubbles, while flavors of citrus, baked apple and yeast finish long and toasty, with some richness.",86,Montevicor NV Sparkling (Cava)
"This Cab blend proves that Hungarian reds are becoming more of a contender on a global level. An enticing wave of pepper and wooded spice on the nose rolls into flavors of juicy red fruit, pepper, raspberry and wood on the tongue. The structure is solid but elegant, so though the wine can age, it's good to drink now. Balanced and stylish overall.",89,Bock 2003 Capella Cuvée Red (Villány)
"Inviting in succulent, brambly berry, this is a balanced wine that takes a light approach to ripeness. Clove and vanilla add to its admirable length and breadth.",88,Peter Cellars 2014 Estate Merlot (Carneros)
"Modest red-fruit aromas are edgy, spicy and a touch horsey. Lean and juicy in the mouth, this new Pinot Noir from Santa Ema tastes of plum and herbal raspberry. Dry, spicy and peppery tasting on the finish; true to the variety.",87,Aila 2014 Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley)
"The ??? Pinot from Ayoub is a true mystery wine, made with fruit sourced from unnameable but exceptionally high-end sources. Flavors are subtle and elegant, with lovely floral top notes over firm, well-balanced fruit and chewy tannins. Still quite young and compact, this wine needs another five years at a minimum to blossom. Drink 2020–2030.",92,Ayoub 2013 ??? Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
Tropical and citrus fruit aromas come with controlled skin-based bitterness. This has a full oily texture and flavors of lemon-lime and white pineapple. Fresh acidity on the finish keeps this clean and in good shape. Drink right away.,89,Loscano 2015 Private Reserve Torrontés (Cafayate)
"Young Pinot Noir can sometimes dazzle you with juicy expressive downright sensational fruit, as this does. Though tasted prior to its official release, the wine drinks beautifully, offering a big hit of citrus flesh and rind along with lovely raspberry and blueberry fruit. It's forward, fresh, balanced tightly against its lush acidity, and is already just about irresistible.",93,Toil Oregon 2015 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Aromas of herbs, jasmine and peach are followed by off-dry pear and peach flavors. There's not much complexity here but it provides easy drinking enjoyment.",83,Black Box 2014 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This wine comes from a new project from winemaker Melissa Burr (Stoller Estate), focusing on old-vine vineyards. This bottling comes from vines planted in 1968. The aromas are light, with notes of cherry, cigar box, dried leaf and earth. The flavors are cranberry tart and mouthwatering, showing an exquisite sense of balance, with a lingering finish.",91,History 2014 Elise Vineyard Pinot Noir (Columbia Gorge (WA))
"A simple, straightforward wine, this has an attractive mineral, tangy texture to go with the bright citrus fruit. Crisp and refreshing, it is ready to drink.",86,Château de Santenay 2014 Vieilles Vignes  (Bourgogne)
"Aromas of cedar, plum, red currant, clove and menthol unfold in the glass. An easy-drinking blend of 45% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Sangiovese, the juicy palate delivers black cherry, blackberry, ground pepper and licorice alongside soft, polished tannins. Drink through 2018.",88,Rocca di Frassinello 2013 Poggio alla Guardia  (Maremma Toscana)
"This opens with earthy aromas of scorched earth, ripe berry, leather and a funky whiff of game. The full-bodied palate offers mature black cherry, black raspberry, truffle, grilled sage, ground pepper and a hint of tobacco alongside youthfully assertive, solid tannins. Drink after 2018.",90,Clavesana 2011 Olo  (Barolo)
"Made from 85% Sangiovese, 10% Malvasia and 5% Alicante, it features aromas of blue flower, ripe black fruit and espresso notes. The palate offers black cherry, black pepper, toasted oak and roasted coffee beans. It ends on a bitter, tannic note that dries out the mouth.",86,Suberli 2012  Morellino di Scansano
"Fermented whole cluster in 80% stainless steel, this fresh tart wine is packed with flavors of citrus and apple. It's crisply defined, finishing with a touch of freshly cut herb.",88,Phelps Creek 2015 Pinot Gris (Columbia Gorge (OR))
"With a fresh but earthy nose of flowers, honey and herbs, this approachable white begs for food pairing. Simple but balanced and with a flirty character, it has a summer sipping kind of appeal.",86,VinArte 2004 Alb de Murfatlar Pinot Gris (Murfatlar)
"An intensely dark and elegant Malbec, structured in firm tannins and complex in black almost-liqueur-like cherry, and a finish of herb, oak and mocha. A full-bodied and yet soft wine that is ready to drink now that is poised to get more interesting in time. A small percentage (10%) of Cabernet Sauvignon is blended in.",89,Cinnabar 2009 Amber Knolls Vineyard Malbec (Clear Lake)
"A touch of strawberry streaks through this wine's lemon scent. The palate is slender, easy and fresh, making for an uncomplicated summer drink with a dry, taut finish.",88,Familie Zull 2016 Lust & Laune Rosé (Niederösterreich)
This is a crisp juicy wine showing the bright red fruits of the vintage. It still has its tannins intact along with plenty of black-currant acidity and a dry aftertaste that will soften over the next few months. Drink from late 2017.,87,Château de Bordes-Quancard 2014  Bordeaux
"This is just 14.2% alcohol, so despite the richness and ripeness, this is not fat or flabby. The fruit has concentrated black cherry and cassis flavors, and the smoky, pain grillé flavors of barrel aging are nicely integrated. Aromatically this wine is just beginning to evolve, with complex plum, prune, cherry liqueur, coffee and smoke.",93,Sheridan Vineyard 2004 Reserve Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"This powerful wine has considerable structure and considerable acidity that will shine as the wine develops. The fruit is delicious, showing great potential. Drink from 2020.",92,Chanson Père et Fils 2013 Les Chenevottes Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet)
"Quite tart when it hits the lips, this is nonetheless a dense, flavorful Pinot Gris, tasting of grapefruit, sour orange, apple and green banana. It shows lots of juice and powers through the mid-palate into a fruit-driven finish.",90,Adelsheim 2012 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"A rough and tumble blend of Tempranillo, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. It starts out with forceful, cheesy oak that gives way to dark plum, bramble and oak-resin flavors, while the finish shows tannin and tomato leaf flavors. It's full, tough and different from all the polished, international wines that dominate the marketplace.",85,Tagonius 2002 Crianza Red (Madrid)
"There'a soft sweetness to this wine that makes it immediately drinkable. The flavors are suggestive of ripe red cherry, red licorice, red currant liqueur, mocha and sweet oak.",86,White Oak 2009 Syrah (Napa Valley)
"Aromas of red licorice candy and raspberry are fruity, forward and clean. The palate is more than competent and balanced, with creamy strawberry and raspberry flavors. The finish is short but easy, and for the price that's all you can ask for.",87,Manyana 2008 Tempranillo (Cariñena)
"Rose aromas emerge on the nose of this block-designated, light-bodied wine. It's full of crisp red fruit and bright acidity.",88,Balletto 2015 Emerson Block Burnside Road Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Plummy and dark, with accents of cedar, dark chocolate and hints of coffee. This is always the most robust of the Felton Road Pinots, and really deserves a few years in the cellar; although it's approachable now, expect the already soft tannins to turn silkier in time.",93,Felton Road 2008 Block 5 Pinot Noir (Central Otago)
"Bright and light on its feet, this is a pleasant and sunny wine that's loaded with crisp citrus and green apple aromas and flavors. There's a subtle, surprising smoothness to the palate, though zippy acidity picks up on the midpalate and through the clean finish. Drink now.",88,Bellingham 2015 Citrus Grove Chenin Blanc (Coastal Region)
"A little too jammy, with pineapple, apricot and vanilla spice flavors. The sweetness is balanced with lemony acidity, but it's not really a dry table wine.",84,Opolo 2006 Roussanne (Central Coast)
"This is a fruity wine, full of both red-berry and cherry flavors and some dry tannins that will certainly soften and integrate. It has the potential to be balanced, full and deliciously fruity. Wait until 2019.",87,Château Tayet 2015 Cuvée Prestige  (Bordeaux Supérieur)
"Smoky notes of roasted meat and white pepper spice up the plum skins and blackberry fruit that show on the nose of this bottling. The smoke is also prominent on the sip, where graphite minerality frames the blueberry and blackberry fruit. The character of slightly burnt balsamic reduction sauce also shows through.",88,Fess Parker 2013 Rodney's Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"This chewy, tangy white wine is an engaging blend of 42% Viognier, 33% Marsanne, 23% Roussanne and a splash of Grenache Blanc. Fresh flavors of citrus, apples and pineapple abound. If you're looking for an unoaked alternative to Chardonnay, this is a good option.",89,Quady North 2015 Pistoleta White (Rogue Valley)
"The winery is part of the emerging garagiste movement in Paso Robles. It's an ambitious wine, blended with Petite Sirah and Malbec, both of which add complexity. But there's a candied tone to the blackberry flavors that makes it lush and soft.",85,Ascension Cellars 2010 Ethereal Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"This Valpolicella blend sees a few months of aging in large oak casks to produce aromas of dark cherry and sweet spice. At the back, however, is a tinge of dried apple skin and old leather.",85,Fabiano 2009  Valpolicella Classico Superiore
"Quite light in the glass but unmistakably pink, this Grenache-based rose shows a lime-driven citrus rind character on the crisp nose, gaining a touch of fruit from delicate watermelon and slight bubblegum scents. There is a touch of effervescence on the palate, where delicious and zesty lime, pink peach and more watermelon flavors come into play.",90,Margerum 2015 Riviera Rosé of Grenache (Central Coast)
"The finest Jester Cabernet I can remember, this full-bodied yet supple wine features aromas of cassis, cedar and vanilla in fine balance. Cassis and chocolate flavors continue in the same vein, followed by a silky, long finish. Drink now–2028.",92,Mitolo 2014 Jester Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)
"Scorched earth, menthol, cooking spice and mature plum aromas take shape in the glass. The forward palate offers dried black cherry, coffee and licorice alongside smooth, polished tannins. Drink soon to capture the remaining fruit flavor.",87,Fattoria di Valiano 2011  Chianti Classico
"Made in a structured, traditional and dry style, this wine will be great at dinnertime. It has moderate and attractive spice and oak aromas, full body and ripe fruit flavors that don't go to extremes. The sense of balance, layered texture, reserved flavors and sophistication make it a winner.",92,Monte Volpe 2012 Primitivo (Mendocino)
"The fruitiness of this wine suggests drinking it with simple Chinese foods or ham. With orange, apricot and brown sugar flavors, it's balanced by crisp acidity.",85,Sterling 2012 Cellar Club Sauvignon Blanc (Calistoga)
"Alluring scents of rose, iris, perfumed berry and aromatic herb take shape in the glass. The structured palate offers mouthfuls of ripe Marasca cherry, crushed raspberry, clove, licorice and pipe tobacco alongside austere tannins. Give this time to unwind. Drink 2020–2028.",91,Pugnane 2010 Villero  (Barolo)
"This blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot is an Oregon winery's take on a super Tuscan red. Aromas are volatile and those high tones carry into the flavors. Light raspberry fruit, high acidity, and a sharp astringency characterize the wine.",86,Apolloni 2007 Conti di Val Seriana Soleggio Red (Columbia Valley (OR))
"This deep black-cherry colored wine has a fruity nose of pomegranate and strawberry. It is smooth on the palate, with flavors of black currant, plum, white chocolate, lavender and a hint of baking spice. The finish is characterized by a splash of tart strawberry.",92,Golan Heights Winery 2013 Yarden Syrah (Galilee)
"Still quite closed, this wine has a wealth of French oak toast and spices alongside dark berries. It's silky and restrained but with great depth of flavors and intensity.",89,Bunnell 2008 Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Not much going on in this soft, direct Chardonnay, besides sweet oak, with its buttered toast, vanilla and butterscotch flavors. Way underneath is pineapple and lemondrop fruit.",85,Frank Family 2010 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Dominated by Ugni Blanc, the grape also used in the local Armagnac brandy, this is a tight, crisp wine, green but not unpleasantly so. Its acidity comes from fresh apple flavors, touched with some good juiciness and a fine refreshing finish. Screwcap.",85,Domaine du Tariquet 2007 Ugni Blanc-Colombard (Vin de Pays des Côtes de Gascogne)
"Smooth and soft, this is an easy, very accessible wine. Red fruits touched by pepper and spice are cut by zesty orange and lemon flavors. It has a warm, rounded aftertaste.",85,Ravoire et Fils 2015 Domaine Fontanyl Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"The variety's requisite citrus and green aromas are on display, but they aren't very defined or exciting. Neither is the wet, chunky palate, which may be moderately fresh but doesn't offer much besides basic pineapple, kiwi and green melon. 270,000 cases made.",83,Santa Rita 2009 120 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley)
"Compared to Wiemer's more fruity, floral bottlings this vintage, the Josef Vineyard is decidedly savory, showing pronounced notes of earth and herb. Semisweet in style, the palate offers concentrated doses of fresh white pear and tangerine as well. The finish lingers on dusty mineral tones.",89,Hermann J. Wiemer 2015 Josef Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Tightly coiled in fruit and oak, this is a young yet vibrantly lush, plush and juicy wine.It's ready to expand on the palate as it opens to reveal exotic baking spice, textured velvety softness and swathes of black cherry and pomegranate. Medium bodied and exuberant, it'll drink well with food.",92,Bruliam 2014 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This is the best of the new releases from Seven Bridges, a Portland-based winery with a penchant for Washington State fruit. Smooth, balanced and mouth-filling, this offers a truffle highlight that sits over the bright berry and cherry flavors.",89,Seven Bridges 2009 Golden Ridge Vineyard Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (OR))
"Blackberry aromas have a Port-like character and a smoky undertone. Big extraction leaves a thick, weighty mouthfeel and the essence of Cabernet's sweetness. Some mineral, coffee and meat on the lengthy finish. A good mix of finesse and wildness.",92,St. Supéry 1997 Dollarhide Ranch Limited Editi Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This opens with aromas of toast, oak and cherry. The tense palate offers raw red berry, roasted coffee bean, oak-driven spice and powdered sage, yet lacks fruit richness. Abrasive tannins give it a bracing finish.",87,Giacosa Fratelli 2012 Basarin Vigna Gianmatè  (Barbaresco)
"This is a stylish wine. It has fine acidity and light poised fruity character. With plenty of orange zest and a herbal touch, this blend of Cinsault, Grenache and Syrah is a generous wine, ready to drink now.",89,Hecht & Bannier 2016 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"There is a sense of pure juicy black-currant fruit that shoots through this great wine. With tannins that are firm while not a jot too much, the wine is crisp, packed with fruit and set for many years of aging. It is beautiful, fruity and intensely structured. Drink from 2027.",97,Château Margaux 2014  Margaux
"This is the driest of Iron Horse's new releases, but it still has a honeyed richness even though the residual sugar is a comparatively low half a percent. It feels refined, fancy and elegant, with delicious raspberry, lime and toast flavors. The blend is 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay.",93,Iron Horse 2005 Ultra Brut Sparkling (Green Valley)
"A clean, well made wine displaying Cab Franc's herbaceous, earthy, and spicy-floral side.  Drinks on the lean side, with some spare, delicate berry fruit; it definitely needs food to bring out its best qualities.  Very dry.",84,Nelson 1997 Cabernet Franc (Sonoma Valley)
"Sourced from the Stillwater Creek vineyard this wine spent 20 months in 75% new French oak. Immediately appealing, it opens into a mix of cranberry, pomegranate and cherry fruit, annotated with light hints of sandalwood, cocoa and black tea.",91,Guardian 2010 Stillwater Creek Vineyard The Wanted Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A good Pinot Noir, lusty, dry and fruity, although it's a bit raw in youth. Shows rich cherry marmalade, cola, spice and sandalwood flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. The vineyard is not among the valley's best, but Siduri interprets it as well as anyone.",90,Siduri 2009 Keefer Ranch Pinot Noir (Green Valley)
"This is a beautiful wine to look at for the coppery-gold color and the fierce explosion of fine bubbles. Smells luscious, with subtle raspberry, lime, bread and lees aromas. This is the best rosé Handley has ever produced: amazingly rich, long and full-bodied, with the creamy smoothness of Champagne.",92,Handley 1996 Brut Rosé  (Anderson Valley)
"If you're not familiar with the tastes and character of the Dolcetto grape, this widely available expression by Prunotto is typical in its bright array of wild berry and black fruit aromas. The wine is young, fresh and generous in its youthful flavors.",87,Prunotto 2009  Dolcetto d'Alba
"A complex nose unites freshly cut russet-pear peel, ripe red apple and juicy, yellow Mirabelle plum, with a spicy touch of pepper. The palate shows oodles of that juicy Mirabelle, framed with tangy ripe lemon and bright tangerine. All this comes in a streamlined, concentrated but sleek shape with briskness and dryness. The long finish tingles with zesty spice.",93,Geyerhof 2016 Ried Sprinzenberg Riesling (Kremstal)
"Delicious and tangy, this wine is tensely textured. With its pale orange-pink color it is fruity and packed with acidity and red currants, finished with a twist of spice.",87,Domaine Sainte-Marie 2014 Cuvée Paparazzi Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This racy Cab smells a touch scalped, with modest, slightly candied cherry and raspberry aromas. On the palate, this is balanced but basic. Flavors of plum, black currant and a dash of salt finish firm and warming.",87,Santa Julia 2014 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Uco Valley)
"With its gold bottle designed by Adriana Karembeu, this rich wine is full of rounded fruits and ripe, juicy apples. This fruitiness is balanced by a more structured character that introduces a steely edge of minerality. The wine is mature, ripe and balanced with a bright, fresher aftertaste.",92,Chanoine NV Tsarine Cuvée Adriana  (Champagne)
"This full-bodied blend of Viognier, Clairette and Grenache Blanc is a pretty typical white from the Southern Rhône. It's largely neutral in aroma and flavor save for a modest melon note, with a weighty mouthfeel. Drink soon.",86,Andrieux & Fils 2010 Cuvée Marie Vieilles Vignes White (Côtes du Rhône)
"Given extended lees contact during barrel fermentation to add richness, this wine is rich and incredibly intense, a mix of crème brûlée, brown sugar and hazelnut aromas with a palate satisfying in pear puree. Despite its power and heady qualities, it finds a nice balance in the glass, ending round and lush, yet bright.",92,Marimar Estate 2013 Don Miguel Vineyard Dobles Lias Unfiltered Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Despite moderate alcohol, this is full-bodied and almost sweet-tasting. Hints of dairy products combine with orange and pineapple flavors on the thickly textured palate.",84,Half Mile Creek 2014 Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia)
"Dried roses, violets, lavender, red currants and cranberries describe the nose of this beautifully delicate and complex wine. It tastes tart but also slightly sweet with chewy succulence and polished tannins.",90,Tenuta delle Terre Nere 2006 Feudo di Mezzo Il Quadro delle Rose  (Etna)
"There's a sweet, inviting aspect to the nose here that recalls Christmas spice, nutmeg, rum cake and mature blackberry. The wine feels compact and firm on the close and would pair with roasted ham with clove under the skin.",87,Gamba 2007 Campedel  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
"A little sweet and one-dimensional, with candied flavors of raspberries and limes.",84,Korbel NV Brut Rose Sparkling (California)
"The first vintage of this experimental, 7,000 vines per acre wine. An intense, dense wine, all the herbaceous, mineral character of Sauvignon Blanc is magnified with orange zest, touches of pear skin and a steely acidity.",92,Château de Tracy 2004 Haute Densité  (Pouilly-Fumé)
"High alcohol and exceptionally ripe fruit are the hallmarks of this mountain vineyard. In this Zinfandel, they express themselves as blackberries, cherries and mocha that have a roasted edge, and a Port-like heat that is by no means unpleasant. But you do want to drink this Zin with dishes rich in beef, cheese and olive oil.",88,Charter Oak 2010 Monte Rosso Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley)
"93-95 Barrel sample. A solid, almost chunky wine, but well balanced, the tannins fine and tight. The overall effect is of a wine that is warm and ripe, but there is also a tension there.",94,Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande 2008 Barrel sample  (Pauillac)
"Dark, dusty, strongly scented with barrel toast, coffee grounds and incense, this is the most substantial and complete version to date. Balancing cherry and plum fruit against the pretty barrel-infused tannins, it glides gracefully across the palate into a seamless finish.   Saggi is the Long Shadows collaboration with Tuscany's Ambrogio and Giovanni Folonari. the blend in 2007 is 43% Sangiovese, 36% Cabernet Sauvignon and 21% Syrah. With each new vintage, the percentage of Sangiovese climbs, putting more Tuscany in this new world super-Tuscan wine. Dark, dusty, strongly scented with barrel toast, coffee grounds and incense, this is the most substantial and complete version to date. Balancing cherry and plum fruit against the pretty barrel-infused tannins, it glides gracefully across the palate into a seamless finish.",91,Saggi 2007 Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Yellow tinted, with toasty, creamy aromas of baked apple and pear. Feels round and fleshy but fresh, with peach and baked apple flavors blended with copious toasty oak. Toasty and long on the finish; a high-quality Chardonnay for sure.",90,Bodega Catena Zapata 2009 Catena Alta Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"Kracher TBA wines are numbered in ascending order of intensity. Even at this medium level of intensity, this is an impressive wine. It has that fine balance, pushing its rich marmalade and dried apricot flavors right up to intense acidity. The wine is certainly full, but keeps a delicacy and great lightness of touch.",92,Kracher 2005 Zwischen den Seen Nummer 4 Trockenbeerenauslese Scheurebe (Burgenland)
"Dusty and nuanced with soft aromas of cocoa, dried raspberry and cherry, reminiscent of a chocolate cherry latte from Starbucks. Light weight in the mouth with approachable tannins and a clean, dry finish. Drink now.",85,Château Comte Devaugelas 2007 Red (Minervois)
"With fresh, jammy blackberry and cherry fruit, this Cab tastes like it's right out of the fermenting tank. It's bright in acidity and simple, but gets the job done.",83,Redwood Creek 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"The grapes come from three vineyards: Georges III in Rutherford, Tokalon in Oakville and Stagecoach, up on Atlas Peak. That helps explain the wine's beauty. It's pure California, cult-style Cab, soft and generous, with voluptuously ripe black currant and black cherry flavors elaborately enriched with spicy, smoky, 100% new French oak. My only quibble is that it could use a little more subtlety.",94,B Cellars 2004 Blend 26 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"From one of the properties owned by Bernard Magrez, this wine exhibits the opulent character he seems to like. Rich and full of black-plum flavors, it offers all the fruit of the vintage with the right amount of tannins to support it. Drink from 2018.",92,Château les Grands Chênes 2013  Médoc
"Medicinal, herbal wine, with attractive white fruit aromas. The palate is rich and soft, with fresh honey and sweet fruits. Definitely sweet, it is still balanced with the fruits and the spirit underlay.",88,Ferreira NV Porto Branco  (Port)
"Aromas of roasted coffee bean, ripe plum and dark kitchen spice waft out of the glass. The forward palate offers mature wild cherry, licorice, sage and espresso that carry through to the firm finish. Drink through 2019.",89,Melini 2011 Vigneti La Selvanella Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"The great fruit produces a delicious wine that is also structured with a strong steely element. It is full of yellow fruits, layers of wood and juicy acidity. The aftertaste is as bright as a button.",91,Trenel Fils 2012  Pouilly-Fuissé
"Gattinara (a pure expression of Nebbiolo) offers many of the aromatic characteristics one normally associates with Barbaresco and Barolo, two of Italy's greatest red wines. There are tones of small berry, cola, tar and licorice. The wine is tight and fresh overall and cleans the palate very well.",90,Travaglini 2004 Riserva  (Gattinara)
"This tastes far more expensive than the price would suggest. Sourced from both Red Mountain and Royal Slope vineyards, it's a smoke-, coffee- and licorice-laden wine, with expressive cassis and black cherry flavors at its core. It finishes with lovely, fine-grained tannins.",92,Elevation Cellars 2009 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Fragrant with notes of grapefruit, apple and lemon, this dry, delicately-framed Chardonnay is crisp with lemony acidity and an elegant citrus-rind flavor. It's refreshing and easy drinking, but could use a boost of intensity in the mid palate.",85,Lamoreaux Landing 2011 Estate Bottled Unoaked Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"Smooth and palate-coating, it's 100% varietal, with just the right balance between blackberry and black cherry fruit, and barrel-induced flavors of toffee, toasted macadamia nuts, and café crème.",91,Seven Hills 2012 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Don't expect explosive fruit from this wine. It delivers a pungent, spicy mix of cola, roasted meat and black olives instead, cushioned by ample weight in the mouth and a broad, creamy texture. Drink now–2020.",90,9 Mile Road 2013 Shiraz (Langhorne Creek)
"This wine would be a great value even for more money. It's bone dry, soft and extremely balanced, with cherry, black currant, plum and carob flavors that are grounded with a nice, sweet edge of fresh herbs and tobacco.",88,Napa Family Vineyards 2004 Reserve Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Burdese is Sicily's tip-of-the-hat to the great wines of Bordeaux. A blended red, the wine is elegant and firm, with dark concentration and earthy tones of leather and spice behind fresh berry and blackberry. Balance and length characterize the mouthfeel.",91,Planeta 2008 Burdese Red (Sicilia)
"With no oak but aged in stainless steel on the lees, this 100% Sauvignon Blanc is bone dry and crisp in acidity. It offers vibrant flavors of lemons, grapefruits and limes, with a touch of sweet honey on the finish.",87,Titus 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"This wine has typical Condrieu aromas and flavors of honey, apricot and white pepper, all carried by a fairly full-bodied, slightly oily palate. It's a rich wine, with lingering spice on the finish.",91,Les Vins de Vienne 2012  Condrieu
"The spicy and earthy nose on this sprightly bottling from the iconic vineyard is superb: pressed mulberry, beet and rhubarb aromas lifted by thyme, star anise and bay leaf. The palate is slightly mellower, with rounded pomegranate and cherry notes cut by pine needle-like spice.",93,Bien Nacido 2013 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"Thick black cherry, vanilla, licorice and kirsch aromas show on the nose of this blend of 40% Syrah, 34% Grenache and 26% Mourvèdre. The palate is also rich and juicy, with black currant, nutmeg and caramel-laced cappuccino flavors, bolstered by bright acidity.",92,Calcareous 2013 Tres Violet Red (Paso Robles)
"Lively and approachable with vinous tones of cherry, raspberry and cola, Col di Lamo delivers a bright, food-friendly Brunello. There's also a very attractive touch of chopped mint or eucalyptus on the close.",90,Col di Lamo 2006  Brunello di Montalcino
"Sweet and honeyed, but with enough tongue-tingling acidity to keep it almost in check, this is a well-made sweet table wine. Aromas and flavors blend tangerines and ripe apples.",85,Chateau Lafayette Reneau 2001 Johannisberg Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Bright, luminous and soft, this has a bouquet of spring flowers and exotic fruits. It's soft, with a sweet intensity that's not overdone or heavy. This is made by one of Europe's most successful wine co-operatives.",88,Cavit 2010 Zeveri Müller-Thurgau (Trentino Superiore)
"The Dão's very own Encruzado is the backbone of this beautiful fresh wine. Made by top winemaker Alvaro Castro, the wine is rich, full of pears, apricots and pears with a touch of nutmeg. It needs another year to age. Drink from early 2016.",91,Obrigado 2013 DAC Encruzado (Dão)
"Here's your basic everyday Zindandel at a good-value price. It's dry and tannic, with spicy flavors of blackberries and plums. Easy to drink, and it gains traction as as it warms in the glass.",86,Kenwood 2011 Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
"This is a smooth wine, soft with just a hint of tannins and with plenty of juicy acidity. Black-currant fruitiness dominates this crisp, clean and ready to drink wine.",84,DFJ Vinhos 2016 Cara Viva Tinto Red (Lisboa)
"This traditional-method Riesling sekt, made from a collection of Bernkastel vineyard sites, has been a consistent crowd pleaser from vintage to vintage. It's a cutting, spry wine with delicate, persistent bubbles and concentrated green apple, lemon and lime flavors. Brut in style, with revitalizing acidity and complexities of caramelized sugar and nuts, it makes an ideal apéritif.",90,Hansen-Lauer 2014 Brut Sekt Riesling (Mosel)
"Bristles of lemon-lime acidity lend energy and vibe to this unusually refreshing Gewürztraminer. Perfumed with ripe tropical fruit and voluptuous on the palate, it maintains varietal typicity, but has an irresistible zest that's worth seeking out.",89,Standing Stone 2013 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes)
"Bracing and full-bodied, this offers dried sour cherry, raisin and licorice flavors alongside raspy tannins that clench the finish. Give the tannins another few years to unwind then drink up before the remaining fruit disappears.",86,San Giuseppe 2013  Amarone della Valpolicella
"A French version of a brand that is more familiar in Chile as Viña San Esteban, this wine has more stylistically to do with South America than southwest France. It is soft, juicy, rounded and with attractive ripe tannins. The wine is ready to drink.",85,Vino San Esteban 2015 Réserve Malbec
"Punchy and forward, this fruity concoction offers loads of ripe pineapple, peach and citrus flavors. It's slightly off dry and straightforward in style but neatly balanced. Sharp lemon-lime acidity lends a pleasantly zesty kick to the finish.",89,Villa Huesgen 2015 1735 Riesling (Mosel)
"Lifted aromas of cherry Jell-O, spicy raspberry and a kiss of anise show brightly on the nose. The palate offers a slight tannic grip, with strawberry and cherry flavors leading to a lightly peppered finish.",86,Veramar 2013 Estate Club Cabernet Franc (Shenandoah Valley)
"The wine is King Estate's superpremium offering, made exclusively with organically grown grapes from the estate vineyard. Lush and earthy, it's got a lot of forward, tart berry fruit power, turns a bit soft in the middle, and sails away with a hint of heat and a lick of chocolate.",90,King Estate 2008 Domaine Pinot Noir (Oregon)
"This wine shows Pinot Grigio's bright, ripe lemongrass and peach flavors, touched with a kiss of honey. But it's balanced and crisp in acidity.",88,Black Stallion 2012 Pinot Grigio (California)
"Like the name suggests, this Carmenère is opaque purple in color, with earthy, complex aromas of graphite, char and herbal black currant. The palate is, not surprisingly, saturated and dense. Flavors of toasty, minty black fruits are charred, while the finish tastes roasted, heavily oaked and blackened. Drink through 2021.",92,Montes 2013 Purple Angel Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"In a nod to the most heartfelt of Veneto wine traditions, the bottle is closed with white string that holds the cork in place. Once open, the bottle boasts bright perfumes of peach blossom, honey and citrus.",87,De Faveri NV Frizzante Spago  (Prosecco Treviso)
"Ripe and spicy, this is an attractive package of warm tannins and red berries. This wine has a solid, dry core, but it will develop fast—delicious within a year.",85,Château de Fontenille 2010  Bordeaux
"This fruity wine is made to be drunk young. It has soft tannins, perfumed blackberry fruit and just enough acidity. Smoothly textured, it's a great barbecue-style of red. The wine is named after the vineyard rather than after the literal Portuguese meaning of “scantily dressed.” Drink now.",86,J. Portugal Ramos 2015 Pouca Roupa Tinto Red (Alentejano)
Prinsi's Gaia Principe cru is located very near the Gallina vineyard and shows slightly softer and less intense aromas. Winemaking plays a big role here: This is an oak-driven wine that melds supple aromas of vanilla and sweet spice over a lively base of red fruit. There's also a mineral note of chalk or wet stone that lingers long on the finish.,90,Prinsi 2004 Gaia Principe  (Barbaresco)
"This is a concentrated, voluptuous white, made from mature vines on the producer's estate. It opens in a richness of apricot fuzz, gooseberry and banana, kept fresh by moderate acidity and a flourish of wildflowers and white pepper.",87,Chalk Hill 2014 North Slope Pinot Gris (Chalk Hill)
"Bitter tannins and heavy toast influence suggest a wine that has been heavily extracted. Rich and sweet-tasting, it has power and a solid, tannic presence.",87,Château Barde Haut 2009  Saint-Émilion
"From a vineyard planted on the edge of Freestone by James MacPhail of MacPhail Family Wines and respected grower Jim Pratt, this wine opens with a splash of white pepper that persists on the soft, silky palate. Roses and black tea provide savory flavor, with an intensity of forest floor.",88,Sante Arcangeli 2014 Mardikian Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Fleshy aromas of melon and peach are leesy and soft. This is more angular and acidic on the palate, which fails to fan out. Nectarine and salty briny flavors finish with papaya and peach notes.",84,Aljibes 2014 VA Viña Aljibes Sauvignon Blanc-Chardonnay (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"A dry wine, firmly tannic, although also with acidity and black currant fruit. Spices and licorice add interest, while the tannins finish this attractive wine.",88,W. & J. Graham's NV Six Grapes Reserve  (Port)
"Lemberger, also known as Blaufränkisch, was planted here in the 1970s—the winery believes it was the first commercial bottling in the country. This is a seriously good wine, worthy of special attention. It could be mistaken for a particularly fine country wine from Italy, southern France or Spain, with its old vine complexity, red and blue fruits and whiff of tanned leather.",90,Kiona 2011 Estate Bottled Lemberger (Red Mountain)
"Montana (sold as Brancott here in the U.S.) has been trying to make good Pinot at a good price for years, and they seem to be getting closer to their goal. The 2007 South Island Pinot blends fruit from Waipara and Marlborough into a soft, round, cuddly whole, redolent of root beer and beet root and ending with a flourish of tart cherries. Drink now.",86,Brancott 2007 Pinot Noir (South Island)
"The distinct black and white pepper nose on this wine by Siduri's Adam Lee evolves into gingerbread and cinnamon, all backed up by riper scents of blackberry extract. It's light in density, but pops with black cherry and more berry flavors, all carrying a citrus-like tannic grip.",92,Novy 2012 Sierra Mar Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"A blend that includes Syrah and Tannat as well as Bordeaux grapes, this is a wood-aged, ripe and rich wine. A tense streak of acidity heightens the effect of the black currant fruits. Spice at the end comes from the wood. Drink from 2016.",89,Domaine de Gensac 2012 Piaffer Red (Gers)
"Comprised of equal parts sweet, toasty oak, brisk acidity and ripe tropical fruit and citrus flavors, this Chardonnay is successfully made in the popular style. It's creamy and rich, with a vanilla honey sweetness. Easily Ventana's best Chard ever.",88,Ventana 2011 Estate Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco)
"Touched with spicy wood, this is a classic smoky wine from Cabernet Franc, ripe while still held in tension by the acidity and dry tannins. It's dry with red plum and black currant freshness. Drink from 2016.",88,Château de Brézé 2012 Clos Mazurique  (Saumur)
"This blend of 35% Kékfrankos, 34% Merlot, 27% Pinot Noir and 4% Cabernet Franc has aromas of tart cherry, pomegranate and black pepper. It is medium bodied with flavors of red plums and tart cherry.",88,Weninger 2011 Red (Sopron)
"This brawny, earthy 11-year-old opens with aromas of leather, game, tobacco, graphite and mature plum. Given its age, it's surprisingly youthful, displaying dried dark cherry, fig, prune, black pepper and tobacco flavors alongside an assertive, tannic backbone. Drink through 2018.",90,Terre de la Custodia 2003 Exubera  (Montefalco Sagrantino)
"Forward and flavorful, this brings together five different grapes from eight different vineyards, though it is mostly (70%) Wahluke Slope Cabernet Sauvignon. I found a hint of funk, cooked raisin, and lots of baking spices. Penetrating, unusual flavors, but overall not quite together.",85,Powers 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Crisp and refreshing, it delivers honeysuckle, ripe yellow peach, pink grapefruit and lemon-lime sensations. Energizing minerality and crisp acidity give a pristine finish.",90,St. Pauls 2013 Riesling (Alto Adige)
"Lovely scents of rose petal, iris and perfumed berry slowly take shape in this striking wine. The full-bodied palate delivers ripe red cherry, licorice, white pepper, cinnamon and sage alongside firm, fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity. A mineral note wraps around the finish. Hold for even more complexity; drink 2019–2024.",94,Elvio Cogno 2012 Ravera  (Barolo)
"A blend of Sangiovese (38%), Merlot (31%) and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine displays each in turn with aromas and flavors of dried herbs, coffee, tobacco and cherry. The style is reserved, with plenty of fruit and acid but subtle oak—perfect for the dinner table.",91,Cavatappi 2012 San Pietro Tuscan Style Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This wine smells like dried herbs and white pepper, tastes herbaceous and feels rather stiff on the tongue. Being lean in style, it's not a great stand-alone drink but will be good at the dinner table.",85,Tangley Oaks 2012 Lot 16 Cabernet Sauvignon (North Coast)
"Cascina Ballarin's Barolo Bricco Rocca comes from the La Morra area of the Langhe and offers intense aromas of blue flower, violets, almond flowers, cinnamon and powdered licorice. The focus here is on elegance and harmony and the mouthfeel follows through with power and determination. This is a truly beautiful wine",94,Cascina Ballarin 2005 Bricco Rocca  (Barolo)
"This Cab has some nice things going on in its velvety mouthfeel, but it's rather jammy-fruity and chocolatey, like a Starbucks coffee-based drink with a squirt of raspberry syrup. Doesn't seem to be ageworthy, so drink up.",85,Fontanella 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder)
"Lively and zesty on the nose, this bottling shows aromas of crushed cranberry, fennel, sagebrush and the lightest hint of Earl Grey tea, almost leaning into Kalamata olives. Pencil lead, tarragon, olive, black pepper, sage and pine sap hit on the palate, with an underlying base of rose buds, lavender and tart plums. Only 140 cases were made, so get it fast.",94,Point & Line 2014 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Dark concentration and medium aromatic intensity open Barolo Castelletto. There's a delicate, feminine side to this Nebbiolo that presents itself through aromas of pressed violet, root beer, chopped mint and peppermint. Those fresh overtones are backed by tight, gripping tannins. Drink after 2018.",90,Mauro Veglio 2007 Castelletto  (Barolo)
"This is a textured wine with ripe and perfumed fruitiness. Honeyed in style and medium-sweet on the palate, it's a complex, rich wine that's ready to drink now, but could also improve with age.",92,Rieflé 2010 Steinert Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Shows its cool-climate origins with a certain austerity that accompanies the exotic wild cherry, currant, Mandarin orange and root beer flavors, accented with sweet smoky oak. A rush of acids and tannins takes over the palate, strongly suggesting modest ageability. Give this Pinot Noir a year or two in the cellar.",90,Saudade 2007 Split Rock Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This is attractively fruity in aroma, accented by smoke and spices. It smells plummy and tastes a bit like wood smoke and black pepper. Medium to full bodied, it is well balanced and just tannic enough to keep the texture firm and appetizing.",88,Graziano 2011 Grenache (Mendocino County)
"Tobacco and cedar aromas add complexity to this medium-bodied wine that relies more on savory, herbal and spicy notes than fruit flavors.",87,Fenestra 2012 Silvaspoons Vineyard Malbec (Lodi)
"Compared to Artesa's three other 2009 Pinot Noirs, this one's the least drinkable at this time. Although it's very extracted in cherry and raspberry fruit, it's jammy-simple, like a spoonful of marmalade, with a scour of acidity. Your best bet is to cellar it for 4–6 years and see what happens, but odds are you won't be disappointed.",93,Artesa 2009 Artisan Series Sangiacomo Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"A 30-year-old tawny that shows great intensity and rich dried fruits and honey as well as the woody flavors from long aging in barrel. It's a very fine wine, dry in character with touches of bitter marmalade and finished with intense acidity. Like all tawnies, the wine is ready to drink.",94,Quinta do Vallado NV 30 Years Old Tawny  (Port)
"Produced in the area of the Alpilles mountains surrounding Les Baux de Provence, this fruity wine is full and ripe. A touch of caramel gives richness and balances the acidity and the intense red currant final fruitiness. The blend is Grenache, Cinsault, Syrah, Mouvédre and Cabernet Sauvignon",88,Domaine de Valdition 2014 Tradition Rosé (Alpilles)
"Ripe and soft. There is an attractive citrus element that gives structure, wih acidity coming through. Delicious now. Screwcap.",87,Domaine Zinck 2009 Riesling (Alsace)
"This could very well be Chile's most expressive, interesting white Sauvignon. It's got all those prickly pineapple, passion fruit, scallion and pepper notes that are typical, and also a lot of pure citrus flavors backing it all up. The mouthfeel is zesty and spirited, but there's natural roundness, too. Some licorice adds complexity to the finish. Best Buy.",89,Montes 2002 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"This offers ripe cherry and blackberry notes, followed by bright acidity and a palate that bears medium density. It's a great food wine to pair with breaded veal, sausage or meatloaf.",88,Leone de Castris 2010 Elo Veni Negroamaro (Salento)
"With complex aromas of cedar, tobacco, tree bark, herbs and blackberry, this lush, tightly packed Syrah gets off to a fine start. A mouthfilling palate with baked but controlled flavors of boysenberry, leather and chocolate finishes long, minty and with classy herb flavors. For a modern, oaky Syrah, this is excellent. Drink now through 2017.",92,Lagar de Bezana 2010 Edicion Limitada Single Vineyard Syrah (Cachapoal Valley)
"Merlot and Syrah make up the majority of this blend. Aromas of cherry, coffee, pencil lead and barrel spices are initially light and elusive while the plum and vanilla and flavors are much more generous.",88,Mercer 2013 Sharp Sisters Red (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Equally proportioned between the two varieties, this wine shows perfumed aromas of green herbs, coffee, dark plum and floral notes. The fruit flavors are elegant, with chalky, lightly drying tannins.",87,Three Rivers 2013 Malbec-Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Along with a slightly oxidative character, this perfumed wine has a ripe yellow fruit and spice edge. It is already delicious to drink.",89,Château Jean Faux 2016  Bordeaux Blanc
"Slightly overripe aromas of raisin and prune dominate the nose on this jammy, spongy-feeling gran reserva. Soft, ripe cassis and plum flavors come with spice and tobacco accents. On a savory finish, prune comes back into play, thus cementing a ripe, jammy essence. Drink through 2025.",92,Marqués de Murrieta 2010 Finca Ygay Gran Reserva Limited Edition  (Rioja)
"It's a pleasure to see another winery determined to explore the potential of Oregon Riesling, here sourced from a top site in the Ribbon Ridge AVA. Ripe, round and rich, this offers a complex mix of grilled peach, pineapple and papaya fruit, with a lively touch of mint. The underpinning of wet stone minerality adds length and texture. This belongs among the very best Rieslings from the state.",94,Ovum 2015 Toro y Scorpio Riesling (Ribbon Ridge)
"Crisp. dry and fruity, this wine has a light touch of citrus and fresh acidity. Fruity with a slight sparkle, it's an ideal apéritif.",85,Wines & Winemakers 2012 Azul Portugal Escolha White (Vinho Verde)
"Leathery plum and berry aromas come with a touch of char. This blend of Shiraz and Tempranillo feels round and solid. Familiar flavors of berry fruits and cherry are a bit spicy, while the finish tastes of black fruits and feels right.",87,Vicente Gandia 2014 El Miracle 120 Tempranillo-Shiraz (Valencia)
"Strong, almost overpowering in fruit, which dominates at the cost of balance. Shows massive blackberries, currants and cherries, as well as sweet oak, but you wish there were more subtlety.",84,Hans Fahden 2006 Mountain Cuvée Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"This wine is medium-bodied, with slightly briny flavors of cherry, earth and herb. It's balanced and holds interest, with a clear emphasis on the herbal aspect of Oregon Pinot Noir.",87,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2010 Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This Pinot shows basic varietal character, displaying ripe, opulent raspberry and cherry pie flavors, with a touch of toasty oak. It's soft enough to drink now.",86,River Road 2012 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Tasting a little on the sweet side, this is rich in citrus, apricot, pear and peach flavors. It will pair well with Asian fare, or with a savory salad of greens, goat cheese and grapefruit.",85,Markham 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Always impressive, this wine is structured and powerful, with firm tannins that are still coming together. Packed with black fruits and tannins, it conveys a rich, almost Port-like quality, perhaps because the grapes are foot-trodden as in Port. Drink this wine from 2022.",95,Quinta Vale Dona Maria 2014 Vinha da Francisca Red (Douro)
"Fruity wine, packed with red berries, lightweight tannins and a stalky black currant fruit character. It's not for aging, it is a wine that has friendly acidity and an open, generous nature. Drink now.",86,Château de Chambert 2011 Les Loges de Carlat Malbec-Merlot (Cahors)
"Fresh, gushing fruit flavors such as raspberry, red cherry and boysenberry fill out this expressive and well-balanced wine. It is sweetly fruity in aroma, full-flavored, full-bodied, firm and dry in texture but not heavy. It craves ribs or wood-fired pizza.",90,Berryessa Gap 2011 California Series Zinfandel (Yolo County)

"Earthy, subtle aromas of cured meats, licorice and baked plum are smooth and sly. This feels firm, structured and staunch in the mouth, while flavors of earthy plum, berry, carob, tea and spice finish dry and elegant. This mature Rioja is ready to drink now.",91,Zinio 2006 Vendimia Seleccionada Reserva  (Rioja)
"This is a structured wine, firm with tannins. Behind the structure, the attractive black-plum fruits are still developing. The wine is dense and solid and will be ready from 2018.",85,Château l'Eglise Saget 2015  Bordeaux
"The wine starts off slowly due to a note of almond nut or cardboard that masks the natural fruit. Once it gets started, however, this luminous sparkling Prosecco offers cheerful notes of stone fruit and pear.",85,Astoria 2008 Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
"Dense and firm, dark plum fruits and tight tannins frame this wine against its fruits and spice flavors. Although it is not a heavyweight, the intensity of flavors more than compensates.",89,R&A; Pfaffl 2008 Altenberg St. Laurent (Niederösterreich)
"From the oldest Chenin Blanc vines in the Dry Creek Valley, winemaker Leo Hansen crafts a dry, floral white with textured character and nuanced acidity that's garnished with layers of apple, herb and pear, and just a suggestion of tropical flourish on the finish.",90,Leo Steen Wines 2011 Saini Farms Chenin Blanc (Dry Creek Valley)
"Lightly spiced wine, with a fat texture, soft and rounded, just seasoned with pepper.",83,Domaine Specht 2009 Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Lemon pith and ripe peach aromas are clouded under a distinctly medicinal tone of baby aspirin. While there is nice roundness to the palate and balanced acidity to boot, the flavors are mild showings of orchard fruit and lemon curd.",84,Wyncroft 2013 Wren Song Riesling (Lake Michigan Shore)
"A pale red of exquisite slenderness and easy, totally charming red-cherry fruit. Use this almost as you would a rosé and chill it a little: the result will be the most charming, easy, cherry-ish and refreshing red ever. Drink soon.",88,Eschenhof Holzer 2014 Zweigelt (Wagram)
"Creamy lemon curd and fresh apple notes are offset by savory tones of mushroom and truffle in this very classic Chardonnay sparkler. A laser-edged strike of lemon-lime acidity grips the midpalate but is cushioned neatly by soft, mouth-filling mousse that lingers on the finish.",90,Fox Run 2012 Blanc de Blancs Méthode Traditionelle Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"Lockwood's lost a lot of steam over the years. This '06 Chard is thin and watery, with just a squirt of lemon and lime flavor.",81,Lockwood 2006 Chardonnay (Monterey)
"You won't be disappointed with this attractively priced Saint-Chinian. Floral and herbal, with strong scents of lavender, licorice, laurel and menthol all infusing the black cherry, currant and boysenberry center. Rich and concentrated with a tecture like crushed velvet and fine but well-structured tannins. Hints of black pepper and bittersweet chocolate grace the close.",91,Gérard Bertrand 2009 Syrah-Mourvèdre Syrah-Mourvèdre (Saint-Chinian)
"An overtly raisiny, almost cooked bouquet, leads this full-bodied, ultraripe CS. It is appealing for its richness, density and weight. Flavors of cassis and blackberry are on the fringe of being syrupy, while moss, prune, black pepper and herbal flavors pop up on a plush finish.",87,Casarena 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
). Rubiolo is a soft and lush Chianti Classico with ripe fruit aromas backed by easy leather and tobacco. The wine shows nice lines and supple spice.,88,Gagliole 2009 Rubiolo  (Chianti Classico)
"This leads with blue flower, camphor, crushed herb and red berry aromas. Firmly structured and linear, the palate delivers succulent red cherry, crushed strawberry, cinnamon and star anise flavors supported by a backbone of vibrant acidity and firm, refined tannins. Drink 2022–2032.",92,Negro Giuseppe 2014 Pian Cavallo  (Barbaresco)
"Clean and savory, this has jammy orange and apricot flavors, which finish with a touch of honey. The acidity is bright and zesty. The chilly vintage shows in the form of a touch of green mint.",86,Girard 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Fermented and aged in large French and Austrian casks, this single vineyard Pinot Grigio opens with aromas that recall oak, yellow apple and candied citrus peel. The round palate offers white peach, vanilla pear, apple and lemon drop alongside racy acidity.",88,Tramin 2014 Unterebner Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige)
"A heavy dose of petrol is the aromatic greeting, and it comes with hints of rubber, latex and waxy white fruits. Feels tangy and fresh due to blazing acidity, while it tastes both of tropical fruits and diesel. Long and chiseled on the finish.",86,Meli 2010 Riesling (Central Valley)
"Deep pink in color, this blend of 42% Syrah, 30% Grenache, 11% Cinsaut, 11% Mourvèdre and 6% Counoise offers light strawberry and pomegranate aromas on the tightly wound nose. Bountiful, refreshing acidity powers the palate, but the flavors are sparse, just hinting at sour raspberry and pomegranate.",86,Robert Hall 2015 Rose de Robles Rosé (Paso Robles)
This blend of Sangiovese and Canaiolo is enhanced with a small percentage of Merlot. That addition heightens the wine's softness and renders a richer mouthfeel.,85,Straccali 2010  Chianti
"Bright, ripe, seemingly sweet fruit fills the aromas and flavors of this soft and generous wine blended from Pinot Noir, Pinotage and Pinot Meunier grapes. It floods the palate with rich raspberry and black cherry notes. And since the tannins are very light and the acidity low, it has a pillowy texture.",88,Saint Gregory 2015 Red (Mendocino County)
"There are black plums, iron, iodine, fudge, espresso and a touch of squid ink aromas on the nose of this blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 14% Cabernet Franc, 10% Malbec and 6% Petit Verdot. The palate is driven by fudge and chocolate, showing plum jam fruits and noticeable oak and cedar smoke elements.",90,Pear Valley 2010 Distraction Red (Paso Robles)
"Despite the price, this wine is no bargain. It's soft, a little sweet and Porty, with a hot mouthfeel from high alcohol. Okay in a pinch with barbecue.",81,Fair Hare NV Zinfandel (North Coast)
"Osborne is now in Ribera del Duero, and if this wine is an indication of what to expect, then work needs to be done. It has a cheesey nose with no real fruit character. The palate has acidic freshness but also a dearth of substance and a grabby feel. It's not bad wine per se, but in RDD the competition is stiff and this isn't going to draw many converts.",84,Osborne Selección 2003 Señorio del Cid Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"This wine is a blend of 60% Syrah from Funk Estate in The Rocks and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon from McClellan Estate. It draws you into the glass with aromas of plum, coffee, huckleberry, black olive and light spices. The feel—plush and palate-coating—is the real star of the show, with persistent blue fruit and coffee flavors on the finish.",92,Saviah 2012 Hunt & Gather Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Rondineto is a sharp and thorny wine with strange aromas of pickled fruit, green olive or caper. The mouthfeel is thin and crisp.",83,Fattoria Giuseppe Savini 2011 Rondineto  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo)
"Concentrated red cherry, black tea leaf and a touch of minerality show on the nose of this blend of 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Merlot, 14% Malbec, 12% Cabernet Franc and 7% Petit Verdot. A line of concentrated blackberry powers the palate, which also offers woody mint and rose-petal flavors.",88,Rancho Sisquoc 2012 Cellar Select Meritage (Santa Barbara County)
"A densely concentrated but unbalanced wine, it opens with aromas of stewed prunes, plum, oak, coconut and espresso. The heavy wood influence carries over to the palate. Black cherry notes are overwhelmed by oak, vanilla extract and coffee bean. Drying wood tannins dominate the finish.",86,Casa Raia 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
"Earthy, tarry, gritty aromas come with generous black-fruit scents. This is bold, bright and lively in character, with juicy acidity creating a racy pulse. Spice, licorice, plum and tomato flavors finish fresh and elegant, with clarity and length. Drink through 2017.",92,Lapostolle 2011 Collection El Rosario Syrah (San Antonio)
"This is a 100% varietal wine, with fruit sourced from Sonoma Mountain as well as Dry Creek and Alexander valleys. Black fruit wraps around generous tannin and oak as a touch of cola spice attempts to liven things up on the palate.",84,Martin Ray 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"Deep old gold in color, this wine speaks of its years in wood. While it has retained its fruit, it has also rich toast, sultanas and considerable sweetness that is balanced by the intense acidity at the back. It's a beautiful wine, ready to drink like any aged tawny.",91,Quinta das Carvalhas NV 20 Year Old Tawny  (Port)
"A new blend for Pepper Bridge, Trine is named for the three main partners and includes all five Bordeaux red grapes. Tannic and earthy, with a powerful core of dark fruit, this needs more bottle time to fully integrate. Layers of fruit are mixed with loam, iron, licorice and espresso, full-bodied and deep.",91,Pepper Bridge 2008 Trine Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Lime, melon and citrus aromas are basic but clean. The palate is pulpy in feel, while pithy flavors of white grapefruit and generic citrus fruits finish with a mild note of papaya.",84,Dominio de Eguren 2013 Protocolo White (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"An interesting wine that grows more complex as it sits and warms in the glass. The vineyard long has been source to one of Ravenswood's best Zinfandels, and the 2007 was really great. This '08 is a tad less complex, but shows classic Zinfandel character, with wild berry, tobacco and pepper spice notes, as well as a rocky minerality. It should age for a very long time, although the point score is unlikely to change.",92,Ravenswood 2008 Dickerson Zinfandel (Napa Valley)
"Given ample time in oak, this wine delivers size and strength, a feisty celebration of big blackberry fruit and muscular tannins, well representative of both the vineyard and the vintage. Strawberry, mushroom and truffle figure prominently, with a finish of black tea.",90,Pali 2012 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"A consistent performer from year to year, Villa Maria's 2009 Private Bin Sauvignon Blanc hints at asparagus, which kept my enthusiasm a little more limited than in the past. But there's ample grapefruit and bright Green Gage plum on the finish.",87,Villa Maria 2009 Private Bin Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Almost luscious pear aromas and notes of peardrop make for a very fruity nose. The palate has a fruity, lemony ease, while the body is slender, dry and has some spritz. The lemon freshness is vivid, brightening everything on this easy, fruity summer wine.",89,Winzer Krems 2016 GV Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"A tremendous achievement in Merlot. The vineyard, around 1,600 feet up on Mt. Veeder, is now owned by the Jackson family, and the winemaker is Chris Carpenter, who oversees Cardinale. In fact, this Merlot bears an uncanny resemblance to Cardinale in the dramatically ripe, sweet fruit and superb, tannin-based structure. It's 100% Merlot, with hefty yet balanced alcohol, and the wine easily handles the 85% new French oak in which it was aged for 22 months.",98,Mt. Brave 2008 Merlot (Mount Veeder)
"The name is silly, but the wine is serious. The winemaker wisely blended in some Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot to add structure to Cab Franc's seductive fruit. It's rich in cherries and raspberries, with great acidity and tannins. It's pretty oaky, but the fruit stands up to it. What a beauty with a great steak. Drink now–2018.",93,Oakville East 2011 Franc 'N Stern Cabernet Franc (Oakville)
"Add Raptor Ridge to the slender ranks of Oregon wineries producing this off-the-radar Alsatian grape. Sourced from the Zenith vineyard and aged 11 months in neutral oak, this is a tightly wound, lightly spicy white wine. Crisp peppery highlights somewhat recall a domestic Grüner Veltliner, and the barrel aging has begun to round out the sharp edges. Drink now through 2020.",89,Raptor Ridge 2015 Auxerrois (Eola-Amity Hills)
"A simple, youthful white, perfumed and spicy as well as crisply fruity. From the Entre-deux-Mers region, it is cool, clean, laden with green plums and white currant flavors. For aging over the next few months.",85,Château du Pin Franc 2012  Bordeaux Blanc
"Nothing has quite reached the heights of the original release of this wine, but every version has been solidly made by winemaker Rich Funk of Saviah. This is sleek, firm, with cassis and tart red berries. The balance is fine and the finish is clean and shows just a hint of baking chocolate. It's a justifiably popular bottle and a great summer go-to red.",88,Saviah NV The Jack Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Dry and reedy smelling, with juicy berry-cherry aromas and flavors. The wine is snappy, zesty and juicy, with accents of cocoa and pepper. Clean, simple Cabernet with ample pop and freshness.",85,Morandé 2009 Pionero Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"This bottling's extremely fresh aromas of lime meet with a rounded clarified butter, drawing one in for sip after sip. That vibrancy extends to the lightly presented palate, where flavors of lime juice, lemon peels and crisp pear ride a rising wave of acidity across a tightly wound texture.",91,Bernardus 2015 Rosella's Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Fragrant with cut grass, peavine and sweet hay, leading into light fruit flavors of apple and pear. There are suggestions of sliced orange, and the creamy, textural mouthfeel derived from nine months of aging on the lees.",93,Buty 2009 Sémillon/Sauvignon/Muscadelle White (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Massive blackberry, vanilla and marshmallow aromas are voluptuous. A just-right mix of lushness and tannins determines the palate, which hosts toasty flavors of chocolate and blackberry. A smooth finish with firm but manageable residual tannins is intense but not rough. Drink through 2028.",94,Dominio de Atauta 2012 Llanos del Almendro  (Ribera del Duero)
"With a color more red than gold, this is an intensely rich wine, with flavors of jellied plum, honey and bottled cherry. The tannins give the wine structure as well as sweetness and richness. In the end, acidity offers a pleasant counterbalance.",91,Kracher 2011 Beerenauslese Zweigelt (Burgenland)
"This blend of 47% Grenache, 35% Mourvèdre and 18% Syrah is reminiscent of a walk through the dewy sagebrush, with dried wild herbs most prominent alongside cola, rustic plum and mulberry and a hint of pine forest. Those forest-like flavors show on the sip as well, with bay leaf, green peppercorn and a savory salts enhancing the baked berry and tangy plum skin elements—a GSM with teeth and structure.",92,Asuncion Ridge 2014 Salacious Red (Paso Robles)
"The best Syrah so far from Cadaretta, this pure varietal is three-quarters Pepper Bridge and one-quarter Stone Tree Vineyard fruit. The purity and focus are compelling. Deep boysenberry fruit is highlighted with black olive and dusty coffee. Tight and expressive.",91,Cadaretta 2008 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Showing the superb structure of the vintage and the spectacular way this great vineyard can ripen Pinot Noir, this polished wine is not only delicious from the get-go, but ageable. Floods the mouth with lush black cherry, red currant, cola, sweet oak, anise, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors that go on and on. A memorable wine that should slowly gather steam and peak by 2011, then begin a long, steady arc downward.",97,Arista 2005 Ferrington Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"This small producer holds some wines back for late release, and in this instance it's a wonderful gift to consumers. Drinking splendidly, the 2009 has rounded, well-integrated, generous flavors of plum and cherry, dusty gravel, and firm, polished tannins. There's a light hint of bark, and overall a marvelous balance. It's maturing, but not anywhere near done.",92,Carlton Hill 2009 Pinot Noir
"Vanilla, saffron and other exotic yellow spices are laced amidst the dried apples, dried pineapples and just-cut lemons on the nose of this wine from a vineyard on the cool western fringe of the appellation. It's fairly broad in the mouth, with lots of lemon zest, cooked apples and more vanilla, cut by a pithy bitterness.",92,Ryan Cochrane 2013 Solomon Hills Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"With its bright pink color and fruity acidity, this is a candy-flavored, crisp wine. It is as bright in its flavors as it is in its color. It is light and ready to drink.",84,Domaine Dupeuble Père et Fils 2014 Gamay (Beaujolais Rosé)
"A big, impressive wine, smoky and juicy, the wood an important element in its youthful state. Blackberries, spice and black cherry flavors are there along with cocoa and broad tannins. It is a beautiful wine, for aging 4–5 years.",92,Markowitsch 2007 Rosenberg Red (Carnuntum)
"Cardamom and vanilla lend warmth and spice to fresh black cherry and blueberry flavors in this sprightly wine. It's rich and ripe in fruit concentration, but delicately textured with a brisk, spry finish.",87,Bedell 2012 Malbec (North Fork of Long Island)
"This wine's cranberry, raspberry and cherry flavors are spicy and tart, carrying a suggestion of hard candy. It's consistent throught its tart finish and promises much development ahead. Drink now through the late 2020s.",91,Elk Cove 2015 Mount Richmond Pinot Noir
"It's terribly hard to make an expensive, upscale Cab Franc that succeeds. The variety on its own tends toward cherry fruit simplicity. In this bottling, von Strasser has added Merlot and even Zinfandel to perk things up with dark stone fruit and tannic depth. It's an elegant, dry wine, but at this price, not in the same league as their fabulous Cabernet Sauvignons.",87,Von Strasser 2005 Marcellini Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Diamond Mountain District)
"This is classic and fun, bold and fruity, with weight coming from the firm tannins. Pair this with food.",85,Bouchard Aîné & Fils 2012 Nouveau  (Beaujolais)
"Mazuelo is almost always a blending grape for a reason: it's limited in depth and weighty. So it's no surprise that this opens with leather, prune and bullish jam and liqueur aromas. The palate, however, is kind of sharp and lacking depth, while the flavor profile is juicy, herbal and folds in cassis and berry. Snappy and acidic for an expensive varietal wine.",88,Dinastía Vivanco 2007 Colección Vivanco Parcelas de Mazuelo  (Rioja)
"A note of charred turmeric adds an exotic touch to the red plum and caramel aromas. The elevated acidity is the palate's driving force, thrusting outward, overshadowing the tannins that have the quality of powdered sand.",84,Fox Meadow 2009 Cabernet Franc (Virginia)
"90—92 Barrel sample. Fresh, rich, with attractive acidity and crisp, green apple and cream flavors. Well balanced, this wine shows excellent botrytis and sweetness properly together.",91,Château de Myrat 2006 Barrel sample  (Barsac)
"Laser strikes of acidity and deep, mineral intensitiy lend a grounded elegance to this otherwise sunny, yielding dessert wine. It's intensely honeyed, bursting with sweet pineapple and peach flavors, yet finely filigreed in mouthfeel. Delicious already, it should improve through 2040.",94,Dr. Loosen 2014 Erdener Treppchen Auslese Riesling (Mosel)
"Toasty woodsmoke aromas are matched by wild berry, cassis, cherry and marshmallow scents on the nose of this huge Malbec. Creamy feeling but also inky and fully concentrated, this tastes like black cherry and cough drops. Candied ripeness carries onto the finish along with chocolate and dry spice flavors. Drink through 2022.",94,Viña Cobos 2012 Bramare Marchiori Vineyard Malbec (Luján de Cuyo)
"Soft and sugary sweet, with spicy black raspberry and chocolate flavors, this is a clean, simple wine to drink with barbecue.",83,Calcareous 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Ripe and solid, this has dense tannins and a superstructure of opulent red-berry and black currant fruits. The wine is layered with coffee, wood-aging influence and a firm finish. It's big and has great potential.",93,Château Carbonnieux 2009  Pessac-Léognan
"Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon make up the majority of this wine. Light aromas of herb, coffee bean and barrel spice lead to cranberry and cherry flavors that bring a lot of enjoyment.",89,Kiona NV Estate Pioneer Red Version I Red (Red Mountain)
"A delightful, light, strawberry wine. It has a bright, bubbly character and acidity that gives extra life to this classic apéritif wine. There is just a hint of softness from the fruit to finish.",87,Bailly-Lapierre NV Rosé Brut  (Crémant de Bourgogne)
Sunny whiffs of Meyer lemon and peach turn zestier on the palate of this dry Riesling. It's a delightfully quaffable wine marked by cutting mineral intensity. Drink now through 2019.,89,Loosen Bros. 2015 Dr. L Dry Riesling (Mosel)
"Hard spice, blackberry and leather form a firm opening salvo, then oak, mocha and chocolate notes take over on the bouquet. The palate is firm and healthy, with minerally berry, spice, leather and chocolaty flavors. Long, alert, pure and driving on the finish. Drink now through 2016.",91,Ferrer Bobet 2007 Red (Priorat)
"This lightly aromatic wine offers notes of butterscotch, peach and toasty spices. It's lighter in style with a creamy feel to the stone and tropical fruit flavors.",88,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2013 Indian Wells Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Made from organically farmed fruit, this easygoing Nero d'Avola offers juicy blackberry and sour cherry lightly framed by a white pepper accent. It's simple but well-made, with bright acidity. Pair it with summer salads or pizza.",86,Feudo di Santa Tresa 2013 Purato Made With Organic Grapes Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"This is a rich wine made to be drunk young. It has spice, a smoky-bacon flavor and warm-hearted red plum and damson fruitiness. The wood aging shows through in hints of toast. The wine is ready now.",87,Domaine Rotier 2015 Esquisse Red (Gaillac)
"Martella's Hammer Syrah, which is a statewide blend, consistently is as good as, if not better than, its more expensive bottlings. As in the past, the '06 is very dry, crisp and somewhat tannic. What it lacks in fruity richness it more than makes up in structural balance and elegance, but you'll find enough cherry, currant, tobacco and sweet oak flavors to satisfy.",90,Martella 2006 Hammer Syrah (California)
"A well-priced wine packed tight in oak-aged aromas of ripe fruit and spice. There's a warm, jammy feel and the mouthfeel is soft and easy.",86,Colosi 2008 Red (Sicilia)
"Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot are combined to produce a beautiful red wine of intensity, persistency and integrity. Bright blackberry and cherry aromas are backed by crushed pepper and green mountain herbs.",92,Tenuta San Leonardo 2005 San Leonardo Red (Vigneti delle Dolomiti)
"Winemaking team Alex MacGregor and David Ramey have produced a beautiful Sauvignon Blanc here, from organically farmed grapes grown in several vineyards throughout Mendocino County, including owner John Fetzer's Kathleen's Vineyard, named for his mom. Barrel-fermented but having not undergone ML, the wine is deliciously fresh and vibrant with lots of minerality to recommend, as well as depth.",90,Saracina 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino County)
"The winery's reserve Chard has consistently been the best among their five Chards. The '05 is a dramatic wine, although oak-o-phobes might find it toothpicky. It is smoky and buttery and caramelly, but a year or so should knit that together with the ripe tropical fruits and make the wine seamlessly complex.",94,Chateau St. Jean 2005 Reserve Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"Hailing from top sites Klipsun, Kiona and Ciel du Cheval, this wine is near equally split between between Merlot (49%) and Cabernet Franc (44%), with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. Notes of dark raspberries and flowers with abundant oak accents lead to surprisingly silky tannins for this appellation and producer.",91,Mark Ryan 2012 Long Haul Red (Red Mountain)
"Fresh and buoyant, this has bright aromas of cherry cough drop, cola, rosemary oil and ginger. It is ethereal and clean with a very lively and polished mouthfeel.",90,Barale Fratelli 2008 Vigna Castellero  (Barolo)
"This is a rich smooth wine, full of delicious citrus and apple-fruit flavors. It is ripe, still with signs of wood aging that add a juicy character to the wine. It is developing well and should be ready to drink from 2018.",90,Roux Père et Fils 2014 Champlots Premier Cru  (Saint-Aubin)
"Mature black-skinned fruit, new leather, Mediterranean herb and dark spice are some of the aromas you'll find on this big, bold red. The brawny monolithic palate doles out ripe plum, black cherry marinated in spirits and cake spice alongside chewy tannins and the warmth of evident alcohol. Drink 2018–2025.",91,Podere Paganico 2010 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"The aromas draw you into the glass, with brooding notes of purple fruit, mineral and baking spice. The cherry flavors are full in feel, showing impressive purity and depth. There's no trace of new oak in sight.",92,Syncline 2014 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Syrah (Red Mountain)
"A blast of ripe stone fruit accompanies whiffs of saline and balsamic herbs. The juicy palate boasts yellow peach, pink grapefruit and pear with hints of sage and eucalyptus. Mineral marks the finish.",89,Di Meo 2012  Greco di Tufo
"Lovely aromatics push scents of espresso, cassis, truffle and baker's chocolate right up front. The wine is polished, fine-boned and balanced, with taut cranberry and raspberry fruit. It brings in subtle accents of chalk, earth, rock and lead pencil, building to a firm, beautifully structured finish.",92,Lauren Ashton Cellars 2011 Proprietor's  Cuvée Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a fantastic Barbera d'Asti Superiore with a plush, soft, velvety feel and loads of intensity that peels back into layers of fresh blackberry, cherry, spice, chocolate, leather and exotic spice. This wine carries the banner high for all the Barbera producers now experimenting with a more modern style.",91,Marchesi Alfieri 2007 Alfiera  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore)
"This 100% varietal wine is a blend of fruit from Ciel du Cheval and Obelisco vineyards. Aromatically expressive, it boasts directly appealing notes of black plum, cassis, violets and dark spice, with the fruit very primary. The black-fruit flavors coat the palate from end to end and bring a compelling mouthfeel. The tannins are there but are beautifully integrated. It will be best from 2022–2030.",91,Mark Ryan 2014 Lonely Heart Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"A nice Merlot whose rich tannins and elegance mark its Napa origins. Although it finishes dry, it fills the mouth with ripe, sweet cherry, red currant, toast and caramel flavors. Needs lots of breathing to let it mellow.",90,Reynolds Family Winery 2007 Merlot (Stags Leap District)
"This Southern Rhône blend of Roussanne, Viognier and Marsanne is pretty and smooth, with a pleasing array of light tropical fruits, good acidity and a finishing pat of butter. Drink (happily!) through 2017.",92,Tranche 2011 Slice of Pape Blanc White (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The Vila Santa Reserva boasts wood aging as well as lush, rich fruitiness. The touch of woody spice emphasizes the green- and white-fruits that give this rounded wine a full texture. There is a plush feel that promises some aging, although the wine can be enjoyed now.",90,J. Portugal Ramos 2012 Vila Santa Branco Reserva White (Alentejano)
"A deep gold color sends up warning flags, and the flavors bear that out. Has simple apple flavors with a touch of shellac and no depth. Kosher.",82,Bartenura 2000 Pinot Grigio (Veneto)
"This is a tight, mineral-textured wine. Crisp fruit keeps it bright, but the texture adds a more serious, structured note. Wait until late 2017 for it to come completely together.",87,Château Petit Moulin 2016 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
"At 81%, this could be a varietally labeled Merlot, with the rest Cabernet Franc (15%) and Petit Verdot. It appeals with pretty aromas of cocoa, wood spice and jammy red fruit that are followed by full-bodied fruit and barrel flavors that pack a wallop while staying in balance.",91,Dusted Valley 2013 BFM Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"With a vineyard planted in the traditional Beaujolais style of individual bushes rather than trained on wires, this is a light, soft and fruity wine. It has attractive tannins and fresh red fruits. Drink now.",86,Georges Duboeuf 2015 Château des Vierres  (Beaujolais-Villages)
"Fleshy black-plum and cherry flavors are cloaked in layers of dark toast, smoke and spice in this boldly structured red. A blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, it neatly balances Merlot's softness with crisp refreshingly herbal expressions of Cabernet. The finish is marked by bramble and elegant fine-grained tannins. Drink now through 2022.",88,Rooster Hill 2015 Meritage (New York)
"A distinctive, fruit forward wine with notes of blueberry and ash. It's fresh with tannins adding gruffness.",86,Cascade Ridge 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Engaging scents suggesting rose, iris, perfumed berry and Mediterranean herb meld together in the glass. The soft, bright palate offers red cherry, raspberry, a hint of tobacco and a coffee note alongside supple tannins.",90,Sesta di Sopra 2011  Brunello di Montalcino
"Light red fruits, perhaps just a little stewed and herbal, with a soft mouthfeel and mocha-streaked finish.",85,San Juan Vineyards 2007 Cabernet Franc (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Made from Chardonnay grapes, this metodo classico opens with creamy aromas of apricot, honey, citrus and blanched almond. The wine feels smooth, rich and silky on the finish, with small, elegant perlage.",92,Contadi Castaldi 2007 Brut Satèn Chardonnay (Franciacorta)
"Rounded and soft, this is a wine that is still developing. It exhibits ripe, powerful fruit flavors, but with a spicy edge. Hints of wood aging show through as the wine opens up, but it's still young, and will need time to bring out its complexity. Drink from 2016.",92,Patrick Javillier 2011 Les Clousots  (Meursault)
"Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this is a good, smooth wine that shows its Napa origins in the ripeness of fruit and classy tannins. Floods the mouth with blackberries and oak. There's a certain sharpness that cuts through the richness and lasts through the finish, which may limit ageability, so drink soon.",91,Flora Springs 2007 Trilogy Red (Napa Valley)
"Made entirely with Friulano, this stunning wine delivers dried apricot, candied nectarine zest, baked apple, almond and dried herb sensations. A mineral vein weaves through the elegantly structured palate, adding both depth and complexity. Drink through 2023.",93,Radikon 2008 Jakot Friulano (Venezia Giulia)
"A good, if fairly standard wine, showing all the popular Chardonnay elements. It's dry, crisp and creamy, with fruit and buttered toast flavors.",85,Nitty Gritty 2011 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"An elegant and refined Chenin that shows superb balance and the potential to age gracefully for another five years, at least. Lush and rich, this has a smooth texture and a round but lifted palate. Aromas and flavors of baked apple and toast are layered with sweet citrus and honeyed richness. The long, strong finish leaves sultry sweet spice and nutty accents behind.",91,de Trafford 2009 Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch)
"This high-octane wine offers sensations of toasted oak, sawdust and evident alcohol. It's warm and evolved without much fruit richness.",85,Cà Richeta 2011 Crussi  (Nebbiolo d'Alba)
"This was co-fermented with 3% Viognier. It's a very light Syrah that punches below its weight and skirts around the edges of clear varietal character. Citrus skin flavors and thin red fruits push it close to generic red, serviceable but without the power of most Washington Syrahs in this price range.",86,Cadaretta 2011 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A subdued nose of earth and chocolate leads into a fresh, lively and finely textured palate of red and black cherry. The texture is crunchy and refreshing, with an aromatic, enticing echo. A very clean finish on a refreshing, cherry-flavored wine.",90,Glatzer 2012 Dornenvogel Zweigelt (Carnuntum)
"Made from organically farmed vineyards, with native yeast and old barrels, this wine is a melting pot of bright cranberry and raspberry, smoke, toast, florals and sweet herbs. Medium bodied, with silky tannins, and plenty of terroir expression, it's well priced to boot. A win all around.",90,Fairbank Sutton Grange 2015 Sangiovese (Bendigo)
"This wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon (78%), with the rest equal parts Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Aromas of barrel spice, cedar, green herbs and black fruit are followed by tightly coiled fruit and barrel flavors that need some time to settle in.",90,Matthews 2012 Reserve Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A touch oily on the nose but that's balanced by tropical fruit, pear and apple aromas. The palate has a chunky feel and weight to it along with melon and apple flavors. And it finishes the same, rounding out an inoffensive, standard package.",85,Aresti 2009 Estate Selection Chardonnay (Curicó Valley)
"Roasted and earthy smelling, with a pinch of iodine and even a whiff of bacon or ham. Rich, full and a touch sticky on the tongue, with baked berry and chocolate flavors. Mellow and sweet on the back end. 100% Malbec.",85,Tacama 2008 Halcón de la Viña Malbec (Ica)
"Muscat's typical sweetness and delicacy give this an attractive balance of crisp acidity and ripe raspberry flavor. It's light, lively and intensely fruity.",85,Royal Muscato NV Pink Sparkling (Vin Mousseux)
"With the number of really good dessert wines available for under $12 per bottle severely limited, this is a refreshing ray of golden sweetness. Dried apricots add enough citrus pith to partially balance out the intensely sweet flavors. Drink in the lusciousness over the next couple of years.",89,D'Arenberg 2008 The Stump Jump Sticky Chardonnay Chardonnay (McLaren Vale-Adelaide Hills)
"Jammy raspberry and plum aromas are primary and fresh on the nose. This ripe, round wine is sure to be a party-pleaser. Solid cassis, berry and spice flavors finish pure, with ripeness and proper balance.",89,Concha y Toro 2012 Serie Riberas Gran Reserva Ribera del Tinguiririca Cabernet Sauvignon (Marchigue)
"Soft in character and rounded, this is a full-bodied wine, feeling fat and gently textured. The yellow fruits are sweet, ripe, buoyed by wood and finishing with attractive acidity.",89,Collovray et Terrier 2008 Domaine des Deux Roches Les Cras  (Saint-Véran)
"High alcohol of 20% makes this dessert wine hot in the mouth. That's the main impression, because the sweetness and fruit aren't quite strong enough to balance the heat. Nonetheless it's pretty sweet, with blackberry jam and chocolate flavors.",87,Williams Selyem 2004 Mistral Vineyard Port (Central Coast)
"Rustic and feral, with hints of dirty Band Aid alongside notes of coffee and molasses. Still, it holds some appeal for not conforming to expectations and boasts a redeemingly ripe, creamy texture that's almost suede-like on the finish. Drink now.",85,Réserve des Oliviers 2007 Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape)
‘Na Vota is a fresh and easygoing wine that is vinified in stainless steel to maintain its fresh berry and floral aromas. The wine has medium structure and staying power but does reward the palate with its crisp acidic finish.,85,Cantine Sant'Agata 2007 'Na Vota  (Ruché di Castagnole Monferrato)
"Tangerines abound throughout this intensely perfumed, concentrated wine. Dry in style, it's refreshingly citrusy, yet streaked with wet stone, petrol and struck flint. While deft and light bodied, it's persistent through a long, pleasantly astringent finish.",90,Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards 2014 Homestead Reserve Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"En Paradis—“in paradise”—refers to a vineyard owned by Régine and Jean Rijckaert. The wine is deliciously and very lightly oxidized, showing a great line of tangy, juicy green and white fruits which are overlaid by pineapple acidity. It has fine concentration and a so-refreshing lemon-zest aftertaste.",93,Rijckaert 2010 En Paradis Vieilles Vignes Chardonnay (Arbois)
"Juicy, dusty and wrapped in cedar, this rarefied wine is classic in nature, with highlights of pencil shavings, red currant and a dose of dried cherry. The oak is robust and supportive, offering specks of vanilla and clove, the tannins thick and tenacious, ready to mellow in time. Drink best from 2023 through 2033.",94,Patland 2013 Stagecoach Vineyard Select Barrel Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This strongly mineral and textured wine is all about terroir. It has dark tannins, dense black fruits as well as freshness. Black currants and cherries give the fruity side, but at this stage it's the structure that is important. Wait and drink from 2016.",92,Lucien Lardy 2013 Côte de Py  (Morgon)
"Light and tonic with raw notes of cherry and forest fruit, this is a bright, easy-drinking Rosso di Montalcino. Pair it with lamb, rosemary and roasted potatoes. The wine's natural acidity and tannins can stand up to the consistency of those dishes.",88,Biondi Santi 2007  Rosso di Montalcino
"The wine comes from vineyards surrounding a stylish 19th-century chateau. With its bright red-berry fruit, the wine is crisp and only lightly structured. It is a cru wine to drink soon to appreciate its fruitiness.",86,Jean Loron 2015 Château de Bellevue  (Brouilly)
"A dark color and a soft nose with woodsy cherry scents form the greeting on this Brazilian Pinot Noir. Despite being dark and seemingly dense, this feels scalped and high in acidity. Dry but bland flavors of plum and black cherry are slightly bitter prior to a modest finish.",85,Salton 2014 Paradoxo Pinot Noir (Campanha)
"This is a perfumed, structured wine that is showing both tannins and fruit well. While ripe and full of black fruits, it's also bright with acidity. It is just beginning to develop, with a dark, tarry texture that lingers on the finish.",93,Domaine la Bastide Blanche 2010 Red (Bandol)
"Menthol, leather and underbrush aromas lead the nose while the dense palate offers raw sour cherry and dried sage. Bracing tannins grip the finish.",88,Renzo Seghesio 2008 Riserva Pajana  (Barolo)
"From three plots holding 75-year-old vines, this wine offers yellow fruits, apples and crisp pears. Plenty of fresh acidity gives it a crisp character, while the ripe fruit makes it refreshing and very ready to drink.",88,Nicolas Maillet 2014 Le Chenin Blanc  (Mâcon-Verze)
"Still dependable despite changes in ownership, this winery again delivers an elegant, well-made wine. With this vintage, it veers more toward herbaceous notes than fruity ones. The dominant flavors are of green olives and sweet bell pepper. Don't think, however, that it's lean. Oak provides fatness, and the right foods, like grilled red meat, will coax out the berry sweetness.",87,William Hill Estate 1998 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This inky wine opens with black concentration and rich aromas of mature cherry, almond paste, spice, blackberry and plum. Integrated wood tones of leather and toasted coffee complete the picture and help render soft but structured tannins. Drink after 2015.",94,Podere Sapaio 2008 Sapaio  (Bolgheri Superiore)
"This soft, mature wine has ripe red fruits that now merge with more yeasty, nutty flavors. The result is a delicately textured wine that is dry with delicious acidity at the end. Drink now.",90,Devaux NV Cuvée D Rosé  (Champagne)
"Very much a food wine, this has a strong tannic element as well as red-plum flavors. It is rich, dry and full bodied showing a touch of pepper at the end.",86,Château de Marsan 2015 Red (Bordeaux Clairet)
"Here's a light, easy Chardonnay from Friuli in Northern Italy that offers measured aromatic intensity and notes of stone fruit, flowers and white mineral. The wine would wash down an easy salad thanks to its lean consistency and fresh finish.",84,Cabert 2007 Chardonnay (Friuli Grave)
"This soft wine has forward fruitiness and a light tang of lemon zest. Almond accents and touch of minerality add some complexity, enhancing its immediate appeal.",87,Maison Charles Père et Fils 2015  Bourgogne
"This has a classic Nebbiolo nose of new leather, rose petal, red berry, tilled earth and a whiff of aniseed. On the palate, toast, white pepper and a hint of oak-driven spice back up a core of sour cherry. It's still tightly wound and needs a few more years to come together. Drink 2018–2025.",90,Cantina del Nebbiolo 2010 Meruzzano Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"Leafy minty blueberry aromas announce this jammy Monastrell. There's no oak on this, nor much give to a linear flat palate. Blueberry flavors hold onto the nose's grassy herbal essence, while the finish tastes peppery and vaguely green.",85,Telmo Rodríguez 2015 Al-muvedre Monastrell (Alicante)
"There's no question about the huge richness of this wine—it is there from the initial aroma. It is smooth, totally voluptuous, immediately appealing. The flavors are of the sweetest runny honey, matched with acidity to emphasize the ripe peach and dried apricot flavors.",90,Rosenhof 2004 Trockenbeerenauslese Chardonnay (Burgenland)
"This is a dense wine, packed with both tannins and acidity. It brings out the ageworthiness of this appellation with its rich potential and dark mineral texture. Drink this concentrated cru wine from 2018.",88,Henry Fessy 2015  Juliénas
"Though relatively young (planted in 2001) this Dundee Hills vineyard can deliver the goods. This is full, juicy, packed with ripe fruits, moderately deep in color, and limned with sharp, herbal, astringent tannins. It could profit from a bit more bottle age, to take the edge off the green tea in the finish.",90,Erath 2007 Lillie's Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"This polished, un-oaked Riesling shows the variety's petrol note riding high over citrus and honeysuckle flavors. It's off dry and brisk in acidity. With alcohol of 12.5% by volume, it's a lovely, delicate wine to drink now.",87,Cutruzzola 2011 Riven Rock Vineyard Riesling (San Luis Obispo County)
"Made with 90% Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo, this opens with pretty aromas of crushed berry, violet and a whiff of menthol. The juicy palate offers black cherry, white pepper and licorice alongside firm but fine-grained tannins.",88,Donatella Cinelli Colombini 2012  Chianti Superiore
"This is a fancy restaurant-style Pinot Noir. That means it's dry, silky and rich, and has that elusive, undefinable quality of elegance that can accompany the finest Pinot-friendly foods, such as steak, lamb, grilled tuna or a wild mushroom risotto. It's tantalizingly crisp, with complex cherry, cola and spice flavors. Drink now and through 2016.",94,Sanford 2010 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Fragrant white flower, honeydew melon, tomato vine and hay aromas all come together in the glass. The vibrant palate shows pink grapefruit and tangerine alongside a vein of mineral.",88,Fantinel 2014 Tenuta Sant'Elena Sauvignon (Collio)
"Aromas of currant, plum, herbs and dry brush are fresh, focused and don't try too hard. Wiry and juicy on the palate but not all that deep, this blend of 40% Cabernet and 60% Mencía tastes of pointed plum and raspberry, flavors that turn a touch sour on a zesty, acidic finish.",87,Vinos de Arganza 2012 Palacio de Arganza Cabernet Sauvignon-Mencia Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)
"This clean, fresh and fine-tuned wine brings apple, green melon and green leaf flavors together, with a burst of tangy acidity. A perfect pour for pasta and poultry dishes.",88,Brigadoon 2016 Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley)
"This Viognier is alive with aromas of honeysuckle, chamomile and white peach. The flavors are tart and upfront, showing tangy peach and passion fruit.",84,Bogati 2015 Viognier (Virginia)
"A fragrant nose is composed of lime zest and fern. The palate is softer and lighter than this suggests but carries a savory, yeasty, herb-tinged core reminiscent of fresh sage and pear peel.",89,Netzl 2015 Grüner Veltliner (Carnuntum)
"Considered by many as the finest of the Grand Crus, Les Clos is steep, south-facing and impressive just to look at. Like many wines from this vineyard, this wine has immense power and concentration. It is rich, dense and full of tight but rich yellow and green fruits shot through with intense acidity. It is still very young and needs to be aged. Drink from 2019.",95,Domaine Pascal Bouchard 2013 Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis)
"Initial aromas are suggestive of turpentine and alcohol, but with time things improve. This is chunky and low on pulse; flavors of tomato, green herbs and red fruits are marginal, while the finish carries some burn and heat.",85,Casa Juan 2005 Señor de Lesmos Reserva  (Rioja)
"This robust wine opens with aromas of dried rose, tar, leather, fig and allspice. The full-bodied palate delivers dried black cherries, licorice, underbrush and grilled sage alongside firm, velvety tannins.",90,Plozza 2009 Blackedition Passione  (Sforzato di Valtellina)
"This blend of 70% Syrah, 25% Grenache and 5% Mourvèdre is a beautiful shade of purple in the glass, and offers aromas of black plum and milk chocolate. The mouthfeel is silky, with zesty acidity that rises through blueberry and boysenberry flavors toward the caramel-layered finish.",92,Niner 2013 Square Root Heart Hill Vineyard Estate Grown Red (Paso Robles Willow Creek District)
"This is full of superripe red fruits, full-bodied and concentrated. It offers spice as well as fruitiness, both well integrated and given a lift by the attractive lemon acidity. It's a rosé for winter and could match turkey with its weight and density.",89,Château la Coste 2013 Bellugue Rosé (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence)
"Hints of waxy honeycomb and grilled peach whisper on the nose of this wine, with assertive threads of baking spice, honeysuckle and lemon verbena weaving throughout. The plush palate is smooth and round, though with ample lift to enliven the finish and the ripe fruit flavors of melon, toasted apple and creamed pear. Drink now–2019.",90,Topiary 2015 Chardonnay (Franschhoek)
"It's easy for a California Chardonnay to be rich, but few can rise to the level of balanced complexity as this gorgeous bottling. The wine is enormous in apricot, orange, nectarine, pear and Meyer lemon fruit, with the vanilla and buttered toast of French oak. The acidity is just about perfect.",94,Williams Selyem 2012 Olivet Lane Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"The full tilt of ripe peach hits the nose at once, followed by glimpses of marmalade and peach compote. The palate follows with the same aromatic intensity, enriching the peach compote notes even further with lemony barley sugar and fresh caramel, pierced by tangy citrus acidity. The flavors are mature and precise, opulent but tempered, and have a decadent touch. This is lovely now but has the concentration and drive to evolve. Drink now through 2030.",95,René Muré 2010 Vorbourg Grand Cru Clos Saint Landelin Vendanges Tardives Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"A bit developed already, with a round mouthfeel and some honey character accented by citrus and gingery-peppery spice. Pleasant to drink now, but seems to lack the vivacity for extended aging.",86,Leeuwin Estate 2010 Art Series Riesling (Margaret River)
"Pineapple and spice on the nose are followed by like flavors on the palate. An interplay of acid adds quality to the wine but overall, it lacks dimension and the kind of layering that typifies good Chardonnay.",82,Brotherhood 2004 Chardonnay (New York)
"Quite light in the glass, this bottling still shows a vast array of tropical-leaning aromas, from jasmine and honeysuckle to ripe Gala apples, orange juice and key lime pie. Crisp stonefruit shows on the sip, as do more powerful white flowers, like tuberose.",86,Falkner 2015 Viognier (Temecula Valley)
"One of the most familiar of Champagnes, the Yellow Label is finely made—a fruity while structured wine. It has both fresh and fragrant fruit as well as richness, a soft, creamy texture and bright acidity. There is no sense in bottle aging here—drink this wine because of its crispness.",90,Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin NV Yellow Label Brut  (Champagne)
"At this price, buy a bunch and pour it in paper cups at your next big party. You won't get any complaints. Blackberry, chocolate and oak-like flavors are front and center.",83,Cocobon 2011 Red (California)
"Made mostly from Chardonnay, with a touch of Pinot Noir, this is so rich and creamy, it's like satin gliding across the mouth, carrying waves of lemon- and lime-infused buttercream, brioche and a smoky flavor. It feels classy and delicious from the first sniff to the seemingly sweet finish.",93,Chandon 2006 Brut Sparkling (Mount Veeder)
"As you'd expect from this pioneering Oregon winery, this is a smooth, sophisticated, accessible yet ageable wine. Polished berry and cherry fruit is swathed in cola and cocoa highlights, running through silky tannins. Drink now through 2020.",91,Adelsheim 2014 Breaking Ground Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"This is full of botrytis influence, yet is it lighter and fresher than some other Burgenland sweet wines. It leaves a feeling of lemon acidity to go with the honey- and flower-scented finish. Screwcap.",92,Gunter Triebaumer 2009 Ruster Ausbruch Welschriesling (Burgenland)
"Creamy dark-berry aromas carry a floral, blueberry hint, while the thick palate teeters on syrupy as it delivers gummy, mildly baked black fruit flavors. Lactic and full on the finish, with a touch of crusty bitterness along with milk chocolate and/or carob.",85,Septima 2008 Malbec (Mendoza)
"With 70 hectares of vines and many generations of family management, Piazzo Armando is a steady and consistent producer of Barolo and other traditional wines of the Langhe. This is the winery's top product and its quality shows thanks to delicate aromas of wild cherries, light cinnamon and pressed blue flowers.",90,Piazzo Armando 2005  Barolo
"Layers of exotic spice and crushed earth permeate through this dry Riesling paying just homage to it's red-clay origins in Ürziger Würzgarten, the spice garden of the Mosel. It's exquisitely light bodied, a revitalizing crush of cutting white grapefruit and lime flavors. The finish is marked by a meandering spray of spice and honey. Drinks well now but should improve through at least 2030.",92,Dr. Loosen 2012 Ürziger Würzgarten GG Réserve Alte Reben Erste Lage Dry Riesling (Mosel)
"Enticing scents of white flowers and citrus blossom lead the nose of this elegant wine. Silky and crisp, the bright palate delivers yellow apple, pear and a tangy hint of tangerine, framed in vibrant acidity and a polished perlage.",92,Bisol 2016 Crede Brut  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"A tough, gritty wine not offering much richness. It's very dry and quite acidic, and the modest cherry flavors veer into tobacco, white pepper and sage.",84,Terra d'Oro 2007 Sangiovese (Amador County)
"Slightly herbal plum and berry aromas come with a pinch of spice and meatiness. Feels medium-bodied and crisp, with juicy red-fruit flavors of plum, tomato and raspberry. Dries out on the finish, where it becomes more herbal and roasted.",85,Espuela del Gaucho 2010 Limited Edition Reserve Malbec (Mendoza)
"A very pretty, opulent floral nose with hints of spice lead on this Hungarian sparkler. On the palate, it has a clean, minerally flavor that lacks some of the dimension and finesse that the nose would lead one to expect. A good food wine, though—and fun. Imported by MHW Ltd.",83,Törley NV Gála Sparkling (Hungary)
"From a producer with a proven track record for Rhône wines comes this powerful, dramatically structured 100% Grenache. Shows the variety's lush cherry flavors, with complex layers of grilled meat, dark chocolate, black licorice, violets and peppery spice. A bit hard and closed in tannins, it should be given a good decanting.",90,Io 2006 Grenache (Santa Maria Valley)
"Made with enough skin contact to yield a gentle coppery hue, this medium-bodied wine features aromas of cantaloupe, cherry and citrus. Cherry fruit on the palate is accompanied by vaguely Pinot Noir-like notes of dried bracken and moss, then glides to a long, silky finish. Drink now.",90,McPherson Wine Company 2015 MWC Pinot Gris (Victoria)
"From dark granite soil, this wine is structured and concentrated. It has ripe black-cherry fruit and spice that add to the mineral texture and firm tannins in the background. Drink this cru wine from late 2017.",88,Georges Duboeuf 2015 Flower Label  (Saint-Amour)
"Fruity, crisp with red-currant and citrus flavors, this is a bright, vivacious wine. There is a tight mineral edge that contrasts with the fruitiness and turns this into a food friendly wine. Drink now.",88,Vignobles Raymond 2016 Elodie Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"A pruny, overripe Merlot that feels harsh and bitter in tannins. Not offering much.",82,Hopper Creek 2007 Estate Merlot (Napa Valley)
"This is a gorgeous, compelling wine of power and finesse. It has a captivating fragrance of earth, leather, black fruit and incense accented with whiffs of exotic spice. The palate is rich but refined, delivering ripe black cherry, blue berry, tobacco and baking spices along with enveloping, velvety tannins. Drink 2016–2036.",95,Mastroberardino 2006 Radici Riserva  (Taurasi)
"Maduro cigars, cedar, beef char and pipe ash highlight the nose on this blend of 48% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Cabernet Franc and 20% Merlot from a longtime producer. It's relatively lean and light on the palate, with black peppercorns and roasted pork elements. The Cab Franc shows strongly.",89,Corley 2011 Proprietary Red (Napa Valley)
"Attractive fruity tones of red currant, raspberry and strawberry hull dance in the bouquet of this pretty rosé, graced by garrigue accents of lavender and rosemary. Flavors of red berry skin and peach pit unfold on the medium-weight palate, framed by soft tannins and a delicate spice note that lingers on the close.",90,Château de Lancyre 2015 Le Rosé (Coteaux du Languedoc Pic Saint Loup)
"Clean, saline-driven aromas of apple and minerals filter into a round, plump, fresh palate. This tastes of lime, green apple and green herbs, while a cucumber note comes up on a juicy, tangy finish.",88,Calcu 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Colchagua Valley)
"There is huge fruit here, with the tannins firmly packed into the dark fruit character. Juicy Merlot is perfumed, open, swathed in rich robes. A wine for medium-term aging.",92,Château la Croix de Gay 2009  Pomerol
"Lightly herbal aromas of black currant, tobacco, minerals and latent char provide for a fine opening. Given that this is now 14+ years old, its core structure and acidity level are excellent. Rooty flavors of licorice and black currant show toast and chocolate accents, while the finish is dry, spicy and whole. This is living proof that top Chilean Cabernets from exceptional vintages can age for up to two decades; drink through 2020.",91,Aresti 2001 Family Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Curicó Valley)
"Heady, oaky, pushy aromas of green-leaning red-berry fruits and coffee grinds are earthy and strong. This is concentrated in the mouth, and also pasty and resiny in feel. Flavors of lactic oak, cardamom and blackberry finish with vanilla sweetness and a lasting wave of wood.",87,Santa Rita 2009 Medalla Real Gran Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Costa)
A straightforward nose with honest raspberry fruit and an underlying green plum note. There's well-defined acidity and rounded tannins though a turnip note makes for a less than stellar ending. Drink now to 1 year.,82,Atwater 2007 Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes)
"Here's a very elegant and ethereal expression of Nebbiolo with measured aromatic accents of drying mineral, wild berries and Indian spice. This is a delicate and feminine wine with freshness, tartness and a very fine quality of tannin.",90,Castello di Verduno 2007 Rabajà  (Barbaresco)
"Hailing from the cool 2011 vintage, it's light in style with notes of red currant, herbs and olive with little apparent oak influence. A straight-forward easy quaffer.",85,Hyatt 2011 Merlot (Rattlesnake Hills)
"Smooth, nutty aromas include vanilla and flor scents. This has a dry palate with flavors of orange, lemon, salt and peanuts. It's crisp but metallic in feel, with angular acidity and a finish that's salty in flavor and slightly oily in texture.",87,Delgado Zuleta NV Premium Sherry (Manzanilla-Sanlúcar de Barrameda)
"A great value wine that's ready to drink now. This vibrant and aromatic selection boasts scents of orange blossom, white peach and fresh honeydew. The palate is fresh and lively with a crisp and mouthwatering finish.",86,Spier 2011 Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch)
"Light, fruity and clean smelling, with a touch of candy to the nose. The palate, especially for an $8 Garnacha rosé, is zesty and spunky, with cherry, plum and citrus flavors. Crisp and crackling through the finish.",87,Borsao 2010 Rosé (Campo de Borja)
"A blend of white grapes Vermentino and Colombana, this opens with aromas yellow flower, stone fruit, and a whiff of citrus. The fresh palate offers yellow peach and tangerine that lead to a clean finish.",87,Fattoria Fibbiano 2015 Fonte delle Donne White (Toscana)
"Bright, brash fruit sets this off on the right note, with raspberries and strawberries and even a little watermelon in the mix. Fruit defines the middle, and extends through to the full, ripe finish.",87,Martin & Weyrich 1997 Ueberroth Vineyard Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"This Chardonnay has all the bells and whistles the winemaker can bestow on it. It's soft and creamy, with flavors of sweetly-sour pineapple and lemon-drop candy, buttered toast and savory cinnamon spices. Fine acidity gives a sheen to the richness.",91,Stonestreet 2010 Upper Barn Chardonnay (Alexander Valley)
"Encapsulated in a big, beautifully etched bottle with black wax closure, Grand Wren is a grand statement—an explosion of smoke, leather and ripe fruit. It's smooth in texture, but with streaks of bright acidity throughout. The finish is big and bold with a Port-like intensity.",87,Renwood 2010 Grand Wren Zinfandel (Amador County)
"A strongly herbal, garrigue character dominates the overall personality of this wine, but is supported by ample black plum and cherry notes to keep it from being overly earthy or green. Firm, slightly astringent tannins coat the palate and remain well into the finish.",89,Domaine de l'Edre 2010 Carrément Rouge Red (Côtes du Roussillon Villages)
"This is a solid effort, especially at this price point. The cherry-cola core of flavor grabs your interest quickly, and hangs on with a hint of tobacco in the smooth finish. Some nice acidity adds a touch of minerality.",88,Corvallis Cellars 2011 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Shy at first on the nose, this wine from just east of the Sta. Rita Hills boundary winds up offering a very pretty if delicate nose of lime, salt and a touch of popcorn hidden in the background. It's high-toned and bright on the palate, with limestone, gray slate and lime-peel flavors, quite refreshing with each sip.",92,Pence Ranch 2013 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County)
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah, this vibrant wine conveys aromas of black currant, red berry and cooking spice. The savory palate offers black cherry and ground pepper alongside relaxed tannins. Drink through 2016.",88,Giorgio Meletti Cavallari 2013 Borgeri  (Bolgheri)
"While this wine is herbaceous, the attractive aspect lies in its lemon and orange zest flavors that are full and bright. It's crisp while deliciously fruity, ready to drink.",85,Jean Maréchal 2013 Le Roi des Pierres  (Sancerre)
"Slightly confected floral notes are ruffled with green herbs and leaves on this off-dry Muskat Ottonel. The palate is peachy and a bit  perfumey, but refreshingly brisk with acidity.",85,Dr. Konstantin Frank 2012 Muskat Ottonel (Finger Lakes)
"Break out the prosciutto-wrapped figs and stuffed mushroom appetizers for this light, silky rosé. It's crisp in acidity and delicate in the mouth, with assertive raspberry, orange tea and honey flavors. This is one of the more successful Pinot Noir rosés out there.",88,Festival and Feast 2012 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Sonoma County)
"This blend of Sangiovese and Merlot from Tuscany is a bit closed, but it reveals subtle underbrush and violet aromas along with raspbberry and black cherry flavors. Pair this with pasta topped with meat sauces.",86,Vignemastre 2010 Dardo Red (Toscana)
"Somewhat closed and tight at first, this eventually opens up to reveal scents of firm stone fruit, fynbos, Asian pear, orange blossom and white melon rind. There's a roundness to the palate, supported by dense flavors of melon flesh and roasted nuts. Enjoy now.",87,Rustenberg 2012 Chardonnay (Stellenbosch)
"This is one of the more complex wines from the 2003 vintage. The nose has aromas of blackberry liquer, smoked meat, truffle and road tar. On the palate the fruit seems a little heavier and more roasted, but still melds well with its earthy, mushroomy flavors. Medium finish.",90,Giacomo Ascheri 2003 Vigna dei Pola  (Barolo)
"This wine has very ripe, juicy fruit flavors that coat the mouth with rich blueberry and blackberry, while the texture is smooth and almost viscous. It is full bodied and has soft tannins and acidity.",88,"Wise Villa 2013 Estate Grown, Produced and Bottled Tempranillo (Placer County)"
"Weight and a rich character bring out caramel and apricot fruits as well as a crisp citrus core. It's warm, round and ripe, and still fresh while full in the mouth. Age this very drinkable wine until 2015.",89,Domaine Ellevin 2012 Vosgros Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"Very dry and pretty tannic, this cool-climate Syrah combines its blackberry and cherry fruit with less ripe notes of herbs and even a touch of asparagus. Intense umami flavors of salty, smoky bacon give it richness. Drink now.",88,Keller Estate 2007 La Cruz Vineyard Syrah (Sonoma Coast)
"A very nice wine, bone dry and crisp in cool-climate acidity that really gets the mouth watering. It has complex flavors of lemons, limes, grapefruit and herbs, with a clean, pleasing minerality.",88,Alma Rosa 2008 Pinot Gris (Santa Barbara County)
"Made with equal parts Sangiovese and organically grown Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with fruity aromas of red cherry and raspberry. The aromas carry over to the easygoing palate alongside tangy acidity and smooth tannins. Enjoy soon.",87,Volpaia 2014 Citto Red (Toscana)
"An almost overpowering fragrance greets the nose on this bottling, with scents of lime and pear blossoms, honeysuckle, jasmine and peach sorbet. The palate is very citrus-driven, with oranges and tangerine skin, proving quite sour and tart for such a ripe introduction.",86,Pace 2014 Huber Vineyard Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Bel-Air is owned by the Cazes family of Château Lynch-Bages in Pauillac, and the pedigree of the winemaking shows. A rich, almost opulent wine, tempered with tannins. Flavors of dark black figs, herbs and wood come together harmoniously. It has a tense edge of tannin that promises aging.",90,Château Villa Bel Air 2003  Graves
"This salmon-colored blend of 90% Cabernet Franc and just a touch of Merlot is light, crisp and perfumed. It has a creamy mousse and a bright, red currant-inflected aftertaste. Drink now.",87,Calvet 2014 Brut Rosé  (Crémant de Bordeaux)
"his is representative of the Cupcake style—a Pinot that lush with raspberry and rhubarb flavors, but also decent acidity. Drink up.",84,Cupcake 2011 Pinot Noir (Central Coast)
"This is perfect for lovers of light, herbaceous Sauvignon Blanc. All the grassy and citrus flavors are here, attractively crisp while not aggressive. Drink this year. Screwcap.",84,Domaine de l'Herré 2012 La Galope Sauvignon Blanc (Côtes de Gascogne)
"This wine is 100% Cabernet, coming from Seven Hills, Loess, Summit View, Yellow Jacket, Stone Valley, Ferguson and Pepper Bridge vineyards. Locked-up aromas of barrel spice, toast, herb, vanilla and dark fruit give way to rich but well balanced black-fruit flavors. Lightly grainy tannins offer sufficient support.",91,L'Ecole No. 41 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Aromas of broad white fruits provide the backdrop for the sweaty and cheesy overtones. It's medium bodied, with diffuse flavors, but the acidity keeps the palate bright and lifted. It finishes on a soft, soapy note.",81,Autumn Hill 2011 Chardonnay (Monticello)
"This canned white is slightly dark in color, smells and tastes nicely fruity and has vanilla and cream accents. It's full-bodied, soft and smooth on the palate.",85,Mancan NV White (California)
"A big (15.6% alcohol) wine, the 2006 Bella's Garden nevertheless comes across as balanced and drinkable in its youth, marrying a rich, creamy texture with mixed berry fruit and hints of mint and vanilla. Avoids any cooked character, finishing long and fresh. Drink now–2015.",91,Two Hands 2006 Bella's Garden Shiraz (Barossa Valley)
"A solid effort, the 2007 Chockstone is a balanced, accessible red. There's ample cherry fruit, touches of cedar, vanilla and woodspice and modest tannins. Everything is in proportion, and it should drink well for the next 5-8 years.",87,A.T. Richardson 2007 Chockstone Shiraz (Grampians)
"The wine is crisp, full of red berry fruit and lively acidity, with a smooth texture. This is terrific as an accompaniment to a summer meal or as an apéritif. The finish is deliciously fruity. Screwcap.",88,Les Maîtres Vignerons de Saint-Louis 2011 Terres de Saint-Lion Rosé (Coteaux Varois)
"This is a simple, fruity wine. It has a pear flavor, light minerality and a zingy aftertaste. Smooth and rounded, it looks as though it will be ready to drink from early 2017.",85,Domaine Trouillet 2015 Coeur de Pouilly  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
"Very juicy, smoky, smooth and velvety. It has great acidity as well as sweet fruit. An opulent, open wine, yet with a great final structure; big and sweet.",93,Château Petit-Village 2009  Pomerol
"Produced by the winemaking team of Château de Belcier in Castillon, this is a firmly structured, dry to the core wine. There are hints of ripe and juicy berry fruits to go with the dark tannins and dense texture. It needs several years to age.",87,Château de Monrecueil 2010  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux
"This blend of Grolleau and Gamay has an attractive onion-skin-pink color. Fruity and with red-currant flavors, it is soft and lively. There is a nutty character that adds to the pleasure of this easygoing ready-to-drink wine.",87,Paris-Simoneau NV Brut Rosé Sparkling (Touraine)
"Firmly tannic and powerful, this is dominated by a plum skin texture and a spice note. It's dense and rich, with a dry structure and the acidity of the vintage showing on the finish.",94,Domaine Vincent Girardin 2010  Echézeaux
"A new offering (and label) from Oregon's King Estate, this sports a label meant to resemble a folded-up piece of note paper with random jottings. On the back label is a sort of freeform poem; in the bottle is a fresh, dry, rather light Riesling. Flavors of lemon and lemon rind, with a papery finish.",86,next: 2008 Riesling (Washington)
"This bone-dry wine offers flavors of white fruits. Its crisp acidity is tempered by a touch of honey and spicy almonds. Balanced and fruity, the wine is ready to drink.",86,Collegiale des Domaines de Loire 2014 Les Bois de Vaux Sec  (Vouvray)
"There's a richness to this wine that's immensely pleasurable, but also a meaty, umami spiciness. It's actually remniscent of chocolate-covered bacon, infused with blackberry essence and liquid licorice, then sprinkled with black pepper. Really delicious, if a little hot in alcohol.",89,David Fulton 2009 Estate Bottled Petite Sirah (St. Helena)
"This leads with wild berry, citrus and herbaceous tomato leaf aromas. It's vibrant and easygoing, with pink grapefruit, sour cherry and dried herb flavors. Zesty acidity gives it a bright, clean finish.",87,Ciavolich 2016 Donna Ernestina Rosato (Colline Pescaresi)

"This simplest, freshest and lightest of Chablis styles has a refreshing lemon character, a light touch of melon and crisp acidity. Drink now.",86,Domaine Laroche 2011  Petit Chablis
"Lilacs and violets meet with black raspberries, blackberry pie and savory sage on the nose of this 42% Grenache, 38% Syrah and 20% Mourvèdre blend. The palate leans very savory, with tar, salt, anise and burned ends of roast beef combining for a hearty sipper.",91,Mattina Fiore 2012 Buona Derrata G-S-M (Santa Maria Valley)
"This is a fruity wine with crisp red fruits and acidity that are balanced by gentle tannins. With its warm feel, it is an easy wine that is ready to drink.",86,J. Portugal Ramos 2015 Vila Santa Loios Tinto Red (Alentejano)
"A semisweet wine, all currants and ripe fruit. The sweetness comes from superripe fruit, giving a delicious balance with the acidity. Flavors of yellow apples, tarragon and all-spice come together in an exciting finish.",92,Weinrieder 2007 Grande Reserve Riesling (Niederösterreich)
"Fresh aromas of red fruits are immediately attractive, but the wine also has weight, with some rich, smoky fruits, edges of tobacco and dried fruits. The tannins give a definite firm structure, but are well padded by wood and ripe fruits.",86,Château Respide-Médeville 2006  Graves
"Produced from the estate vineyard's oldest vines, this CSV bottling is a dry, leesy, textural wine, with dominant flavors of citrus flesh and rind along with green apples. There's a strong streak of mineral also, and a well-balanced finish of medium length.",92,Cave Spring 2012 CSV Estate Bottled Riesling (Beamsville Bench)
"Unctuous and ripe in caramel and toasty aromas, this is deep golden in color but completely crisp and balanced in the glass. The nose is so overwhelming that the flavors take time to show. Once they do, it's a celebration of green apple and melon enveloped in complex minerality and a supple body.",92,Fort Ross 2012 Fort Ross Vineyard Chardonnay (Fort Ross-Seaview)
"Aromas of jasmine and white orchard fruit lead the nose on this straightforward sparkler. The bright palate offers crisp green apple, kiwi and white peach accompanied by a frothy mousse.",87,Raphael Dal Bo NV Brut  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Full-bodied and firmly structured, this offers aromas of dark cherry, mocha, blue flower and a whiff of exotic spice. The concentrated palate doles out black cherry, raspberry jam, raisin, chocolate and baking spice alongside velvety tannins. Drink 2017–2023.",93,Allegrini 2011  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"Grassy, slightly stalky apple and nectarine aromas feed into a fresh, citrusy palate that brings a mix of white stone-fruit flavors as well as green citrus. A solid, lasting finish is dry and fresh.",86,Segura Viudas NV Brut Sparkling (Cava)
"An elegant Pinot Noir, dry, silky and crisp in acidity, making it a natural for lamb chops or a grilled steak. The flavors are strong, of sour cherry candy and raspberries, with a sweet, smoky coating of oak. Likely to develop over the next six years.",92,Arista 2009 Ferrington Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"A finely perfumed wine with aromas of white flowers and honey. The wine has the purest acidity, very citrus and grapefruit, delicious apple skins and a dancing freshness. Worth aging, but delicious now.",90,Winzer Krems 2010 Kremser Pfaffenberg Reserve Riesling (Kremstal)
"Toasty as well as fruity, this serious and complex wine has powerful tannins, a dense structure, red fruits and good concentration. There is weight here and aging potential.",90,Real Companhia Velha 2007 Porca de Murça Reserva Red (Douro)
"Leathery red-fruit aromas turn more gritty and earthy with airing. This feels chunky and full, without much elegance. Plum and rubbery berry flavors finish with a chocolaty oak note.",86,Coleccion Privada 2015 Gran Reserva Pinot Noir (Maule Valley)
"This block-selection Syrah is a kissing cousin of Polkura's more basic yet excellent Syrah from Marchigue in western Colchagua. It shows plenty of oak, vanilla and black-fruit ripeness, but on the palate it's nicely balanced and runs a mile deep. Toasty, smoky blackberry flavors end with mocha notes and oomph. Drink through 2019.",93,Polkura 2012 Block g+i Syrah (Marchigue)
"Here's a firm red that opens with aromas of coffee, toast and black plum. On the dense palate, notes of roasted coffee bean and ground black pepper add interest to the core of dried blackberry. It's tightly wound, with bracing tannins.",87,La Braccesca 2012 Achelo Syrah (Cortona)
"Half barrel fermented, and all oak-aged (roughly two-thirds new), this cloaks the lush fruit flavors of pineapple, peach and nectarine in a wash of caramel. The wine remains well proportioned, with acids and barrel toast playing a supporting role.",89,Burrowing Owl 2015 Chardonnay (Okanagan Valley)
"Foursight's 2011 Pinot, from a very cool vintage, is savory, with mushroom and herb alongside a streak of red cherry. Light in color and texture, it's subtle yet expansive on the palate, with a peppery, juicy finish. It's a wine that can be enjoyed now, but put some away for a couple of years and the seams will come together even better.",90,Foursight 2011 Charles Vineyard Clone 05 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"This wine is a blend of fruit from Boushey, Artz and Red Willow vineyards. Aromas of tire rubber, herb and red and black fruit lead to a soft palate backed by fine grained tannins.",88,Fall Line 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley)
"Made in a lighter style, this silky Pinot Noir has crisp acidity accentuating flavors of cherries, red licorice and cola. It's an elegant wine for drinking now.",87,Stephen's 2006 Stromsoe Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County)
"Here the dominant grape is Merlot, with smaller amounts of Syrah, Cab Franc, Cab Sauv and Petit Verdot. It falls to the herbal side in terms of flavor, ripeness and tannin, with some bitterness in the finish. On the plus side, it shows pleasing toasty scents and accents from some barrel aging.",88,Helix by Reininger 2011 Pomatia Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This Bordeaux-style blend, from a choice section of the Seven Hills Vineyard, is fragrant with a beguiling mix of fruits, flowers and fresh herbs. Cassis and pepper, Asian spices and a lingering, textural mouthfeel, make this a wine that disappears all too quickly from the bottle.",93,Pepper Bridge 2008 Seven Hills Vineyard Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This should prove to be quite popular, as it's loaded with blackberry and sweet black cherry fruit flavors. It carries the fruit with stiff but polished tannins, and brings in accents of licorice, coffee and dark chocolate. Nothing is overdone; the balance here is just right, and the addition of 16% Syrah brings with it a dash of pepper.",87,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2008 Indian Wells Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This wine is 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Cabernet Franc, 20% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot. The aromas are almost completely shut down at present, with just hints of barrel spice, herb and dark fruit. The fruit flavors are similarly locked up, backed by lightly grainy tannins. There are good things going on but it needs time to reveal itself. Best after 2022.",91,Pepper Bridge 2014 Seven Hills Vineyard Estate Vineyards Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Aged in a mixture of French oak (32% new) and stainless steel, it shows the best of both with fresh peach notes and barrel spices intermingling with crème fraîche. It's creamy in feel with the concentration winnowing slightly toward the finish.",89,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2012 Canoe Ridge Estate Chardonnay (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Lots of zippy acidity in this Chardonnay. Lots of sweetness, too. Tastes like lemon and pineapple pie filling, with heat from the alcohol.",84,La Merika 2010 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Shows Pinot's dry, silky texture, but turns unripe and green, with cherry-mint flavors and high acidity. With Pinot, you get what you pay for.",84,Kirkland Signature 2007 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
"An affordable blend that is almost 60% Malbec, the rest Cabernet Sauvignon, Franc and Syrah. It drinks well, smooth and polished, and the rough tannins that can often overtake the fruit in this region have been nicely managed here, pulling the wine into balance. Strawberry and light black cherry, some herb and tar, and good grip for an everyday red.",88,Velocity 2007 Velo Red Red (Rogue Valley)
"Ripe yellow plum and plump, red-cheeked apricot lead a merry dance. Light, clear honey fills any gaps while notions of passion fruit and lemony acid temper the richness. A very, very fresh-fruited TBA with immense liveliness.",92,Rosenhof 2012 Trockenbeerenauslese Welschriesling (Burgenland)
"Paso Robles-based Alma Sol reaches into Napa Valley for its Cabernet, with good results. The wine is dry, full-bodied and smooth, with rich flavors of blackberries, currants, dark chocolate and spices. Nice now, after a good decanting, and it should develop bottle complexities over 5–6 years.",90,Alma Sol 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"The aromas of yellow apple, pear and spice are light but enchanting. The tart flavors bring a lightly creamy feel, showing a sense of poise.",88,Barnard Griffin 2015 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Aromas of cassis, flint and violet prepare the palate for flavors of black currant, cherry pie, smoke and white chocolate with a hint of purple flowers. Fruit and savory flavors vie for attention among a web of lush tannins. The smooth finish is characterized by sustained floral notes.",90,Vitkin 2009 Petite Sirah (Israel)
This is a textured wine that's rich and round. Its citrus and red berry fruits are balanced with a spice and caramel character.,87,Château la Tour de l'Evêque 2011 Pétale de Rose Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Ripe oaky aromas include prune and raisin scents along with vanilla. This is somewhat rough and heavy in feel, with baked blackberry flavors and roasted meaty notes. A full blast of minty spicy oak controls the finish.",88,Lamadrid 2015 Single Vineyard Bonarda (Agrelo)
"A great Pinot Noir, although it's rugged now in its youth, with a scoury mouthfeel. Raspberries, cherries, cola, mushrooms splashed with balsamic, and white pepper, clove and cinnamon spices mark the flavors. Should emerge from austerity by 2015 and provide good drinking for several years afterward.",95,Talley 2009 Rosemary's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"Rich spice and beautiful balsam notes of cherry cola and root beer set the stage for what is a compelling Chianti Classico with good intensity and staying power. The wine has a chewy, rich texture with long-lasting notes of bursting cherry.",88,Villa Vignamaggio 2006  Chianti Classico
"Raspberry jam, menthol, cooking spice and espresso aromas lead the nose. The palate offers tart red cherry, crushed raspberry, thyme, anise and ground green pepper. Bracing, slightly astringent tannins provide support but need to soften up. Drink after 2018.",89,Castelli del Grevepesa 2010 Castello di Bibbione Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico)
"Fully ripe fruit flavors are accented by light toast and spice notes in this full-bodied and extremely smooth-textured wine. Dense ripe blackberry and dark chocolate flavors seem to coat the palate, and moderate tannins provide good grip.",89,Hess 2015 Shirtail Ranches Cabernet Sauvignon (North Coast)
"Complex notes of bee pollen, saffron and caramel lend nuance to zesty apple and citrus peel aromas on this dry-style Riesling. It's a richly concentrated yet invigoratingly crisp wine marked by sun-kissed tangerine and lime flavors. The finish lingers long, accentuated by layers of crushed chalk and slate.",91,Willi Schaefer 2014 Graacher Trocken Riesling (Mosel)
"Deep berry aromas blend with sweet, creamy, spicy oak notes on the nose of this cellar-worthy bruiser, which is live-wire, energetic and holding a lot in reserve. A full allotment of oak-driven flavors include coffee, mocha, pepper, baked berry and chocolate. On the finish, it's huge and tastes of toast, medicinal berry and chocolate-drenched cherries. Drink from 2015–2025.",94,Emilio Moro 2010 Malleolus  (Ribera del Duero)
"Round and ripe frangipani, jasmine, honeysuckle and white peach aromas contribute to the pretty nose of this bottling, even though they feel as confected as bubblegum. There is a vibrant energy to the palate, which is rich in poached pear, baked apple, dried ginger and caramel flavors. Over the top but pleasant.",87,J. Lohr 2015 Gesture Viognier (Paso Robles)
"Basic but in the best possible way. The nose is familiar, clean and inviting due to licorice, sweet black fruit and smoky aromas. Fresh in the mouth, with bright acidity pumping up berry, cassis and herbal flavors. Composed on the finish, with a high level of competence.",88,Asunto de Vino 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley)
"This wine is 100% varietal, aged entirely in French oak. Shy at first, it allows room for an earthy element of compost and is dark and brooding all around, with sizable, tamed, chalky tannin. Leather, black pepper, licorice and cinnamon all make an appearance, adding to the wine's complexity and likability.",92,Mauritson 2013 Madrone Spring Vineyard Petite Sirah (Rockpile)
"This aged 100% Traminer has aromas of yellow peach, canned apricots and caramel. It is soft on entry into the mouth and has flavors of peach pie and caramelized apples.",89,Château Vartely 2013 D'Or Matur Traminer (Moldova)
"At this stage, this wine is closed and packed with acidity. But just wait for a few years and the ripe wood and yellow fruits will emerge. It's a full-bodied, rich wine that needs to round out. Drink from 2016.",90,Joseph Faiveley 2011 Morgeot Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet)
"The deep, saturated color and vivid, smoky flavors indicate a monster wine, but the reality is more complex and interesting. It smells like boysenberry, grilled beef and black pepper, tastes grapey and berrylike but also roasted and savory. It is surprisingly light-bodied considering how flavorful it is.",87,Quinta Cruz 2010 Silvaspoons Vineyard Souzao (Alta Mesa)
"A wonderfully drinkable Chardonnay that shows brilliant coastal character and lots of richness, at a decent price. Crisp and dry, it has elaborate flavors of pineapples, green apples, peaches, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla and cinnamon spice.",90,Schug 2008 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"A spicy, candied fruitcake nose leads into slightly tart cherry flavors in this New Mexico Cab. The structure is good but the wine needs a bit more balance and depth. Still, it has potential.",81,La Chiripada 2005 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (New Mexico)
"Made entirely from Pinot Noir grapes, this is a light, ethereal and lovely sparkling wine, faintly pink in hue with high-toned, nuanced layers of red cherry and orange. This is one to enjoy on its own or at the table, picnic blanket or tailgating from the back of a truck, preferably with soft cheeses.",93,Davis Family 2014 Rosé de Noir Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Riva dei Fiori shows a light and delicate quality with pretty accents of white flower, almond paste and crushed stone. This sparkler is short and snappy with a clean, bright close.",86,Montesel 2012 Riva dei Fiori Brut  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"This wine—sold direct only through the winery —gets better with time, with stony, cherry and cardamom brightening up through the tannins as the wine has a chance to breathe. Big and full, V. Sattui gets its grapes from mostly Lake County, rounding it out with a smaller percentage of Napa Valley fruit, as well as a handful from Dry Creek. Very solid.",88,V. Sattui 2008 Petite Sirah (North Coast)
"This is a solidly built wine with ripe black-fruit flavors and lots of texture. It looks deeper than usual, smells like blackberries and black pepper, and tastes dry, full and firmly tannic.",86,Barra of Mendocino 2013 Estate Grown Sangiovese (Mendocino)
"his is a fine wine, with balanced noble rot and yellow fruits, layered with honey and a intense acidity in the background. Some wood aging has rounded the texture while not dominating the flavors. Age for 4–6 years.",92,Saget la Perrière 2010 Château de la Mulonnière A la Faveur de l'Automne Chenin Blanc (Coteaux du Layon Beaulieu)
"This wine is deliciously elegant yet decadently rich in all the right ways, from a prime, longtime vineyard source planted to vines over 40 years old. Honeyed apple comes to the fore amid lush, formidable layers of complexity and high-minded pursuit, never getting bogged down, the minerality perfectly pitched and the oak fully integrated.",97,Ramey 2012 Ritchie Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"A skyscraper-sized blend of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Syrah, 9% Cabernet Franc and 4% Malbec, this is a generously structured, tannic and bold expression of plum, leather and pencil lead that leans into gamy, black pepper notes as well. Velvety smooth, it has years to go in the bottle. Cellar through 2025.",93,Viader 2013 Estate Limited Edition Red (Napa Valley)
"Powerful, concentrated Chablis. It is rich, with ripe apricot and nectarine fruit, laced with Seville orange acidity. With a touch of toast, a well-integrated structure, this is a wine for medium-term aging.",92,Olivier Leflaive 2009 Vaudésir Grand Cru  (Chablis)
"Thinner and more traditional in style and appearance, this Riserva has nice balsam- and almond-like intensity. These qualities make it a perfect companion to pork with glazed onions or vegetables au gratin. It's a bit thorny and nervous in the mouth—qualities that probably won't be appreciated by those seeking soft, dense flavors.",87,Lamole di Lamole 2004 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"On the sharp and lean side, showing sour red cherry candy, wintergreen and green peppercorn flavors, fattened with sweet oak. Dry and elegant, but not very rich. Drink up.",86,Benovia 2009 Savoy Vineyards Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"This wine is not at all petite, with its richly layered and concentrated palate. It has an abundance of fine-grained tannins to support its opulent flavors of dark fruits and oaky spices. Full bodied but plush and soothing in texture, it blends in 15% Petit Verdot. Drink through 2022.",92,Michael David 2015 Petite Petit Petite Sirah (Lodi)
"A sophisticated wine that shows richness, creamy character and a fine, crisp toast edge. The fruit is packed with pear and apricot flavors, but is well integrated into a richer, more mature character.",89,Szigeti NV Cuvée Prestige Brut White (Österreichischer Sekt)
"Seemingly sweet and light bodied, this features raspberry, vanilla, brown sugar and cinnamon flavors. It's a delicious wine in the way of a granola candy bar. Drink now.",87,Sequana 2010 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Aromas of mature berry, tilled soil and a whiff of dark spice unfold on this young red. The vibrant, straightforward palate offers easy-drinking pleasure, doling out juicy wild cherry and star anise alongside loose knit, glossy tannins and bright acidity.",87,Istine 2013 Vigna Cavarchione  (Chianti Classico)
"Taut, tart and tangy, this well-built wine was fermented in neutral oak. It's got a pleasant creaminess in the mouth, sharply defined citrus fruits, notably grapefruit and Meyer lemon, and supporting acidity.",88,Lundeen 2013 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
"Here's a genuine and fruit-driven expression of Brunello with ripe notes of mature cherry and blackberry followed by a focused mineral tone of black stone or chalkboard. You'll also get interesting layers of eucalyptus, cola and dried herbs at the back.",90,Piccini 2005 Villa al Cortile  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"This power-packed new Malbec from the son of legendary Mendoza winemaker Jorge Riccitelli shows lush blackberry and cassis aromas along with burnt toast and graphite notes. A huge, saturated palate is resiny and chewy, while flavors of baked black fruits are oaky and savory, with a saucy finish that's bulky. This is full, chunky and delicious; drink through 2024.",92,Matias Riccitelli 2012 Republica del Malbec Malbec (Mendoza)
"Packed with fruit, minerality and impressive wood-aging flavors, this is a single-parcel wine of immense power. Black fruits and tannin share the honors, giving structure and density. It's a wine for long-term aging, solid and concentrated. Drink from 2019.",94,Lemos & Van Zeller 2012 CV Curriculum Vitae Red (Douro)
"This is a candy sweet, soft wine with flavors of pineapples, orange blossoms, apricots, peaches and caramel. Drink now.",83,Castoro Cellars 2006 Roussanne (Paso Robles)
"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of black-skinned fruit, underbrush and a whiff of menthol. The lithe palate offers black wild cherry, crushed raspberry and white pepper alongside firm but polished tannins.",91,Fattoria Torre a Cona 2012 Terre di Cino Sangiovese (Toscana)
"Vigneti di Montegradella is a well-priced Valpolicella with more intensity and density than you'd expect. In fact, the wine offers determination and personality with enough natural extraction to pair with bean soup or barbecued hamburgers.",87,Sartori 2006 Vigneti di Montegradella  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore)
"Honeyed aromas of orange marmalade lead to a flat palate. Bitter flavors of melon and almond skins confirm that this oddball blend of Moscatel, Doradilla and PX from the mountains outside Málaga is lackluster.",83,Finca la Melonera 2015 La Encina del Inglés White (Málaga)
"The production is tiny, yet the potential of this wine is enormous, with its tight, textured structure that is still so young. It is opulent and generous while still keeping a tight rein on its emotions. A steely core is surrounded by fruit that has hints of apricots as well as citrus. This will be a very fine wine but it needs many years, so wait until 2022.",97,Château Haut-Brion 2013  Pessac-Léognan
"With a swirl, this wine's enticing new leather, eucalyptus, woodland berry and herb aromas unfold in the glass. The taut and savory palate offers sour cherry, crushed strawberry, star anise and white pepper notes. Refined tannins and firm acidity provide balance while a hint of coffee signals the close. Drink 2020–2029.",92,Albino Rocca 2014 Montersino  (Barbaresco)
"At the age of 5 1/2 years, this Cabernet is still very forward and sweet in blackberry, cherry, anise and cedar flavors. The tannins are rich and thick, in the way of mountain grapes. The wine tastes a bit one-dimensional, although it could be going through an awkward phase.",87,Cobblestone 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak)
"Similar in style to a Côtes de Gascogne, this is a fruity, ripe and attractively light wine. The crisp, refreshing palate dances along.",85,Baron d'Arignac 2011 White (Gers)
"A good, rugged Zinfandel, tannic and spicy, with a rustic mouthfeel framing wild berry, currant, licorice, beef jerky and spice flavors. Drink now with spicy pork, beef and chicken dishes.",86,Haraszthy 2008 Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
"Cabernet Franc (84%) takes the lead with the rest equal parts Merlot and Petit Verdot. It offers a complex assortment of herbs, including thyme and sage, along with floral notes, blackberry and anise. It's restrained yet fully flavored with a captivating feel and firm, fine-grained tannins. A complete dazzler that will only improve with some additional time in the cellar. Best from 2014 on.",92,Cadence 2011 Bel Canto Cara Mia Vineyard Red (Red Mountain)
"This wine is extremely well integrated and approachable on the nose, with crushed pepper notes spicing up the elegant black currant and plum aromas. Thyme, fennel pollen and licorice notes sing throughout the palate's dark but restrained black fruit, all held together by tarry structure. Drink 2018–2023.",92,Jaffurs 2013 Bien Nacido Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"An expressive wine, with solid, dense and powerful tannins. With a spicy, leathery, dry textured feel, and perfumed fruits supporting it, this is a wine for the seriously long-term. It is black and solid, an impressive evocation of the structure of great Malbec in Cahors. Keep for at least eight years.",95,Clos Troteligotte 2011 K-2 Malbec (Cahors)
"Basically a high-alcohol fruit bomb, with jammy flavors of raspberries and cherries. The heat from 15.5% alcohol gives it a chili pepper burn. Defines that style, for those who like it.",84,Mutt Lynch 2007 Canis Major Perotti Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"A full-force, racy blend led by Merlot. It's ripe, staunch, mildly herbal and shows aromas of leather, savory berry and molasses. The palate is saturated, acid-driven and clacky, so it's lively stuff with medicinal, ripe berry and spice flavors. Finishes snappy and crisp, with pronounced acidity and tannins.",88,Matetic 2008 Corralillo Winemaker's Blend Red (San Antonio)
"Named after the valley where the vineyard is situated, this red-fruited spicy wine is crisp. There are soft tannins and attractive acidity. Drink now.",85,Quinta do Cavalinho 2014 Vale das Donas Red (Tejo)
"Soothing, flavorful and easy to drink, this medium- to full-bodied wine offers measured and ripe plum and berry notes, a velvety texture and lingering finish.",87,Barra of Mendocino 2014 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Mendocino)
"A solid effort for the price, marrying hints of pencil-like oak with bright pineapple and lemon drop flavors. There's ample weight and texture without going over the top, and a moderately long finish. Drink up.",87,Fernz 2009 Chardonnay (Marlborough)
"Produced close to the sea at Bandol, this wine has a good proportion (20%) of Mourvèdre in the blend. That adds to the richness and brings out a fine aromatic floral character. Wild strawberries flavors give a rich ready-to-drink aftertaste.",87,Le Charmel 2016 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Delicate scents of wisteria, acacia, herb and beeswax lift out of the glass. It's both lively and ethereal, offering yellow apple, Bartlett pear and a citrus note framed in crisp acidity and silky perlage.",90,Borgoluce 2016 Rive di Collalto  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Earthy blackberry aromas come with a leafy note and rusticity. The palate on this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is crimped and pinched, with linear flavors of boysenberry and herbs. On the finish, this tastes a bit green, with blueberry sweetness helping to balance things off.",88,Echeverria 2012 Elements Cabernet Sauvignon-Petit Verdot-Carignan-Carmenere Red (Central Valley)
"Extremely dark, inky, black, impenetrable; dense in every way, this highly extracted wine is a real tongue-stainer. The fruit is blueberry compote; the tannins grippy and strong, but polished and ripe; the acids and minerality keep the power under a firm leash.",93,Gorman 2007 The Evil Twin Syrah-Cabernet (Red Mountain)
Aromas of freshly cut apple and pear are followed by dry fleshy fruit flavors with Granny Smith apple notes on the finish. It's an accessible and enjoyable wine.,88,Boomtown 2015 Pinot Gris (Washington)
"Made by refermenting in the bottle and leaving it on its lees without disgorging, this offers savory flavors of juicy lime, ripe pear, mineral and a yeasty note of baked bread alongside a soft mousse. It's dry and balanced with lively acidity.",90,Adami 2013 Sul Lievito  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"From the vineyard around viticulturist Anne Moller-Racke's home planted to the Donum clone, this is a stunner from start to finish, an elegantly tousled expression of mint and bay leaf that's big-boned at first, yet completely lively and fresh on the palate, settling into a place of grace, bursting in brooding dark berry, cherry, cinnamon and clove all wrapped up in a sultry texture.",95,Blue Farm 2013 Anne Katherina Vineyard Farmhouse Estate Farmed Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"This is plummy, spicy and complex, with hints of cracked pepper, clove and cinnamon mingling with fresh mushroom, thyme and mint. The wine is a bit chunky in feel, but finishes with supple tannins and reasonably soft acids, making it approachable now.",89,Urlar 2012 Pinot Noir (Wairarapa)
"Lees and new oak seem to prevail in this wine, giving it a yeasty, caramelized taste that overpowers the fruit, which seems just fine in pineapples, peaches and limes.",84,Clos La Chance 2005 Liebeler Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"This basic Pinot offers up tea and oaky clove and cinnamon aromas. It's fairly fresh and juicy in the mouth despite a mild resiny oak feel, and flavors of meaty berry fruits are fully spiced like a licorice gum drop.",84,Aresti 2011 Estate Selection Pinot Noir (Central Valley)
"This ripe Chardonnay is a successful example of its style, with honeysuckle, white peach and marshmallow aromas on the nose. The palate offers apple custard and lemon curd flavors, held together with savory smoke and sea salt aspects.",88,Harmony Cellars 2015 Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"There is definite richness here. This is a wine that has a mineral structure inside an opulent and ripe outer skin. The fruits run the range from pear to black currants to tropical flavors, all given a delicious spicy edge. Age for 2–4 years.",92,Loimer 2009 Langenlois Terrassen Reserve Riesling (Kamptal)
"The local Beira grape, Maria Gomes, makes a star turn in this apricot and peach flavored wine. The ripe fruit is cut by fresh, crisp lime juice, adding crispness. A final tang of orange completes the picture.",88,Luis Pato 2013 Maria Gomes (Beira Atlantico)
"Rose, violet, red berry, mint, menthol and eucalyptus scents lead the nose. Even at this young stage the vibrant palate seamlessly weaves together juicy Morello cherry, wild strawberry, spice and balsamic sensations supported by firm, polished tannins. It already shows breeding and class, but give it time to develop fully. Drink after 2020.",95,Poderi Aldo Conterno 2010 Bussia  (Barolo)
"This opulent Chianti Classico opens with aromas of violets, black berries, meat juices and spice. The delicious palate delivers concentrated black cherry layered with white pepper, cinnamon, clove and balsamic herbs. It's soft and round but at the same time it boasts alluring intensity.",93,Nittardi 2011 Casanuova di Nittardi  (Chianti Classico)
"Dark berry and a light, tropical fruit quality on the nose add to the appeal of this Pinotage. On the palate, the flavors of juicy berry and banana are rounded and smooth, offering assertive spice but in a gentle package.",84,Indaba 2006 Pinotage (Western Cape)
"This unusual rosé blends Merlot rosé with substantial portions of Chardonnay, Cabernet Franc and Gewürztraminer, highlighting textural and flavor attributes from each. It's luscious in mouthfeel with a dense concentration of tropical fruit flavors, yet brisk and effortlessly quaffable. A delightful new take on a Hamptons classic.",90,Wölffer 2014 Summer in a Bottle Rosé (Long Island)
"This is an elegant wine, with balanced fruit and tannins that make for a soft texture. It is rich and laced with fresh, raspberry-like acidity. It can age for another year, but it is also ready to drink.",89,Quinta do Casal Monteiro 2009 Estate Bottled Vinho Tinto Red (Tejo)
"Pencil eraser, blueberry, olive and peppery notes are what you draw off the bouquet of this ripe yet basic Cab. In the mouth, this feels rubbery and tannic. Flavors of ultraripe black fruits taste sweet and come with licorice and espresso bitterness on the finish, which is mossy, heavy and choppy.",87,Concha y Toro 2011 Marques de Casa Concha Cabernet Sauvignon (Puente Alto)
"Still young, this is a rounded full-bodied and intense wine. It has a very perfumed character, ripe pear and apricot flavors cut with a more steely, tight acidity. A fine Grand Cru wine like this needs several years' aging.",91,Domaine Ehrhart 2011 Domaine Saint-Rémy Hengst Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"More blossomy and mineral than ripe or ruddy, there's a demure elegance to this bristling off-dry Riesling. Crisp, almost crystalline flavors of tangerine and yellow peach accentuate and lengthen the palate. It's a deftly cutting wine to drink now through 2020.",91,Dr. Loosen 2014 Bernkasteler Lay Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"On the thin side of light-bodied, this has an abundance of oak that overpowers the subtle fruit in this wine from an estate property in a relatively warm appellation. Ripe dark cherry takes on a baked quality here.",84,Alexander Valley Vineyards 2012 Estate Grown and Bottled Pinot Noir (Alexander Valley)
"This luminous Chardonnay from southern Italy imparts notes of spice, fresh herbs and little fruit. It is, however, rounded off by mineral notes and some citrus or pineapple-like aromas. It's an easy-drinking white with a chalky, almost sweet sensation in the mouth.",86,Cantine Due Palme 2005 Rocca Normanna Le Sciare Chardonnay (Salento)
"This attractive, steely wine has a good touch of minerality and hints of wood under the crisp lemon fruitiness. Textured with lively acidity and bright freshness, it is ready to drink.",88,Henri de Villamont 2013 Grumes d'Or  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
"Savory tones of roasted beet, truffle and soil juxtapose pristinely ripened cherry and plum in this elegantly balanced Cabernet Franc. It's supple and juicy yet nuanced and earthy. Crisp acidity freshens a long, softly tannic finish.",89,Red Newt Cellars 2014 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes)
"Aromas of toasted nut, brimstone, citrus and a balsam open. The palate offers yellow apple, medicinal herb and nectarine while a saline note marks the close.",87,Feudo Antico 2014 Grillo Parlante Grillo (Terre Siciliane)
"Picture grandma standing over a pot of stewed prunes, which fill the dusty old house with their sickly aromas. Cooked, earthy and rustic, this wine has little going for it. Just barely acceptable.",80,Mont Tauch 1998 Red (Fitou)
"Simple and sweet, with Lifesaver candy flavors of pineapples and lemons. Earns an extra point for the clean mouthfeel.",83,Arrow Creek 2007 Pinot Grigio (California)
"Rich and ripe on the palate. Plush and full, brimming with plum, cherry, chocolate, spice, herb and vanilla flavors. Lively and long on the finish. A real treat.",92,Kosta Browne 2000 Cohn Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Sketchy right away, with salinic, pool water aromas. Awkward and buttery in the mouth, with corn and baked apple flavors. Finishes salty and nutty.",80,Lidio Carraro 2010 Da'divas Chardonnay (Vale dos Vinhedos)
"Made from Roussanne, Viognier and other Rhône varieties, this blend is dry, soft and heavy. But it is flavorful, offering waves of apricots, peaches and coconut-tinged macaroons.",85,Derby 2010 Fifteen 10 White White (Paso Robles)
"Plum, cherry, cassis and earth aromas are as is, with little nuance or complexity. In the mouth, this is plump, maybe a bit chunky. Quiet, ripe plum and spice flavors finish with more of the same and little to no change. Drink now.",89,Viñestral 2009 Reserva  (Rioja)
"This soft and creamy wine is rounded and with a ripe red-berry character. It is verging on off dry, producing a wine that is all fruit with just a tang of acidity to give it a lift at the end. Drink now.",88,Bouvet-Ladubay NV Trésor Rosé Brut  (Saumur)
"Not many people cellar Zinfandel but this is one you might want to for a few years. It's very dry and tannic and extraordinarily dense, with a complex spectrum of red and black currant, pomegranate, molasses cookie, baked cherry pie, root beer, cocoa and peppery spice flavors that go on and on. Shows Zin's full-bodied power, with a fruity sweetness that seduces the palate. Absolutely delicious, but if you're allergic to high alcohol, go elsewhere.",93,Deerfield Ranch 2005 Buchignani Garcia Vineyard Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"The greatly improved Beaumont, under the same ownership as Château Beychevelle in Saint-Julien, has produced a full-bodied, rich wine, which is weighty and packed with serious fruits and tannins. It shows an attractive, black-currant-driven side, but it remains a wine for aging.",90,Château Beaumont 2010  Haut-Médoc
"The bitter-sweet edge of dark fir honey engulfs nose and palate which nonetheless has a core of bright, ripe, juicy and slightly sweet pear. The sweetness sings with that bitter tinge. This is rich but fresh and balanced and leaves with an off-dry aftertaste of more honey.",91,Domaine Fernand Engel 2013 Gloeckelberg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Caramelized blueberry, crushed pepper and a deeply hidden dried green herb component present on the dense nose of this bottling, which hides the grapes typicity a tad yet remains delicious. The palate rides a nice line between smoked beef, chocolate and balsamic reduction and the expected peppery and herbal edges.",91,Byington 2013 Bates Ranch Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Raisin, black plum and oregano are the aromas that define this lightly baked, earthy Malbec. In the mouth, this is direct and slightly raw in feel, but not overly so. Flavors of herbal fruits, raisin and stewed berries finish solid and with a peppery taste that introduces a mild burn to the picture. Drink through 2017.",90,Familia Villanueva 2009 Deorum Private Collection Malbec (Mendoza)
"This is a ripe and fruity wine that's deliciously fresh and fragrant. It has a lively, creamy texture with apple juice flavors and a touch of nuttiness.",88,Klipfel NV Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"Stewy and strained on the nose, this Tempranillo feels raw and tannic. Stewy flavors are derivative of the nose, and the wine is rough, hot and severely tannic on the finish.",82,Sinfonía 2014 Vintage Collection Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)
"This is a one-trick pony, but it's got quite a nice trick. Candied cherry aromas are the opener and follow through on the crisp palate. Little tannin is in evidence on the finish, where cherry flavors are joined by some boysenberry notes. A good choice for pasta in a tomato sauce.",83,Bricco dei Guazzi 2006  Barbera del Monferrato
"Waxy lemon rind and blossom notes accent this off-dry Riesling full of ripe, almost preserved peach flavor. Briskly textured and fresh in acidity, it's an uncomplicated, drinkable wine. Enjoy now through 2019.",88,Moselland 2014 Arsvitis Riesling (Mosel)
"With attractive, authentic aromas of lemon, lees and radiator dust, this Albariño is one of the best you'll find outside of Galicia. The palate is round, layered and citric in the middle, with melon, orange and pineapple flavors. A clean, free-flowing finish is on the money. Drink now.",90,Bouza 2013 Albariño (Montevideo)
"Starts off dark and a bit brooding, with aromas of plum, espresso and black olive, but shows hints of brighter fruit elements on the palate. Mouthfilling but dry on the finish, this is still very young; decant if serving now, or try 2013-2020.",90,D'Arenberg 2008 The Laughing Magpie Shiraz-Viognier (McLaren Vale)
"The almost luminous pink hue promises exuberance: the wine delivers a plethora of fruit notes—spicy elderberries, luscious strawberries and juicy red cherries all take turns to dazzle. Is this your typical rosé? Certainly not—it's more of an ultralight red that needs chilling. But it certainly delivers sophisticated yet fun drinking. Simply abandon yourself to its joyful flavors and celebrate summer!",92,Umathum 2015 Rosa Rosé (Burgenland)
"Cherry cough drop, raspberry and minerally aromas settle on the nose. This four-grape blend shows a lively palate that's dry and crisp in feel, with raspberry, plum and red pepper flavors that lead to a tight finish that peters out quickly.",88,Oliver Conti 2009 Ara Red (Empordà)
"Spanish broom, aromatic herb and orchard fruit aromas lift out of the glass while the rounded palate offers white peach, honeydew melon and a white almond note. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors.",89,Castellari Bergaglio 2012 Pilin  (Gavi)
"This is the best fourteen buck Pinot Noir on the market. It shows plenty of Pinot character, with its silky mouthfeel and cherry, raspberry, cola and spice flavors that finish so dry and clean. Highly recommended for restaurants that want to feature a distinctive California Pinot at an inexpensive price.",86,Aquinas 2006 Pinot Noir (Napa Valley)
"Blue flower, wet earth and dark berry aromas lead the nose. The juicy palate offers blackberry, black cherry and a hint of white pepper alongside soft tannins and bright acidity. Drink soon.",87,Feudo Maccari 2013 Nero d'Avola (Noto)
"This is a simple, slightly sweet wine. It tastes like a pineapple, lime and vanilla pastry melted down into wine, with alcohol giving heat, and acidity to make it crisp.",84,Clos Solène 2008 Essence de Roussanne (Paso Robles)
"Made from native grape Caprettone, this savory wine beckons with inviting fragrances of white flowers, nuts, yellow apple, citrus and flint. The focused palate delivers nectarine, lemon zest, pear, mint and mineral accented with Mediterranean herbs. Crisp acidity gives a refreshing finish. Vinity Wine, Panebianco.",92,Cantine Olivella 2012 Emblema Caprettone (Vesuvio)
"From a small region just north of Pouilly Fumé, this is light and fruity. It's soft, just herbaceous and full of green apple and grapefruit flavors that give a fresh, lively character. It's completely ready to drink.",86,Joseph Mellot 2012 La Gaupière Sauvignon Blanc (Coteaux du Giennois)
"92—94 Barrel sample. A dark, meaty wine, very new world in its richness and opulence. It is concentrated, packed with black fruit.—R.V.",93,Château Faugères 2006 Barrel sample  (Saint-Émilion)
"Gentle notes of red apples play above a balanced, concentrated but sprightly palate: zesty acidity brightens everything and counters the textured weight. Despite being rich, this is very appetizing and makes you long for more.",91,Johanneshof Reinisch 2015 Rotgipfler (Thermenregion)
"Made with organic grapes, this has subtle aromas of red cherry, leather and blue flower. Solid and fresh, the palate offers tart cherry, star anise and clove framed in supple tannins.",88,Campinuovi 2014  Montecucco
"While aromas of smoke, char and plump black cherry lend a sultry tone to the nose, this light-footed wine is surprisingly refreshing on the palate. Brisk and spry, it finishes with an electric jolt of tart red raspberry and cherry acidity.",87,Glorie Farm Winery 2012 Cabernet Franc (Hudson River Region)
"The Sullivan designate complements the Dardis, with a different mix of clones. Here it's Pommard and Dijon 777, and the wine is robust and textural. Aging in 28% new French oak brings up highlights of baking spices around fruit that runs from rhubarb to strawberry to cherry pie. It's balanced and light, and should drink well through 2022.",89,Fairsing 2013 Sullivan Pinot Noir
"This blend of 55% Mourvèdre, 39% Syrah and 6% Grenache comes from Syncline winemaker James Mantone. It brings generous aromas of white pepper, herbs, mulberry jam and dried tobacco. The palate packs a hefty punch with über rich, dense fruit flavors that coat the palate from end to end, leading to a warm, tart finish.",92,Force Majeure 2012 Collaboration Series VI Red (Red Mountain)
"The cool, light Sauvignon Blanc of Touraine has an intensely herbaceous, catty character. This is typically crisp, fresh and very fruity, if one dimensional. Drink now.",84,Paul Buisse 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Touraine)
"This blend of Mourvèdre, Carignane and Syrah is still quite young but already shows lots of savory potential. Wild berry, underbrush, subtle game and crushed slate aromas lead into a palate of loaded with mulberry, sagebrush and cedar flavors. It has loads of energy out of the gate.",89,Municipal Winemakers 2015 MCS Red (Santa Barbara County)
"Made in a completely different style from Uvaggio's typical Primitivo, this is meant to be a reserve-tier bottling, with seven months in new and once-used oak. Crisp berry flavor, along with a hint of cranberry, makes this juicy and balanced. It finishes softly on a slightly nutty note.",90,Uvaggio 2011 Barile Primitivo (Lodi)
"This garnet-colored Merlot has aromas of black plum, cherry and saddle leather which pave the way for soft flavors of raspberry, red plum and a smooth tannic finish.",86,Vini 2015 Veni Vidi Vici Merlot (Thracian Valley)

The lively palate delivers mature yellow apple, lemon zest, bread crust and toasted almond alongside a silky mousse and vibrant acidity.",91,Barone Pizzini 2010 Nature Sparkling (Franciacorta)
"Cool tones of slate and stone accent delicate sour cherry and raspberry flavors in this sprightly dry rosé. Zippy and thirst quenching, yet firmly anchored in minerality, it's an elegant rosé for year-round enjoyment. Drink now.",90,Wittmann 2014 Trocken Rosé (Rheinhessen)
"This soft, smooth and creamy wine has attractive spice and vanilla from the wood aging, along with light citrus and peach flavors. Ripe and full in the mouth, it has a touch of minerality at the end to give a fine texture. It is ready to drink.",87,Louis Jadot 2012  Bourgogne
"This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot opens with rustic aromas of animal sensations along with prune and white pepper notes. The palate shows overripe black cherry along with bell pepper and vanilla accompanied by massive, astringent tannins and not enough freshness.",85,Le Palaie 2009 Bulizio Red (Toscana)
"It's easy to appreciate the buttery aromas, vivid and tangy fruit like crisp apples and Bosc pears, and lively texture with appetizing acidity, elegance and raciness. It's not a big wine but a finely detailed one.",89,Navarro 2013 Chardonnay (Mendocino)
"A big, burly, concentrated Grenache, Yangarra's High Sands bottling seems capable of evolving nicely over the next 3–5 years, although it is supple enough to drink now. Black cherry preserves gain structure on the finish in the form of finely dusty tannins.",88,Yangarra Estate Vineyard 2006 High Sands Grenache (McLaren Vale)
"From a new producer, this Chiles Valley-grown white crackles in waxy apple and lemon-zest aromas. It was aged in mostly stainless steel, with a small addition of neutral oak. Peach fuzz dominates atop the creamy texture, providing brightness in an otherwise full-bodied, though balanced, wine.",90,Herencia 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Candied black cherry, crushed thyme, marjoram, peppercorn and smoked meat show on the nose of this bottling. The palate is very sweet, nearly treacly by sip two, showing concentrated strawberry juice and hoisin spice against a thick mouthfeel.",88,Nicora 2014 Euphoric La Vista Vineyard Grenache (Adelaida District)
"While demure on the nose with just hints of yellow peach and spice, this dry, medium-bodied Riesling builds in intensity on the palate with concentrated flavors of tangerine and yellow cherry. A streak of lemon-lime acidity stretches out the finish.",89,Sheldrake Point 2012 Reserve Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Peppery and tight, a wine with a distinctly dry character. Its black currant flavors are enveloped by the texture of the wine, although there is an excellent pink juicy character. Age for a year. Glass stopper.",89,Zantho 2009 Zweigelt (Burgenland)
"A shy, mineral-leaning nose offers pencil shavings and dark raspberry notes. The palate proves more dynamic, with sagebrush, red cherries and anise seed, showing lots of energy but nothing too complex.",88,Fess Parker 2012 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Musky aromas of white flowers and mustard come before a lean, lemony, restricted palate. Melon, lychee and lime flavors are tropical and slightly oily, with mustardy notes coming back on the finish.",87,Bodegas Ontañón 2013 Vetiver Vendimia Viura (Rioja)
"A savory Pinot Gris that shows how well the variety can grow in Carneros. It was barrel fermented, which gives a creamy richness to the citrus and tropical fruit flavors. A nice edge of acidity adds a clean, bright mouthfeel.",88,Sutcliffe 2011 Pinot Gris (Carneros)
"Aromas of ripe berry, exotic spice, menthol and underbrush slowly take shape in the glass. It's full-bodied, offering raspberry jam, crushed herb and star anise set against fine-grained tannins. Drink 2019–2026.",92,Viberti 2011 La Volta Riserva  (Barolo)
"It's rare to find a Washington Malbec at this price; and this is a very good one at that. Toasty and firm upon entry, it loads the palate with black cherry and cassis, followed with generous barrel flavors of coffee and a finishing thread of smoke. It tastes like a wine that was intended to sell for considerably more.",89,Redd Brand NV Malbec (Yakima Valley)
"Light in color and mellow on the nose, with leesy notes, this always-reliable Albariño is fresh and kicking with acidity. Apple and peach flavors carry over to a plump finish with lasting stone-fruit and melon notes.",90,As Laxas 2016 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Made from a field blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sauvignon Musque, this wine is given three months in French oak. Structured, it also has a decadence of vanilla cream and pear pie surrounded by briny aromas and plenty of citrus.",90,Gustafson Family 2014 Heritage Tree Vineyard Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley)
"Massive blackberry, cherry, currant and mocha flavors characterize this dry, potent Syrah. At the age of five, it's round and mellow in the mouth, with firm tannins and a gentle scour of acidity. Just beginning to show its stuff. Drink now–2018.",92,Qupé 2008 Bien Nacido Hillside Estate Syrah (Santa Maria Valley)
"Smooth Chardonnay-like richness gives concentration to this magnificent ripe wine. The wood aging shows through the fruit, ending on toast, spice and green herbs.",90,Quinta do Vallado 2009 Branco Reserva White (Douro)
"Airfield reds are thoroughly saturated with color, and often quite tannic, to the detriment of the lighter, more subtle fruit. This wine loses its definition and turns from pretty to pretty harsh as a result.",84,Airfield Estates 2007 Spitfire Dolcetto-Primitivo-Sangiovese Red (Yakima Valley)
"This is nothing more than a few barrels of wine bottled by Hughes, a so-called “global vintner.” And like its Lot 128 brother, it is really good juice. Inky and floral, with blueberry and wild raspberry flavors. It's smooth, fresh, bold and finishes with mint and chocolate. Shows the positives of Campo de Borja's Garnacha.",90,Cameron Hughes 2007 Lot 129 Garnacha (Campo de Borja)
"Bold with tannins, this spicy wine is dense and dark. It's all structure and dryness at the moment. And, although the fruit is there, it looks as though the tannins will remain.",85,Xavier Flouret 2015 Château Haut-Meneau Quai Lumière  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"This big-boned Cabernet tastes rich, complex and inviting. It combines cinnamon and cedar aromas, ripe blackberry and cherry flavors and a firm, tannic texture that will love a grilled lamb chop or similar flavorful fare. Concannon ages the reserve lots for at least 18 months in French oak barrels. Best from 2015–2020.",91,Concannon 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley)
"This wine's assertive game, toast, leather, underbrush and balsamic aromas carry over to the tight, linear palate, along with cranberry, red cherry and white pepper notes. Close-grained tannins and racy acidity provide the framework.",90,Ressia 2014 Canova  (Barbaresco)
"One-dimensional and silky, with candied cherry and raspberry flavors that finish a little sweet.",83,Dewitt 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"It's easy to drink this medium-bodied, pleasant Cabernet and enjoy the light herb and cherry flavors. Not tannic in spite of 10% Tannat grapes blended in, it feels soft and tastes mild on the finish.",84,Leaping Horse 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"This is beautiful with fragrant tones of rose petal, wild berry, lemon zest, ginger and sage. Its complexity is impressive and so is the mouthfeel's polished and fine nature. Age this wine 10 years or more.",93,Gianni Gagliardo 2008  Barolo
Aromas of bright pink roses and soft cherry fruit are a bit shy on the nose but pretty when they do arise. The palate of this 85% Syrah and 15% Viognier blend shows raspberry fruit and lime-rind tartness.,87,Four Lanterns 2014 Sunset Rosé (Paso Robles)
"This is a bold, ripe wine, full of both tannins and rich black fruits. Spice from the wood has given the wine an extra dimension while the ripe fruitiness gives it an almost jammy character. As it develops it will broaden into an impressive, concentrated wine. Drink from 2022.",93,Domaine Jacques Prieur 2014  Corton-Bressandes
"Creamy notes of red and yellow apples, just an edge of citrus zestiness and inviting notions of apricot announce a subtle, elegant white with a dense but never heavy structure. Rounded fruit with a wonderfully linear trajectory make this a worthwhile food companion. This is a wonderful expression of the indigenous Austrian Zierfandler.",93,Stadlmann 2012 Mandel-Höh Zierfandler (Thermenregion)
"Opens with light tropical aromas, toasty oak and vanilla. It's honest on the palate, where the body is good and structured and the flavors of peach and apple are accented by toasty oak. Nice and balanced, but maybe a touch woody for what it is.",86,Bodega del Fin del Mundo 2010 Reserva Chardonnay (Patagonia)
"A beautiful, soft and likeable Pinot Noir, with considerable complexity. Shows waves of black cherries, red currants, cola, mocha, bacon, licorice and sandalwood flavors that finish in a swirl of dusty spices. Dry and silky, this Pinot is drinking well now, and should hold over the next six years.",93,Lynmar 2007 Quail Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Aromas of pear, Spanish broom, flint and Mediterranean herb emerge in the glass. The juicy, medium-bodied palate offers ripe apple, peach and lime alongside fresh acidity and a mineral vein. A hazelnut note marks the close.",90,Feudi di San Gregorio 2015  Fiano di Avellino
"Richly structured, this wine is all texture at this stage—although the rich fruit lingers underneath. Apple, pear and citrus fruits give this opulent, powerful wine its freshness. This has a great future ahead.",94,Louis Latour 2010  Corton-Charlemagne
"An intriguing blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Muscadelle, which highlights the herbaceous Sauvignon character and a more perfumed Muscadelle. The two give a fresh, citrus- and pineapple-flavored wine, lively, to be enjoyed young.",86,Château Mont-Pérat 2008 Les Amants Mont-Pérat  (Bordeaux Blanc)
"Named after the tower that dominates the buildings of Esporão, this wine is the pinnacle of achievement from the estate. It is a beautiful, silky textured wine that has dark tannins, a dense structure and intense black fruits. The sum is much more than the parts: a very fine, long-lived wine. Drink from 2019.",95,Herdade do Esporão 2011 Torre do Esporão Garrafeira Red (Alentejo)
"Balanced and subtle but with good character, this blend offers flavors of tobacco, leather and clove. Fruit-driven and accessible, it's both elegant and ageable.",87,Beau Joubert 2005 Oak Lane Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch)
"Leathery cherry and cassis aromas are softened up by baking spice accents. In the mouth, this is hard-edged and pointed, with sharp, lemony acidity. Flavors of spiced plum and pie cherry finish with jagged acids and heat. This is a real enamel-peeler; more time in bottle can only help.",88,Linaje Garsea 2010 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"The pale salmon color and dry palate are the chief attractions of this light-bodied, dry wine. Berry fruit is subdued but enlivened by citrus and notes of white pepper. It's very fresh and refreshing. Drink as soon as possible.",87,Bründlmayer 2014 Langenloiser Zweigelt Rosé (Niederösterreich)
"A lean and peppery style of Rioja that's very much from the old school. Red fruits such as raspberry and pie cherries steal the palate, giving the wine a tangy sensation and a spicy, almost sharp feel and finish. Very young and fresh right now; it improves with patient airing.",86,Viña Salceda 2004 Crianza  (Rioja)
"A supple, oaky red, infused with aromas of sandalwood and flowers and flavors of roasted cherries and dried spices. Finishes smooth and creamy, with hints of vanilla.",88,Quinta da Romeira 1999 Prova Regia Touriga Nacional (Estremadura)
"In homage to the 150th anniversary of Italian unification, this elegantly designed bottle sports a bright Italian flag on the label. That celebratory spirit continues thanks to the wine's aromas of sweet cherry, cola and raspberry. Its light consistency means it could be consumed slightly chilled with cod or fish soup.",87,Il Vino dei Padri 2009 150 Anniversario Ruché (Monferrato)
"Hard to believe this Cabernet Franc-based Bordeaux-style blend is nearly six years old. It's still bitingly tannic. There's a huge core of blackberry and cocoa fruit that's slowly showing aged notes, but those tough tannins will never go away before the fruit fades. Drink up.",87,Star Lane Vineyard 2007 Astral Red (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
"A rather ripe style of the variable grape, this bottling shows honey, mango and caramelized banana on the nose, proving approachable although very buttery. The palate is a bit flat in acidity and texture, but offers white peach and dried apple flavors.",85,Sarah's Vineyard 2014 Viognier (Santa Clara Valley)
"Smooth and supple, this mix of Syrah, Cab Franc, Merlot and Malbec offers generous mixed berry fruit in a fresh, enjoyable style. What's missing is a sense of focus, rather than just blending of four disparate grapes.",88,Jaxon 2012 Forté Red (Southern Oregon)
"This bottling from the San Francisco-based producer is about as Burgundian as California gets. Aromas of honeydew rinds, Meyer lemon pith and honeysuckle meet with briny chalk, chiseled marble and a touch of almond warmth on the nose. The extremely fresh, clean and chalky palate shows stunning texture as well as rounded lemon blossom, sea salt and the faintest butter flavor.",96,Ryan Cochrane 2015 Solomon Hills Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"Red fruit notes with touches of tannin dominate this wine. It is tight, with a bitter cherry flavor that suggests this bottling needs some age. There's a firm feel overall, suggesting this will work better with food than as an apéritif.",88,Duval-Leroy NV Rosé Prestige Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne)
"Sébastian Bordenave-Coustarret has the light touch needed to show the delicacy and great charm of the Petit Manseng grape. With a fine balance between honey and apricot fruits and such poised acidity, the wine is light and fresh as well as ripe. It's wine that will develop slowly, so drink from 2019.",93,Domaine Coustarret 2014 Vent d'Ange  (Jurançon)
"omprised of mostly Montepulciano with 20% Merlot, this shows sweet tones of ripe cherry, blackberry, cinnamon and tobacco. It's simple and straightforward, with clean, velvety lines.",88,Tenuta Vitalonga 2009 Terra di Confine Red (Umbria)
"Leonensis is a truly beautiful blend of Sangiovese (50%) with Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc that opens with plush and thick aromas of chocolate, spice, almond paste, black fruit, cherry and cassis. In the mouth, the wine imparts a soft, smooth texture and long finish.",92,Podere Brizio 2007 Leonensis Red (Sant'Antimo)
"This reticent wine takes a bit of airing to come around, but once it does it shows impressive depth of melon fruit accented by crushed stone. It's medium to full in body, with a slightly oily texture, while the finish has a drying, tactile quality to it that's a bit like chalk dust.",91,Paul Jaboulet Aîné 2009 Le Chevalier de Sterimberg White (Hermitage)
"This is a wine of grace and purity that doesn't try to overwhelm you with richness. The flavor is reminiscent of ripe cherries with the tartness of their skins, and a touch of lavendar and smoky oak.",89,Curtis 2010 Grenache (Santa Barbara County)
"This brand continues to impress in terms of quality-to-price ratio. This blend of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon and 22% Merlot comes from a great appellation and is ready to enjoy now. Raspberry, black cherry and cranberry serve as the finesse side of the equation, before a brawny, chewy sense of power wanders in.",88,Kirkland Signature 2012 Signature Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District)
"Made entirely of Pinot Nero, this elegant, structured sparkler opens with aromas of rose, berry and yeasty sensations of freshly baked butter cookies. The palate delivers a nice depth of flavors including tart red apple, wild strawberry, sage and marjoram alongside brisk acidity and an elegant, persistent mousse. It's already delicious but will also age well over the next few years. Drink through 2019.",92,Tosti 2007 Cuvée Giulio I Pinot Nero (Alta Langa)
"Sourced from the winery's estate vineyard, this bottling presents a compelling depth of earthiness, a stony, rocky sense that gives it a savory edge. Tobacco and tea surround ample plum and blueberry. The wine is approachable and soft, with tiny percentages of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot.",88,Gundlach Bundschu 2012 Merlot (Sonoma Valley)
"This warm ripe blend of Pinot Noir and Gamay has some firm tannins as well as juicy red fruits. It is concentrated and structured while also having a generous, fruity character. Drink this wine now.",88,Florian Roblin 2015 Champ Gibault Pinot Noir-Gamay (Coteaux du Giennois)
"Syrah makes up more than half of this blend that also includes Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah and Malbec. The combination is medium-bodied and mixed, with baked bread and tart cranberry competing for attention. Bay leaf and dried herb also play roles, before the whole finishes light.",86,Deering 2011 Ideal A Better Red Red (Sonoma Valley)
"This is a superripe wine full of rich black fruits and solid tannins. It blends Touriga Nacional with a whole raft of other grapes including Petit Verdot and Merlot. Together this blend gives a powerful wine, dense and full-bodied, that will need aging. Drink from 2017.",92,Companhia das Quintas 2012 Quinta de Pancas Reserva Red (Lisboa)
"They kept this Cab back all this time, presumably at some cost to the company, but consumers are the beneficiaries. Everything has mellowed. The wine, with 1% Petit Verdot, is like hands of cassis, dark chocolate and oak massaging the palate. The grapes were sourced from top vineyards in the Dry Creek, Sonoma and Alexander Valleys. Drink now–2010.",93,Arrowood 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"Owned by the Francisco family since 1870, this wine is juicy and just lightly stalky, with fine crisp acidity. Needing to develop and soften its firm texture, it will be ready to drink from 2020.",85,Château de la Croix 2014  Médoc
"This Alpine sparkler opens with aromas that recall honeysuckle, lily of the valley and candied citrus. The firm palate delivers ripe yellow apple, nectarine zest, candied ginger and toasted walnut accompanied by crisp acidity.",89,Cave du Vin Blanc de Morgex et de la Salle 2008 Cuvée du Prince Metodo Classico Prié Blanc (Vino Spumante)
"Ridge's historic Monte Bello estate produces black tobacco, wet slate, chalk and blueberry jam aromas in this vintage. The wine, which gets support from 14% Merlot-3% Petite Verdot-1% Cabernet Franc, is not very dense and even racy on the palate, with violet, cola, tart cranberry and darker fruit as well.",92,Ridge 2011 Monte Bello Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"A firm, rather lean, stalky wine, dominated by black currant flavors. The tannins are dry, dense. This will show best with food, its firmness and tannic character cutting well with rich meat.",86,Bernard Magrez 2004 Château Tour Blanche  (Médoc)
"This tasty wine opens with savory scents of herb-speckled cranberries and red currants. It's a tight and tangy wine, that comes alive with aggressive aeration. Drink now through 2020.",88,White Rose 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This McLaren Vale-based winery reaches into the neighboring Adelaide Hills for its Chardonnay. This is subtly oaky, hinting at toast and butter, then pulling back to reveal understated apple and citrus flavors that are clean and refreshing on the finish.",88,Kangarilla Road 2015 Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)
"A delicate cherry blossom perfume persists throughout Hazlitt's Rieslings this vintage, and it's especially noticeable in the Homestead Reserve. While off dry in style, it's intensely mineral with a lemon-lime zing that reverberates on the finish.",88,Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards 2013 Homestead Reserve Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Bright and tangy, this is a crisp, tight and mineral wine. It is fruity with pear and lime fruits that are caught up in the tangy texture and tense acidity. This is a wine that could age a while more, so drink from 2017.",88,Domaine du Haut Bourg 2015 Pavillon Sur Lie  (Muscadet Côtes de Grandlieu)
"Thanks to its buoyant aromas of field flower, green apple, pear and dried sage leaf, you could definitely describe this as a multidimensional wine with noticeable elegance. There are musky, sweet fruit flavors on the finish.",87,Conte Collalto NV Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene)
"This was picked at the same time as the regular Viognier, but fermentation was stopped, leaving it as a sweet wine (about 4.8% r.s.). The fruit is laced with honey, lime and apricot; it's delicious without being cloying.",90,Chandler Reach 2007 Dessert Wine Viognier (Yakima Valley)
"Mint, leather and berry aromas result in a strong, warm bouquet with a note of just-run horse and saddle. In the mouth, this feels good and rich, with weight and acidity for balance. Flavors of carob, mint and herbs accent core black-fruit notes, and the finish is dark, with licorice and chocolate flavors.",88,Artesana 2011 Tannat-Merlot (Canelones)
"This Chard has lots going for it, crisp acidity balanced with intense flavors of tropical fruits, orange, buttercream and baking spices. It's easy to drink now with classic California fare like Dungeness crab and buttered sourdough bread.",87,Draxton 2012 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"Chopped herb, underbrush, truffle and balsamic notes lead the nose. The palate is fresh, vibrant and polished, offering sour cherry fruit with a hint of licorice. A sage note closes the finish.",87,Montemercurio 2013 Petaso  (Rosso di Montepulciano)
"Minty boysenberry aromas show modest minerality. The palate feels acidic and clipped, while angular berry flavors lead the charge. A minty, peppery finish comes with scouring acidity, so this needs food.",85,Solsticio 2010 Invierno Malbec (Mendoza)
"Aromas of ripe black fruit, coffee, oak, vanilla and a whiff of rubber take shape in the glass. The palate offers black raspberry, mocha and dark spice notes alongside polished tannins.",88,Al-Cantàra 2011 U Toccu Pinot Nero (Sicilia)
"Here's a quintessential Verdicchio from one of the denomination's rising stars that opens with a fragrance of spring flowers, hay and flint. The palate delivers fleshy white peach, pear and almond flavors, along with mineral notes and bright acidity that results in a refreshing finish. Fun to drink now or hold 2–3 years for additional complexity.",90,La Staffa 2012  Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico
"Serious cellar Cabernet here. It's eruptive with jammy, blackberries, cherries and black currants, with a delicious edge of dark chocolate. The new oak adds spicy, pungent notes of buttered toast and caramel. Yet it's also very tannic. So balanced and finessed, this Cab should have no trouble negotiating the next 10-plus years. Maybe longer. Much longer.",94,Communication Block 2010 Lampyridae Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder)
"Extraordinarily rich in briary flavors of wild blackberries, licorice, cocoa and pepper, this Syrah has the added virtue of finishing dry. Although it's a bit soft, it's a beauty, especially at this price.",90,Bonterra 2006 Syrah (Mendocino County)
"A delicate but earthy nose shows aromas of hibiscus, pencil lead, sagebrush and bay leaf. The palate packs a bright vibrancy, showing flavors of tart cranberry, crushed black pepper, clove, more sagebrush and juniper. This is action-packed but lightly framed.",90,Darcie Kent Vineyards 2012 Pinot Noir (Monterey)
"Reserved on the nose at first, this wine eventually releases pressed black raspberry and elderberry fruit as well as a peppery teriyaki element. Similar fresh fruit shows on the palate, enhanced by anise, dried sage and other aromatic herbs.",91,Culton 2013 Worth Hill VIneyard Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)
"Char and roasted coffee notes lend a brooding, smoky backdrop to bright red berry and cherry flavors in this full-bodied Pinot Noir. Cranberry acidity bristles the palate, leading a long finish marked by firm but fine tannins. It needs another 3–5 years in the cellar to integrate, but should mature elegantly.",90,Franz Keller 2011 Schwarzer Adler Pinot Noir (Baden)
"100% varietal, this wine is a blend of fruit from Ciel du Cheval and Force Majeure vineyards. The dark fruit, mineral, meat, white pepper, green herb and savory aromas are initially brooding but intriguing. The palate packs a big wallop of dark-fruit flavors, bringing a lot of hedonistic appeal. It's not for the faint of heart but it delivers.",92,Mark Ryan 2014 Crazy Mary Mourvèdre (Red Mountain)
"Though still exploring the zesty acid-driven side of Pinot Noir, Marc Piro adds depth and richness to this bottling. Red cherry compote and cordial meet fennel, dill, tarragon and tapenade on the nose. The extremely lively and fresh palate unleashes an array of flower petals, just-pressed tart berries and Kalamata olives. A deep structure and thorough acidity complete the picture.",95,Piro 2015 Presqu'ile Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"Savory, smoky aromas of campfire and grilled beef become leathery as this airs out. This feels wiry and alive, but the flavor profile is stalky and briny, with hints of red plum and raspberry. An odd, nutty flavor rises up on the finish.",85,Bodega Classica 2012 Hacienda Lopez de Haro Crianza  (Rioja)
"Mouthfuls of black cherry, raspberry, nutmeg and cinnamon abound in this wine. It boasts a beautiful structure coupled with elegant freshness. Drink now through the next few years.",89,Giuseppe Campagnola 2011  Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso
"A bouquet of golden apple and honeydew melon sets the scene for flavors of melon, lilac, and barely ripe golden apple. It is smooth on the palate, with fruit and floral notes playing off each other. The lengthy, sophisticated finish wraps up on a nice bright note.",89,Shiloh Winery 2012 Chardonnay (Judean Hills)
"With a dark purple hue and rubbery, horsy aromas of black fruit, leather, dried beef and coffee, this full-bodied blend of 95% Syrah and 5% Garnacha delivers plump, chewy flavors of dark plum and ripe blackberry. There's also a lot of animal, earth and leather to the rustic finish.",87,Marques de Griñon 2007 El Rincón Syrah-Grenache (Vinos de Madrid)
"Ebullient blossom and berry notes waft from this unique carbonated Pinot Noir (blended with proportions of Cabernet Franc and Cayuga grapes). Plump strawberry and cherry flavors are dry on the palate, but concentrated, accented by brisk acidity and sharp, piercing bubbles.",87,Atwater NV Bubble Pinot Noir Rosé Sparkling (Seneca Lake)
"Granulated berry and plum aromas are slightly reduced and come with an animal note on this Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon blend. A flush, weighty palate is well balanced, while flavors of dark plum and cassis finish tannic and a bit rubbery.",87,Spartico 2016 Organic Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon (Utiel-Requena)
"This linear white opens with delicate aromas that recall citrus blossom, citrus peel and orchard fruit. The racy palate offers green Anjou pear, lime and a note of bitter almond alongside a backbone of firm acidity.",87,Montecappone 2014 Mirizzi  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico)
"This is a shy little wine, with woodsy overtones on a base of plum and raspberry fruit. It's a bit thin in the mouth but has reasonable concentration, fine tannins and winds up with an appealing orange rind note. Drink now.",84,Glenora 2007 Vintner's Select Syrah (Finger Lakes)
"You'll love this traditional expression of Barbaresco and its excellent balancing act between the elegance of its natural fruit aromas and the spicy oak-related tones that embellish it. There's a touch of raw fruit or citrus zest as well and the wine closes in a silky, smooth fashion.",90,Giacosa Fratelli 2007 Basarin  (Barbaresco)
"Celebrating the Roman name, Munda, for the Mondego River, this wood-aged wine is also a celebration of the great white grape of the Dão, Encruzado. It is rich, smooth and ripe, with a fine mix of tropical, yellow and crisp citrus fruits all finely integrated into the mineral texture. The wine needs to age a little longer, so drink from 2017.",92,Fontes da Cunha 2013 Munda Branco Encruzado (Dão)
"Peach blossoms, seared orange, jasmine and other white flowers show very strongly on the nose of this wine by veteran Gary Eberle. The palate is ripe with honeysuckle, pears and cooked apples. It's a bit fat in the middle, but texturally focused on the edges with pinpoint acidity.",87,Eberle 2014 Mill Road Vineyard Viognier (Paso Robles)
"Malbec (46%) makes up most of this blend followed by 23% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot and finished with Cabernet Franc. It offers aromas of dark plum, currant, cocoa and spice that are followed by generous, textured and full blue and black-fruit flavors that bring a lot of hedonistic appeal. Coffee flavors linger on the finish.",91,Basalt 2013 Rim Rock Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This Zin is made in the St. Francis style of dryness at the cost of extremely high alcohol. It's a good, lusty wine made for drinking with rich fare that will counter-balanced the heat. The flavors of blackberries, currants and peppery spices are very rich.",86,St. Francis 2007 Montecillo Vineyard Kaarin's Terrace Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley)
"This smells and tastes like a pale Pinot Noir and has some of the body and smooth texture of a red wine, too. Tasty cinnamon, nutmeg and red-cherry flavors get plenty of uplift from zingy acidity, so the balance is great and the finish lingers.",91,Castle Rock 2016 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Mendocino County)
"Smoky and obviously wood-aged, this toasty, spicy wine has extracted black-coffee flavors that mask the black currant fruits. That leaves a wine that seems austere and with a bitter aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",85,Château la Roque de By 2011  Médoc
"Guigal's luxury cuvée from Condrieu is a great success in 2008, marrying richness and power with hints of honeysuckle, toasted nuts and apricot. It's full bodied, creamy in texture and tremendously long on the finish. Drink now–2016, and possibly beyond.",93,E. Guigal 2008 La Doriane  (Condrieu)
"This youthful wine is heavy on oak with aromas of toast, vanilla and coffee bean backed by black cherry, leather and tobacco. There's good depth and dimension, especially in the mouth, thanks to the 3% Petit Verdot that is added to a rich Sangiovese base. Only 300 cases were made.",86,Candialle 2006  Chianti Classico
"Pretty whiffs of rose petal and stone fruit mark this fragrant sunny semidry Riesling. Suggesting delicate extractions of apricot and white peach, it's softer and rounder on the palate than Keuka Lake Vineyard's dry Rieslings. The finish is brisk and citrus.",89,Keuka Lake Vineyards 2015 Estate Grown and Bottled Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Scratchy, candied aromas of red fruits get things off to a rough start. The wine is acidic in feel, with tart, herbal red-fruit flavors. And it finishes pickled, with an herbal sharpness.",82,Abrazo 2011 Garnacha (Cariñena)
"Sourced from vines that date back more than 100 years on the Beatty Ranch, this wine is appropriately robust, a big, syrupy concentration of baked blackberry and plum. Soft in tannins and structured, it finishes with a complexity of vanilla and black cherry.",90,Howell Mountain Vineyards 2012 Old Vine Zinfandel (Howell Mountain)
"Dark and brooding with blackberry and boysenberry flavors, this fresh, juicy wine boasts generous oak and tannin. Sourced from the estate vineyard of Freeman Winery in Sebastopol, it gains clove and dried herb nuances as it develops.",91,Cellars 33 2014 Gloria Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Feudi di San Gregorio's distinctive take on the indigenous Greco variety favors a more saturated and concentrated style. The color  is slightly more golden and intense and the aromas reveal ripe melon, honey, dried hay and almond.",89,Feudi di San Gregorio 2005  Greco di Tufo
"Alluring red cherry wraps itself around a velvety texture with tannic foundation and a substantial mouthfeel. Though powerful, it's sexy and floral, with buoyant acidity and weight.",92,Kokomo 2013 Grenache (Dry Creek Valley)
"One of Friuli Venezia Giulia's little known denominations, the Carso growing zone, with its rocky soil, is turning out some fine whites like this elegant Pinot Grigio. Round, creamy but also loaded with finesse, it delivers aromas and flavors of ripe pear, creamy apple and juicy lemon while a stony mineral note graces the finish.",90,Castelvecchio 2015 Pinot Grigio
"Red currant and red berry fruits show strongly in this wine from Virginie Aubrion's biodynamic vineyards. The tannins are strong, although leaving space for the fruitiness. It needs to develop, with good acidity likely to come through. Drink from 2016.",85,Château de Piote 2013 Cuvée Prestige  (Bordeaux Supérieur)
"Now officially labeled from the newly named Malibu Coast appellation, this bottling shows lots of potential for the region. Aromas of lush lemonade, crushed vanilla, browned butter, honeysuckle and honey lead into a soft and lush palate that's buttery but high-toned. Flavors of toasted bread with orange marmalade prove warm but tartly dynamic.",92,Dolin 2013 Estate Chardonnay (Malibu Coast)
"Dense and meaty like a baked purple leather pouch, this is tightly tannic, with a lift of acidity on the midpalate and a hint of violet struggling to get out. It's an interesting wine; give it 3–5 years in the cellar or drink now with red meat.",89,Steven Kent 2008 Ghielmetti Vineyard Petit Verdot (Livermore Valley)
"Full of the bright fruit typical of the vintage, this wine is made from 90% Merlot with a touch of Cabernet Franc. It's structured with still-young tannins and is dominated by red berry fruit, needing to age until 2021.",91,Château Tour Grand Faurie 2014  Saint-Émilion
"Soft and rounded, this rich wine brings out the smoother side of Sauvignon Blanc. With its apple and pear flavors, it has ripeness that is cut by lime acidity. Drink this wine from 2017.",89,Alain Girard et Fils 2014  Sancerre
"Quince, toast and ripe apricots combine easily in this full, rich wine. It has attractive spice, juicy apricot juice and a rounded, textured aftertaste conveying nutmeg as well as fresh acidity. Laurent and Sophie Cisneros bought Rouillac with a focus: eliminate chemical pesticides and herbicides. They built a barrel cellar to environmental European standards. Eric Boissenot consults.",87,Château de Rouillac 2013  Pessac-Léognan
"A slightly chunky and inelegant Côtes du Rhône, this wine nevertheless delivers satisfying and assertive notes of black olive, espresso and dark chocolate. Drink it over the next few years.",86,André Brunel 2009 Red (Côtes du Rhône)
"A delicious, crisp wine, with great bitter cherry and wild strawberry flavors and a high-definition streak of acidity. A great summer drink, but also for food.",88,Roger et Didier Raimbault 2008 Rosé Pinot Noir (Sancerre)
"With fine, dusty tannins, this rich and juicy wine wears its fruit on its sleeve, all black plums and blackberry flavors. The acidity of the year is almost sweet with the fresh ripeness of the fruit. It is developing well, showing a medium-term future. Drink from 2018.",92,Château Capbern 2013  Saint-Estèphe
"From vines on the plain of Saint-Émilion, close to the Dordogne river, this is a ripe fruity wine. The tannins are already well integrated into the berry fruits, leaving just a dry core that is typical of the year. Drink the wine from 2018.",88,Château Abelyce 2011  Saint-Émilion
"Stunning is the only word that does justice to this exceptional wine. It's fragrant and compelling, from the first sniffs of almond paste, butter cream and apple pie, right on through a magnificent palate loaded with well-balanced fruit, pastry and nut flavors. Rich, complex, and beautifully proportioned, it rolls into a seamless, toasty finish.",95,Fairsing 2013 Chardonnay
"This is a structured, substantial wine, grippy on the palate, with firm-grained tannin and smoky oak. Mouth-filling with a juicy sophisticated core of cherry, blackberry and black currant, there's a defiant meatiness to the fruit, spiked in clove, black pepper and tobacco. Cellar through 2033.",94,The Vineyard House 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"Riesling that is just becoming mature is the foundation of this perfumed, white fruit and complex wine. Dried apricot and spice cake flavors give the wine richness and balance the fruitiness that is now maturing. Drink this fine wine now.",90,Vieil Armand 2009 Château Ollwiller Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"This is pure Cabernet Sauvignon from the Stillwater vineyard, ripe and loaded with dark fruits. There's a strong element of char, smoke and roasted espresso running through the finish. Tannins are silky, but the flavors are right on the edge of burnt. Drink this with a juicy, charcoal-grilled steak and it will hit the bulls-eye.",90,Elevation Cellars 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Soft and heavy, this has lots of sweet oak riding on top of blackberry and cherry jam flavors. It feels overextracted, lacking subtlety, but it sure is fancy. Drink now.",86,Rutherford Ranch 2008 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This bottling is easy, light and crisp, starting with squeezed orange and ripe yellow apples on the nose. It's delicate on the palate, with citrus and stone-fruit flavors, just right for an afternoon sip in the sun.",87,Maddalena 2015 Pinot Grigio (Monterey)
"This 100% Syrah shows intense blackberry, crème de cassis and plum sauce flavors, plus hints of charred bone and black pepper. It's dry, and the tannins are firm but supple. The alcohol is high, but it's balanced with the wine's fruit.",90,Donelan 2010 Cuvee Christine Syrah (Sonoma County)
"Aged for seven years before disgorging, this deliciously mature wine is full of Pinot Noir richness. It has a warm character that seems to be the style of this producer in the Côte de Sézanne. Named after the king who created the French monarchy, the wine has toast, almonds and a generous, creamy aftertaste. Drink now.",93,Le Brun de Neuville NV Lady de N. Cuvée Clovis  (Champagne)
"The nose gives little away but once tasted, there is an understated but deeply stony, pear-fruited and textured palate. This is less about fruit and more about soil and mouthfeel. There is depth and subtle warmth, quite some backbone and a fresh, lingering finish.",90,Prieler 2015 Seeberg Pinot Blanc (Burgenland)
"Fresh and fruity, light and fragrant, a wine with citrus flavors over red currants, spoilt by a metallic aftertaste.",84,Barton & Guestier 2012 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Fermented and aged in barrels, this wine leads with wood and butterscotch sensations that carry over to the palate, along with yellow apples and pear. The dense, buttery palate is brightened by fresh acidity. If you appreciate wines with evident oak influence, you'll enjoy this.",88,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano 2011 Sanct Valentin Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
"Pepper and molasses aromas top concentrated black plum notes on the nose. The mouth is chewy and medium-weight, and offers bright but sturdy blackberry fruit, and some earth and oak notes. Finishes with good length, and tart berry and fresh-cut wood flavors.",88,Morandé 1999 Edicion Limitada Syrah-Cabernet (Maipo Valley)
"Very light in aromas for two often-overpowering grapes, this delicately arranged bottling with patience shows rainy slate and pear-skin aromas. The minerally concrete character carries the sip, where yellow-apple skins and squeezed lemons make for a racy experience. It's a white wine for the cellar.",88,Refugio Ranch 2013 Roussanne-Viognier (Santa Ynez Valley)
"From Château des Landes' old vines, this is a concentrated, solid wine. Dark tannins have dark chocolate and licorice flavors, with a structure that dominates the fruit and needs to soften. New wood aging was perhaps excessive, but give the wine time. Drink from 2017.",88,Château des Landes 2011 Cuvée Prestige  (Lussac Saint-Émilion)
"Sharp-edged aromas show classic notes of grass and fresh asparagus. In the mouth, it pulls the fruit forward: there are lightly honeyed flavors of melon and peach with a slightly sugary, short finish.",86,Catman 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Willamette Valley)
"This wine starts off smelling overly ripe, with sweet orange, yellow apple flesh, peach supreme and juicy melon aromas that flood the bouquet. The mouth is full and round, but a nutty accent adds depth to the palate while medium acidity helps to lift the medium-length close.",87,Golan Heights Winery 2009 Gilgal Chardonnay (Galilee)
"The name pays homage to the Gavilan Mountains where the grapes were grown. It's a good Pinot Noir for drinking now. Dry, crisp and silky, it has flavors of raspberry tea and pomegranates, with toasty oak notes.",86,Chalone Vineyard 2012 Gavilan Pinot Noir (Chalone)
"This tasty but ultimately simple Pinot is soft and sweetly forward in raspberry jam, cola, brown sugar and oak flavors. Drink up.",85,Santa Barbara Winery 2012 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Ripe, almost sweet, fruit is full of delicious black plum and berry flavors. The wine is rounded, opulent and generous to a fault. A solid core of darker tannins hold all this richness together. Drink from 2015.",90,Château Haut-Monplaisir 2012 Malbec (Cahors)
"Made in the modern style of ripe fruit and elaborate oak, this rich, creamy Chardonnay features pineapple jam, peach pie and toasty vanilla flavors. It's a bit obvious, but lipsmackingly delicious.",87,Buena Vista 2007 Dijon Clones Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Muddled, oily aromas are funky for certain. This blend of Riesling, Albariño and Savagnin feels round and melony, but ultimately soft. Floral, pickled melon flavors come in front of a briny, tropical-leaning finish.",84,Viña Alicia 2014 Tiara White (Luján de Cuyo)
"This is a rich and smooth wine, full of impressively ripe fruit tones without going over the top. Bright acidity brings balance and elegance, with juicy berry flavors rounding out the palate. Drink now through 2019.",90,Monte da Penha 2009 Red (Alentejano)
"Restrained in new oak, this refined wine has a floral honeysuckle character that's followed by hearty, rich layers of apple and melon. Just a touch of licorice and orange zest appears on the finish.",90,Pride Mountain 2012 Vintner Select Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"Red Mountain is not especially known for its Gewürztraminer other than the late harvest wines from Kiona. Here it has been blended with 12% Marsanne, resulting in a spicy, off-dry (1.4 residual sugar), rather yeasty wine.",85,Mount Baker Vineyards 2008 Gewürztraminer (Red Mountain)
"A charming young Cabernet, this is rich in blackberry, currant and anise flavors that are complex and interesting. It's a very dry wine, but the fruit is so polished, it seems almost sweet. This is delicious now, although it's pretty tannic and could develop bottle complexity over the next 6–8 years.",90,Beaucanon 2009 Longwood Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This is sort of a second wine from Chalone, but it's a very good one. The grapes were grown in the Gavilan Mountains, where Chalone is located. It shows plenty of acidity, and the apricot, orange, mango and honey flavors are enhanced with a stony minerality that create elegance.",89,Chalone Vineyard 2012 Gavilan Chardonnay (Chalone)
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc shows all the charms of the 2007 vintage. It's an opulent, delicious wine, immediately likeable now for its broad array of blackberry, cherry, raspberry, mocha, cassis and new oak flavors. The tannins are soft, but strong enough to protect this wine for the next six years at the very least.",94,Spring Mountain Vineyard 2007 Elivette Red (Spring Mountain District)
"This Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend comes with a deep, minerally aroma as well as with lush black-fruit, herb and spice notes. The feel is plump and smooth, while the core flavors are of blackberry, tobacco, raw oak and spice. It's predominantly round and ripe, but there's more than enough crispness and tannic bite to keep things framed.",90,Estampa 2010 Reserve Assemblage Cabernet Sauvignon-Carménère-Petit Verdot Red (Colchagua Valley)
"This dark red sparkling wine made from Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier smells like Dr. Pepper, has lively bubbles and leaves a dry, very fruity impression on the palate. Dark cherry and ripe plum flavors dominate.",87,Bonny Doon 2014 Pinot Doonier Sparkling (California)
"The main thing to know about this blend of undisclosed varieties is that it's not dry. It will appeal to consumers who like their white wines fruity and sugary, yet it's not really sweet enough to enjoy as a dessert sipper.",82,Acronym 2011 Great White (California)
"A blend of Syrah and Zinfandel, this is a sharp, Porty wine with flavors of raisins and caramelized blackberries. It's semisweet and sharp on the finish.",83,Fralich 2004 Harry's Cuvée Red (Paso Robles)
"This already mature wine starts off with aromas of herbs and beet greens, then quickly turns leathery with exposure to air. Flavors of leather, dried fruit and decay are a bit lean and astringent. Although the fruit seems to be departing rather precipitously, there's sufficient complexity to merit interest.",83,Tamar Ridge 2004 Pinot Noir (Tasmania)
"A huge Cabernet, in the best sense of the word. It wasn't the easiest vintage, as 2007 was, but meticulous winemaking did the job, resulting in this amazingly rich, impressively ripe wine that's drinkable now and will develop for many years. The fruits veer toward blackberries, cherries and cola, and the tannins are soft and refined. One hundred percent new French oak isn't at all heavy, lending nuances of buttered toast and sweet wood tannins. Will easily age for 15 years.",96,Groth 2008 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"Crisp with bright fruit recalling sliced apples, this wine is fruity and fresh. Acidity cuts easily through it and lends an herbal edge. Drink now.",86,Château Barbé 2016  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux
"This informal red opens with aromas of violet, berry and a whiff of sawdust. The simple, fleeting palate offers dried black cherry and a hint of dark spice alongside grainy tannins that lead into an astringent, abrupt finish.",86,Godiolo 2012  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano
"Fragrant and soft, this sends up a chocolaty mix of strawberry and raspberry fruit scents and flavors. It's a barrel selection from a variety of vineyards, and is young enough to show a stiff, somewhat herbal edge to the tannins. Give it an hour or two in a decanter for best drinking.",89,King Estate 2011 Backbone Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This vital, athletic wine is tempting now but will be best to drink after 2018. It has a dark color with a red-brick rim and opulent fruit aromas. Tangy, mouth-filling cherry and raspberry flavors come with a vibrant, tannic, lively texture. It's a bit tight to enjoy now, but will mellow and mature in the cellar.",93,Balo 2012 Avenging Angel Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Here's a straightforward red that opens with aromas of red berry and blue flowers. The easy-drinking palate offers wild cherry, clove and dried Mediterranean herbs alongside bright acidity and dusty tannins. Drink through 2016.",87,Suberli 2013  Morellino di Scansano
"While delicate in frame, layers of exotic spice and vanilla amidst creamy peach and tangerine flavors lend flamboyance to this Chardonnay. It's forward and a bit oaky, but finishes vibrantly and briskly.",87,Wagner 2014 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"This is taut and minerally, with intense acidity. The structure comes from tangy notes of lemon zest and peach skin. There is some discreet wood aging, but it remains crisp and refreshing.",89,Vincent Prunier 2010  Chassagne-Montrachet
"90-92 Dominated by its acidity, the tannins firm without being too dry, finely integrated into the rich structure. A fine finish of licorice and black plum skins.",91,Château Cantemerle 2010 Barrel sample  (Haut-Médoc)
"Lush and creamy in texture, this shows just how good some relatively inexpensive Barossa Shiraz can be. Elements of graham cracker, espresso, dark chocolate and baking spices are bolstered by ample weight and berry fruit. Enjoy this velvety wine over the short term—by 2018 or so.",91,3 Rings 2013 Shiraz (Barossa Valley)
"This pioneering winery is all about integration of aromas and flavors, with this bottling showing rounded notes of honey, macadamia nut, salted peach and candied lemongrass on the nose. The blend of 72% Roussanne, 23% Grenache Blanc and 5% Picpoul Blanc is light and delicate on the sip and refreshing in structure, with crisp yellow-apple-skin flavors.",90,Tablas Creek 2014 Espirit de Tablas Blanc White (Adelaida District)
"Quite a good, distinguished Cabernet. It's rich and robust, with explosive blackberry and currant flavors, liberally coated with smoky oak, that finish in a swirl of chocolate. Most exquisite are the tannins, so pure and refined. The name refers to the number of barrels in the blend, which comes from St. Helena, Rutherford and Spring Mountain.",94,Hunnicutt 2006 9-3-5 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"If Pinot's first responsibility is to seduce the palate, this one succeeds admirably. It's soft as velvet and silk, and drily opulent, with gorgeously refined tannins that frame lush, intricate flavors. Waves of cherry pie, red currant, licorice, cola and cedar flavors wash over the palate, and feel distinguished, the way a top red wine should. Drink now through 2012.",94,Kazmer & Blaise 2006 Primo's Hill Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"This young wine is already softening up around the tannic edges, and showing some early maturation of the plum and berry fruit flavors. A streak of mint and licorice runs into the finish, along with some not-quite-integrated oak tannins.",87,Marshall Davis 2013 Beacon Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir
"The nose on this Norton is an admixture of underbrush and dark chocolate notes, coupled with blackberry, rose and vanilla accents. Medium to full in body, it has fine, dusty tannins and balanced acids. The finish comes with a hint of tobacco and a minerally tang.",85,Mount Pleasant Winery 2009 Estates Norton (Missouri)
"The third wine of Quinta da Romaneira is made to be drunk young. The aim has succeeded here, as this is a ripe and smoothly textured wine. It has richly satisfying notes of black plum and soft, already well-integrated tannins. Acidity shines through at the end. Drink now.",89,Quinta da Romaneira 2011 Sino da Romaneira Red (Douro)
"A resiny, oily nose is barrel heavy and a strong clue of what's to come. The palate has a thick, syrupy feel and sweet, almost sugary flavors of pear and melon. By the time it's wrapping up, the wine veers towards cloying. Has its virtues but it's entirely too sweet in this critic's opinion.",85,Luca 2009 G Lot Chardonnay (Tupungato)
"Aged in four-year-old barrels for 16 months, this bottling allows its elegant fruit to shine, showing concentrated black cherry, cola, rose petal and ginger aromas. A tight boysenberry note emerges on the palate, dusted with clove and lavender and cut by lively acidity. A thorough and complete wine.",93,Fess Parker 2015 Older Barrel Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"There are lots of rich, ripe vanilla, buttered toast and tropical fruit flavors in this creamy wine. Brightened with acidity, it will appeal to plenty of Chardonnay fans.",85,Steelhead Vineyards 2010 Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"This opens with tobacco, dark spice, forest floor and leather aromas. The palate offers dried black cherry, licorice and clove flavors, set against tightly wound, taut tannins. It still needs a few years to come together. Drink 2019–2025.",90,Tenuta di Sesta 2012  Brunello di Montalcino
"Bright gold in color, with oily aromas of dried apricot, this is distinctly not peppy or lively on the nose. Mature and fleshy in feel, this is on its last legs. Flavors of bitter stone fruits and salt hold steady on the finish.",84,Attis 2014 Lías Finas Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Deeply savory tones of bramble and earth are juxtaposed against fresh tangerine and lemon in this light-footed, semidry Riesling. It's not a deeply complex wine but sprightly and crisp, with a clean, slightly honeyed finish. Drink now.",88,HXM NV Riesling (Landwein Rhein)
"Best Buy wines come in all shapes and sizes. This one settles at the bottom of the category, which doesn't mean that it doesn't have its charms, namely sweet and ready fruit and just enough acidity to keep it from being cloying. Keep in mind the price and young vintage when drinking.",84,Santa Julia 2007 Malbec (Mendoza)
"91-93 Attractive, fresh wine, with a delicious delicacy as well as the perfumed acidity. There is a tasty pear juice and spice combination to finish.",92,Château Lamothe Guignard 2010 Barrel sample  (Sauternes)
"Dry and full-bodied, this structured version of Viognier has subtle fruit aromas of melon and peach, flavors accented by oak and vanilla, a firm texture and clean finish. A substantial white wine, it should pair well with seafood, light meat dishes and creamy sauces.",87,Sobon Estate 2013 Viognier (Amador County)
"A superb wine, the product of a great vineyard site and old vines. The wine is concentrated, very rich, beautifully balanced between considerable acidity and sweet white fruits and mandarin oranges. With its tense, edgy texture, it is a wine that will age for many years.",96,Bründlmayer 2010 Zöbinger Heiligenstein Erste Lage Alte Reben Reserve Riesling (Kamptal)
"From the Treviso area of Prosecco, this luminous sparkler offers steely effervescence and sharp aromas of white flower and dried grass. There's also a touch of bitter almond on the crisp finish.",85,Maccari Spumanti NV Extra Dry  (Prosecco)
"Imagine a Sauvignon Blanc with the weight of Chardonnay, and that's what you get with this single-vineyard wine. It's amazing, because the wine never saw oak. Still, it has a vanilla richness on top of pineapple, peach, anise and honeysuckle flavors. Maybe the correct comparison is of a white Cabernet Sauvignon, with the complexity that implies. What a great value.",93,Dutton Estate 2006 Dutton Ranch Kylie's Cuvée Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley)
"Cedar, cola and spicy oak notes fill the aroma of this full-bodied, well-balanced and smooth-textured wine. The flavors are soaked with concentrated and layered black cherry and currant fruit that persists nicely on the finish. A generous helping of fine-grained tannins adds to the velvety mouthfeel.",92,Las Positas 2013 Meritage (Livermore Valley)
"Right out of the bottle, this wine is tannic and closed. After a while in the glass, it starts to soften, showing mushroom, cola, pomegranate and raspberry flavors, but it's still resistant. Give it until 2018, and it should gradually unfold for another few years afterward.",91,Failla 2012 Keefer Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Hefty, spicy aromas like black pepper, cardamom and wood smoke are followed by ripe, almost thick sensations of blackberry, blueberry and dried black fig. The mouthfeel of this wine is broad and soothing, the body extra full, and the finish lingers nicely.",93,Trinitas 2014 Zinfandel (El Dorado)
"Take a walk on the wild side with this Rhône-style blend. It has wonderful, concentrated, meaty flavors backing up the wild, savory, slightly earthy aromas. Not too full-bodied, it is well-balanced in an appetizingly astringent way, complex in flavors and lingering on the finish. Blended from 76% Grenache, plus five other Rhône varietals.",94,Sol Rouge 2011 Gypsy Rouge Estate Red (Red Hills Lake County)
"From Gallo's Central Coast brand, a lean, tart and minerally Chardonnay marked by flavors of flint and lime just veering into tart green apple. Extremely well made, and not without interest, but if big, blowsy Chards are your thing, look elsewhere.",87,Anapamu 2001 Chardonnay (Monterey County)
"Tighter blackberry and blueberry fruits meet with a touch of fennel on this nose of this appellation blend by Billy Wathen and Dick Dore. Flavors range from refreshing blackberry soda to root beer and cola, achieving a measure of elegance thanks to dill, tomato leaf and a tannic grip.",89,Foxen 7200 2012 7200 Cabernet Sauvignon (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
"An aromatically interesting wine with notes of cherry, cedar and nori. The palate is flavorful with dry, rustic tannins.",85,Naches Heights 2010 Naches Heights Vineyard Syrah (Naches Heights)
"Full dark berry aromas and flavors and classic pepper accents mark this very likeable wine. Cocoa and meaty elements add a bit of complexity not necessarily expected at this price. Kept lively by its brisk, but not sharp acidity, it finishes peppery with a tart-sweet profile.  This straightforward, delicious wine exemplifies how competitive California can still be, despite the trend to priciness.",87,Cline 1999 Zinfandel (California)
"This Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend is deep red-violet in color, with a nose of black cherry and Tuscan peppers. Cool notes trump fruit in a mélange of black cherry, vanilla, mint and aniseed flavors with a hint of brambles. Stiff but forgiving tannins linger on the palate with a flash of acidity at the back of the throat.",90,Tulip Winery 2011 Black Tulip Red (Galilee)
"Sweet cedar, cinnamon and plum aromas are followed by plush and pretty flavors of black cherry, raspberry and plum. The wine offers a good acid balance and a spicy, bright finish. This should pair well with tomato-based dishes and lamb.",88,Nemeion Estate 2010 Agiorgitiko (Nemea)
"Touches of cedar and fresh-cut oak in the aroma join ripe but dry fruit flavors and firm tannins on the palate. Well structured for mid-term aging, this wine will be best after 2019.",91,High Valley Vineyard 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (High Valley)
"Palai (100% Müller-Thurgau) is a compelling and fresh white with just enough complexity to keep you guessing. Stone fruit, honey, crushed granite and pressed white rose appear on the bouquet. The wine is dry and polished with a long finish.",86,Pojer & Sandri 2010 Palai Müller-Thurgau (Vigneti delle Dolomiti)
"Every intervention available to the winemaker for creating richness has been applied here, including 75% new French oak. California Chardonnay hardly gets more extravagant in buttercream, smoky toast, lemon drop, apple butter and pear flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Grown in one of the coolest areas of the appellation, yet it's so rich and full bodied, it almost has the body of a red wine. Don't let it get too cold, and pay attention as it warms and evolves in the glass.",92,Moone-Tsai 2010 Charles Heintz Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"Spicy, tarry, gritty aromas of asphalt and olive drive the bouquet. This feels ripe and full bodied, with stewed plum, herb and cardamom flavors. Toast, dark-berry flavors and mint are the key notes to the finish.",88,San Pedro 2011 1865 Single Vineyard Carmenère (Maule Valley)
"Less bright and perfumed than La Coterie's Passe Colline bottling, this is still a soft, approachable wine with ample cherry fruit. Hints of leather and white pepper give it a bit of complexity. The blend is 65% Grenache, 25% Syrah and 10% Carignan.",85,Vignobles La Coterie 2010 Pierre du Diable Red (Ventoux)
"Creamy, lemon-scented apples offer a harmonious, easy to enjoy and friendly palate on this aromatic, bright and fruity white. With a slender, scented silhouette, this is designed for easy, lightweight summer sipping. Drink soon while flavors are in their prime.",89,Dürnberg 2015 Falko Cuvée White (Niederösterreich)
"Easy to see what the winemaker was aiming for with this Cabernet Sauvignon-based wine. Sheer opulence was the goal, and it succeeds. The wine is soft and gentle, with ultrarefined tannins and incredibly ripe, concentrated blackberry jam, blueberry, chocolate and sweet oak flavors. The alcohol is quite high, which gives it a glyceriney sweetness and also precludes aging. Drink now–2014.",92,Delectus 2010 Cuvée Julia Red (Knights Valley)
"Attractive, strong oak accents like charcoal and bacon dress up this full-bodied, high-octane wine. The palate is bold and ripe, with dark fruit flavors. The American oak bottling exhibits greater tannic structure than the French oak bottling, and it's interesting to enjoy them side by side.",88,Herzog 2014 Variations American Oak Cabernet Sauvignon (North Coast)
"Definitively taking a cool-climate approach, this 100% varietal wine opens with indelible wafts of violets and white pepper, followed by a presence of more pepper and black currant around a medium-sized body. Earthy leather and mushroom pronounce themselves on the midpalate before it finishes in black licorice.",90,People's Wine Revolution 2013 Three Rivers Ranch Syrah (Bennett Valley)
"Linear and loaded with finesse, this delicate, polished red opens with fragrant blue flower, berry and crushed herb scents. The bright, ethereal palate offers sour cherry, strawberry and a hint of baking spice, framed by silky tannins and vibrant acidity. Drink soon.",89,Selvapiana 2014  Chianti Rufina
Granit is the sandy granite hillside soil of northern Beaujolais. The vineyard is a neighbor to the Fleurie appellation. This textured wine is rich with cherry and red-currant flavors that are rounded out and have just hint of tannins. The wine could soften even more so wait until early 2016.,89,Domaine de Colonat 2014 Perle de Granit  (Beaujolais-Villages)
"Mild white-fruit aromas come with notes of white pepper. This has a chunky, oily feel and pithy, lightly vegetal flavors of lime, peach and melon. A salty flavor rises up on the finish.",86,Marqués de Cáceres 2015 Verdejo (Rueda)
"Strawberry fruit is set against some pretty stiff tannins; it seems to have over-reached in color and extract, given the rather lean fruit. Leafy, herbal and a bit off-kilter.",83,Airfield Estates 2006 Merlot (Yakima Valley)
"The Alfrocheiro, normally found in the Dão, is here grown on the sandy soils of Lagoalva de Cima. It gives a ripe, soft and fruity wine, full of red fruits. Tannins are gentle, filling the background with a spicy, dusty character. This wine is only made in the top vintages. Drink from 2017.",91,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2011 Grande Escolha Alfrocheiro (Tejo)
"Ebullient with ripe cherry fruit, this intensely aromatic rosé is geared towards the white Zin drinker who's looking for a step up. While soft and a tad confectionery with a sweet, candied cherry palate, there's a crisp acidity throughout that keeps it from becoming too cloying.",83,Chateau Lafayette Reneau 2009 Pinot Noir Blanc Rosé (Finger Lakes)
"Named after the year the estate was first recorded, this is a rich wood-aged wine. It has spice, stern tannins and layers of black currants and black plums that still need to have their head. The wine is dry as well as firm but will open up and soften to give a sumptuous wine from 2020.",92,Château Grand Boise 2015 Cuvée 1610 Red (Côtes de Provence)
"This is an aromatic, smoky, herbal and ultimately captivating Syrah. Dense, smoky, tarry and herbal, it is a serious effort from a winery that specializes in the grape. The fruit is a juicy mix of wild berries, cassis and black cherry, with substantial tannins that add herbal, green tea flavors. Give it time to smooth out in the glass and notice how the finish runs on and on into a lovely dénouement of Provençal herb, black olive and spice.",91,Doyenne 2005 Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"High on the deliciousness-factor, this shows soft, seemingly sweet flavors of raspberry, cinnamon, smoky butter, sugar cookie and vanilla. It's a little one-dimensional, but that dimension is a nice one. Drink now.",88,Artezin 2010 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"This nonvintage cuvée from Lombard is soft and fruity with a relatively high dosage that gives a rounded character. Red apple and a light touch of spice balance with the full acidity. The bottling tasted here is young, so it would be worth keeping until the end of 2015.",87,Lombard et Cie NV Brut Réference  (Champagne)
"This dry red blend is as sophisticated, structured and balanced as many high-end Cabernets. Made from old-vine Zin, with Syrah, Cabernet and Petite Sirah as well, it has a deep, exotic aroma of dark fruit plus cedar and cardamom. The flavor is richly fruity, the mouthfeel is firmly textured and the finish lingers nicely. It's medium bodied and full-flavored.",91,Bogle 2012 Essential Red (California)
"There's a lot of appeal with notes of apricot, mango, butter and toasty spices. It's creamy in feel with the oak—70% American, half new—speckling the fruit flavors and the finish.",88,Seven Falls 2011 Chardonnay (Wahluke Slope)
"This wine is principally Cabernet Franc along with dollops of Malbec and Petit Verdot. A pretty pale salmon color, it offers very primary aromas of strawberry, green pepper and spice. The palate drinks dry with lovely fruit flavors and acid that brings tension and keeps the interest high.",88,Seven Hills 2015 Dry Rosé (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Gently soft wine, with a creamy character. There are light white and citrus fruit flavors, hints of green herbs and just the right amount of acidity.",84,Wolfberger 2010 Edelzwicker White (Alsace)
"Focused apple, pear, lime and grass notes are punctuated by some refreshing minerality here. The wine's elegant in the mouth, with some earthy tones. If only the lovely fruit flavors on the finish hung around just a bit longer. Try with fresh goat cheese, sooner rather than later.",86,Henschke 2008 Coralinga Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills)
"A beautiful aroma like violets, cedar, light oak smoke and black cherry wafts from this deeply colored wine. It brings ripe fruit flavors and a hint of toasted oak to the palate, filling the mouth with juicy black cherry, cassis and blueberry. Touches of dark chocolate are bolstered by ample layers of fine-grained tannins. This is a full-bodied, lightly sweet and elegantly balanced wine to drink now through 2022.",92,Cuttings 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"What Americans need is a good $8 Zinfandel, and what do you know? That's just what this is. Dry as dust but sweet in fruit, with all kinds of savory spices, this is the perfect everyday wine for barbecue. Production was 8,000 cases, so it shouldn't be too hard to find.",86,Oak Grove 2010 Reserve Zinfandel (California)
"Immediate in its appeal, this young wine is redolent with aromas of blueberry and huckleberry pie. The blue-fruit flavors are saturated and smooth in feel, trailing a touch toward the finish.",89,Barnard Griffin 2014 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Excellent winemaking by Mike Januik, as with all these Novelty Hill wines, keeps the fruit, acid and tannins all in perfect proportion. The flavors mix blackberry and black cherry; and this young wine is still firm and wound tight.",89,Novelty Hill 2006 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"2012 marks only the second vintage for winemaker Nathan Kendall, but this dry, exceptionally stony Riesling suggests a promising start already. Fermented spontaneously with indigenous yeast, it's exquisitely spry but concentrated in lime, blossom and white grapefruit notes.",90,N. Kendall Wines 2012 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"The texture is off, resulting in a rustic feeling, despite lush flavors of raspberries, figs and sweet, toasty oak. Mainly the problems are jarring tannins plus alcoholic heat on the finish.",86,Bernardus 2012 Pisoni Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"This bright, savory sparkler delivers Rainier cherry and orange zest flavors, along with hints of bread crust and pastry cream. Crisp acidity and a foamy mousse lend balance and finesse.",90,Paltrinieri 2015 La Riserva Brut  (Lambrusco di Sorbara)
"Deep, heady aromas of black cherry, gingersnap cookies and black loam show on the nose. Rich and penetrating flavors of blackberry and brown spice are cut with a ripe fruit freshness in this heavy-duty wine with lots of life.",93,HammerSky 2010 Limited Resources Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"One of the best Barolos of the year, Coste di Rose is a natural beauty with gorgeous, thick extraction and perfectly balanced aromas of blueberries, violets, almond paste, sweet spice and root beer. The wine shows impressive heft and density, yet it is elegant and polished at the same time with finely textured tannins. Cellar this delightful wine ten years or more.",95,Marchesi di Barolo 2006 Coste di Rose  (Barolo)
"Another clean, brisk and slightly sweet Chardonnay from Cupcake, at a pretty good price. Its shows orange, peach, vanilla, buttered toast and white sugar flavors.",84,Cupcake 2011 Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"A good, clean, tart and lightly spicy all-stainless style. Cool climate fruit puts the accent on lime and lemon flavors, keeps the alcohol low (13.3%), and makes this a fine match to shellfish, white fish and light pasta dishes.",87,Buried Cane 2009 Whiteline No Oak Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Bright red berry and violet aromas lead off this soft, medium-bodied red. The palate offers dark cherry and a whiff of white pepper alongside round tannins. It's already accessible so enjoy soon. Drink through 2017.",87,Rocca Felice 2011  Barbaresco
"Showing true cool-climate character, this Chard brims with tropical fruit, pear, honeysuckle and smoky oaky-vanilla flavors, with a gentle scour of acids. Pretty good price for a wine this rich.",86,Bennett Family 2006 The Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This is weighty, creamy and medium to full in body. It has plenty of lime and pear flavors, plus slight brown sugar and vanilla notes.",85,Souverain 2010 Chardonnay (North Coast)
"Quite oaky, the barrel flavors not yet integrated into the fruit, this starts out rough, then rolls into clean, light, pleasant boysenberry fruit flavors. Should continue to improve with more time in the bottle.",88,Mercer 2008 McKinley Springs Vineyard Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Quite possibly the first and only Washington Zweigelt, this has the sort of rough, rustic appeal as did Lemberger in the early days of the state's wine industry. Bright cranberry fruit has a spicy edge, and a sharp, high-toned finish.",86,Wilridge 2009 Zweigelt (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Fruit from Martinborough and Hawkes Bay features in this value-priced wine. Despite ample weight and fleshy texture, it manages to finish dry and elegant, with shadings of fig, white grapefruit, fennel and pineapple.",90,Tablelands 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (East Coast)
"A fine value, the 2009 Walla Walla Valley Cabernet is sourced from Spofford Station and Lefore vineyards. Bright and spicy, it spent 28 months in almost-neutral French oak. Cranberry and currant fruit is forward and precise, with the balance to age another 6–8 years.",88,Lujon 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (OR))
"This is a very pure Pinot Noir. It shows its origins in the silky mouthfeel and crisp acidity, as well as a certain minerality that grounds the raspberry, cherry and cola flavors. It's quite good, but not an ager, so drink soon.",88,Freeman 2008 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Each Le Cadeau wine has a different consulting winemaker. Scott Shull (Raptor Ridge) made this generously toasty wine. Bright fruit flavors bring berry and cherry forward, though in this young wine they are not yet completely integrated. Give it some hours of aeration and it pulls together nicely, or cellar it until 2018.",90,Le Cadeau 2013 Diversité Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Perfumed notes of white peach and grapefruit abound on this medium-bodied, off-dry Riesling. It's fresh and fruity, offering juicy green apple and citrus flavors sharpened by edges of lime and lemon. The finish is honeyed and long. Drink now through 2020 to enjoy its vibrant style.",90,Schloss Vollrads 2015 Riesling (Rheingau)
"With residual sugar at 200 g/L, this is much more concentrated than the average wine labeled Late Harvest. With enough acidity to stay focused and avoid any suggestion of syrup, it's an exceptional value. Deep peach and apricot flavors and a hint of caramel linger through a satisfying finish.",89,Airfield Estates 2013 Late Harvest Riesling (Yakima Valley)
"The wine is soft, fruity and only light in texture. So although there are tannins, they are surrounded by superripe fruit. There is a touch of pepper from the alcohol that gives a burning sensation. Drink now.",84,Adega Mayor 2013 Monte Mayor Reserva Red (Alentejano)
"Off dry, fresh and lightly spritzy, this appealing wine brings flavors of lemon tea front and center. The aromatics hint at honeysuckle and orange blossom, and the finish is pleasantly granular, with a sweet, sugary edge.",88,Sweet Cheeks 2015 Riesling (Oregon)
"Herb, plum, spice and black-currant aromas are followed by well-balanced fruit flavors. The tannins bring some dryness, needing time to stretch their legs. Give it a short decant.",89,Amavi 2014 Estate Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Very light and slightly sweet in style, this low-alcohol bottling offers stone fruit, lemon juice and peels, and the slightest hint of petrol on the honeyed nose. Exceedingly bright and crisp on the palate, the peachy sweetness is cut by a nearly bubbly acidity. It would be great for pool parties.",88,Margerum 2014 Riesling (Santa Barbara County)
"A grassy element surrounds searing layers of lime and kiwi, the wine from a prominent Sonoma site known for the variety. Tingling in acidity and yet offering structure and grace, it finishes clean and refreshing.",87,Apsara 2014 Kick Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County)
"Underbrush, leather, black pepper, clove and leather lead the nose on this brawny wine. The spicy palate offers allspice, anisette, concentrated black cherry and juicy raspberry alongside strapping tannins. It's one-dimensional but savory. Enjoy through 2015.",88,Villa Le Prata 2012 Tirso  (Rosso di Montalcino)
"This classically styled Barolo from one of the denomination's most storied houses shows archetypal Nebbiolo scents of dried rose petal, eucalyptus and hints of leather and berry. The palate delivers cassis and truffle notes, with layers of Alpine herbs. While tannic, the wine is surprisingly forward.",93,Brezza 2009 Sarmassa  (Barolo)
"This lightly oxidized Chard is powdery but not entirely fresh, as it shows aromas of pool water and mealy melon. The palate is chunky and just O.K. in feel, while fleshy flavors of melon and peach end briny and mildly bitter.",83,O. Fournier 2012 Urban Uco Chardonnay (Uco Valley)
"Ripe, almost overripe, notes of fleshy stone fruit like yellow plum make for a generous opening. The palate tones this down with freshness and a rich, warm feel. It finishes dry, with a distinct sense of warmth.",87,Frédéric Mallo 2014 Special Delivery Pinot Gris (Alsace)

"From Cantina di Soave's highest line of white wine, Rocca Sveva Soave Classico is a bright and luminous expression with vibrant tones of citrus, pear and dried sage.",87,Cantina di Soave 2009 Rocca Sveva  (Soave Classico)
"Delicate but enticing scents of white spring flower and pear waft out of the glass. On the refreshing palate, vibrant acidity and small continuous beads underscore yellow apple, lemon zest and a hint of white pear.",89,Bortolomiol 2016 Prior  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Incredibly ripe and dried black cherry, strawberry, clove and smoke aromas give this bottling an almost port-like nose. The palate is similar, with prune and raisin touches, with cooked red fruit and baking spice.",87,Palumbo Family Vineyards 2013 50-50 Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon (Temecula Valley)
"As rich, ripe and flashy as any Pinot Noir out there. It floods the mouth with jammy raspberries and cherries, with smoky oak sweetness like pie crust, sprinkled with cinnamon and brown sugar. Drink soon.",88,Jim Ball 2009 Boonville Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
Rocca delle Macìe's bright Morellino is an immediate and direct wine that refreshes the palate and promises easy pairing opportunities with most Italian dishes. Aromas include soft cherry and succulent blueberry.,87,Rocca delle Macìe 2006 Campomaccione  (Morellino di Scansano)
"A soapy textured wine that misses any focus. There are soft red berry fruits, gentle tannins and some juicy acidity. But it is just dull.",84,Château Tour de Cazelle 2011  Côtes de Bourg
"Dry, lively and fresh, this wine has an attractively restrained range of flavors that includes lemon, white pepper and herbs. It's thirst-quenching and clean in texture, with a fruit-driven acidity that reverberates on the finish.",90,Bliss 2015 Estate Bottled Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino)
"A ripe wine from Haure Jany, this is dense with wood and tannins. The black-currant fruit is masked at this stage with a powerful dry core. Let this soften before drinking, so wait until 2019.",87,Château du Seguinier 2014  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux
"This winery is better known for its Marsanne, but this Viognier is an excellent value. It exudes hints of apricot, pineapple, ginger and honey, coming across rich and creamy on the palate. Despite the heft, it finishes long, framed by mouthwatering acidity.",92,Tahbilk 2014 Viognier (Nagambie Lakes)
"The wonderfully peppery nature of Blaufränkisch makes itself felt here: this is appetizing, honest and fresh-faced. On the palate aromatic blueberries join in while freshness and pepper give verve and energy. This is lovely, honest, refreshing and utterly moreish.",90,Esterházy 2014 Classic Blaufränkisch (Burgenland)
"This pure Malbec is generous and ripe. It has concentration and dark berry fruits that come strongly through the tannic structure. As it develops, its texture will become increasingly more velvety, bringing out richness. Wait until 2018.",88,Château du Port 2014 Tertre-Perdigous Malbec-Merlot (Cahors)

"Dark-skinned berry, exotic spice, leather and pressed blue flower are just some of the aromas you'll find in this gorgeous red. The elegant, firmly structured palate doles out juicy Marasca cherry, cassis, licorice and espresso flavors framed by polished tannins. It's extremely well balanced, with bright acidity.",94,Braida di Giacomo Bologna 2014 Bricco della Bigotta  (Barbera d'Asti)
"Nothing is out of place in this wine: It's intense, but it's not too strong, and the bouquet shows a balance of sweet fruit and savory spice aromas.",90,Venturini Massimino 2007  Amarone della Valpolicella
"One hundred percent Cabernet Franc, this wine shows subtle, nuanced aromas of fresh strawberry, cherry and wildflowers. The palate is compact with a tight core of sweet fruit flavors.",88,Henry of Pelham 2012 Icewine Cabernet (Short Hills Bench)
"Firm, pinched aromas of rubbery berry and red fruits feed into a narrow, tomatoey palate with crisp, drawing acidity and tannins. This Carignan-led blend of five grapes is herbal and briny tasting, with tomato, cassis and red-berry flavors. Length, balance and drive push an herbal finish to a good ending.",89,Garcia Schwaderer 2010 Facundo Red (Chile)
"This is an impressively rich and ripe within the light, poised character of classic Muscadet. It balances floral apple and pear fruit with a tight, mineral texture that gives the wine a young character. The extended lees aging has added notes of almonds and spice to this ripe wine. Drink from 2017.",91,Gadais Père et Fils 2015 Vieilles Vignes Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"This blend of Syrah and Petite Sirah is made in a drink-me-now style that emphasizes sheer deliciousness. Soft and almost sweet, it dazzles with pastry-filling cherries and raspberries, with exotic touches of cocoa, anise and cinnamon. Tannins provide a sturdy architecture, but they're ripe and accessible.",89,Shafer 2005 Relentless Red (Napa Valley)
"Once known as Nugent Vineyard, Winside is a blend of Dijon and Pommard clones that's on the more robust side, especially in this climatically perfect vintage. Offering exuberant red cherry fruit and layers of cola and milk chocolate, it's ready to enjoy with pork tenderloin and similarly hearty fare.",90,Stemmler 2012 Winside Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Such a generous and ripe wine, with a dark core of tannins surrounded by opulent fruit. Black fruits, coffee, very concentrated flavors, a powerhouse of structure and richness. The warmth of the wine is palpable, as is the aging potential.",97,Château La Mission Haut-Brion 2009  Pessac-Léognan
"Coming in at 47g/L residual sugar, this is quite ripe and aromatic with notes of peach and flowers but doesn't have the acid to hold it together.",85,Hyatt 2012 Riesling (Rattlesnake Hills)
"Raisin, horse hide and other heavy, earthy, sun-baked aromas create a somewhat ponderous bouquet. In the mouth, this is jammy but still fully alive, tannic and grabby. Flavors of black plum, boysenberry and herbs end with a reprise of firm tannins, overt oak and related woody flavors. Drink from 2017–2030.",94,Dominio de Atauta 2011 Llanos del Almendro  (Ribera del Duero)
"The best Napa Cabs are soft, concentrated and supple. This pretty wine is all that. It combines the power of sun-ripened fruit with a reluctance on the winemaker's part to overwhelm. This dry wine impresses through restraint, not a knock to the head. The right foods will make it sing.",92,Beaucanon 1998 Jacques de Connick Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This wine is light, with touches of honey and dried fruit. Oranges, marmalade and dried sultanas are balanced by the acidity of this already attractive Sauternes. Drink now, but better from 2016.",86,Cheval Quancard 2011 Lafleur Mallet  (Sauternes)
"Warm whiffs of cinnamon and brioche accent aromas of black cherry and plum on this plush, fruit-forward Saperavi. Plummy and soft with black-fruit flavor, it's a straightforward, yet tasty wine. Finishes with a fringe of fine, delicate tannins.",86,Standing Stone 2012 Saperavi (Finger Lakes)
"A little on the sweet side, with lemonade and pineapple juice flavors that are sugared. Crisp acidity fortunately provides a clean finish to this slightly oaked Sauvignon Blanc.",85,Brander 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Byron’s first-ever wine from this justly famous vineyard. This wine flatters the senses from the get-go. The fruit is tremendously ripe, balanced and supple, with enough oak to lend it the requisite smoke and vanilla qualities and glyceriny sweetness. Soft, velvety, smooth and silky are just a few words to describe the mouthfeel.",90,Byron 1997 Sierra Madre Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"Restrained mulberry aromas interweave with scents of turned soil, white pepper and clove on the earthy nose of this bottling. The sip starts with a pleasing softness but quickly grows deeper and more weighty with luxurious tannins, showing hearty red cherry and dried fennel flavors.",92,Lincourt 2014 Lindsay's Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)

"From the Vinho Verde region in northern Portugal, this tightly crisp, bone dry wine is fresh, almost shockingly so. Red currant flavors dominate along with a lively, light texture. Drink now.",85,Obrigado 2014 Nortico Rosé (Minho)
"A dusty, plummy, dark berry pie Petite Sirah from old vines grown in the Santa Clara Valley by the Guglielmo family, who have been based here since 1925. With lots of bittersweet chocolate, white pepper and well-integrated oak, this Petite is subtle, its alcohol relatively low and its tannins quite refined, a Petite for French palates.",90,Guglielmo 2007 Private Reserve Estate Grown Petite Sirah (Santa Clara Valley)
"Sometimes price is not indicative of a wine's overall quality, and this appears to be a case in point. The nose is dry, cheesy and overly oaked, and the palate is downright screeching with acidity, so much so that there's a sour flavor and scour to both the palate and finish. Too much tartaric acid? You bet!",84,Familia Schroeder 2007 Malbec (Argentina)
"Raspberry aromas are simple but friendly. This feels condensed and a bit jammy, without a lot of stand-up structure. Candied, lightly loamy flavors of plum and currant finish modest and short.",85,Burgo Viejo 2012 Tinto  (Rioja)
"Here's a second-label, inexpensive Pinot Noir with genuine character and style. Full flavored, it offers clean and substantial fruit—ripe plum and cherry—along with a dash of sweet spice and mocha.",88,Jezebel 2014 Pinot Noir (Oregon)
"Dainty aromas of wild strawberry, red cherry and peach pit lead the nose of this playful rosé. The palate is light and lively, with flavors of citrus peel and white melon rind that carry through to the mouthwatering finish. Drink now.",87,M. Chapoutier 2014 Bila Haut Rosé (Pays d'Oc)

The sparkling wine boasts a clear, compact style with a touch of crisp acidity on the close.",87,Toffoli 2010 Millesimato Extra Dry Rive di Refrontolo  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Freshly cut green apple with a touch of lemon signals great refreshment on the nose. The palate has a touch more roundness, giving more flesh to the apple fruit. It still plays a brisk, dry Riesling game, characterized by lemon on a dry, slender palate.",90,Weszeli 2016 Ried Loiserberg Riesling (Kamptal)
"Although this seems initially austere, it has some fruit weight. Its tannins are dry and firm but will soften with time, showing potential for long, slow aging. Drink from 2020.",88,Château des Mille Anges 2015  Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux
"Genius Loci is an elegant and linear Sangiovese that opens with oaky notes of exotic spice and vanilla followed by cherry, raspberry and pressed blue flower. It's clean and crisp in the mouth with a long, but not overly dense or rich texture.",89,Burchino 2007 Genius Loci Sangiovese (Toscana)

"Young and fruity, this is a smooth, lightly textured wine. It has just enough acidity to give a fresh edge to the ripe quince and Rocha pear flavors. Drink now.",85,Fitapreta Vinhos 2014 Branco White (Alentejano)
"Firm tannins and great freshness, with a touch of bitter chocolate as well as spice and tight tannins. This second wine of Lafite is attractively fruity, easily lifting the weight of tannins.",92,Château Lafite Rothschild 2008 Carruades de Lafite  (Pauillac)
"Structured and perfumed, this is a great expression of Touriga Nacional. It brings out a mineral character, with a severe edge to go with the dry tannins and black currant flavors. For aging over 4–5 years.",92,Quinta Nova de Nossa Senhora do Carmo 2009 TN Grand Reserva Touriga Nacional (Douro)
"Tea, spice and modest berry aromas make for a reticent nose. This feels jammy and spongey, while medicinal, herbal berry and oak flavors veer towards minty green and resin on the finish.",88,Casas del Toqui 2013 Terroir Selection Gran Reserva Carmenère (Peumo)
Imported by Lion Nathan USA.,86,Philip Shaw 2007 No. 19 Sauvignon Blanc (Orange)
"Aromas of celery, arugula, snap pea, dusty apple and citrus announce a clean palate with scouring acidity. Lemon-lime and grapefruit flavors are typical of Casablanca SB, while a fresh, citrusy finish brings a green-herb element into play.",86,Root:1 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"Rich and concentrated in red cherry, cigar and plum, this demurely approachable and enjoyable wine has the legs to age. Structured and tightly drawn, it holds a tannic overbite that eases in the glass. Cellar through 2017.",91,Joseph Phelps 2012 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"The virtues of this 100% Chardonnay are its elegance, cleanliness, brightness and the sheer pleasure it offers. It's so refined and complex, offering flavors of Meyer lemons, Kaffir limes, brioche and smoky vanilla that change endlessly in the glass. Just fabulous, and a terrifically versatile food wine.",95,Iron Horse 2002 Blanc de Blancs Sparkling (Green Valley)
"This is one of those fun, easygoing Italian Pinot Grigios that tastes great on a hot summer afternoon. The wine is crisp, light and lean with simple endnotes of citrus and melon.",84,Villa Cornaro 2011 Limited Selection Pinot Grigio (Veneto)
"Lovely Sangiovese aromas of pressed blue flower, mint, leather, berry and a balsamic note mingle in the glass. The juicy palate doles out ripe wild cherry, black plum, cinnamon, licorice and mocha alongside firm, velvety tannins. Drink after 2018.",94,Villa I Cipressi 2010 Zebras  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"There are tightly focused aromas of black cherry, cedar, leather and graphite on the nose of this blend of 43% Merlot, 42% Cabernet Franc, 12% Cabernet Sauvignon and 3% Petit Verdot. Fennel and dill show prominently on the sip against a fatter layer of black cherry, with a strong mint character on the finish.",89,Leoness 2013 Meritage (Temecula)
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah, it conveys aromas of red and black currants, black pepper and cedar. The straightforward palate delivers juicy blackberry accented with notes of white pepper, mocha and graphite alongside round tannins. It's ready so enjoy soon.",89,Guado al Tasso 2012 Il Bruciato  (Bolgheri)
The wine opens with a slightly copperish hue and offers flat aromas of dried apricot and banana chips. Its mouthfeel lacks vibrancy and there are sour almond notes on the finish.,84,Varaschin NV  Prosecco Superiore di Cartizze
"Plum, espresso, cedar and underbrush aromas unfold on this straightforward Sangiovese and 3% Cabernet Sauvignon blend. The ripe, warm palate doles out juicy black cherry, blackberry, vanilla, white pepper and a licorice note alongside firm, fine-grained tannins.",89,Bindi Sergardi 2012 La Ghirlanda  (Chianti Classico)
"This is old reliable as far as Washington Pinot Gris is concerned. Mouth-filling flavors of tart apple, citrus and pineapple are set in juicy acids. The addition of small amounts of Sauvignon Blanc and Gewürztraminer heighten the aromatics.",87,Hogue 2012 Pinot Grigio (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Hiding behind Griñon's impressive 2004s is this ultrapremium blend of Cabernet, Petit Verdot and Syrah. Emeritus is sweet and ripe with pipe tobacco, cassis, spice cake and chocolate aromas. It's immense and inviting, with grabby, plump blackberry fruit along with cinnamon, mocha and cola notes. Creamy, rich and almost unctuous. Drink over the next five years. 200 cases made.",92,Marques de Griñon 2003 Emeritus Red (Dominio de Valdepusa)
"Commanding nose, with cherry, purple basil, mineral and meaty elements. Fine depth of fruit, with sweet-tart and earthy notes, and a brisk mouthfeel. The tangy finish with its tart cherry, mineral and earth complexity holds you a long time. Serious, and fulfills Domaine Drouhin Oregon's promise to make great Pinot Noir on a par with Burgundy.",91,Domaine Drouhin 1998 Pinot Noir (Oregon)
"This shows the sunny opulence of the vintage, brimming with tropical- and stone-fruit notes. Guava and nectarine flavors meet ample weight on the palate, balanced by a slightly chalky finish.",88,Whitehaven 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"A very good Merlot, representing a huge increase in quality over the 2008, and a return to the charms of the 2007. It's ripe and tasty in fruit, currants and sweet oak, and earns extra points for the fine structure. Ready now.",87,Materra Cunat Family Vineyards 2009 Merlot (Oak Knoll District)
"Smooth and supple, almost silky, this dense and delightful Syrah begins with a smoky, meaty run of sweet cherry and berry flavors, then quickly adds interesting nuances of herb and leaf and earth. The cherry fruit triumphs, along with cut tobacco and a whiff of clove, as it weaves through a long finish.",91,Olsen Estates 2008 Heritage Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"Berry and black-plum aromas come with a hint of green. This feels full, solid and grabby, while herbal plum and berry flavors more or less follow the nose. On the finish, this southerly Malbec tastes of carob, mint and berry fruits.",87,Agustinos 2016 Reserva Malbec (Bío Bío Valley)
"Reserved on the nose, with tight citrus blossom and a wet stone minerality, this blend of Roussanne and Viognier by the Paso-residing French couple Guillaume and Solène Fabre will drink fresh for years to come. The palate is framed by pithy tension, with flavors of apple skin, pear flesh and a tingle of acidity deep into the finish. Drink 2017–2030.",90,Clos Solène 2014 Hommage Blanc White (Paso Robles)
"The nose is neutral except for dusty aromas and a hint of applesauce. This feels bold, thick and a bit clumsy, with pithy citrus, nectarine and apricot flavors. These notes continue through the wine's finish. Drink now.",83,Acordeón 2012 Chardonnay (Tupungato)
"Soft and somewhat sweet, this rustic Petite Sirah has candied flavors of raspberries, mocha, bacon and black pepper. An easy sipper to enjoy now.",85,Trentadue 2008 Alexander Valley Estate Petite Sirah (Sonoma County)
"In this wine, the initial extracted flavors have softened quickly to give an open, drinkable, fruity character. Blackberry fruits and acidity go with light tannins. It will be ready soon. Drink from 2018.",89,Château Grand-Puy Ducasse 2013  Pauillac
"Not a success. The wine is thick, heavy and lifeless, with syrupy cherry and cassis flavors that have way too little acidity to perk them up.",83,Koehler 2005 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot make up three-quarters of this blend, with the balance Petit Verdot and Syrah. The aromas of herb, barrel spice, fig, dried fruit and vanilla are reserved while the red- and black-fruit flavors are rich but deft, with the tannins providing some heft. It seems a bit more evolved than its age might suggest.",87,Dumas Station 2013 Cow Catcher Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This wine is very fresh and crisp, with plenty of fresh herb aromas and vibrant grapefruit flavors. Light bodied and well balanced, it has good acidity and a snappy finish.",87,Dancing Bull 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (California)
"A rooty-smelling nose suggests sarsparilla soda, with accents of oak, malt and baked blackberry. There's just enough energy to the ripe palate, which tastes of earthy, savory blackberry, baking spices and cola nut. A smooth, ready finish revolves around surprisingly soft tannins. Drink this easy rider through 2022.",93,Dominio de Atauta 2010 Llanos del Almendro  (Ribera del Duero)
"Herbaceous, lemony tones reverberate from start to finish on this elegant off-dry Riesling, accenting sweet, juicy peach and tangerine flavors. Hints of smoke and tea leaf add some complexity, along with a lime-pith astringency on the finish.",90,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch) 2011 Riesling (Mosel)
"This bold, broad-shouldered wine shows focused truffle, gravel and cassis flavors. Densely layered, it's 100% varietal, 100% barrel-fermented and further aged in new French oak. With its firm structure, it shows plenty of ability to age and will be best from 2022 through 2023.",98,Alpha Omega 2012 Beckstoffer Las Piedras Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
"After starting out a touch reduced, this wine opens to reveal aromas of wet rock, high-toned white flowers, lime and green apple. The palate is broad and dry, with generous citrus flavors that linger.",91,Sparkman 2015 Birdie Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Intensely aromatic, intensely fruity, this Riesling packs a powerful punch of flavor within a delicate frame. The fruit profile is tropical with concentrated guava and mango flavors spiced with hints of white pepper. It's semi-sweet in style, but bracing acidity leaves the finish quite dry.",88,Weingut Georg Albrecht Schneider 2011 Niersteiner Hipping Spätlese Riesling (Rheinhessen)
"This Merlot isn't as big or tannic as VM's 2014 Reserve, but it's close in quality. Cedary oak frames Bing cherry fruit on the nose, while the palate delivers a rich, creamy texture and additional complexity in the form of vanilla, licorice and raspberry. The long, velvety finish folds in hints of dark chocolate and espresso. Drink now–2025.",92,Villa Maria 2013 Single Vineyard Braided Gravels Merlot (Hawke's Bay)
"Savory dried thyme notes accent sunnier flavors of preserved peach in this brisk, off-dry wine. It's fruity and fresh, with an elegant, sprightly footprint.",87,Heinz Eifel 2013 Shine Gewürztraminer (Rheinhessen)
"Here's an easy, no-fuss white wine from central Italy (made with native Passerina grapes) that offers subtle aromas of peach and citrus over a bright, zesty mouthfeel. Pair this wine with fried vegetable tempura.",84,Capestrano 2009 Passerina (Marche)
"One of the best Nebbiolos to ever come from California. The aroma dazzles with notes of tar, licorice, roasted meat, cherries, pepper and cedar. The wine is absolutely dry, with brilliant acidity, and seems to change with each moment in the glass. Just starting to dry out, but still fresh and lively. A remarkable wine at an amazingly affordable price for what you get.",94,Clendenen 2003 Brico Buon Natale Nebbiolo (Santa Maria Valley)
"This opens with aromas of toast, oak, grilled herb and a hint of iris. The palate offers coffee, marinated cherry, licorice and a saline note alongside close-grained tannins that leave an astringent finish.",88,Stroppiana 2012 San Giacomo  (Barolo)
"Intensely ripe, almost pulpy black fruit lends a soft, easy feel to this richly textured Cabernet Franc. It's a tad clunky on the palate, but bright acidity and savory herbaceousness add elegance to the finish.",86,T'Jara 2010 Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island)
"Wayward, funky aromas of wet dog and candied fruits don't provide much elegance to the bouquet. This also feels somewhat bland and dilute, which is unusual for Argentina. Herbal, minty flavors of cherry and plum finish peppery, green and raw in feel.",83,Finca Flichman 2012 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Sourced from the Omaka Valley, this Pinot Noir is fermented and aged in 1000-liter casks, hence the Big Barrel moniker. It's medium bodied and silky in texture, with only minimal oak-derived flavor. Instead it offers crisp red fruits like cherries and pomegranates, plus subtle hints of tomato leaf and smoked meat. Drink now–2021.",91,Bird 2013 Big Barrel Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
"Sulfur and match stick are the early aromas on this standard Chardonnay. After that blows off, apple and peach scents are pitted against overt oak. The palate feels good, while flavors of pineapple, mango, apple and cinnamon are oaky and not elevated.",85,François Lurton 2012 Piedra Negra Reserve Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"A bright, beautifully brisk Sauvignon Blanc, marked with crisp acidity and racy flavors of citrus fruits and gooseberries, accented with sweet oak. It's a creamy, deliciously complex wine, and although it's fully dry, it finishes with a honeyed richness.",92,Chalk Hill 2008 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Chalk Hill)
"Sartori is one of Valpolicella's most important wineries thanks to its focused dedication to local winemaking traditions. This is not as thick or sweet as others. In fact, it shows an elegant, understated quality, with bright cherry and spice overtones.",88,Sartori 2008  Amarone della Valpolicella
"Holds back just a bit initially, but then evolves slowly and steadily. Delivers a very firm, polished and linear feel in the mouth. Dusty aromas of crushed stone and crushed white pepper are backed by cola, cassis and red currant. An elegant and sophisticated Brunello.",93,Camigliano 2006 Gualto Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Mild, powdery and innocuous on the nose, this boxed wine is dilute and citrusy in the mouth, with tart orange and lime flavors.",80,Black Box 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley)
"This tight, young Syrah has a succinct core of blueberry and raspberry flavors, which are wrapped in a mix of herb, earth and green tea. The tannins are just slightly bitter, but all in balance, and that bitterness is not at all unpleasant.",90,Novelty Hill 2009 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This opens with subdued aromas that recall yellow flower, toasted nut and a whiff of citrus. The rather lean but quenching palate offers lemon zest, white almond and a hint of mineral alongside zesty acidity.",87,Marchetti 2014 Tenuta del Cavaliere  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore)
"Mango aromas bring out the tropical character of this superripe wine. It is soft and creamy, maybe too much so, since it lacks a crisper edge. It is ready to drink.",85,Georges Duboeuf 2015 Domaine de la Batie  (Saint-Véran)
"A generic, regional South-Central Coast Pinot showing berry, cola, herb and sautéed mushroom flavors encased in soft, silky tannins and crisp acids. Has little complexity and best consumed now.",85,Bernardus 2000 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
"Dramatically ripe, this delicately framed spätlese is a showcase of pristine, sunny peach and Meyer lemon flavors accented by caramel and crystallized honey. It's nuanced as well, darting with acidity and touches of sea salt and slate that persist.",93,Markus Molitor 2012 Ürziger Würzgarten Spätlese Riesling (Mosel)
"Funky aromas that recall game and farmyard carry over to the palate along with sweet vanilla and toast. Warm and forward, it ends on an overripe, overly sweet note.",84,La Togata 2012  Rosso di Montalcino
"Made from Malbec, this lightly structured wine tastes rich while also fruity. Caramel flavors go over the red berry fruits and give a rounded, still fresh aftertaste.",84,Château Famaey 2013 Chevalier Famaey Rosé (Côtes du Lot)
"A deep rose color, this pretty wine seduces with sweet cherry and red plum fruit, rounded out with a dollop of cinnamon spice and buoyed with moderate acidity. Full, forward, flavorful and built for medium-term aging, this should be enjoyed now through 2020.",92,Lachini 2012 Lachini Family Estate Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"Yeasty, fresh-baked bread aromas, followed by an impressively fresh wine full of white fruits; white currants and pink grapefruit follow on the palate. It's well rounded with a soft aftertaste and well-balanced acidity, but there's no sign of maturity yet.",91,Nicolas Feuillatte 1997 Palmes d'Or  (Champagne)
"For the suggested price of $12, this delivers plenty of richness and flavor. Plum and briary blackberry aromas lead the way, followed by a medium- to full-bodied, slightly creamy palate that offers dark fruit tinged with a hint of brown sugar. Drink now–2017.",89,Tortoise Creek 2011 Le Charmel Syrah-Grenache (Costières de Nîmes)
"This wine is frankly old and downsliding, with aromas of pumpkin and corn flakes. A gold color and mildly oxidized apple-like flavors are tired.",81,Inacayal 2015 Pinot Grigio (Mendoza)
"Fragrant in floral jasmine and tropical aromas, this light, lean Sauvignon Blanc stays fresh in the glass.",86,Worthy 2011 Five Clones Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"This heavy, baked Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon blend carries all the fingerprints of winemaker Michel Rolland, a partner from the start in this high-end Salta project. Aromas of raisin and leather are rustic and rich. Flavors of mocha, molasses, cassis and chocolate finish with a syrupy feel. Drink sooner rather than later.",91,San Pedro de Yacochuya 2009 Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon (Cafayate)
"A blend of 85% Cabernet Franc and 15% Merlot, this descriptively named wine has a nose of raspberry, bell pepper and leather. Flavors of black cherry, raspberry, eucalyptus, anisette and clove coalesce on the palate among chewy tannins. The refined finish is enlivened by a burst of crystalline acidity.",91,Tulip Winery 2010 Mostly Cabernet Franc (Judean Hills)
"The mild but slightly tired aromas of apple, honey and haystack announce a soft palate with apple, nectarine and tropical flavors. A yeasty, somewhat hollow finish indicates this is starting to break down. Drink this 80% Chardonnay and 20% Viognier blend immediately.",84,Viñedos Marchigüe 2015 City Wine Reserva Chardonnay-Viognier (Colchagua Valley)
"Duhart-Milon continues to get better and more sophisticated. This 2011 vintage shows that trend well with its elegant spice, black currant fruits and firm tannins. The fruitiness is well focused, with typical Cabernet acidity bringing out the fresher side of the wine. Drink from 2017.",92,Château Duhart-Milon 2011  Pauillac
"Tart lime and lemon notes brighten fresh apple and pear flavors in this light-bodied dry-style Riesling. It's a refreshingly nimble, spry wine, but hints of smoke and mineral lend complexity. Drink now–2016.",87,Glenora 2014 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Lavender and lilac are just part of the floral bouquet that emerges from this wine, which also shows a blackberry vinaigrette element on the nose. Once sipped, it's like sucking on a purple-flower candy, with more lavender as well as plum and a pencil-lead edge that cuts through the palate.",87,Sarah's Vineyard 2011 Old Vine Zinfandel (Santa Clara Valley)
"This smells like a melted Luden's cough drop sprinkled with coffee grounds and spices. Medium bodied, it has a jumbled herbal flavor, finishing with warmth and notes of dark chocolate and coffee.",83,Vivác Winery 2009 Tempranillo (New Mexico)
"Marked by rich acids and tannins, this is a youthful Pinot that needs brief time in the cellar, or decanting, to let it soften and mellow. The tightness doesn't prevent the massive cherry, black raspberry, vanilla, cola and Asian spice flavors from shining through. Give this high quality wine until the summer of 2009.",93,Dutton-Goldfield 2006 McDougall Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This blend is 82% Cabernet Franc, 6% Syrah, 6% Merlot and 6% Cabernet Sauvignon. The emphasis on the Franc puts more herbal flavors in the center, with coffee grounds, black pepper and baking chocolate wrapped around the spicy and tart berry fruit. The match of acid and barrel flavored tannins is picture perfect.",92,Fielding Hills 2006 RiverBend Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope)
"Old vines from a 10-acre vineyard are the backbone of this wine. Ripe and concentrated, it offers aromas and flavors of mint from the wood aging along with a dominant Cabernet black currant and berry fruitiness. This is going to develop well, so drink from 2018.",88,Château Peyredon Lagravette 2012  Haut-Médoc
"Sharp and tangy, this assertive wine shows a well-integrated mix of berry, cherry, sassafras and herb. Lightly dusted with fresh earth, it does a gentle fade through the finish.",89,Kelley Fox 2010 Mirabai Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"A grapey wine, thin and watery, with just a hint of raspberry soda pop and coffee grounds.",82,Reustle 2009 Grenache (Umpqua Valley)
"Dense and concentrated, with a mint flavor from the new wood, this is a wine that combines rich plum and blackberry flavors with firm tannins and juicy acids. Because it is so rich, it is likely to be ready to be drink in the next 2–3 years.",90,Georges Vigouroux 2009 Château de Haute-Serre Malbec (Cahors)
"It's toasty from 17 months in French oak, but the wood is well balanced by cassis and the nose picks up some lovely hints of anise with air. Straightforward black-currant and vanilla flavors flow smoothly across the tongue. Soft tannins and low acidity make this a Cab that's meant to be enjoyed now. Editors' Choice.",90,Sandalford 1999 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Barker & Margaret River)
"All the parts are here, but they're not yet in complete harmony. The black-currant flavor is strong and deep; the tannins are thick and dramatic; and the acidity is fresh and stimulating. Oak is evident, with notes of buttered cinnamon toast, and the finish is long and spicy. All indications are of a wine that needs serious time in the cellar. Give it until at least 2015.",93,Kelleher 2007 Brix Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"Whole-cluster pressed and barrel fermented, this is a deep gold, and opens powerfully with scents of buttered fruit and nuts. It's rich and creamy, showing toast and other barrel tones ahead of any specific fruit. Drink now through 2018.",89,Sokol Blosser 2014 Chardonnay (Dundee Hills)
"EQ is a consistent leader among Chilean Pinots. This vintage shows high-toned, edgy aromas of currant and spice. It's quite full in body, with a resiny, creamy oak note that should settle in the near future. Woody, ripe-berry flavors finish round, with a mild sense of chocolaty richness. Drink through 2018.",91,Matetic 2013 EQ Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)
"For being a goldkap, this is not especially lush or botrytized. Instead, it features a fine balance of acidity, which enlivens the green apple and citrus flavors and gives them extra poignancy. This is crisply balanced and mouthwatering on the finish.",90,Dr. Wagner 2006 Saarburger Rausch Auslese Goldkap Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer)
"This wine, solid and dense, is full of firm tannins as well as red cherry fruits. It's also fruity, with a great juicy character that permeates right through the wine. For drinking now, but better kept for 2–3 years.",89,Georges Duboeuf 2011 Domaine de Lavernée  (Chiroubles)
"Lively cherry and berry aromas come with a touch of prickle and snap. The palate has a wiry, energetic feel, and the flavors of berry and cherry satisfy and come with aftertastes of molasses and baked sweetness.",87,Lelia 2011 Garnacha (Cariñena)
"A Syrah-based Rhône blend, this wine is soft, sweet and simple. It has powerfully ripe raspberry, cherry, Dr. Pepper cola and spice flavors, and is hot in high alcohol.",85,Hearst Ranch 2008 Three Sisters Cuvée Red (Paso Robles)
"Hazy layers of smoke and struck flint permeate amidst pristine gooseberry and white grapefruit in this late release bottling, lending an early glimpse into its development. It's a complex dry Riesling mingling elements of earth, fruit and flower into a silken tonic catapulted by jolts of zest and acidity. Lithe and lean, it finishes with a long, mineral repose. Alluring already but should drink well through 2030 at least.",93,Dr. Loosen 2012 Wehlener Sonnenuhr GG Réserve Alte Reben Erste Lage Dry Riesling (Mosel)
"Here's a lightly oak-aged Recioto di Soave that opens with an intensely golden color and beautiful aromas of raw honey, roasted almond and chestnut, backed by candied fruit and apricot.",92,Sandro de Bruno 2007 Monte Calvarina  (Recioto di Soave)
"This Cabernet Franc is superripe and oaky, with earthy, stewed and woody aromas. In the mouth, this feels grippy, resiny and dense. As it airs out, vanilla, woodspice, prune and cassis aromas come to the fore. The chocolate-tinged finish is slightly sticky in feel, exuding a strong sense of ripeness.",90,Durigutti 2013 Reserva Cabernet Franc (Mendoza)
"Deep gold in color, this wood-aged wine made from Moscatel Galego grapes is unctuously rich and concentrated. The 40 years in wood have given it depth and density, balancing spicy flavors with hints of honey and apricot. An orange peel note finishes the beautiful combination. Drink now.",94,Secret Spot Wines NV 40 Years  (Moscatel do Douro)
"This cool-climate, northern Italian expression of Pinot Nero opens with nice aromas of blue flower, small berry and white chocolate. The wine is compact and short in the mouth with a fresh, crisp close.",88,Josef Weger 2004 Maso delle Rose Pinot Nero (Alto Adige)
"From a replanted block of the vineyard, this wine is zesty, savory and high in acidity. With a backbone of stony texture and a deep core of licorice and strawberry flavors, it's bold in tannins and intensity, yet finishes bright.",90,Iron Horse 2014 North Block Pinot Noir (Green Valley)
"Ripe, premium fruit and fairly high alcohol levels define this wine. A hot year and ripe fruit combine to create complexity in the nose, with an interesting mix of spices (cardamom, clove), lots of tannin, some darker fruit, and hints of smoke and earth. The only down side: it lacks weight and it finishes very tannic.",88,Girardet 1999 Reserve Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley)
"Shows the herbal quality that often marks this winery's Napa Chardonnay, with a tobacco and sage edge to the citrus fruit and Asian pear flavors. The structure is balanced with brisk acidity and even some oaky wood tannins.",88,Grgich Hills 2010 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"This is a warm and round wine from Irancy, southwest of Chablis. Red fruits are sustained by some wood aging that smoothes out the stalky texture and spice. It's a wine that could age another couple of years to soften it further.",87,Simonnet-Febvre 2012  Irancy
"This garnet-colored wine conveys aromas of cranberry, black cherry and bramble. Flavors of dark cherry, cranberry and black plum have a strong acidic backbone and a long finish.",88,Miloš 2009 Plavac Mali (Peljesac)
"Mas des Bressades is one of the standard-bearers of Costières de Nîmes, and this rosé is a perennial favorite. Red berries and cherries lead the way, wrapped around a core of citrus acidity. It's light to medium in body, with a pleasantly silky feel to the finish.",87,Mas des Bressades 2013 Cuvée Tradition Rosé (Costières de Nîmes)
"Styled after the great white wines of Bordeaux, this is fresh and clean, with luscious mixed fruit flavors that emphasize apple and melon. A cooler vintage has produced a wine of low alcohol and real finesse, with a light dusting of toasty oak. Given its impeccable balance, it could be cellared for another 6–8 years.",92,DeLille 2011 Chaleur Estate Blanc Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A powerful, classic Chambertin, intensely structured and tannic. The sweet black fruit is potentially enormous, still finding its place among the tannins. Spice, with a mineral streak, gives the wine added complexity. Very dense in texture, this will age 10 years and many more.",95,Domaine Jacques Prieur 2009 Chambertin  (Chambertin)
"The Rutherford grapes that go into this wine travel down to Santa Barbara post-harvest, a journey that doesn't diminish the wine's sense of place. It represents its dusty provenance well amid a taste of sanguine tannins, soy sauce and ripe plum.",86,Conway 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)

"Medium bodied, this wine has layers of dark red fruits, plus touches of earth and tobacco, especially on the finish.",86,Fenestra 2008 Ghielmetti Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Livermore Valley)
"Aromas of blackberry, fennel bulb and smoke set the scene for flavors of cherry, raspberry, chocolate and tobacco leaf. Mellow but ever-apparent tannins ply the palate alongside a strong bolt of acidity that tapers off into a pomegranate-imbued finish.",90,Or Haganuz 2014 French Blend Red (Galilee)
"From grapes grown in the cool Oak Knoll District, this wine was given time in neutral oak for less than a year, providing a soft lushness on the palate. Tropical and just slightly grassy, it offers a long finish marked with sizzling acidity.",90,Malk 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Sharp in acids, with a knife-like cutting quality that slices right through and across the wine's natural cherry flavors. The tannins are bigtime, too. Doesn't seem at all likely to improve in the bottle.",83,Zucca 2006 Barbera (Sierra Foothills)
"This is a bold and ripe wine from the gravel soil of Lalande de Pomerol. It is now reaching maturity. It has rich blackberry fruits, layered with acidity.

"Dark and chunky, but also salinic and clammy smelling, with black fruit aromas sitting in front of a palate of salinic, woody, baked fruit flavors. The tannic finish is hard and edgy, and there's some heat too. Has its high and low points.",84,Bodegas Murtia 2007 Dos Monastrell (Jumilla)
This wine is all about power and hedonism. Brooding dark fruit aromas meld with black licorice and lead to a seamless full-bodied blackberry and black-cherry flavors. It demands another sip.,94,K Vintners 2013 Cattle King Upland Vineyard Syrah (Snipes Mountain)
This Cuvée Royale delivers candy-like notes of sweet honeysuckle and butterscotch. It is a luminous and fresh wine with a clean and simple mouthfeel backed a touch of tangy spice that is driven by the wine's tonic effervescence.,86,Marchesi Antinori NV Cuvée Royale Nature Brut Sparkling (Italy)

"Dark loam and a slate-driven minerality restrain the concentrated black raspberry and black currant ripeness on the nose of this elegant wine, made by a Sonoma-based group co-founded in 1972 by a descendant of tractor-maker John Deere. Lots of eucalyptus and purple sage shrubbery on the palate spices up the soft, luscious blackberry and olallieberry fruit core.",92,Landmark 2013 Escolle Road Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Aromas of dark-skinned berry, exotic spice and wildflower lead the nose on this concentrated but refined wine. The intense palate offers layers of ripe black cherry, juicy raspberry, licorice, clove and tobacco alongside firm, velvety tannins. It's a compelling expression of Chianti Rùfina. Drink 2016–2021.",92,Marchesi de' Frescobaldi 2011 Nipozzano Vecchie Viti Riserva  (Chianti Rufina)
"A superb wine from a great year, this is powerful and structured, with great acidity and solid, pronounced fruits. La Romanée is a small vineyard, wholly owned by Liger-Belair, next to Romanée-Conti. The wine is rich, spicy and very complex, with black fruits welling up from its depth. With great structure, it brings together opulent Pinot Noir fruits with firm, dense tannins with immense aging potential.",96,Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair 2010  La Romanée
"From organic grapes in a blend of Grenache, Cinsault, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine is rich and ripe.

The fruit lasts right through to the end.",91,Domaine de Valdition 2014 Vallon des Anges Rosé (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence)
"Jean Laurent is based in the southern Aube region with its ripe Pinot Noir, as in this blanc de noirs. It is full of lavish apple and spice flavors along with an orange-zest tang. Acidity comes cleanly through the richness to produce an impressive, balanced and full-bodied wine.",90,Jean Laurent NV Blanc de Noirs Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne)
"A beautiful Pinot to drink now, this is elegant and supple, with crisp acidity and a delightfully light texture. However, there's nothing light about the flavors, which suggest wild forest berry, softened cola, mushroom, dried pine and spice, enhanced with a subtle jacket of sandalwood.",92,Freeman 2010 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)

This herbal wine offers green fruits as well as red berries. Plenty of fresh acidity brightens the mineral texture along with a crisp aftertaste. Perhaps less of the freshness would have been an advantage.,84,Les Vignobles Gueissard 2014 Les Papilles Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This is a soft, ripely fruited Sauvignon Blanc, embued with hints of passion fruit and lime. It's plump and medium bodied, round on the palate, then tart and lingering on the finish. Drink now.",87,Smythe & Renfield 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Broad aromas of seared lemons, white peach and nectarine are given nuance with a bit of quinine on this entry-level bottling. Stewed lemons and apple-custard flavors show on the plush and pillowy palate, cut with an acidic sizzle.",88,Testarossa 2013 Cuvee Los Gatos Chardonnay (Monterey County)

"An opulent feeling Riesling, full of peach and pineapple flavors. It's ripe, full in the mouth and textured, its richness masking the dryness of the fruit and the acidity. It could age a few more years—give it 2–4.",93,Joseph Fritsch 2010 Schlossberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"This simple red opens with prune and baking spice scents that follow through to the round, accessible palate, along with blackberry jam and cut grass notes. Drink soon.",86,Nativ 2015 Aglianico (Irpinia)
"This Cab has all of the classic notes one would expect: rich dark berry fruit, black plum skin, cigar tobacco and black currant leaf are all front and center. The tannins are surprisingly firm and tightly structured, but the nuances of milk chocolate sauce and graham cracker crumb add decadence to the finish.",87,Fleur Du Cap 2009 Bergkelder Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Western Cape)

"A red Meritage blend of 51% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc, 5% Petit Verdot and 4% Malbec, the name honors Dry Creek Vineyard's love of seafaring.

Juicy, brambly berry come to the fore on the finish, which is still grippy on the palate.",88,Dry Creek Vineyard 2011 The Mariner Meritage (Dry Creek Valley)
"This seems to be hurrying along its aging curve, showing a burnished gold color. It's smoky and intense, with citrusy fruit that's more like grapefruit than anything else, plus plenty of weight and bright acidity. Drink up.",87,Man O' War 2009 Valhalla Chardonnay (Waiheke Island)
"Initial hints of dust and dried earth on the nose dissipate with aeration to reveal prettier notes of fresh grapefruit and lemon. The dry, full-bodied palate is brisk with citrus flavors that linger on the finish.",87,Heron Hill 2016 Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Finger Lakes)
"Produced from old bush vines, this is densely rich wine, with great structure and layers of full-bodied black fruit tones. It has a fruit and acid balance supported by concentrated tannins. It does need to age, so drink from 2017.",90,Casa Cadaval 2011 Vinhas Velhas Trincadeira (Tejo)
"This is a dreamy creamy white founded in stony mineral and juicy acidity that shows a mix of baked apple, pineapple and melon. A tease of green olive provides a briny, salty edge to its tense balance. A lingering hint of vanilla oak figures prominently on the lengthy floral finish.",93,Chateau Montelena 2014 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"At first, all you sense is a heavy, operatic costume of chocolaty, smoky, coffee-like oak flavors. Underneath these, a ripe and slightly sweet boysenberry soul keeps the drama going. Like a sturdy stage set, the richly laced tannins support the fruit and oak until the curtain falls.",90,Zinhead 2011 Zinfandel (Lodi)
"This deeply colored wine opens with aromas of black-skinned berry, cedar and vanilla. On the dense palate, notes of toast and tobacco underscore mature black plum. Assertive tannins leave a mouthcoating finish. Drink through 2020.",88,Drei Donà 2013 Pruno Riserva Sangiovese (Romagna)

"Tastes candy sweet and hot, with Lifesaver cherry and black raspberry flavors. Drink now.",84,Hunt Cellars 2004 Unforgettable Merlot (Paso Robles)
"This barrel-fermented wine reflects the modest ripeness that marked the 2010 vintage. Scents of almond paste, orange peel, citrus, melon and pear intertwine, and the wine's flavors carry light suggestions of them all, along with a touch of caramel. It's drinking well right now, so why wait?",88,Stoller 2010 Reserve Chardonnay (Dundee Hills)
"The winery's larger production offering, this is made from a handful of vineyards, including many used in vineyard-designates. Blending prowess shows in this wine that explodes in plum and clove. Tight, bright acid buoys flavors of strawberry, cranberry and orange, with a twisted funk of earth on the finish.",91,MacRostie 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)

"Aromas convey cedar, savory herb, earth, black licorice and cherry. The dark flavors are reserved in style but still display richness, supported by fine-grained tannins.",91,Chateau Rollat 2011 Edouard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This is Barton & Guestier's home vineyard and, in 2006, it has produced a finely crafted wine. The balance is all there, with ripe red berry fruits and cranberry juice adding to the firm, dark core of tannins. It is worth aging  for two to three years but is certainly drinkable now.",89,Château Magnol 2006  Haut-Médoc
"A very fine edition of River's Red, this returns Merlot to the first chair (55%) position, with Syrah and Cab Franc splitting the rest.

Cassis, earth, hints of dried mushroom and those stiff but powerful tannins combine to make this a standout at the price.",89,Three Rivers 2011 River's Red (Columbia Valley (WA))

Drink from 2018.",91,Château Phélan-Ségur 2012 La Croix Bonis  (Saint-Estèphe)
"Firestone continues to produce good, affordable Rieslings, and this 2010 is one of their best yet.

Fully dry, it has remarkably deep, tannin-inspired flavors of cherry pie, currants, mocha, licorice, peppercorn and smoky new oak. Just addictive, and should hold well for six years.",94,Laetitia 2006 Les Galets Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"The largest of the four grands crus in Morey-Saint-Denis, this vineyard gives the most structured wines. This bottling, with its tannins and power, is no exception.

"This opens with juicy pomegranate and cherry notes before bourbon barrel scents take hold. The midpalate seems to fade, then the flavors return on the finish. Give it another year or two in bottle to pull itself together.",89,Walnut City WineWorks 2014 Carlton Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir

"Inviting aromas of baked blueberries are leveled by crushed asphalt and dried herbs on the refined nose of this bottling. Stewed strawberry and red plum flavors are elegantly cut by more crushed stone, dried spearmint and a touch of sweet tobacco, all held together by grippy tannins.",90,Graveyard 2014 Mortal Zin Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"90-92 Barrel sample. Dense, smoky tannins over ripe fruit with layers of powerful structure. It is extracted but also well-made.",91,Clos Magdelaine 2009 Barrel sample  (Margaux)
"Modern, polished fruit and new wood flavors blend well in this wine. The fruit is clean, ripe, bright with sweetness and flavors of black cherries. The wine is generous, full and opulent, with softer tannins than many Brunellos. Despite this nod in the direction of an international style, the wine still has the classic Brunello power and potential for aging.",92,Tenimenti Angelini 1997 Val di Suga  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Black-pepper-crusted beef, crushed graphite, dried mint, elderberries and blueberries show on the nose of this bottling. The palate reflects a juicy, fruit-forward style, with ripe mulberries and red plums lifted by star anise, clove and cinnamon.",87,Pull 2012 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Off the bat, this contemporary Cava displays welcome fresh-fruit qualities. Raspberry aromas precede a citrusy, bouncy palate. Flavors of orange, plum and jellied candies finish with an interesting sweet-lime note.",88,Pere Ventura NV Tresor Brut Rosé Sparkling (Cava)
"Dark, tart and showing plenty of tang and tenacity, this is a fresh-tasting mix of blueberries and tart acids. Half new and half used French oak is still integrating, but the overall structure and balance are excellent.",89,Stevens 2011 StevensTimley Malbec (Yakima Valley)
"This wine has a touch of perceptible sweetness on its tropical nose, yet tastes dry, showing a straightforward approach to this crisp, coastal-grown variety. Apricot, melon and guava wrap around a lightness of body and texture.",88,Folie à Deux 2015 Pinot Gris (Sonoma Coast)
"This amber, thickly extracted Vin Santo from Chianti Classico opens with intense aromas of butterscotch, marron glacé, honey-roasted almond and brown sugar. It's beautiful and intense down to the succulent core and offers fleshy layers of syrupy sugar.",93,Villa Calcinaia 2003 Conti Capponi  (Vin Santo del Chianti Classico)
"A bit green, with thin flavors of citrus and herbs. Although it's dry and crisp, this Roussanne lacks richness.",83,Lionheart 2007 McGinley Vineyard Roussanne (Santa Barbara)
"This attractive blend of Grenache and Cinsault is fruity with lively acidity and a crisp, tangy texture. Raspberry and orange zest hang happily together. Drink now.",86,Domaine Grand St Paul 2015 Rosé (Mediterranée)
Pecorino is a very trendy indigenous Italian grape that fully deserves all the attention is has recently earned thanks to its natural structure and easy drinkability. The wine boasts aromas of honeysuckle and apricot and would pair with white meat or fish.,87,Il Conte 2009 Villa Prandone Navicchio  (Offida Pecorino)
"The herb, grapefruit, tropical fruit and melon aromas are light but very varietal. The palate has a slight spritz that perks up the tangy fruit flavors.",88,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2014 Horse Heaven Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Horse Heaven Hills)
"An easy, fruity wine, its attractive red cherry flavors bubbling away in soft tannins and light acidity. Very drinkable, and not for aging.",84,Domaine Jessiaume 2008  Bourgogne
"There's no shortage of ripeness in this single-vineyard, somewhat hot and wild Toro. The nose is all spice, heat and simmering black fruit, and that's backed by a brooding, heaviy concentrated palate. Teetering on the precipice of overripe, this wine needs all the air and patience you can give it to muster elegance to match its power.",91,Telmo Rodríguez 2005 Pago la Jara  (Toro)
"Slight yeasty funk still hangs over the nose. The palate immediately comes in with driven force and incredible energy. There is pith and zest, stone and smoke, but for now the fruit is hidden at the core. Great concentration adds to the drive and dynamic here. This is warm and ripe, but still incisive—it's not showing its true colors yet. Drink 2020—2030.",93,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Roche Volcanique Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Tar and black fruit emerge from the shadows of big tannins that pucker on the palate, begging for more time to soften. Robust and full bodied with a warm ripeness, it finishes flat.",85,V. Sattui 2012 Preston Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This is an oaky, smoky wine, with cinnamon and hickory notes on the nose and palate. There's also ample pear and melon character along with tropical fruit and spice notes. It's resiny and chunky, but good acidity keeps it lively and balanced.",85,Viña Casas Patronales 2011 Reserva Chardonnay (Maule Valley)
"This has a charred, roasted opening along with big black-fruit aromas. Saturated and full-bodied, it offers flavors of baked berry, plum and herbs. It's long, expectedly toasty and fully oaked on the finish, with chunky, rubbery tannins. Drink through 2016.",90,Mano A Mano 2009 Venta la Ossa Syrah (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"While five years from harvest, this bold, penetrating Merlot is still a baby, with a long, promising future ahead. Subtle whiffs of crisp red cherry and mushroom seem quiet on the nose, but the palate is deeply concentrated. Black plum and cherry flavors are penetrating yet deftly grounded by a core of mouth puckering tannin and acidity. Enjoy starting 2020, but should maintain for much longer.",90,Waters Crest 2010 Grand Vin Merlot (North Fork of Long Island)
"Though Washington is rarely recognized for its Gewürztraminers, the grape does exceptionally well here, and Celilo in particular has become a treasured hunting ground for winemakers specializing in the grape. This one is a gem: spicy and off-dry, it expands across the palate with authority and precision. Rather than sweetly floral, it leans toward flavors that are sweetly grassy, but lets pretty rose petal highlights fill in the back of the palate.",89,Maryhill 2006 Gewürztraminer (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Oak dominates this Chard. It's an example of the old criticism, drinking toothpicks. The flavors of buttered toast, caramel, roasted meringue and crème brûlée dominate the pineapple and pear fruit, unbalancing an otherwise excellent wine.",86,Freeman 2006 Ryo-fu Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"The 2007 vintage splits down the middle in Oregon; some producers managed it well; others seemed to struggle. This Jamsheed is a pale reflection of the winery's 2006; thin with herb and leaf, stem and sour fruits.",84,Maysara 2007 Jamsheed Pinot Noir (McMinnville)
"A complex wine with firm acidity and ripe black currant notes. The fruit is juicy, and the palate finely structured. The small property, owned by André Lurton, is improving with every vintage.",92,Château Couhins-Lurton 2010  Pessac-Léognan
"Scents of roasted nuts and apples gain levity on the palate with flavors of lemons and delicate white flowers. Richly textured, this has a slightly-viscous but refreshingly-fruity profile.",85,Barrel Oak 2009 Reserve Chardonnay (Virginia)
"This elegant bottle (both in terms of content and presentation) would make an excellent option for an aperitivo or could pair with summer salads or seafood lunches. Citrus, drying mineral and honey make for textbook Prosecco perfection.",87,Conte Collalto NV Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Made with 70% Catarratto and 30% Viognier, this has aromas suggesting honeysuckle, yellow stone fruit and a savory whiff of tarragon. The soft, round palate shows pear, citrus and a hint of apricot while a note of bitter almond closes the finish.",88,Gregorio De Gregorio 2015 White (Terre Siciliane)
"This is a fantastic Ripasso with deep layers of Nutella, chocolate fudge, roasted espresso bean and sweet blackberry pie. It delivers a lush, rich texture and a soft, velvety mouthfeel and impressive intensity on the long finish.",90,Brunelli 2009 Pa' Riondo  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
"Aromas of pineapple, lemon and stone fruits lead into a palate that is ripe and round, with apple butter and pear flavors. The finish is dry and fairly simple, with banana-like richness and tropical fruit notes, but also some late bitterness. Just two things hold it back: The texture is a bit flat, and the acidity could use a jolt.",85,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite) 2002 Los Vascos Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley)
"Fully 25% of the wine is Syrah, which adds color and helps to bolster the fruit. Red berries provide a light base for a wine with plenty of barrel flavors of toast and coffee grounds.",87,Reustle 2014 Hebron Bloc Grenache (Umpqua Valley)
"Aged in oak, this blend of Chardonnay and Insolia offers bold aromas of white rose, honey and stone fruit, with a soft, round palate. The creamy finish would pair well with a crab cake or a spicy Thai mango salad.",88,Valle dell'Acate 2010 Bidis White (Sicilia)
"Despite the relatively low alcohol, this wine feels curiously hot, enough to lower the score. Chili pepper notes dominate the fruit.",84,Ackerman 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville)
"Lusciously peachy and floral with a deliciously clingy, silken mouthfeel, this dry Riesling offers irresistable quaffability at a seductive price point. It's unabashedly forward yet nuanced. Brisk and cutting on the finish, it's a balanced, refreshing sip. Drink now through 2018.",90,Schäfer 2014 Dry Style Riesling (Rheinhessen)
"The bouquet suggests burnt rubber, compost and briar patch along with basic raspberry/cherry. The palate has a mild creaminess to it and herbal, lightly stemmy flavors of raspberry and rhubarb. Finishes tart, with herbs and vanilla.",83,Sassy Bitch 2008 Pinot Noir (Central Valley)
"Heavily oaked and charred aromas of saucy berry fruits and espresso lead to a choppy, astringent palate. Reedy plum and berry flavors are a touch herbal and saucy. It feels tannic and drawing on an oaky finish that sports a clove note. Drink from 2018–2026.",90,Carlos Moro 2014 Finca Valdehierro 16 Meses Barrica Tempranillo (Cigales)
"A blend of 90% Chardonnay with 10% Pinot Blanc makes this a Blanc de Blancs (not indicated on the label). The wine itself is fruity, soft and with creamed-apple acidity to give it a lift. The light mousse gives a gentle aftertaste. Drink now.",88,Gyéjacquot Frères NV Collection Blanche  (Champagne)
"An attractive floral, appley aroma and generous, ripe apple and herb flavors give this medium-bodied wine plenty of personality.",88,Castle Rock 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino County)
"A bit herbal and earthy, with some green tannins, this 100% Cab was mostly grown in the Mayacamas Mountains overlooking Sonoma Valley. It's dry and soft, with suggestions of cherries, blackberries and currants.",86,Charles Creek 2004 Las Pasiones Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley)
"This has a nutty, almond character that is integrating with the crisp texture. Taut and generous, this has richness, with a wood and citrus character. Age for another year.",92,Pascal Bouchard 2008 Blanchot Grand Cru  (Chablis)
"In the prestigious village of Vosne-Romanée, there is little room for anything but Grand and Premier Cru vineyards. This wine, from the flatter ground at the bottom of the slope, shows something of the structure that makes the great wines. To balance that it also has bright fruit and plenty of acidity. It will be ready to drink from early 2018.",91,L. Tramier & Fils 2013 Collection  (Vosne-Romanée)
"Close to the slope of Grand Crus, Fourchaume is one of the best known of the premiers in Chablis. This ripe wine with its touches of vanilla as well as yellow fruits and acidity has a lightly honeyed character typical of the vintage. It is ready to drink, although it will be better from 2017.",92,Domaine Gérard Duplessis 2013 Fourchaume Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"Thick and powerful, this pure Cabernet boasts a wide offering of aromas: Plum, prune, wild mushroom, moist earth and mature fruit are identifiable characteristics. The mouthfeel is gritty and raw but full of penetrating flavors.",90,Castello di Querceto 2003 Il Sole di Alessandro Cabernet Sauvignon (Colli della Toscana Centrale)
"If at first the wine seems sweet and scattered, just give it time. Soon the nose will knit together to show mocha and that lightly oxidized elegance that is Oloroso. After that there's a palate of coffee, caramel and brown sugar, and a tight, grabby palate that's like your tongue is attached to a magnet. Give this one plenty of air for best results.",91,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L. NV Oloroso Sherry (Jerez)
"Another great Hillside Select from selected blocks in Shafer's vineyard. It's a perfect illustration of the “iron fist in a velvet glove” description of Stags Leap Cabernet, with perhaps more emphasis this year on the velvet than the iron. With smooth tannins and luxurious, oak-influenced blackberry and black cherry jam flavors, it's delicious now and will provide plenty of pleasure over the next 8–10 years.",94,Shafer 2008 Hillside Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District)
"Rounded and warm, this wine shows ripe yellow fruits and spice from the wood aging. It's richly endowed, full of toast and with a generous texture. The minerality and acidity are a hint in this rounded wine. Drink from 2020.",92,Louis Latour 2015 Les Referts Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet)
"Attractively dry but at the same time rich and buttery, this wine achieves a good balance of fresh acidity and full flavor. The aromas are like caramel and butter, flavors suggest spiced apples and the finish carries them through.",89,Poseidon 2012 Boon Fly's Hill Chardonnay (Los Carneros)
"Kicking off with a tight nose of lemongrass and limestone, this is a Viognier for fans of Sauvignon Blanc. It keeps a razor-sharp focus on the palate, with tart apple flavors and zesty acidity that wipes the flavors clean rather quickly, but it verges ever so slightly towards a hint of tropical papaya.",89,Zaca Mesa 2012 Zaca Mesa Vineyard Viognier (Santa Ynez Valley)
"This is the third wine of classed growth Château Grand-Puy-Lacoste, a charming offspring of the more serious grand vin. It shows lively black fruits, touches of wood and balanced acidity. It's a wine to drink young and fruity, so open from 2016.",89,Domaine de Saint-Guirons 2010  Pauillac
"The price keeps creeping up, but at least this is one Australian wine that consistently delivers vintage after vintage. The 2004 offers classic aromas of cassis, cinnamon and clove, with a touch of cracked pepper for good measure. It's full-bodied without going overboard, with a rich texture and a long, clean finish filled with complex spice notes. Good now, should be even better in 10 years.",91,Peter Lehmann 2004 Stonewell Shiraz (Barossa)
"Fermented with 100% stems and aged in neutral French oak, this textbook example of this top Syrah site brings aromas of smoked meat, purple fruit, crushed violets and fresh parsley along with other green herbs. The palate's über-fresh fruit and savory flavors are supported by tart bright acids. This one will only get better with some bottle age and will truly shine at the dinner table. Best from 2022 through 2030.",92,Kerloo 2014 Les Collines Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Wild bilberries abound on nose and palate and scent the entire drinking experience. The palate is fresh and vivid, as befits the slender red vintage of 2014. This has been handled with great care and turned out into a wine of elegance with poised, pure fruit and gentle structure.",91,Jalits 2014 Blaufränkisch (Eisenberg)
"Soft and aromatic, this is a crisp, clean and fruity wine. It has some sweetness (not indicated on the label) with lime and tangy citrus flavors. It's ready to drink.",83,Pierre Deschamps 2012 Riesling (Alsace)
"This is laden with wood, spiced with a toast note that dominates this otherwise crisp, nervy wine. The acidity is refreshing; the citrus note creates a lively streak of freshness. This needs a few months for the wood infuence to soften.",86,Domaine Hubert Lamy 2010 Les Chataigniées  (Bourgogne)
"Vintner Adriano Gigante delivers a thick, resiny Ribolla Gialla with aromas of candied fruit, caramel and apricot. Try this pretty wine with ravioli stuffed with yellow squash.",86,Gigante 2010 Ribolla Gialla (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"This blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Grenache blend is high in alcohol and ultra ripe with fruit. It's pushed well past any subtlety, with dark black fruit flavors, chewy tannins and some heat on the finish.",87,Simple Machine 2013 The Vector Syrah-Grenache (Rogue Valley)
"This is a mix of grapes from Willamette and Umpqua Valley vineyards. Light and earthy, it has a classic style that echoes a village Burgundy, only with the distinctive hint of tomato leaf that typifies less expensive Oregon Pinots. There's tart raspberry fruit as well, whiffs of plum and cherry, and overall it packs a lot of interest into its moderately-priced frame.",87,Kings Ridge 2005 Pinot Noir (Oregon)
"Water Wheel wines consistently deliver quality and value. The winery's 2007 Shiraz is made in a decadently supple, drink-now style with enough cocoa and mocha overtones to bring chocolate cake to mind. There's some cedar and spice complexity as well. Drink now-2013.",90,Water Wheel 2007 Shiraz (Bendigo)
"Leather meets plum sauce meets red licorice in this full-bodied, robustly crafted wine that's plush and lush on the palate. Seismic tannins present themselves upfront in a confrontational way before softening on the finish.",91,Sbragia 2013 Andolsen Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley)
"One of the most commonly seen French rosés in the U.S., La Vieille Ferme's 2013 delivers a mouthful of bold red fruit, plenty of weight on the palate and a pleasant but quick finish. Drink up.",85,La Vieille Ferme 2013 Rosé (Ventoux)
"This blend of Syrah (58%), Merlot (33%) and Malbec (9%) offers immediate appeal, with ready-to-go aromas of raspberry compote, mocha and cranberries. The polished red-fruit flavors show depth.",91,Canoe Ridge 2012 Cherry Street Reserve Red (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Dark gold in color and perfumed on the nose in a mix of apple blossom and sea spray, this wine is aged in a majority of seasoned French oak and a third stainless steel. It's soft, layered and voluptuous on the palate, despite its cool provenance and tenacious acidity.",88,Boheme 2012 Taylor Ridge Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"Strong citrus fruit flavors come through in this surprisingly tart and acidic wine. Given its low alcohol, one might expect more sweetness, but here the juicy fruit sings of lemon, orange and pineapple. No reason this couldn't work nicely with fresh-shucked oysters.",88,Dunham 2013 Lewis Estate Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Part of a wine series made from indigenous varieties of northeast Italy, this easy-going effort shows medium structure, with a creamy fullness. The finish has bright endnotes of cut grass, lime and honeydew. It's perfect for appetizers or light summer lunches.",87,Sirch 2011 Pinot Grigio (Venezia Giulia)
"Creamy, rich and spicy, this has potent pineapple- and orange-jam flavors, with lots of the sweetly buttered toast you get from oak barrel aging. It seems a little sweet in the finish, but it's elegant and refined.",87,Pech Merle 2010 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Soft and rounded, this is touched by a note of vanilla that adds extra openness. With its apple and pear flavors, this is an attractive, fruity wine; it's very forward, but it shows a note of Chablis steel in the background.",86,Château de Maligny 2010  Chablis
"This opens with plum and floral aromas, with freshness coming up from the bouquet. A zesty palate runs along a beam of bright acidity, while spicy raspberry core flavors finish peppery and with a burst of toasty oak. Just 50 cases made.",90,Kingston Family 2012 Alazan CJ's Barrel Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)
"After several years working in wine commerce and tourism, Céline Guguen-Brocard in 2013 studied winemaking. This is a bright result in partnership with Frédéric Gueguen, a former winemaker for her father, and Jean-Marc Brocard. This rosé is bright, crisp and full of cranberry fruit and tangy acidity. Drink now.",86,Domaine Gueguen 2016 Domaine Marie B.  (Bourgogne)
"As this wine ages, a touch of vegetal unripeness slowly emerges. It's not too strong, but it does detract from the cherry and cola flavors. The mouthfeel is just beautiful, soft, silky and dry. Drink up.",86,Halleck 2008 Hillside Cuvée Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"A heavily charred nose smells downright burnt. This Garnacha is tannic and oaky, with charred flavors of clove, black plum, toast and wood resin.",86,Ramón Bilbao 2014  Rioja
"There is plenty of the power and structure of a Vosne-Romanée in this single parcel wine. It has density and concentration over a rich full black-fruit character. There are still signs of the wood aging and some high toast flavors that need to integrate, so wait until 2020.",93,Domaine de Bellene 2014 Les Quartiers de Nuits  (Vosne-Romanée)
"Fresh and juicy, this opens with alluring aromas of ripe plum, violet, sunbaked soil and dark spice. The bright, silky palate offers crushed blackberry, succulent cherry, clove and star anise alongside supple tannins. Enjoy through 2018.",89,Feudi di San Gregorio 2013 Rubrato Aglianico (Irpinia)
"This wine commands attention with its aromas of black pepper, dried flowers, asparagus, fresh herbs and mineral. The potpourri and blue fruit flavors are sweet and rich, carrying some warmth along with them but generally holding it well.",91,Tenor 2011 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Dramatically rich and full-bodied in blackberry, cassis, dark chocolate and oak flavors. With thick, fine tannins giving it a youthful astringency, this Bordeaux blend needs to be cellared. Should develop bottle notes over the next ten years.",91,Stonestreet 2007 Legacy Red (Alexander Valley)
"This full-bodied red manages to be concentrated and weightless at the same time. It opens with aromas of blue flower, wild berry and a whiff of espresso. The smooth, almost creamy palate delivers a black cherry core while notes of graphite, clove, ground pepper and cake spice add depth. It's impeccably balanced, with velvety tannins and just the right amount of freshness. Drink through 2017.",92,Ornellaia 2012 Le Serre Nuove  (Bolgheri)
"Aromas of tropical fruit and white spring flowers lead the nose on this racy sparkler. The palate offers kiwi, green apple and white peach accompanied by vibrant acidity and vigorous bubbles.",87,Canevel 2014  Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore
"This dry wine shows hints of honey as well as pure sliced apple and white stone fruits. It is deliciously crisp, bright with acidity, almonds and a tangy texture. The wine is totally ready to drink in its fruity youth.",91,Domaine Pichot 2015 Coteau de la Biche Sec  (Vouvray)
"Ripe and fruity, the wine is a great success. It has juicy berry fruits that are underpinned by the firm tannins and mineral structure. It is full while also crisp: a wine that is deliciously perfumed. Drink from 2024.",93,Château de Fieuzal 2014  Pessac-Léognan
"A ripe and full-bodied wine, this has good depth of flavor from its lees and wood aging. A creamy texture comes along with a tangy cool fruitiness that has lemon and bitter orange flavors. It could be drunk now, but with its still crisp acidity, it will be better from the end of 2015.",88,Manuel Olivier 2012  Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Nuits
"This informal wine opens with a dark, ruby color and pretty notes of red berry, rose and pipe tobacco.",88,Uccelliera 2010  Rosso di Montalcino
"This wine really benefits from the delicious ripe fruit of the vintage. So broad, rich red-berry flavors give the wine a generous character with just the right amount of the balanced acidity. The wine is full, fruity and ready to drink.",88,Maison Jessiaume 2015  Bourgogne
"Dark fruit and earthy, gamy aromas include hints of carob, chocolate and vanilla. This is 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot; on the palate, it feels chewy, jammy and saturated. Oaky flavors come in front of caramel, chocolate and smothered berry fruit notes, while this is thick on the finish.",90,Tres Palacios 2014 Cholqui Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Maipo Valley)
"A fresh, pure, comfortable nose with nothing pushy or out of place opens this layered, balanced Rioja that doesn't wow but definitely impresses. Plum, berry, tomato and spice flavors finish with peppery notes, staunch tannins and an overall sense of quality. Drink now through 2022.",90,Sonsierra 2012 Reserva  (Rioja)
"Cabernet Sauvignon (70%) makes up the majority of this wine along with Merlot (23%), Malbec (5%) and Petit Verdot. It's aromatically brooding, with notes of black fruit, toffee, moist soil and a floral top note. The palate pulls few punches with its rich, high-octane flavors and firm tannins but manages to keep it all in balance.",91,Milbrandt 2012 Sentinel Red (Wahluke Slope)
"From Napa and Sonoma in equal measure, this wine is herbal, slightly green, while also dense, syrupy and mouth-coating in tannins.",84,Evoke 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa County-Sonoma County)
"Here is a ripe, full-bodied wine that brings out the minerality of the Douro terroir. It is structured and textured, with a strongly tangy character. Acidity and bright lemon flavors are still young and need some aging, so drink from 2016.",88,Casca Wines 2014 Santos da Casa Fazem Milagres Branco White (Douro)
"Crisp and glossy, this refreshing, stainless-steel Sauvignon Blanc has the appropriate varietal flavors of fresh herb, sweet grass, lime and grapefruit. The flavors of citrus and herb are in perfect balance and complement each other perfectly.",90,J. Scott Cellars 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Rogue Valley)
"The blend is 51% Merlot, the rest divided among five other grapes, including Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. Consequently, it's a bit of a mish-mash, fruity to the point of grapy, medium long, with the barrel flavors unresolved. Give this one another year or two of aging to allow all the components to come together.",89,Sinclair Estate Vineyards 2009 Pentatonic Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"There's a distinctive, quite appealing sense of salsa, cilantro and parsley on the nose of this Lucas & Lewellen-made blend of 45% Sangiovese, 20% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Cabernet Franc, 10% Freisa and 5% Petit Verdot. Pasilla and Fresno chiles play into the palate as well, where red berry fruit is the backbone. Wine geeks will dig this, but casual sippers may be confused.",89,Toccata 2011 Classico Red (Santa Barbara County)
"Pinot Grigio Unterebner offers a beautiful contrast between cool-climate aromas of white flower and passion fruit and spicy, oak-driven aromas of vanilla and cinnamon bun. Pair this wine with a savory appetizer strudel filled with spinach, cheese and pine nuts.",90,Tramin 2010 Unterebner Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige)
"Pear and herb scents combine for a savory, fruity nose. The palate plays out its lovely, yeasty savoriness with hints of sage and fern. Citrus freshness animates and enlivens the lovely midpalate texture, leaving a clean and very refreshing finish.",90,The Dot 2016 Austrian Apple Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"Shows more gooseberry and feline notes than previous vintages, but there's still enough sweet spearmint and pink grapefruit flavor to satisfy. The acidity is lovely and mouthwatering.",88,Patianna 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino)
"Forward and fruity, this is a solid, drink any time Chardonnay. It's built in a blocky chunky mode, but some sleek lime flavors put a polished edge on the underlying acids.",88,Dobbes Family Estate 2013 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
"Grassy and oily smelling and then you'll find a thick, oily palate with honey and lychee flavors. Not very zesty, so it's kind of clumsy and dense, with a chunky finish and bitterness. Decent acidity is what keeps its head above water.",86,Jorge Ordóñez & Co. 2010 Botani Moscatel Seco Moscatel (Málaga)
"This full-bodied wine has unapologetic late-harvest flavors like raisins and prunes dusted with dried herbs, and a firm texture that comes with alcoholic heat.",85,Deaver 2013 Henry's House Zinfandel (California)
"Good for its apricot, vanilla and buttercream flavors, but really lacks the sweet richness that an expensive dessert wine needs. It falls apart mid-palate, and turns watery on the finish.",84,Prager 2007 Sweet Claire Late Harvest Riesling (California)
"A taut, clean Riesling that seems a little subdued in its flavors. The palate is clean and fresh and offers the refreshment one expects from dry, Austrian Riesling.",87,Weingut Groiss 2014 Riesling (Wagram)
"Rose, violet and vanilla aromas lead the nose on this straightforward Nebbiolo. The friendly palate doles out crushed black cherry accented with milk chocolate. It's round and ready so enjoy now.",87,Rocca Felice 2012  Nebbiolo d'Alba
"Tightly constructed for an entry-priced Chardonnay, this has faint almond nuttiness accenting pineapple and grapefruit flavors. Drink this medium-bodied wine through mid-2018.",85,Jacob's Creek 2016 Chardonnay (Australia)
"Epitomizes the New World style of a superripe, soft, plush wine, bursting with fruity-berry flavors, and generously oaked. Hard to imagine a wine flattering the palate more, with its graceful tannins and heaps of blackcurrant, sweet roasted pepper, olive and white chocolate flavors. Instantly appealing, although it may be a difficult match for food.",93,Shafer 2000 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A dark color and rich, jammy, baked aromas of charred oak and lush berries are the opening to this blend of 72% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Carmenère and 8% Cabernet Franc. Moderately bold acidity and firm tannins lend energy and structure to the palate, while this tastes of blackberry, cassis and spicy oak. A slightly hot finish with a lot of wood spice is the closing act. Drink through 2021.",91,Santa Ema 2014 Catalina Red
"Like oak? Yes? Then this is the Vacqueyras for you. There's ample fruit weight to support the lush lashings of toasted coconut and luxurious vanilla notes and pull them through a long, velvety-textured finish. Drink now–2018.",91,Tardieu-Laurent 2010 Vieilles Vignes Red (Vacqueyras)
"Bright on the nose with purple fruit, black raspberry and dried strawberry, this blend holds 34% Syrah, 33% Grenache and 33% Mourvèdre. Aromas gain complexity thanks to asphalt in the background and a lifting dried-mint scent. Tar, dried cherry, tart pomegranate and cranberry show on the palate, along with floral elements of hibiscus and rose.",90,Archium 2013 Dissident Red (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Subdued aromas of spirits, raisin, menthol and resin emerge on this. The bulky palate shows blistering alcohol and a hint of raisin but it lacks fruit richness. Grainy tannins leave a raspy finish.",85,La Fornace 2011  Brunello di Montalcino
"A positive bouquet of melon, white flowers and honey leads to a ripped acidic palate that generates tangy, almost sharp flavors of orange and gooseberry. A citrusy angular finish turns pithy and bitter as it dissipates. Drink now.",87,Nora 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
This wine is produced from vines aged 62–88 years old. It has ripe red fruits and soft tannins creating a wine that is generous and ready to drink. It is a blend of grapes from the flat lands beyond the slopes in the Côte d'Or. The wine finishes with acidity as well as attractive fruitiness.,87,Roche de Bellene 2014 Vieilles Vignes  (Bourgogne)
"Fresh and fruit forward, this is a fine value in a most enjoyable style. Bananas, pears, apples and more are in play, with a mouthfilling, generous midpalate.",89,Foris 2013 Chardonnay (Rogue Valley)
"While not as blossomy in perfume as previous vintages, there's plenty of fresh watermelon and sour-cherry refreshment here. Exceptionally light bodied and dry, it's an invigoratingly crisp summer sip. The finish is brisk but crystalline and mineral.",88,Lieb 2016 Bridge Lane Rosé (North Fork of Long Island)
"Cabernet Sauvignon (57%) takes the lead on this wine, followed by Petit Verdot (18%), Merlot (17%), Cabernet Franc (7%) and Malbec. Bright aromas of plum, cranberry, cigar box, blackberry, café au lait and smoke lead to sweet generous red and black-fruit flavors. It brings a sense of purity of flavor that captures the attention.",91,Pirouette 2014 Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Vibrant, tart gooseberry, plum and lime aromas are upfront on the bouquet, with additional hints of sweet grass and honeysuckle dancing in the background. The palate offers bright acidity and crisp citrus flavors. Drink now.",88,Protea 2013 Chenin Blanc (Coastal Region)
This is an easy and thin wine with low aromatic intensity and simple elements of fresh fruit and cherry. The one-diminutional mouthfeel is soft and short.,84,Canti 2011  Montepulciano d'Abruzzo
"This is a light and elegant expression of Nero d'Avola, with pretty nuances of spice and smoke between bay leaf and powdered curry. Black fruit fills the mouth thanks to the wine's soft and chewy texture.",87,Feudo Principi di Butera 2007 Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"Fresh and clean, this Vermentino offers ripe aromas of apricot and peach, with background tones of citrus and pear. It's extra smooth and silky on the close.",88,Tenute Soletta 2011 Chimera  (Vermentino di Sardegna)
"Winemaker Carl Bowker delivers a great-smelling wine on this blend of 64% Tempranillo and 36% Grenache, with aromas of purple fruit, violets and a pepper-crusted bacon. The palate suggests a very flavorful pork roast in plum sauce, showing hoisin, ripe blackberries and grape candy, proving simultaneously playful and elegant.",93,Caliza 2012 Sympatico Red (Paso Robles)
This Brut interpretation of Prosecco (“Brut” means it tastes dry in the mouth) offers tangy fizz and soda-like intensity backed by subdued aromas of white mineral and stone fruit. Pair it with puff pastry appetizers.,86,Sant Eurosia 2007 Brut  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
"A ripe and fruity wine, the lemon flavors are complemented by rich melon and orange zest. It's a wine that has a dense texture, with the acidity well integrated into the fruitiness.",86,Bougrier 2012 Château du Jaunay Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"This is a successful straight-ahead Chardonnay, with aromas of buttercream, vanilla and orange cake developing complexity thanks to alkaline, pithy notes. For such a rich nose, it proves quite clean and crisp on the palate, with lemon-lime soda, wet slate and just a touch of buttered apples.",89,Demetria 2012 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County)
"Whiffs of dusty minerals lend a savory, earthy character to dried fig and pressed apple notes on this sweet Riesling. With flavors of fresh fruit fading into the background, it's showing signs of an approaching maturity. Drink soon.",86,Macari 2011 Block E Riesling (North Fork of Long Island)
"Honeyed and caramel aromas are followed on the palate by a ripe, rich creamy texture. Yellow fruits are further smoothed by buttery flavors. This is a rounded wine, ready to drink.",85,Louis Max 2013  Mâcon-Villages
"Fresh and fruity, this is a bright wine, full of almost shocking acidity and red-currant fruits. Its tannins are there, although more of an afterthought to the fruit. Drink this light fresh wine from 2017.",87,Château Jean Faux 2014  Bordeaux Supérieur
"This wine's dark berry cinnamon, blue flower and truffle aromas come together in the glass. The taut palate shows Morello cherry, cranberry and white pepper notes alongside firm acidity and somewhat grainy tannins.",88,Alessandro Rivetto 2014  Barbaresco
"Although the nose is restrained, fresh, ripe notions of Mirabelle and yellow apple can be made out. The palate is bright and poised, shot through with lemon zestiness and lip-smacking freshness. Dry, toned and slender, it's packed with bright, citrusy fruit.",91,Ingrid Groiss 2016 Gemischter Satz Braitenpuechtorff White (Niederösterreich)
"The odd name (misspelled on the front label, correct on the back) means beyond the beyond. It's a lightly buttery, nutty take on a relatively simple, yet tasty Chardonnay, with mixed apple, tangerine and honeydew fruits.",89,Lachini 2013 Al di Là Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
"This vintage of Mirabai is open and full-throttle fruity, with appealing cherry scents and flavors. It's a lovely, delicate shade of rose, with a floral component to the bouquet. It's a subtle, elegant wine that offers immediate enjoyment and the prospect of cellaring well through 2020 or longer.",92,Kelley Fox 2013 Mirabai Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This base Barolo offers upfront aromas of tealeaf, moist tobacco, apple skin, cedar wood, white cherry and wild berry. Those notes are overlapped and tangled yet the wine finds balance in the mouth thanks to the supporting role of tannins and acidity. Overall, this is a fresh, traditional and direct expression of Nebbiolo.",88,Giribaldi 2004  Barolo
"Although this opens with woodsy aromas, things settle with airing as berry and black currant notes emerge. This is thick and voluminous, with a cushy body. Flavors of black plum, blackberry and herbs come with high-toned notes of tomato and saline, while the finish feels plump and meaty.",90,Luigi Bosca 2010 Malbec (Luján de Cuyo)
"Structured from the start, this wine provides succulent boysenberry and blackberry around a full-figured body that's otherwise steeped in vanilla and coffee, the toasted oak quite prevalent. It finishes slightly tart in dried herb and mushroom.",87,Rodney Strong 2012 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
Albana di Romagna is a little-known white wine from central Italy that offers much of the same fresh appeal of more popular and commercial Italian whites like Pinot Grigio. This expression is bright and crisp with pear and stone fruit.,84,Tenuta Valli 2009 Vinchi  (Albana di Romagna)
"And now for something completely different, this wine explodes in whole-cluster, carbonic freshness and surprise. It's a light cerebral take on the variety that delights at every turn. Stainless-steel fermented and aged, it's loaded in raspberry and cherry-jam flavors and dipped in black licorice. It's fresh, fruity and entirely memorable.",94,Sheldon 2016 Springloaded Monkey Paw Luc's Vineyard Tempranillo (Sonoma County)
"Lush and opulent, with South Coast notes of tomato, cola and beet, crushed hard spices and earth and some pretty black-cherry fruit. It drinks very soft, almost disembodied, with scarcely a tannin to be found, and low acidity. It's elegant, but could use some more crispness and structure.",86,Talley 1999 Rosemary's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"Decadent swirls of petrol and oak inform the entry of this young wine, golden in color and viscous on the palate. Coconut flakes season a core of ripe pear compote and cinnamon before a streak of sizzling acidity tempers the richness of the wine's initial impression, ultimately finding freshness on the finish.",90,Buena Vista 2013 Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Pointy cherry aromas initially suggest nail polish and volatility. A gritty palate with candied red-fruit flavors seems generic, while berry, chocolate and marshmallow flavors lend sweetness to the finish.",84,Tucumen 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"With the typical blend of a Côtes de Provence rosé, this is pale in color and light at heart. Made by the well-known Châteauneuf-du-Pape producer, it has some weight as well as ripe red fruits. A touch of tannin in the structure gives it an attractive tension as well as a tangy aftertaste.",86,Brotte 2015 Charles Brotte Cuvée Rose Secret Rosé (Vin de France)
"Showing good balance, this wine tastes focused, bright and lively. Firm acidity and tannins back up generous, ripe cherry and black plum flavors. It feels ultrasmooth on the palate and is a pleasure to sip.",90,Pfendler 2013 Estate Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"The subdued nose eventually reveals black cherry, anise and a whiff of chopped herb that carry over to the straightforward, informal palate. Dusty, drying tannins and a note of bitter sage leave an astringent finish.",86,Di Giovanna 2013 Poggionotte Red (Terre Siciliane)
"Thick, tannic and somewhat astringent, this wine blends 80% Cabernet Sauvignon with 10% Merlot, 6% Cabernet Franc and 4% Petite Sirah. Tar and tobacco flavors and a leathery mouthfeel give it a loud voice of powerful ripeness.",87,Terra Valentine 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District)
This certified organic wine from Damien Lorteau is juicy with attractive blackberry fruit. Spice and warm tannins (aged 12 months in barrel) give it a rich structure. It will have a fine future—a ripe wine with plenty of fruitiness. Drink from 2019.,89,Château les Vieux Moulins 2014 Cuvée les Hélices  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"Every vintage this wine pulls the same score, so there's something to be said about consistency. This bottling is neutral on the nose, with hints of dust and melon. The palate is clean and citrusy in feel, with melon and green herb notes. An easy finish seems right given the precedings.",86,Palo Alto 2013 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Maule Valley)
"A first-class Zin that shows classic mountain character, at a very nice price. Dry and rich in tannins, it's explosive in briary, brambly wild berries, currants, dark chocolate and pepper, with a touch of raisins. Just delicious.",90,Easton 2007 Zinfandel (Amador County)
"A beautiful, fragrant wine that is fresh with apples and pears and lightly mineral in character. It has great fruitiness and lively acidity that continues strong to the end. Drink now.",89,Muxagat 2011 Os Xistos Altos Rabigato (Douro)
"Rich and dense, this is a ripe, wood-aged wine, now showing maturity. It has weight, red berry fruits and a firmer structure of tannins. It is ready to drink, but could age another year.",87,Château la Mascaronne 2009 La Mascaronne Red (Côtes de Provence)
"Trebbiano, Roscetto and Malvasia are blended to produce a clean and simple wine with sharp, clean lines backed by lively aromas of citrus, pear and Golden Delicious apple.",84,Falesco 2010 White (Est! Est!! Est!!! di Montefiascone)
"A delicious and interesting white wine, made from a variety more usually used for blending purposes. It's honey-rich but dry, similar in structure to an oaky Chardonnay, with tropical fruit and vanilla flavors that have a pleasant touch of bitterness.",90,Jaffurs 2008 Thompson Vineyard Grenache Blanc (Santa Barbara County)
"Visually, this is a pale version of a Creamsicle. It has citrus yellow fruits and soft acidity. With its spice, it is well balanced, ending with a refreshing burst of bright red-currant flavors.",87,Château de Calavon 2015 Rosé (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence)
"If you catch this wine young and properly chilled, it isn't that bad. It's very sweet and sugary, with candied melon, mango and citrus flavors. Then it gets more tropical on the finish, with ending notes of banana and mango. On the verge of tasting fake but not quite.",84,Marqués de Cáceres 2007 Satinela Medium-Sweet White (Rioja)
"This wine is crisp, medium bodied and surprisingly firm for an inexpensive Merlot. Drink this wine over the next year or two for its potent cassis and black cherry fruit. Some rare beef will help show the wine to best effect.",86,Oyster Bay 2011 Merlot (Hawke's Bay)
"Grassy, floral and herbal, this nice white comes from a well-regarded site devoted to the variety. Melon and fuzzy peach flavors highlight its dry, diluted palate, with moderate acidity.",87,Portalupi 2016 Las Brisas Vineyard Vermentino (Carneros)
"This Merlot-based rosé is a bit on the sweet side. It's juicy and simple, with red plum fruit that finishes with enough acidity for balance.",85,Kate Radburnd 2015 Berry Burst Rosé (Hawke's Bay)
"Very tight and linear in all the right ways, this focused wine shows black raspberry, sweet hummingbird sage, clove butter and star anise on the nose. It's even lighter on the palate, where potpourri, olallieberry, black pepper and pencil lead converge. It will age gracefully, thanks to judicious acid and tannins. Drink 2018 through 2028.",94,Claiborne & Churchill 2013 Runestone Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)
"Here's an interesting blend of Corvina, Cabernet Sauvignon and Rondinella that reflects the aromas and power of each grape variety. The wine offers mature notes of cherry, clove, blackberry and cola: It tastes slightly sweet and very succulent.",87,Aldegheri 2003 Le Pietre Santambrogio Red (Rosso del Veronese)
"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon hails from a three-acre block of the winery's estate. Muted somewhat in terms of fruit, it offers instead ample amounts of smoky oak and herb, the tannins firm and generous.",86,Flora Springs 2011 Rennie Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
"Camphor, menthol, toast and espresso aromas lead the nose. The firm, tightly wound palate shows roasted coffee bean, dried cherry and licorice alongside bracing tannins.",88,Marziano Abbona 2012 Ravera  (Barolo)
This wine offers very ripe fruit that gives an almost-sweet character to what should be a dry wine. There is acidity that helps. Drink now.,85,Quinta do Castelinho 2013 Quinta Dona Mafalda Vinhas Velhas Red (Douro)
"Cabernet Sauvignon from Navarra is always going to be vintage-dependent, so in a perfect year like 2005 a wine like this shows its best. The nose offers coconut, dill and cedar, which sets the stage for a lengthy, honest palate of roasted berry, cola, herb and tobacco flavors. Not a sweet or “fruity” style per se, but a cut above and a good terroir wine that reflects its year.",89,Señorío de Sarria 2005 Viñedo No. 9 Cabernet Sauvignon (Navarra)
"With grapes coming from Weinbau, Klipsun and Ciel du Cheval vineyards, among others, this wine offers brooding aromas of dark raspberries and bittersweet chocolate. The oak (half new French) provides a perfect complement, with flavors of coffee and spice mixing with dark fruit. It's hard to put the glass down.",92,Januik 2012 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This robust red shows plenty of ripe berry flavors, firm texture and full body. It has a gripping mouthfeel and persistent raspberry and cranberry flavors that make the mouth water.",89,Fenestra 2011 Tempranillo (Livermore Valley)
"Floral blueberry aromas work alongside baking-spice notes on an inviting nose. This feels fresh and jumpy, with live-wire acidity. Leafy plum and lightly herbal flavors finish fresh and snappy, with juicy acidity and no overt oak. Drink through 2019.",91,Superuco 2014 Michelini Sammartino Calcáreo Coluvio de Altamira Malbec (Valle de Uco)
"Aromas of vanilla, cocoa, cashew and dried herb start out light and elusive but open up over time. Meanwhile the cherry flavors are sweet and creamy in feel, backed by firm, somewhat dry tannins.",89,Canoe Ridge 2012 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills)
"A wide-open, friendly wine, all delicious rich white fruits and tropical flavors. While it may not be ageworthy, it is a pleasure now, an opulent mouthful of Chardonnay.",90,Louis Latour 2006 Les Folatières Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet)
"Opens with decent dusty apple and peach aromas, but they don't really hold together for long. And the palate is similar in that it offers adequate opening flavors of green apple and citrus but no improvement after that. Drink right away; it won't age well.",84,Basico 2008 Blanco Sauvignon Blanc (La Mancha)
"In this soft, ripe wine, rounded tropical fruits contrast with the crisp texture. It's fruity while also having a mineral character that suggests the potential for aging. Drink from late 2017.",87,Paul Prieur et Fils 2014  Sancerre
"The foxy muddled berry aromas are puzzling. This Malbec blend feels narrow and pinched. Hollow lactic foxy red-fruit flavors are crisp but not fully convincing, while abrasive, hard-edged tannins scrape across the finish.",86,Solo Contigo 2012 Colección Red (Mendoza)
"Blended with 25% Roussanne and fermented and aged in French oak, the aromas are light but intriguing, with slightly reduced notes of peach, cream, flowers and spice. The poached pear and stone-fruit flavors are delicate but accented by tart focused acidity that keeps the interest up.",88,Tertulia 2016 Whistling Hills Estate Vineyard Viognier (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Pretty aromas of violet, iris and woodland berry waft out of the glass. The vibrant palate offers raw red cherry, orange zest and dried Mediterranean herb alongside racy acidity and sleek tannins.",87,Castello Sonnino 2013  Chianti Montespertoli
"Pert and juicy in feel, overripe lemon and peach tones mark the nose and palate. This is enjoyable but not overly engaging or long lasting on the palate.",85,Laurentide 2013 Semi-Sweet Riesling (Leelanau Peninsula)
"This wine is expressive, with aromas of violet, herb and purple fruit. The palate is lighter styled and tart, delivering a bit more tannic heft than this variety often shows. Give it some time to open up.",90,Kerloo 2015 Blue Mountain Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"From a vineyard in the Santa Lucia Highlands, a young, jammy wine bursting with candied flavors of raspberries and cherries. It drinks very concentrated and intense. There's a caramelly note that may come from well-charred barrels in this dry, full-bodied wine.",87,Opolo 2000 Pinot Noir (Central Coast)
"Pithy and citrusy on the nose, but ultimately it's rather neutral. The palate is citric and lean, with orange, lemon and sour apple flavors. Zesty to the point of tartness, with a citrusy, juicy finish. A pointed SB with zing.",86,Emiliana 2010 Natura Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"This rich and creamy vintage wine boasts soft apples, fresh acidity and a fine, tight texture. There's just a hint of toast to round out the palate and add complexity. It could improve with age further, so drink through 2020.",92,Piper-Heidsieck 2006 Vintage Brut  (Champagne)
"There's a note of candied fruit or butterscotch at the start of this Vermentino from southern Tuscany that is followed by pear, peach and white almond. The finish is short, crisp and spicy.",85,Conte Ferdinando Guicciardini 2010 Massi di Mandorlaia Vermentino (Maremma)
"Soft with a yeasty character, this wine has not gotten its act together. It has some bitterness, walnut and spice flavors although nothing hangs together.",83,Domaine Ferret 2013  Pouilly-Fuissé
"Rich and pure, with warm saddle-leather aromas as well as scents of toffee and hard cheese. The palate runs sweet and rich, with plenty of brown sugar and spice galore. As a whole it's a rather forward and approachable wine that might lack some complexity but not exuberance.",89,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L. NV Amontillado Sherry Sherry (Jerez)
Both tannins and ripe berry fruits are in juicy balance in this wine. It gives it density as well as a crisp character that is enhanced by the smoky flavor that comes through. Drink this wine from 2018.,88,Château Sainte Barbe 2015 Merlot du Château Sainte Barbe  (Bordeaux)
"Rich and flavorful, this Cabernet has jammy flavors of cassis, cherries, milk chocolate, licorice and vanilla. The wine is almost sweet and very soft in structure, the kind of Cab that adheres to today's cult parameters. Drink now through 2010.",87,Bardessono 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville)
"Beautiful and appetizing notes of Cox Orange Pippin apples shine. The palate is zesty, sprightly and textured, and shows pure fruit—a combination that spells ideal refreshment. The lemony fillip on the finish is lip-smacking.",90,Dopff & Irion 2014 Riesling (Alsace)
"A fruity wine with soft tannins that reflects the crispness of the vintage. The wine, full of blackberry fruit and balanced acidity comes from an estate in the heart of the Entre-deux-Mers region of Bordeaux. Drink now.",85,Château les Terrasses de Bouey 2014  Bordeaux
"Shows some Riesling character in the petrol, honeysuckle and citrus fruit aromas and flavors, and that crisp Central Coast acidity makes it very bright and clean. It's a bit thin, but nice enough as an apéritif sipper.",85,Claiborne & Churchill 2007 Dry Riesling (Central Coast)
"The aromatics impress with bold notes of lemon tea, orange blossom and Key lime. The vineyard's typical minerality is in full force, underscoring bone-dry flavors of wet stone, tarragon, chervil, lime and grapefruit. The density and balance are impressive.",93,Trisaetum 2015 Ribbon Ridge Dry Riesling (Ribbon Ridge)
"Coming off the Rocks District, this wine displays high-toned aromas of brown stems, crushed violets and black pepper along with a light meat and olive streak. The flavors are poised and layered, showing a mixture of red and black fruits with abundant savory accents. The crazy-long finish flat out impresses.",94,K Vintners 2013 Rock Garden Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Soft stewy raisiny aromas are not problematic but they do suggest a wine that's a bit overripe, which isn't surprising for 2012—a notoriously hot year. A heavy palate is a touch mushy but also tannic. Candied flavors of cherry and cassis are raisiny, while this is plodding and chocolaty on the finish.",89,Echeverria 2012 Founder's Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"A rich, earthy Pinot bright in red and blue fruit and an herbal note in the distance, Londer's estate-grown Pinot is a marriage of site, style and vintage. Lightly textured with soft edges and complexity to spare, it should pair well with bacon and goat cheese quiche.",93,Londer 2009 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Aromas of mature orchard fruit, dried herb and a whiff of pressed flower lead the nose. The straightforward, enjoyable palate offers ripe pear, nectarine and a mineral note. White almond wraps up the finish.",88,Fattori 2015 Danieli  (Soave)
"Intense and compact on the nose, this has cola, mint, cassis and blackberry aromas that are tightly knit. The palate is narrow and intense, with lightly herbal, reedy flavors of saucy, savory berry and herb. This is a leading Carmenère, but it's not as flavorful and substantive as prior years.",90,Concha y Toro 2009 Carmín de Peumo Carmenère (Cachapoal Valley)
"Notes of crushed spices accent the black cherry and plum flavors of this Pinot, making it savory. It's a dry wine, crisp in coastal acidity and a little rough in texture. Not going anywhere, so drink up.",86,J. Wilkes 2009 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"This is a barrel selection combining the best lots from all three estate vineyards. Refined, pungent, spicy and persistent, it opens with bright raspberry and cherry fruit, then lays on layers of anise, coconut, vanilla, caramel and a whiff of cannabis herb. It's long and concentrated, with good aging potential.",93,Trisaetum 2013 Estates Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"The aromas pop with notes of fresh flowers, smoked meat, stems, mineral, smoke, white pepper and an earthy funk. The flavors dance on the palate, with mouthwatering fruit and savory notes that lead to an outrageously long finish. It's equal parts elegance and intensity.",94,No Girls 2013 La Paciencia Vineyard Grenache (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Grassy tropical fruit and melon aromas lead to chalk and lemon-lime rind flavors on the palate. It's lean in the mouth, for the most part. Stony-mineral flavors and a nice jalapeño note bat cleanup. 3,000 cases produced.",87,Morandé 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"Dark mulberry, black raspberry, wet slate and a touch of whole nutmeg show on the nose of this bottling by a Chicago-based winery from a vineyard that now goes by the name Shokrian. It's dry and tart on the sip, full of sour wild berries along with lots of sage and thyme, culminating in a cola and candied-plum finish.",92,City Winery Chicago 2015 Verna's Vineyard Reserve Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara)
"Wiry aromas of red plum and cherry are offset by deeper, more baked and stewy notes. This drills away with hard tannins and punchy acidity, while cherry, plum, mint and earthy flavors finish with baked, chocolaty power. The blend is 40% each of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, with 20% Merlot.",88,Bodega Patritti 2008 Primogénito Blend Red (Patagonia)
"Fruit stars in this young, rich Cabernet. It's as good as young, drink-me-now Napa Cab gets, offering waves of blackberries, cherries, plums, sweet oak and spices that go on and on into long finish. The tannins are perfectly ripe, the acidity fine and brisk.",90,Atlas Peak 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This blend of Garnacha, Cabernet Sauvignon and Tempranillo opens with leathery, earthy aromas that suggest coffee grinds, black olive and stalky berry fruits. In the mouth, it comes through with a dense, layered feel and spicy flavors of baked berry fruits and black cherry. Overall this is a ripe, chewy, spicy wine with some rusticity. Drink through 2022.",91,Clos Pons 2010 Roc Nu Red (Costers del Segre)
"Inviting scents of hay and chamomile lead the nose while the succulent palate offers juicy lemon, mature apple, peach and Mediterranean herb. Bright acidity lifts the finish.",88,Masseria del Feudo 2015 Grillo (Sicilia)
"A wine that makes you take notice. The bouquet is intense, with minerality, char, huge black-fruit aromas and handsome shadings of chocolate and coffee. Power and purity come on like gangbusters, and the flavors are a classic mix of blackberry, cassis and fine Swiss chocolate. Heady, smooth and impressive. My highest rated wine yet from Carlos Pulenta's Vistalba label. Drink now through 2014. Composed of 87% Malbec with Bonarda and Cabernet Sauvignon.",95,Vistalba 2007 Corte A Red (Mendoza)
"While the nose reveals only faint whiffs of apples, nuts and brambles, the palate of this off-dry Riesling is crisply concentrated with fresh red apples and tart peaches. It's not a deeply persistent wine, but finishes brisk and bright.",87,Twisted River 2015 Bin 168 Riesling (Mosel)
"This firm Malbec comes from old vines. It is concentrated and dense, while wearing its power easily and openly. Wood aging adds complexity as do the leather, dark chocolate and black fruits that are followed by juicy acidity. A wine with great potential, don't drink before 2018.",94,Château Haut-Monplaisir 2010 Pur Plaisir Malbec (Cahors)
"Inky dark in appearance and concentration, this muscular Recioto della Valpolicella Classico wraps your tongue tight with its blockbuster power and persistency. Aromas include blackberry jelly, chocolate, cola and exotic spice. It finishes with smooth firmness and loads of personality.",90,Nicolis 2006 500ml  (Recioto della Valpolicella Classico)
"Although the color is an evolved garnet with brick edges, this wine offers a fresh nose of blue flower, gingerbread and ripe cherry with hints of toast and clove. The palate is evolved but still delivers ripe red cherry, vanilla and espresso along with smoothed tannins and soft acidity. Not much complexity and even though it's forward, it's also balanced. Drink through 2019.",90,Tenuta di Sesta 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
"Both opulence and decadence are evident on the fleshy, peachy nose. The palate presents brighter, fresher peach and yellow plum fruit but has the sweetness of bitter honey. An intriguing and heady mix.",89,Vignoble des 2 Lunes 2010 Hatschbourg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"This offers a raw, sharp note of garden herb and white cherry. The natural acidity and crispness suggests it should pair well with cheese ravioli in a sage butter sauce.",86,Tenute Soletta 2008 Corona Majore  (Cannonau di Sardegna)
"Only just off dry, this is a crisp Champagne with a cookie-pastry flavor that balances fresh lemon and orange-zest flavors. While fine with food, this would be an excellent apéritif.",89,Mailly Grand Cru NV Délice Demi-Sec  (Champagne)
"Earthy aromas are a hallmark of the Baga grape, a component of this full-bodied, tannic blend. With weight and richness, a mint note and new wood flavors, it is a serious wine that still should develop over three years.",92,Caves Aliança 2007 Quinta das Baceladas Red (Bairrada)
"Sound and clean, if a little one-dimensional, with cherry, raspberry and cola flavors. Has a nice silky texture, but the wine is unlikely to age, so drink soon.",86,Alysian 2009 Russian River Selection Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Sweet but not overdone, with attractive aromas of lychee, peach and rose water. Medium weight, with a fruity but somewhat thin finish. Drink now.",84,Two Oceans 2011 Moscato (Western Cape)
"Dark smoky, stout aromas of licorice, molasses and blackberry feed into a jammy palate with rock-hard, clamping tannins. Plum, blackberry and blueberry flavors are loud and intense, while this finishes with density, complexity, chewy tannins and a jammy essence. Drink through 2028.",92,Alidis 2011 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)
"Aromas of yellow peach, melon and fresh straw pave the path on the nose of this wine. The palate takes a surprising turn, with bright, zippy acidity and a bitter, pithy lime flavor that lingers through and lends a light texture to the finish. Drink now–2018.",87,Mulderbosch 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape)
"Monte Lodoletta Amarone is an exercise in extraction. The wine is absolutely black. Aromas are concentrated and intense and the wine is equally enormous in the mouth thanks to the extraction, oak, fruit and the hot climatic conditions associated with this vintage. Drink after 2020.",96,Dal Forno Romano 2003 Vigneto di Monte Lodoletta  (Amarone della Valpolicella)
"Farmed biodynamically, this wine has a pure fruit character, intense and mineral. It's on the sweet side, although the acidity allows good freshness into the mix. It needs to age, so drink from 2017.",91,Jean-Baptiste Adam 2013 Kaefferkopf Grand Cru Vieilles Vignes Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"The winery says this is their earliest-picked fruit, which explains why the wine is leaner and earthier than their other bottlings. You'll find mushroom and green herb notes alongside the raspberries and cherries. Whether or not this extends the wine's ageability is arguable, but it does make it less appealing than, say, their Sun or Sky bottlings, which are riper.",88,Hilliard Bruce 2011 Earth Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Aromas of green apple and citrus are as classic as it gets for Chilean Sauv Blanc. This is straight forward but enjoyable, with modest minerality. Flavors of citrus and gooseberry carry over onto a refreshing finish.",87,Ritual 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"Aromas of toast, scorched earth, espresso and grilled herb come together on this structured Barbaresco. The palate is still young and a bit shy but eventually reveals dark cherry, white pepper, sage and tobacco accompanied by packed tannins that need to unwind. A licorice note signals the close.",90,Paitin 2012 Sorì Paitin  (Barbaresco)
Lively aromas of brambly red fruit and spice are followed by plump raspberry flavors. It shows a lot of freshness and purity.,89,Angel Vine 2013 Primitivo (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This wine is brooding in black and red currant, with dusty, well-integrated tannins and a curl of smoke. Big bodied, it finishes in a puckering way, hefty on the palate.",89,Ballentine 2012 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A rustic nose gives way to a touch of clove and Asian spice, as full-bodied, robustly ripe baked plum and cherry generously provide flavor and power on the palate. The spiciness lingers on the finish.",87,Gracianna 2014 Estate Mercedes Riverblock Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Lots of leather and churned earth on the nose, and with time plum and tomato notes enter the party. It's a forward, aggressive Tempranillo with jumpy red-fruit flavors and a long, angular finish. Not really a wine for connoisseurs, but good for everyday consumption.",84,Valsanzo 2006 Damalisco  (Toro)
"Tiers of blackberry jam, plum, milk chocolate, anise and smoky cedar flavors mark this layered Cabernet. It shows the thrilling balance of the vineyard, with ripe fruit in tension with minerals, brisk acidity and wonderful mountain tannins. A splash of Merlot and Cabernet Franc add soft, cherried relief to Cabernet's hardness. Drink this wine now and over the next 15 years, as it gradually sheds its fruit.",94,Sequoia Grove 2009 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Stalky and tannic, this wine's structure is balanced by red berry-fruit flavors. It is smoky, typical of Cabernet Franc, giving a young character that should broaden out. Drink this fruity while structured wine now, or better from 2016.",86,Domaine les Pins 2013 Le Clos Cabernet Franc (Bourgueil)
"Smells strongly of lemongrass, and this character carries over onto the palate, which is flavored by lemon, pear and herbs. Feels a bit heavy in the mouth, but finishes clean and lemony.",83,La Villa Veneta 2001 Pinot Grigio (Veneto)
"This unpretentious wine has a light fragrance of blue flower and black berry, while the simple palate offers fleeting black cherry flavors.",86,TerrAmore 2013 Nero d'Avola (Terre Siciliane)
"A beautiful wine, this has fresh acidity, crisp fruits and zesty mineral texture. Apples, citrus and hints of apricots are all there along with an intense tangy character that bursts in the mouth. It's still so young and needs to age; drink from 2018 at the earliest. The Special Club is a group of growers who rate and taste each other's wines before release.",94,Pierre Gimonnet et Fils 2008 Special Club de Collection Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)
"A savory nose of seared beef crust gets lift from violet and lavender florals, and then the wine coats the palate very softly, with luscious flavors of stewed cherry, ripe cranberry and more herb-crusted roast. A licorice-aided acidity cleans the mouth on the finish.",93,Testarossa 2012 Fogstone Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Blackberry juice, licorice, grape seed and dried ginger show on the nose of this jammy, spicy blend of 31% Merlot, 23% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Cabernet Franc, 16% Petit Verdot and 9% Malbec. It's rich in dark fruits at first, then tightens on clean and wound-up tannins, with intense pepper and rounded caramel toward the finish.",91,Calcareous 2013 Lloyd of Calcareous Red (Paso Robles)
"The grape that is very local to the Dão region has produced a dense rich wine that is full of fruit. Black currants and berries shine through the firm texture and the solid tannins. The aftertaste has tangy minerality and plenty of acidity, both good for aging. Drink from 2019.",90,Quinta das Marias 2015 Alfrocheiro (Dão)
"A hint of lime and green pear peel, a touch of pepper and passion fruit: this subtle and light white does not give too much away. However its acidity and texture make it a versatile and satisfying food partner.",89,Höpler 2013 Grüner Veltliner (Burgenland)
"A rounded, ripe wine, this is packed with yellow fruits and touched with melon softness. It has toast as well as a mineral texture that give strong backing to the ripe fruitiness. This is likely to develop quickly, drink from 2019.",90,Jaffelin 2015 Passetemps Premier Cru  (Santenay)
"Very subtle but ultimately seductive wild cherry notes captivate on the nose, while the body is luscious, rounded, generous and inviting, without an ounce of fat. There are hints of clove and anise, a deep, mellow cherry core and haunting floral hints. Drink 2015–2020.",92,Fritsch 2011 'P' Pinot Noir (Wagram-Donauland)
"Apricot and peach aromas lead the way in this still-tight, mineral wine. Its richness is drawn up at this stage, showing crisp acidity as well as honey and pineapple flavors. It's likely to age well, so drink from 2019.",89,Clos Dady 2014  Sauternes
"A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and four other grapes, this toasty red will please anyone who likes a red wine with satiny, milk chocolate goodness. The fruit and mouth-coating barrel flavors are fine, though there is just a hint of a green edge to the tannins.",89,Dunham 2009 Trutina Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Enticing fragrances suggest alpine wild flower, stone fruit and savory herb. The linear palate is loaded with finesse and character, delivering creamy green apple, tangerine, mineral, white peach and mint. It's well balanced with bright acidity.",91,Abbazia di Novacella 2013 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige Valle Isarco)
"Sweet vanilla and toasted almond are backed by mature notes of berry fruit and exotic spice. The aromas are bold and penetrating but the wine falls short in the mouth because of its firm, bitter tannins.",87,Canalicchio di Sopra 2003  Brunello di Montalcino
"This has already past its sell-by date. The color is tan and maderized, while the nose is soft and mushy, with raisiny aromas. Like the nose, this is flabby and past its prime in the mouth, with a bland, bitter finish.",80,Bodegas Corellanas 2011 Viña Rubican Rosé (Navarra)
"Crisp and clean, with lemon-lime fruit, a bit of stone and just a hint of licorice. It’s simple and straightforward, though it lacks complexity and elegance. It falls off and gets a bit hard and tough in the finish.",84,Montaudon NV Brut  (Champagne)

The palate is more buoyant, with a rich, deep, black cherry-and-plum profile marked by reverberating acidity and layers of fine, velvety tannins.",87,Grafen Neipperg 2009 Schwaigerner Ruthe Lemberger (Württemberg)
"This wine is 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 25% Malbec. The aromas of plum and cherry are kissed with vanilla, coffee and spice. The palate is lush and full, with the tannins showing some grittiness. Still, it delivers a lot of appeal.",89,Board Track Racer 2014 The Vincent Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This wine seems broad across the palate, but not quite as deep as some Condrieus. The fruit is understated, resembling gently toasted marshmallow and maybe a touch of baked pineapple, rather than flamboyant apricot and spice. Plan on serving it with fish or chicken rather than something rich or extravagant.",90,Jean-Luc Colombo 2013 Amour de Dieu  (Condrieu)
"With great freshness, this is an attractive, fruity wine with final ripe berry flavors that are delicately leavened and given weight by tannins. There is already a drinkable balance from the fruit, although the wine needs more time to be in harmony. Drink from 2018.",91,Château d'Armailhac 2013  Pauillac
"This is a fine wine, with great structure and ripe fruit. Dark tannins, a tense mineral texture and blackberry tones are all there, giving a wine that's rich and full bodied. Drink from 2017.",91,Caves Aliança 2011 Aliança Reserva Red (Dão)
"Reduced, and cradled in big oak, this wine is spiky and savory, intense and tart, with a densely overripe notion of syrupy cherry and berry.",87,Nicholson Ranch 2014 Estate Pinot Noir (Sonoma Valley)
"So savory and easy to like, you might miss the complexity, but it's there. Offers flashy raspberry and cherry pie, red plum, pie spice and sandalwood flavors, packed into firm but gentle tannins, and brightened with crisp acidity. The finish is entirely dry despite all the sweet fruit. Really defines the modern coastal California style, even if there's no particular Marin County signature.",92,Bailiwick 2009 Borderline Pinot Noir (Marin County)
"Although you might encounter some initial sulfur, this wine later portrays yellow rose, peach, almond, cut grass and honey. It doesn't have huge flavor intensity but just enough to keep your attention.",86,Mario Schiopetto 2004 Tocai Friulano (Collio)
"Cola and soft red raspberry scents show on the nose of this blend of 58% Grenache, 25% Mourvèdre, 17% Syrah. It's easy-drinking and simple, with red fruit, white pepper and asphalt hints. A great, light, quaffable red for a warm day.",88,Demetria 2014 Cuvée Constantine Red (Santa Ynez Valley)
"This soft, high alcohol blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah is marked by extremely ripe flavors of blackberry jam and milk chocolate. It's technically dry but finishes with a touch of brown sugar. Drink now for voluptuous richness.",88,Clos Solène 2010 Harmonie G-S-M (Paso Robles)
"Aromas of ripe, dark-skinned berry and crushed violet emerge from this vibrant blend of 60% Syrah, 20% Merlot and 20% Sangiovese. The  savory palate doles out black cherries and black currants accented with notes of toast and ground pepper. It's already accessible and made to be enjoyed young.",88,I Giusti e Zanza 2014 Nemorino Red (Toscana)
"This appealing blend of Merlot (69%), Cabernet Sauvignon (28%) and Petit Verdot conveys dark roasted coffee along with red and black fruit with barrel accents. Abundant vanilla and coffee flavors partner with grippy tannins that need more time in the bottle to settle in.",89,Mark Ryan 2012 Numbskull BDX Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Notes of pressed apple and burnt sugar on the nose and palate of this sparkler made entirely of Seyval Blanc grapes are reminiscent of a dry, French apple cider. Juicy and full bodied with a stout frame and frothy, medium-sized bubbles.",84,Clinton NV Jubilee Sparkling (Hudson River Region)
"It's a proper Pinot Noir in the silky texture and cherry and cola flavors, which finish smooth and dry. Other than that, it's rustic and heavy.",85,J. Lohr 2010 Falcon's Perch Pinot Noir (Monterey County)
"Fig, black plum, dried cherry and chai spice show on the nose of this bottling from River Road south of Salinas. Heavy flavors of dried black cherry and dried cranberry show on the sip, lifted by eucalyptus oil, juniper and black-tea elements.",88,Pessagno 2013 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"There's a reason PG has become so popular in America, and this new one from Napa-based Benessere shows why. It's as dry and bright in acidity as a fine Sauvignon Blanc, yet with the rich fruit American wine drinkers love. Those flavors range from peaches and nectarines to Meyer lemons and pineapples, with honeysuckle and spice nuances.",90,Benessere 2006 Pinot Grigio (Napa Valley)
"From estate-grown grapes, this is a fulsome, generously expansive wine, rich in honeyed vanilla, caramel and toffee, and intense in oak. Peach and hazelnut figure into the mix, as does a taste of nutmeg, making for a warm, lengthy finish.",87,Chalk Hill 2013 Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Chalk Hill)
"With some good maturity, this is a rich, fruity Champagne. It comes from the southern Aube region, which endows a more tropical feel, bringing out melon and apricot fruit flavors as well as crisper citrus. A great apéritif style, it will also go with food.",89,Drappier NV Carte d'Or Brut  (Champagne)
"This intensely fruity, floral nectar hits the palate with electric force, catapulting vibrant acidity against sweet, tangy flavors of tangerine, peach and honey. A favorite amidst an excellent showing of 2014 Mosel spätlese, it's delicious now, but should continue to evolve well through at least 2020.",95,Dr. Loosen 2014 Ürziger Würzgarten Spätlese Riesling (Mosel)
"Hot pink in color, this wine offers aromas of bubblegum and cherry. It drinks dry with a stretched-out finish.",86,Murray 2016 Rosé (Red Mountain)
"The Taylors Pass Vineyard continues to shine brightly for both Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir. This Sauvignon features intense tropical fruit with just a touch of green. It's round and mouthfilling, with a long, lime-and-mineral finish. Drink now.",90,Villa Maria 2007 Taylors Pass Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Cedar, graphite, marzipan, black plum and blackberry aromas ooze power and ripeness. This is concentrated and dark in style, with oaky blackberry and cassis flavors. Spice, vanilla, raisin, cassis and chocolate flavors reflect maximum ripeness, while the finish is dense, layered and potent. Drink this hefty, extracted Malbec through 2020.",91,Lamadrid 2012 Single Vineyard Gran Reserva Malbec (Agrelo)
"This excellent entry-level Pinot is bursting with a delightful bouquet of cherries and white chocolate. It's crisp and direct, with well-defined raspberry fruit at the core. The finish is a little stiff and tight, but unpacks well with ample aeration.",91,Adelsheim 2013 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This is a hard-edged wine, a typical trait of young Pommard. It has a firm, dry and tannic character, and the ripe, generous fruit sits underneath. Wait for at least five years for this wine to be ready.",89,Domaine A. Machard de Gramont 2010 Clos Blanc Premier Cru  (Pommard)
"This is an absolutely stunning wine, thick and dense with an array of candied fruits, caramel, marmalade, butterscotch and more. With 189g/L of residual sugar, a little sip or two will go a long way.",94,Styring 2013 Afterglow Estate Dessert Riesling (Ribbon Ridge)

"A rich and smoky Viognier, this opens with aromas of grilled yellow peach, melon and orange oil. The palate offers flavors of toasted brioche and almond to complement the ripe fruit core. Drink now.",88,Bon Cap 2010 Made with Organically Grown Grapes Viognier (Eilandia)
"This is a fuller and creamier rendition of Pinot Grigio with pretty aromas of honey, peach blossom and melon that give the wine a fragrant aromatic lift. It leaves a lean but smooth impression in the mouth and ends with bright citrus flavors. Imported by MW Imports.",87,Eugenio Collavini 2007 Villa Canlungo Pinot Grigio (Collio)
"Barolo Vigna Merenda opens with a bright bouquet composed of cherry, spice, floral and balsam elements. This is also an extremely mineral-driven wine that exposes a vein of graphite or crushed stone at its core. Thanks to the wine's natural structure and long persistency, it would make a perfect pairing partner to any dish with black truffles.",91,Scarzello 2006 Vigna Merenda  (Barolo)
"A perfumed Moscatel, it features spice, honeyed fruitiness and a strong spirit character. When it was bottled, it had just begun to exhibit the old-wood aging flavors and resulting acidity.it offers a delicious orange-peel aftertaste.",91,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal 2002 Colheita  (Moscatel de Setúbal)
"Softly layered with blue fruit and clove, this bold, full-bodied wine is densely concentrated with ripe tannins. Dusty cocoa powder and a gravelly minerality show through its richness.",88,Provenance Vineyards 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)

"With ripe, jammy blackberry and plum flavors, gently touched with smoky oak, this is a nice Cab for drinking now. Smooth and silky, the tannins will work well against grilled beef.",86,Aquinas 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"There is an attractive yeasty character to this fresh wine. Apples and a touch of toast mingle easily on the wine that has some bottle age. It's both crisp and rich, a very satisfying combination.",90,H. Blin NV Premium  (Champagne)
"Power and concentration mark this Syrah. It's explosive in cherry, raspberry, bacon, mocha, pepper, mineral and new oak flavors that are frankly delicious, and the mouthfeel is pure silk. Could be a bit firmer and more structured, but it sure is a good red wine to drink now.",88,Wrath 2008 Doctor's Vineyard Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"This is an enormous Cabernet, as packed with intensity and power as anything in Napa Valley. The vineyard is Von Strasser's highest on the mountain, which maximally exposes it to the sun, and you can taste the solar ripeness in the intense essence of black currants and dark chocolate. The tannins exhibit classic Diamond Mountain potency. This is a dense Cabernet that needs serious time in the cellar. Hold until 2019, and it will continue to develop for many years afterward.",95,Von Strasser 2010 Sori Bricco Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)
"A luscious nose of chocolate-covered cherries and black pepper start this delicious Kostifali from one of Crete's wine champions. On the palate, ample flavors of black cherry, cocoa and soft spices give the wine equal parts heft and finesse. This wine has more aging life in it but is excellent now.",92,Lyrarakis 2014 Kotsifali (Crete)
"As the name Sasyr suggests, this wine represents a successful blend of Sangiovese (60%) and Syrah that is sensual, spicy, savory and perfect for hearty meat dishes.

"Purity and concentration are the hallmarks here, with the forward, instantly delicious character of the 2012 vintage. This has the intense purity of summer fruit, lightly spicy and perfectly balanced.",92,Goodfellow 2012 Durant Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"With its roundness, this wine shows the character of the Loureiro grape. Giving a tweak to the softer element is a burst of fine acidity, a lime juice note and a fresh aftertaste.",84,Viniverde 2011 Estreia Grande Escolha Loureiro (Vinho Verde)
"The nose on this bottling is very smoky and flinty, but also shows underlying pear and apple aromas. There's an intriguing lime-zest character to the palate, with a base of dried apples and a smoked-wood character that's hard to ignore.",87,Cameron Hughes 2014 Lot 526 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County)
"A blend of Merlot (58%), Syrah (35%), Petite Sirah (5%) and Primitivo, this hedonistic wine offers appealing suggestions of coffee, vanilla and cherry. Ripe, silky soft milk chocolate flavors finish warm.",90,Ryan Patrick 2012 Rock Island Red (Wahluke Slope)
"A very light straw in color, this bottling by winemaker Tara Gomez shows freshly cut brown pear, delicate citrus and fresh apple blossom aromas on an inviting, tightly hewn nose.

Rita Hills)
A delightfully easy-drinking Petite Sirah with cherry fruit and licorice overriding a subtle note of tobacco. Drink now.,87,Line 39 2010 Petite Sirah (North Coast)
"Herbs and toast play off the standard fare of blackberries and plums, creating a good whole. It's full, deep, and long—a thoroughbred. Another of those wines that everyone with a taste for California Cabernet should like. Charming and high in quality, if not necessarily ultracomplex.",92,Liparita 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Creamy textured wine, soft and ripe. It has attractive pure acidity that lies lightly on the palate, blended well with riper red apple, pear and just crisp acidity. Ready to drink in six months. Screwcap.",86,Winzer Krems 2012 Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)

"This bright wine has aromas that suggest citrus blossom and tropical fruit. The lively, slender palate shows crunchy Granny Smith apple and pineapple accompanied by brisk acidity.",86,Dorigo 2014 Pinot Grigio (Friuli Colli Orientali)
"Fruity, ripe and yummy, this wine offers aromas that are spicy and slightly oaky from 14 months in mostly American barrels. The flavors are packed with ripe cherry and blackberry.

"Off-dry and slightly sugary, this fruity, candied sipper mixes orange blossom, orange candy and baby aspirin flavors into a concentrated midpalate. Moscato is on fire these days, and this wine will surely please those who love the style.",87,14 Hands 2012 Moscato (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This wine lives up to its name in the pure, perfumed flavors that are an enticement for sipping. An edge of tannin and lemon zest liven the wine even more. The tight, bright acidity at the end is mouthwatering.",88,Mirabeau 2015 Pure Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Broadly fruity at first, this turns a little loose-knit, like a Grateful Dead jam. It's compelling but not terribly tight; it meanders into leaf and tea, then chocolate, then back to the light and pretty red fruits.",91,McCrea Cellars 2006 Cuvée Orleans Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"This is a tasty and interesting medium-bodied wine made from Merlot, Cabernet Franc and a touch of the white grape Viognier. It doesn't overpower with ripeness or tannins, but has a smoky, spicy aroma, meaty flavors and a lively, slightly gripping texture.",88,Rivino 2012 Estate Sedulous Red (Mendocino)
"Aromas of berry and cassis come with a shot of raw oak. This is grabby and puts on the clamps, but spicy, peppery flavors of olive, berry and oak are very good in front of a hard, moderately tannic finish.",88,Calcu 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"Barrel fermented, with deep fruit flavors of orange concentrate, Meyer lemon, candied pineapple and pear. A smorgasbord of fruit, nicely set against light caramel and toast from the barrels. Could not be more delicious, in a drink-now style.",90,Mythology 2009 Chardonnay (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Aromas of vanilla, cherry and cola start this impressive Cabernet Franc from Cooper. On the palate, pepper, cherry and spice is balanced and assertive. A lingering finish of cedar and plum adds to the appeal.",85,Cooper Vineyards 2007 Cabernet Franc (Virginia)

Full bodied and concentrated, it remains approachable and an ideal companion to meaty fare.",93,Rock Wall 2013 Monte Rosso Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
"Complex aromas and flavors of blackberries, leather, roasted meat and coffee show plenty of class, and this wine appears to firm up in the glass, offering more structure than its initial suppleness and amplitude suggest. It may close up for a few years, so try it now, or hold and try it after 2012.",89,Shaw and Smith 2005 Shiraz (Adelaide Hills)
"A good Cabernet, this is dry and tannic, with blackberry, currant, dried herb and oak flavors. It has a certain elegance of tannic structure, and finishes deliciously long and spicy. The grapes come from Napa Valley and Alexander Valley.",89,Punch 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"On the Washington side of the Columbia Gorge, the Celilo Vineyard is an exceptional site for Chardonnay. This was sourced from the 1983 planting, and the relatively old vines and cool vintage deliver a wine with excellent minerality, lift, drive and focus. The fruit is tangy and yellow/green, but perfectly ripe; the acid underpinning is fresh and lively. This has every chance of cellaring until 2024 or later.",88,Ken Wright 2011 Celilo Chardonnay (Washington)
"Aromas suggesting smoke, dark cooking spice and mature black-skinned fruit emerge on this bracing, robust red. The firmly structured, one-dimensional palate displays evident oak, coconut, espresso, raisin and a hint of tobacco alongside forceful tannins that leave a firm somewhat grainy finish.",88,Monteci 2011  Amarone della Valpolicella
"This big, full-bodied wine is unabashedly bold and brassy, from the aromas of toasted oak to the buttery flavors and vanilla finish. While dry, it has a rich texture and the near-sweetness of ripe varietal flavors.",88,Black's Station 2015 Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Dunnigan Hills)

"In really warm years like 2006, wines from the cool Saar valley often excel.

"This is a soft, gentle wine, with hints of peaches and apricots and a tangy aftertaste.",83,Patriarche Père et Fils 2016 Viognier (Vin de France)
"Tasted in September ‘07, this Cab was pretty high in tannins, giving it a tough astringency some folks won't like. But the wine is clean and complex, with blackberry, tobacco and sage flavors. It's the opposite of a cult Cabernet, which is to say it's more like a traditional dry Bordeaux than something out of Napa.",87,Hawkstone 2005 Barney's Heritage Cuvee Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This refined sparkling wine has a classic Franciacorta fragrance of candied fruit, almond and just a whiff of vanilla. The palate delivers ripe peach and nut flavors andd a hint of bread crust. Fine perlage and a crisp, quenching finish.",90,Ferghettina 2006 Extra Brut Sparkling (Franciacorta)
"There almost is the slightest touch of lovely Poire William spirit on the nose. This is a lovely pear-scented, dry wine of immense fruitfulness. A homely earthiness counteracts this and makes for a concentrated, medium-dry but mellow palate. The finish is off dry, lasting and mouthfilling. There is something immensely satisfying about this.",92,Domaines Schlumberger 2012 Spiegel Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Earthy, dry aromas of plum and cherry come with notes of vanilla, herbs, tobacco and leather. This feels fresh, acidic and generally well balanced. Flavors of spiced plum and berry are riper than many 2008s from Rioja, while a finish with tobacco and leathery flavors is solid and fairly long. Drink through 2020.",90,Marqués de Murrieta 2008 Finca Ygay Reserva  (Rioja)
"This 100% varietal wine has aromas of vanilla, milk chocolate and dark fruit along with light oxidative notes. It's fully flavored with coffee and dark cherry notes backed by gritty tannins.",86,Henry Earl 2012 Malbec (Red Mountain)
"Dusty, yeasty citrus aromas show some grit and harshness. The palate is chiseled and acidic, with tart flavors of orange, lime and green herbs. Fresh and highly quaffable, this is the kind of wine to drink with shrimp salad or raw oysters.",87,Peñalolen 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"This lovely expression of Arneis has an enticing floral and fruit fragrance. The palate is medium-bodied and fresh, with creamy green-apple and exotic fruit sensations. This is perfect with insalata Caprese or fish dishes.",89,Montaribaldi 2012 Capural  (Roero)
"Dense black cherry and blueberry fruit lead into a candied-grape element on the nose of this wine that also offers maple syrup, vanilla and lilac touches. The blend of 60% Malbec, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Syrah is fruity on the sip, with kirsch and crème de cassis flavors held up by strong tannins and acidity.",89,Dubost 2010 Gran Reserva Red (Paso Robles)
"Even though this is a dry wine, it has such richness that it almost tastes sweet. The balance comes from the hint of acidity and the intense spice and pepper flavors. It's ready to drink, yet could age for another year.",89,Domaine Sipp-Mack 2009 Tradition Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Made from equal parts Greco and Fiano, Campanaro is Feudi's flagship white wine and exhibits fleshy tones of mature peach, honey and pear. Thanks to its crisp acidity, it would make an idea companion to cheesy pasta dishes. A wonderful wine overall.",91,Feudi di San Gregorio 2006 Campanaro White (Campania)
"Dusty gravel and chalky rock mark the texture and nose of this 100% varietal wine, a sense of minerality that's uniquely its own. Currant, cranberry and an herbaceous streak define the midpalate, flavors that ride a lightly bodied, silky-smooth wave of nuance and elegance.",94,Jarvis 2011 Estate Grown Cave Fermented Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Crisp, very light and fruity, this is an attractive, ready-to-drink wine. A touch of acidity at the end gives freshness.",86,Les Héritiers du Comte Lafon 2012  Mâcon-Milly Lamartine
"This is a wine that is almost mature. With generous black fruits and tannins that are integrated into the texture, the wine is ripe and fruity. The acidity is still there, giving a crisp aftertaste. Drink now.",86,Château Laubès 2010  Bordeaux
"Dry, racy and elegant, a food-friendly Chardonnay to pair with shellfish in cream sauce, salmon, or a fine roasted chicken. Clean, vibrant acidity highlights citrus, white peach and nectarine flavors, with a rich coating of smoky oak. Drink now through 2015.",92,Stonestreet 2009 Broken Road Chardonnay (Alexander Valley)
"This off-dry Riesling boasts pretty fresh apple and floral notes on the palate, but persisting notes of dried herbs and spring ramps distract. Sprightly on the palate with delicate lemon acidity.",83,Four Degrees of Riesling 2012 1st Degree Medium Dry Riesling (Seneca Lake)
"Sweetly ripe and oaky, with pineapple jam, kiwi, pear and green apple, and notes of vanilla, buttered popcorn and cream. Defines the fruit-forward, buttery style of Chardonnay in a soft, forward way.",86,Paradise Ridge 2008 Sapphire Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This wine from longtime Santa Cruz Mountains producer Cinnabar offers a very subtle nose with slight, brisk minerality. Once sipped, the flavors remain subtle, though are nicely rounded with a bit of guava-based tropicalitythat emerges toward the finish.",86,Cinnabar 2012 Central Avenue Vineyard Chardonnay (Monterey)
"This opens with aromas of French oak, toast, menthol and coconut while the lean palate offers mint and a hint of dark spice. It lacks fruit richness while bracing tannins grip the finish.",86,Raineri Gianmatteo 2012  Barolo
"Here's a very correct and clean Sangiovese with bright cherry nuances and blueberry followed by a touch of bitter almond. The mouthfeel is thin, easy and watery.",84,Poderi dal Nespoli 1929 2011 Prugneto  (Sangiovese di Romagna Superiore)
"Dark and fruity, this juicy wine is packed with black cherry and highlighted with tobacco and coffee. The tannins are substantial, and hint at clean earth. It's big and full through the middle, but tails off a bit in the finish.",92,WillaKenzie Estate 2014 Terres Basses Pinot Noir
"Here's a good example of what's so disturbing about the rash of expensive Cabernets and blends that has possessed the minds of consumers. This is an awkward, cumbersome wine. Sure, the fruit is as ripe as anything on earth, but what good is extract if it doesn't have balance? The wine is excessively soft. It's cloying, and to add insult to injury, it's tannic. There are wines that cost one-fifth the price that are far better.",86,Allora 1999 Tresca Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Blue flower, exotic spice and dark berry aromas take shape on this full-bodied glossy red. The structured enveloping palate offers dried morello cherry, raspberry, star anise and pipe tobacco alongside compact fine-grained tannins. It already has so much to offer but will be even better in a few years. Drink 2019–2029.",90,Feudi di San Gregorio 2012  Taurasi
"Ripe and full of fruit, this is developing into a black-currant-flavored wine with a good balance of tannins. It has a smoky background from wood aging, giving the wine extra complexity. Drink from 2019.",88,Château Lauduc 2015 Tradition  (Bordeaux Supérieur)
"Inspired by the Italian word for pearl, La Perlara is a delicious dessert wine that boasts a luminous golden color and intense aromas of honey, almond, apricot and sweet yellow rose. There's also a touch of piquant spice at the end that sets it apart, and the mouthfeel is indeed as smooth and silky as a pearl.",94,Ca' Rugate 2007 La Perlara  (Recioto di Soave)
"Clean and fresh, this juicy wine carries a bit of fruit sweetness, but the flavors are tilted toward minerality rather than fruitiness. It's wonderfully refreshing, with a mix of citrus rind, melon and white peach working into an extended, palate-cleansing finish.",90,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2013 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The bouquet smells like spiked fruit cocktail, and in the long run what's wrong with that? The palate is open and fairly easy, with a touch of kick pushing citrus, tropical fruit and even some mineral notes. A more citrusy and fresh style of Viognier, with 15% Chardonnay.",87,Estampa 2006 Viognier Chardonnay White (Colchagua Valley)
"From one of a group of chateaus owned by the Sumeire family, Coussin's second wine is tangy, textured and with lively acidity. The texture is as important as the fruit, giving a mineral edge to the acidity. The red fruits finish with an attractive lift.",86,Château Coussin 2014 La Croix du Prieur Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Made in the popular style, this features flavors of Meyer lemon, orange, grass, vanilla and white pepper. Although it's sugary-tasting, it's brightened by acidity. Nice to drink with slightly sweet Asian fare or popcorn shrimp.",85,Donovan-Parke 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (California)
"Spice frames the bone-dry red fruit, which carries a sharp, astringent flavor profile into a rather short, tight finish. More cellar time might help to open this up further.",86,Siduri 2012 Hawk's View Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Gavin Chanin has managed to make an Old World-styled wine with this bottling. More delicate than its boisterous Central Coast neighbors, it has an elegance that will appeal to Burgundy nuts. Pepper, pomegranate, cranberry and olive aromas lead into an extremely light palate of candied raspberry, red plum and uncrushed peppercorn flavors.",92,Chanin 2015 Duvarita Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
"Deep garnet in the glass, this has a nose of blackberry and vanilla. Flavors of blackberry, eucalyptus, tart cherry and white chocolate are well balanced, with a mix of fruity and savory notes. Tannins are mostly smooth with a touch of grip. The finish combines a pleasing blend of eucalyptus and tart cherry flavors.",90,Barkan 2011 Special Reserve Winemakers' Choice Shiraz (Galilee)
"Dark blackberry, blueberry and blackcurrant fruits make for a ripe but extremely enticing nose on this bottling, lifted by aromas of vanilla, cola, clove and anise. The palate is delicious and rich with black cherry, but a zesty, bright acidity and chalky tannins contribute depth and length, with a touch of dill.",94,Brecon Estate 2014 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Tasty and wonderfully drinkable. The basic flavors are cola and soy, with extra nuances of blackberries, cherries and quite a bit of smoky, sweet oak. Drinks very dry and spicy.",87,Savannah-Chanelle 2000 Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Aromas of herbs, tar and plum lead to sweet, plush blue fruit flavors. It's not a particularly serious wine but brings plenty of appeal.",87,Boomtown 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
A fully rich yet integrated Chardonnay that offers great value and clean flavors of golden apple and yellow fig and plenty of crisp acidity on the finish.,88,Concannon 2010 Conservancy Chardonnay (Livermore Valley)
"Krug prefers to call this wine multivintage rather than nonvintage, but that doesn’t change what it is. Deep yeast, butter and cider aromas lead into full caramel and apple flavors on the weighty palate; it turns a bit sweet-tart on the finish. Perhaps made with juice from some weaker vintages of the early 1990s, it’s nonetheless very good.",88,Krug NV Grande Cuvée Brut  (Champagne)
"Ripe, slightly sunbaked aromas of berry fruits, plum and raisin include notes of vanilla and oak grain. A medium-bodied palate is agile, fresh and juicy. Oak-aided flavors of coffee, mocha and chocolate accent plum and berry fruit. Despite a drawing, dense finish, this high-elevation Garnacha remains upright in stature. Drink through 2023.",90,Viñas del Vero 2011 Secastilla Garnacha (Somontano)
"This bright Vernaccia layers pretty tones of citrus, pear and cut grass over a lean texture and medium body. This is a good choice to pair with seafood or light salads.",87,Rampa di Fugnano 2011 Alata  (Vernaccia di San Gimignano)
"A selection of Touriga Nacional, this was foot-trodden in open lagars. That gives a richness and smooth density to this stylish wine, adding to its concentration and powerful black fruits. It is solid with tannins that needs to age further. Drink from 2020.",93,Quinta das Carvalhas 2014 Carvalhas Touriga Nacional (Douro)
"Headlining a most impressive debut lineup from this new boutique is this two-barrel reserve. Sourced from the Two Blondes (Andrew Will) vineyard, it's a thick and dense and delicious wine, packed with black cherry, chocolate and espresso. It belongs in the top ranks of all Washington Cab Francs. Yes, the alcohol is up there, but the smooth power of this wine more than justifies it.",94,Pearl and Stone 2015 Reserve Cabernet Franc (Yakima Valley)
"This blend of Chenin Blanc and Chardonnay is immediately attractive. With its balanced acidity and lightly crisp texture, it finishes with a lively sliced apple flavor. Drink now.",85,Bouvet-Ladubay NV Signature Brut Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay (Vin Mousseux)
"This wine is lean and austere, with extracted tannins that have left no sense of fruit. It will remain hard, although it will be less dry from 2018.",84,Château d'Hanteillan 2012  Haut-Médoc
"Notions of baked Mirabelle plums lend their full-fruited aspect to nose and palate. Their softness is countered by fresh, lively crispness. This is friendly, refreshing and fruit-driven.",88,Domaine Zinck 2014 Portrait Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
"An estate-grown 81% Merlot (the rest Cabernet Sauvignon), this wine takes time to come around in the glass, the alcohol overpowering the fruit at first. But in time, the red fruit and soft tannins mellow and make themselves known and this mostly-Merlot becomes a savory, food-friendly quaff.",86,Albertina 2009 Lorilai's Reserve-Zmarzly Family Vineyards Merlot (Mendocino)
"Very primary aromas of lime zest and mineral are followed by lightly spritzy, just a hair off-dry citrus flavors backed by bright, tart acidity.",89,Sleight of Hand 2015 The Magician Evergreen Vineyard Riesling (Ancient Lakes)
"The first of the Girl Next Door wines is well done. It features a sexy, pin-up style label and good Chardonnay juice, barrel-fermented and generous. Peach and citrus fruits, with supporting acids and moderate oak flavors of buttery caramel.",88,Alexandria Nicole 2006 The Girl Next Door ‘Roll in the Hay' Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Spicy, herbal and toasty on the nose, but the palate fails to meet the promise of the aromas. It's acidic and sharp at its center, with grabby tannins along with regular plum and boysenberry flavors. A big-bodied red with rough tannins and outsized acidity.",84,San Pedro 2007 Castillo de Molina Reserva Carmenère (Maule Valley)
"Here's an inky black and densely concentrated Cabernet Sauvignon that would pair with grilled sausage or barbecued steak. The wine is soft, round and slightly sweet on the finish.",87,Feudi del Pisciotto 2008 Missoni Cabernet Sauvignon (Sicilia)
"Aromas of citrus, orchard fruit and crushed stone slowly take shape on this elegant white. On the vibrant, linear palate, a mineral vein and a smoky note add depth to crisp green apple, peach and tangerine. Racy acidity leads to a crisp, clean finish. Hold a few years to let this fully develop. Drink 2028–2024.",91,Villa Raiano 2014 Contrada Marotta  (Greco di Tufo)
"Although this is stalky and gritty-smelling up front, plum and berry aromas settle after airing. A solid mouthfeel with mild tannins is welcome, while flavors of lightly baked boysenberry are earthy and come with a note of cocoa. A plump finish offers a mix of milk-chocolate flavor and dry tannins.",89,Pagos del Galir 2011 Mencía (Valdeorras)
"While this wine has high acidity, it also offers attractive fruitiness. It is light and bright, with a layer of spice and pepper. Drink the wine now.",85,Château d'Haurets 2016 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
"Seductive perfume suggest fronds of jasmine, ivy, mandarin and perhaps an edge of pink grapefruit. The playfulness of this citrus feast fizzes away and excites both nose and palate. It has all the effortlessness that comes with years of practice.",94,Josef Jamek 2014 Jochinger Pichl Federspiel Riesling (Wachau)
"This Zin is actually a field blend including Petite Sirah, Alicante and Carignane. It's sweet with raspberry jam notes, but also a bit vegetal with flavors of asparagus.",81,Beltane Ranch 2012 Estate Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley)
"Made from organically grown grapes, this bright wine offers sensations of peach blossom, green apple and white peach accented with hints of white pepper. Fresh acidity gives it a crisp finish while a saline note signals the close.",87,Di Giovanna 2013 Grillo (Terre Siciliane)
"One of the most exciting names in Barolo, with fruit from one of the most celebrated vineyard crus, this vintage of Cannubi Boschis is a real treasure. Cellar the wine 10 years or more to achieve balance between its firm tannins and bright acidity. The wine already shows incredibly complex aromas of wild berry fruit, truffle and cola and those tones will surely become more elegant with time.",95,Luciano Sandrone 2005 Cannubi Boschis  (Barolo)
"Produced on clay and chalk soil, this wine is soft, with a plump texture that is ripe but has refreshing fruitiness. Very aromatic and with a rounded apple flavor, it is ready to drink.",89,Domaine Jean Teiller 2014  Menetou-Salon
"Aromas of coffee, fig, dried fruit and soy sauce are concentrated on the nose. Earthy flavors on the palate are elevated by these aromas, with a hint of Rooibos tea that gives it lift and intrigue. The tannins are silky and the finish is long with evolving flavors.",87,The Williamsburg Winery 2014 Four Barrel Cuvée Red (Virginia)
"From the Prail region of Alto Adige, this stunning, intense Sauvignon is full of grassy, herbaceous flavors. It is still young, needing time to lose its grapefruit character and ripen into a fine, aromatic wine.",89,Produttori Colterenzio 2002 Praedium Sauvignon Blanc (Alto Adige)
"Fruity, with delicious apricot flavors and some weight from aging on the lees, this is a ripe, full-bodied Sauvignon Blanc. It is full of boundless fruit and fresh acidity and finishes rich but crisp.",87,Domaine Gibault 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Touraine)
"Made from fruit that's sourced from the northern Côte Chalonnaise, this structured wine shows crisp acids and bright yellow fruits, with a sense of richness that comes from the vanilla and apricot flavors. The finish is laced with refreshing acidity.",89,Olivier Leflaive 2010 Vauvry Premier Cru  (Rully)
"This powerful blend of Petite Sirah, Petit Verdot, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc is smoky with oak and thickly concentrated on the palate, with sweet blueberry fruit and dark chocolate flavors. Round and rich, it has moderate acidity.",87,Triumph 2015 Premium Red (Sonoma County)
"Coming from a warm region in a hot vintage, this wine leans into the tropical with aromas of kiwi and mango, with herb and citrus notes providing accents. The flavors are lean and tart, with the concentration light.",86,Mercer 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Beautifully poised, this wine strikes a balance between crisp lemon-curd acidity and intense honey and botrytis. Along with its nutmeg and marmalade flavors, it has the potential to be a powerful, wine. Drink from 2024.",95,Château Rabaud-Promis 2014  Sauternes
"Crisp and with good acidity, this is a light, fruity and forward wine. Lively, balanced and with plenty of taut fruitiness at the end, it is very ready to drink.",87,Trocard 2016  Bordeaux Blanc
"A very interesting wine, this is reserved but complex, not overtly fruity or buttery, but more intriguing than that. It smells lightly like lemon zest and hazelnuts, and tastes quietly concentrated, like peach skin and almonds.",89,Apriori 2014 Chardonnay (Mendocino)
"The wine has tannins and a stalky black-cherry character. With a firm texture and balanced acidity, the wine is developing although it is not yet ready to drink. Wait until 2017.",87,L. Tramier & Fils 2015 Collection  (Juliénas)
"The finish is dry and toughly tannic on this elegant Syrah. With smoked meat, black cherry, blueberry, pepper and salt flavors, it's a chewy wine, full-bodied and complex, brightened with fine acidity. Seems best in its youth for freshness.",90,Laetitia 2009 Estate Syrah (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"Grilled-toast notes swirl around the bouquet of this cassis-scented wine. Leafy elements add complexity without being green, while a lifted cherry element brings vibrancy to the mix. This firm, structured wine features a long, mouthwatering finish that bodes well for cellaring. Try it after 2020.",92,Wakefield 2013 St Andrews Single Vineyard Release Cabernet Sauvignon (Clare Valley)
"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (56%), Merlot (33%) and Cabernet Franc. Aromas of milk chocolate, cherry, herb and moist earth give way to soft supple palate-coating fruit and barrel flavors. It shows a lot of elegance and refinement.",91,Saviah 2014 Une Vallée Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Blackberry-laced chocolate syrup, black cherry extract, freshly tanned leather and sweet tobacco leaf join forces to power a remarkable wine from this winery near San Miguel, where the owning family first planted vines in 1997. The palate shows black olives, leather, tobacco, clove, black cardamom and dried black cherries, all held together by solid tannic grip.",93,Pianetta 2012 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)
"This feels a bit stripped, though the bottle says the alcohol hits almost 15%. There is a chocolaty coating over sharp, herbal, rather thin fruit flavors. The wine shows pleasant strawberry and watermelon fruit flavors, though the tannins and chocolaty barrel flavors quickly take over.",86,Gamache 2006 Estate Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Pure Pinot Noir from the south of Beaujolais, this is soft, fruity and with attractive acidity. Red fruits and a crisp acidity give this wine its bright character. Ready to drink now.",86,Louis Latour 2015 Les Pierres Dorées  (Coteaux Bourguignons)
"This has 10% Monastrell in the mix, and it is a sublime example of what flavors of baked raspberry compote, cranberry and black licorice can do when allowed to mingle together in liquid form. Medium in body, this has a lot of earthiness. It would make a fine alternative to more expensive Pinots.",91,Bokisch 2010 Terra Alta Vineyard Garnacha (Clements Hills)
"With its name going back to 16th-century stag hunting by King Francis I, this chateau offers a perfumed, deliciously ripe wine that is light and poised at the same time. An herbal touch partners with the red fruits for extra freshness.",88,Château Pas du Cerf 2015 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This is a lively and structured blend that integrates Tannat with Merlot and Petit Verdot. With 11 months in French oak, toasted coffee and tobacco notes ride over ripe cherry, plum and currant aromas. The tannins are sandy on the palate, giving ample structure to a dark fruit-driven wine. Freshly crushed black pepper lingers on the finish.",88,Fabbioli Cellars 2012 Tre Sorélle Red (Virginia)
"A bright, light and fruity wine that is ready to drink. It has flavors of currants, juicy orange as well as a mineral texture and a touch of bitter marmalade. Drink now.",86,Château de la Roulerie 2013 Le P'tit Chenin Chenin Blanc (Anjou)
"A clean nose of citrus paves the way for flavors of grapefruit and Sevilla orange. This wine is soft and pleasing on the palate, but it may be touch tart for some tastes.",85,Carmel 2014 Admon Vineyard Chardonnay (Galilee)
"Earthy cherry and wild strawberry notes form the core of this deep, concentrated and yet not overly dense wine. Herbal and teasingly tart as it shifts from midpalate to finish, it offers a last splash of nutmeg on the finale.",92,Gloria Ferrer 2012 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"Creamy notes pear crumble make for a most attractive nose. The palate follows with gentle softness and concentration, supported by bright, fresh acidity. The creamy notes continue alongside notes of green and red apple and fresh pear. There is a lot of substance and body, so have this alongside a meal, the finish is superclean.",89,Gebeshuber 2015 Lage Modler Zierfandler (Thermenregion)
"Worldwide still the biggest-selling Champagne (28 million bottles a year), this well-made wine is ripe and full of fruit. Produced under the direction of chef de cave Benoît Gouez (Wine Enthusiast Winemaker of Year in 2013), it has flavors of almonds and toast, with crisp acidity. The aftertaste brings grapefruit freshness.",89,Moët & Chandon NV Impérial Brut  (Champagne)
"Pretty scents of rosewater, raspberries and cherries introduce this light and pleasing wine. It carries some of the charm of a good strawberry soda, with forward fruit and a delicate frame. That said, it is not just a simple fruity wine, and gains weight and complexity as it breathes. Give it time to show you all it has.",91,Scott Paul 2012 La Paulée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Roasted and brambly on the nose, with lemon, burnt notes and spice more than bold berry fruit. The palate has a tight, rubbery feel and flavors of hickory, clove and mild red berry. A decent but standard and slightly oaky Malbec.",85,Coiron 2010 Malbec (Mendoza)
"This Cabernet shows its Spring Mountain terroir in the big-time tannins and concentration of black currant fruit. It's almost a wine-reduction sauce, but there's a loss of weight on the midpalate that suggests this isn't a wine to cellar, but to enjoy now.",87,Publix 2010 Premium Limited Edition Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District)
"Aromas suggest exotic fruit, yellow flower and a whiff of Mediterranean herb. The linear palate doles out yellow apple, ginger, thyme and a hint of mineral alongside bright acidity.",87,Marilena Barbera 2013 Dietro Le Case Inzolia (Menfi)
"The Calina label  seems to have hit its stride; this Carmenère opens with scents of black fruit, dill sprigs and chocolate. The palate broadens with olive, plum, blackberry and coffee flavors, and as a whole it comes together with a certain ease that announces it's on the money.",90,Calina 2005 Alcance Carmenère (Maule Valley)
"Tuscany has been showing magnificent results with Syrah and this expression boasts all the clean lines, spicy flavors and natural intensity of the variety. Aromas of dark fruit, smoked beef, chocolate and tobacco are balanced by a thick, velvety mouthfeel.",88,Tenuta di Trecciano 2008 Suavis Locus Ille Syrah (Toscana)
"This wine has all the qualities you look for in a good Greco di Tufo: the aromas are fragrant and fruity and there is a solid mineral backbone for structure and dimension. Made from grapes grown in volcanic, sulfur-rich soils, the wine offers pretty tropical fruit flavors.",87,Vinosia 2007  Greco di Tufo
"This 100% Cab wants some time in the cellar. Right now, it's fresh and powerful in black cherries, currants, licorice, mocha and sweet toasty oak, with firm tannins and a streak of citrusy acidity. A masculine wine, brooding and aloof, it needs at least 6–8 years in a good cellar to begin to come around.",92,Malk 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District)
"This is a soft Champagne—more like a wine with bubbles than a crisp apéritif. With its relatively high dosage and ripe red fruit, it's rich up front, cleaning up with acidity on the finish. Keep for a few more months and drink from 2018.",91,Gosset NV Grand Rosé Brut  (Champagne)
"From a 90-year-old vineyard, this begins with a lean blackberry nose and other pointed dark-red to deep-purple fruits, all nicely laced with minerality and herbs. The flavors are dynamic, slipping from cranberry to pomegranate to cherry juice. A black tea finish framed by strong tannins ensures long cellar life. Drink 2018–2022.",90,Ridge 2012 Bento Dusi Ranch Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"Black-skinned berry, grilled herb and balsamic aromas meld together in the glass. On the ripe juicy palate, notes of cinnamon, white pepper, star anise and chopped herb accent the fruity core of black cherry and crushed raspberry. Velvety tannins and fresh acidity provide the framework. Drink 2018–2027.",93,Gianfranco Alessandria 2012  Barolo
"This explodes in sizable red cassis and berry fruit along with darker shades of blackberry and espresso. With leathery tannins that remain puckeringly huge, it can stand some time in the cellar mellowing out, through 2026.",89,Trinchero 2011 Central Park West Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
"A field blend of grapes from two vineyards forms the backbone of this vintage Port. It is rich with young fruitiness that masks the firm tannins that will allow this wine to age many years. Berry flavors are balanced with acidity and richness to give a perfumed wine. In its young fruitiness it is ready to drink, although it will age well and really should not be drunk until 2025 at least.",93,Churchill's 2014 Vintage  (Port)
"Leathery aromas of dark berry fruits and various spices comprise a deep and impressive bouquet. This wine is full on the palate, widespread and displays tannic scratchiness. Immense flavors of wild berry fruits and spice end with intensity and firm, sturdy tannins. Drink through 2023.",93,Dominio de Tares 2015 Cepas Viejas Mencía (Bierzo)
"Very grassy, herbaceous aromas lead to a wine that is dominated by minerality and pink grapefruit. It is intense, ripe and concentrated, but there is an element of tension in its crisp aftertaste.",88,Château de Tracy 2005 Mademoiselle de T  (Pouilly-Fumé)
"Airy and woody on the nose, this textbook Rioja crianza is woody, dry, light and elegant, with a smooth but juicy palate that brings raspberry, plum and brown sugar flavors to the fore. Spice and dry red-fruit flavors meld with juicy acidity on the finish. Drink through 2017.",90,Altos del Marqués 2010 ADM Crianza  (Rioja)
"Familiar varietal aromas of lychee and scented candle come with a hint of petrol. Punchy and crisp in feel, this tastes of garden variety lemon-lime, banana and lychee. A crisp but rudimentary finish closes things out.",86,Cuma 2015 Made with Organic Grapes Torrontés (Cafayate)
"Subtle hints of ripe pineapple and peach hover over this delicate and very refreshing wine. Notes of lemon and citrus zest provide freshness and zing but the most remarkable aspect is its lightness. Dry, ultralight-bodied and super-refreshing this is a great choice for a summer party.",89,Domäne Wachau 2014 Terrassen Gelber Muskateller (Wachau)
"Quite a nice white wine for its acidity and sophistication, which is a function of the crispness. Shows clean, lively flavors of citrus fruits, peaches, wildflowers and vanilla, with umami notes of cashew nut and foie gras. Dry, but feels honey-rich on the finish.",88,Fenestra 2008 Sémillon (Livermore Valley)
"Named after a local volcanic rock formation, this wine is a delicious blend of Aragonez (aka Tempranillo) and Touriga Nacional. It is rich and smooth with black fruits, soft tannins and an aftertaste that is lively with acidity. The wine is ready to drink.",88,Manzwine 2014 Penedo do Lexim Red (Lisboa)
"This wine opens with intense floral aromas that recall room freshener and cold cream. The dense palate offers exotic fruit and flavors that suggest canned peaches alongside a hint of clove. It has a bitter, nutty finish.",86,Franz Haas 2012 Gewürztraminer (Alto Adige)
"This classic Austrian red wine blend, a specialty of the Gols region north of the Neusiedlersee, is here shown at its best. Peel away its tight, mineral outer shell, and the wine inside shows richly dark tannins, juicy fruit and an appealing red and green pepper vitality that contrasts freshness with the serious structure. Age for 3-4 years.",91,Judith Beck 2006 Pannobile Red (Burgenland)
"Not quite dry, this lightly perfumed wine has fresh apricot and white peach flavors. It is poised with acidity and a soft texture. Drink now.",85,Vieil Armand 2013 Tradition Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Thick tannins obscure some of the richer flavors trying to burst through in this wine, a mix of blackberry, black olive and cedar. Full bodied and generous in every way, it finishes with a slow drag of smoke.",88,Signorello 2012 Las Amigas Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"This wine has a strongly tannic, dry character from the Malbec-inspired blend of 52% Merlot, 31% Malbec and 17% Cabernet Sauvignon. However the ripe blackberry fruits are match enough, giving ripe flavors with a squeeze of acidity and richness at the end. Drink from 2016.",86,Château la France 2013 Cuvée Gallus  (Bordeaux Supérieur)
This lean wine lacks fruit to support the dry tannins. That probably comes from the extraction that has also caused some bitterness. It's a hard wine that needs time to soften.,84,Château Leboscq 2012  Médoc
"Lemon butter, shreds of nectarine and a dash of sea salt make appearances on the fairly faint nose of this wine from San Jose-based winemaker Adam Comartin. The wine comes alive once sipped, with white peach flesh, lemony acidity and chalky grip, all culminating in a zing that goes on for minutes, finishing with a touch of marzipan.",89,Comartin 2013 R-Bar-R Vineyards Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Pale in color, delicate in the mouth, this Pinot is marked by dry tannins and a brittle acidity. The fruit is comparatively modest by Santa Rita standards, showing currants, cherries and oranges. Could develop with a few years in the bottle.",86,Flying Goat Cellars 2006 2A Rio Vista Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Ripeness was no problem in this wine, despite the chilly vintage. It bursts with raspberries and cherries, with brown sugar and oak richness. Gentle enough to drink now, the blend is Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, in that order.",85,Kokomo 2011 Claret (Dry Creek Valley)
"This opens with subdued aromas that suggest chamomile flower, passion fruit and a whiff of adhesive bandage. The lean, stringy palate shows notes of crunchy celery, grapefruit and a hint of stone alongside nervous acidity.",85,La Rajade 2014 Sauvignon (Collio)
"Rocky gravel meets plum blossoms, strawberry jam, cola and nutmeg on the nose of this single-vineyard expression by winemaker Brian Loring. Once sipped, dark and rich pomegranate and olallieberry fruit takes hold, with graphite minerality making a splash midpalate.",91,Loring Wine Company 2014 Kessler-Haak Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"This was not an easy vintage in which to make wine with as much fruit and concentration as this bottling, but winemaker Luisa Ponzi has done it. Deep cherry fruit comes laced with cola and chocolate notes, filling the textural, detailed and full-bodied palate. It demonstrates terrific length and an elegant, balanced finish.",93,Ponzi 2010 Avellana Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"With balance and grip, this lightly effervescent wine rolls from a pretty pear flavor into a light tropical fruit note. It's hard to beat at this price.",89,Lone Birch 2011 Pinot Gris (Yakima Valley)
"Black fruits dominate this rich wine. While it has tannins, they are soft and dusty, already well integrated into the fruitiness and generous texture. It's full in the mouth, delicious and ripe. Drink from 2015.",89,Domaine de Cause 2011 Tradition Malbec (Cahors)
"Made from organically grown grapes, this Prosecco sticks out in a crowd. There are aromas here of apple skin, yellow candy and slightly awkward tones of piquant white pepper. It doesn't taste like textbook Prosecco, but cut it some slack because it is one of a handful or organic Prosecco sparklers in existence.",84,Mionetto NV Certified Organic Extra Dry Prosecco (Veneto)
"Plum and candied berry aromas come with a touch of horseradish and chemical harshness. Chunky, plump and short on crispness, this tastes of plum, berry and salt. A bready tasting finish runs low on acidity and fruit.",85,Larchago 2015 Rosé (Rioja)
"This wine has aromas of oak, red currants and roasted coffee bean. Oak dominates the palate, with toasted sensations and espresso taking center stage over the subdued red fruit sensation. Overall, this is dried up and tannic, closing on an astringent note of wood tannins. Veritas Imports, Tanaro River Imports, Crown.",84,Bindi Sergardi 2011 La Ghirlanda  (Chianti Classico)
"This pure Pommard-clone bottling offers lighter red fruit with highlights of cocoa and baking spices. The balance is good, and this should age well and develop interesting aromatics if cellared. Drink 2018–2025.",89,Torii Mor 2013 Nysa Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Cherry-vanilla and boysenberry jam combine around a ripe, lush and full-bodied wine, ideal for smoky, grilled foods. Smooth tannins make it enjoyable now and accessible to many palates, though be mindful of its power and intensity.",88,Murphy-Goode 2012 Snake Eyes Zinfandel (Alexander Valley)
"This 100% Cabernet was grown in a Calistoga vineyard. It was aged in 40% new oak. At the age of 3½ years, it's still quite tannic, even a bit rustic, with zippy acidity and fresh, jammy blackberry and black cherry flavors. Hard to say where it's going, but try aging it for 5–6 years and see what happens.",88,The Grade 2008 Winfield Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Calistoga)
Bright aromas of lemon zest and cut grass give this wine a crisp feel. This should pair well with basil and tomato buschetta or summer pasta dishes with tangy pesto sauce.,86,Pala 2010 I Fiori  (Vermentino di Sardegna)
"A ripe and creamy wine that has also managed to retain a strongly mineral character. It's a rich wine from the heart of Champagne's Côte des Blancs Chardonnay vineyards. Apples, spice and tight lime and lemon flavors give a crisp aftertaste. It is ready to drink.",90,Jean Milan NV Millénaire Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)
"Close to Epernay and on the cusp of the Chardonnay-dominated Côte des Blancs, this producer has Grand Cru holdings in the village of Chouilly. Those vines have produced a wine that balances mineral-laced fruit with a soft aftertaste. Young and with apple flavors, it's great now but will continue to develop in the cellar. Drink from 2018.",90,Vazart Coquart & Fils NV Blanc de Blancs Réserve Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)
"Full and roundly lush, this is a big, bold wine from a specially selected site within an estate vineyard. It imparts smoked meat alongside rich, spiced plum, an undercurrent of rosemary and herbes de Provence whipping in between the fruit and generous tannin.",92,Lynmar 2014 Block 10 Quail Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Clumsy, with outsized acidity and sweet, jammy raspberry, orange and cherry flavors. Tastes sweet and sour, like a Chinese pork sauce. Contains too many different varieties to list, but they include Muscat.",84,Acorn 2008 Medley Alegría Vineyards Red (Russian River Valley)
"Chalk and slate notes juxtapose fragrant, sweet-tart tangerine, lime and lemon on the nose and palate of this laser-edged kabinett. A kiss of honey gives the midpalate just a touch of sweetness that lingers long on the finish.",93,Maximin Grünhäuser 2014 Herrenberg Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"Soft and sweet, this Merlot has a rustic mouthfeel framing jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries, chocolate and leather. Seems at its best now.",84,St. Francis 2005 Merlot (Sonoma County)
"The wine is all fruit: red berries and red currants bursting from the glass. The red wine used to give color has added an edge of tannic texture to the ripe fruitiness. In the house style of this producer, the wine is dry and crisp at the end. Drink now.",89,J. Dumangin Fils NV Le Rosé Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne)
"There is nothing wimpy about this Bordeaux-style blend except the price. It way over-delivers, loading your palate with full-bodied, fruit-powered flavors of strawberry and raspberry jam, bolstered with bracing acidity. It's balanced and complete, with crisp, ripe tannins.",89,Renegade 2012 Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Aromas of espresso, toasted oak and grilled herb take center stage and follow through to the full-bodied palate along with Golden Delicious apple, toasted nut and a hint of lemon zest. If you like evident oak, you'll enjoy this, but the wood may be too invasive for others. Drink soon to capture the remaining fruit.",88,Tollena 2011 Signorina Vittoria Riserva  (Vernaccia di San Gimignano)
"This is an up-and-coming variety for the state. High-toned aromas of lime leaf and citrus are followed by a lean, almost faint but still but well-balanced palate with a thread of acidity running through it. Pair it with food to see it at its best.",88,Rôtie Cellars 2015 Grenache Blanc (Washington)
"Very fruity, this is a refreshingly crisp lemon-flavored wine, bright and intensely tangy. It is a young Alvarinho and needs aging to bring out its ripe creamy, apple-and-pear character.",91,Provam 2014 Alvarinho (Vinho Verde)
"Principally Cabernet Franc with small amounts of Petit Verdot and Malbec (8% each) blended in, this wine is almost irresistible with its pretty, pale salmon color. It does not disappoint with its aromas and flavors of melon, white peach and grapefruit, with a light spritz giving it some lift.",91,Seven Hills 2014 Dry Rosé (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The 2011 vintage was difficult for most Virginia winemakers as the harvest was notoriously washed out with rain. This is a light- to medium-bodied wine, with broad, white-fruit flavors that lack intensity and character.",82,Veritas 2011 Saddleback Chardonnay (Monticello)
"With green, herbal notes of oregano and fresh cut grass mingling with lemon zest and a good lick of acidity, this wine ticks all the boxes when it comes to a solidly made, refreshing sipper.",86,Twin Islands 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Savory, smoky aromas of blackberry, blueberry and latex lead to a rubbery feeling palate with full tannins and chewy, extracted weight. Earthy, loamy flavors of blackberry, chocolate and buttery oak finish rich, with a mossy flavor, big tannins and length. Drink through 2019.",91,Telmo Rodríguez 2009 Pago la Jara  (Toro)
"Arresting from the get-go, with a spice-driven start that rolls into a soft midpalate with nicely evolved fruit flavors of plum and spicy cherry. This isn't a big wine, but it's balanced and fruity, with moderate depth and excellent balance.",89,Kudos 2009 Zena Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Compared to the 2004, this wine seems less generous. The nose is solid, with licorice, spice, pepper and plum fruit. But the palate is kind of flat and bland, with plump but dull raspberry and strawberry fruit. For $30 you want more.",84,Trapiche 2005 Medalla Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Rich and structured, this firm wine has concentration from dense white and yellow fruits plus richness from the wood aging. This intense wine is still developing, so drink from 2018.",90,Château de Santenay 2015  Chassagne-Montrachet
"As always, Seghesio's Cortina is a rich, complex Zinfandel. It captures Zin's briary, brambly, spicy personality, with dense, wild forest-berry fruit, yet manages to be elegantly compact and even Cabernet-like in its tannin structure. A very classy wine that deserves a spot on the best wine lists.",93,Seghesio 2010 Cortina Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"A great buy in a smooth, dry Merlot that shows real Napa elegance and style. It's medium-bodied and lush, with appealing cherry, currant, licorice, tobacco, mocha and spice flavors. Drink now for the immediate appeal.",90,Napa Cellars 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"This is Côtes-du-Rhône, California style. A blend of Grenache, Mourvedre, Syrah and Counoise, it's a dry, rich, full-bodied red wine, flooded with easy-to-drink cherry, blackberry, blueberry and oak flavors, and a wealth of Provençal rosemary, lavender and thyme. Drink now for its soft, youthful purity.",88,Tablas Creek 2005 Côtes de Tablas Red (Paso Robles)
"A good, classic California Zin, dry, medium-bodied and briary, filled with spicy tobacco, wild cherry and pepper flavors. It's a lot of fun, at a great price. Perfect with barbecue, beef stew, beef tacos, roast pork, chicken cacciatore.",86,McManis 2010 Zinfandel (California)
"This is a real food wine, with its tangy texture, touch of spice and attractive acidity. Light fruitiness and a dry core give a structured character. Drink now.",88,Château Reynon 2016 Le Rosé de Floridène Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
"The winery has held back release on this Pinot considerably longer than their vineyard--designated wines. It's softly tannic and silky in the mouth, with concentrated raspberry and cherry jam, brown sugar, vanilla bean and spice flavors. Lovely to drink now and over the next few years.",90,MacPhail 2010 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This is a full-bodied, soft and round style of Pinot Gris that's almost completely dry. Understated pear and melon aromas combine with hints of fern fronds to create an enchanting bouquet, while the flavors are more straightforward and fruity. Drink now.",88,Jules Taylor 2011 Pinot Gris (Marlborough)
"This wine contains a rather high (for Hermitage) 30% Roussanne in the blend (the balance is Marsanne). It's full bodied and luscious on the palate yet somewhat neutral in flavor. Fleeting hints of toasted nuts and stone fruit on the nose are followed by subtle oak and citrus notes, while the long finish features touches of mocha and flamed orange peel.",90,Maison Nicolas Perrin 2011 Marsanne-Roussanne (Hermitage)
"Spicier than most Cab Francs, with a scour of pepper, but lush and flavorful in red cherries, tobacco and sandalwood. Easy to drink, this fine red wine has lots of interest. Drink now.",89,Peju 2007 Reserve Cabernet Franc (Rutherford)
"True to the variety, this pure expression of Syrah shows blueberry, cola, smoked bacon and milk chocolate aromas. The bouquet is a bit muddled compared to last vintage, but the wine is soft and smooth on the finish.",89,Batzella 2008 Bliss Syrah (Toscana)
"Made of 90% Sangiovese, 5% Canaiolo and 5% Colorino grapes, this shows blackberry, underbrush and tilled soil aromas. The palate doles out juicy black cherry, clove and anise flavors with both bright acidity and sleek tannins. Drink through 2019.",89,I Veroni 2014  Chianti Rufina
"Rich and warm, this is a big, ripe wine. Toasted marshmallow notes frame honeyed pineapple, while hints of singed fruit and mocha linger on the finish. Drink now.",89,Lavau 2012 White (Châteauneuf-du-Pape)
"Savory red-cherry notes domaine this wine, with a light body, some spicy accents and lots of refreshing, enlivening acidity.",84,Iby 2012 Classic Blaufränkisch (Burgenland)
"A blend of Syrah, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and a dollop of Petit Verdot, this has subtle aromas of ground pepper, toast, French oak and espresso. The aromas follow over to the rather lean, straightforward palate along with a note of fresh cherry set against loose-knit, fine-grained tannins. Enjoy over the next few years.",88,Campo di Sasso 2014 Insoglio del Cinghiale Red (Toscana)
"The Grand Lieu lake gives extra ripeness to the Melon grapes grown close to its shores, resulting in a rich, smooth and creamy-textured wine. Of course there is also plenty of citrus and mineral acidity. The wine is ready to drink.",87,La Berrière 2015  Muscadet Côtes de Grandlieu
"Forward aromas of menthol, bay, lavender and pink flowers dominate the nose of this pretty rosé, with soft notes of orange, melon and underripe peach underneath. The medium-weight palate shows some roundness, though it's lifted by ample acidity and a pithy astringency that graces the finish.",86,Domaine de Viranel 2015 Trilogie Rosé (Pays d'Oc)
"Full berry and hickory aromas come with a hint of burnt rubber. The palate is regular, if a bit gritty, with generic berry flavors and a spot of bitterness. It finishes quick, tannic and solid, with a lot of fruit character.",86,Coiron 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"All Roussanne from the Gunkel vineyard, this is a fine expression of pure varietal fruit. A fresh and delicious blend of flavors, it touches on peach, apricot, lemon curd and pineapple, with impressive concentration through a long, clean finish.",91,Barnard Griffin 2012 Roussanne (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Dusty and mineral, yet full of crisp lemon, lime and grapefruit flavors, this off-dry wine is a refreshing example of one of the Mosel's unsung grapes, Elbling. Delicate in body, it finishes briskly on a slightly smoky, mineral tone. Drink now.",86,Frieden-Berg 2013 Ursprung Feinherb Elbling (Mosel)
From the beautiful Menfi area of southern Sicily comes this clean and genuine expression of Nero d'Avola featuring bright berry aromas and silky tannins. Pair this wine with roast pork.,87,Cantine Barbera 2009 Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"Made from old vines and partially fermented in wood, this is a complex wine, offering plenty of pure white fruits. It is very precise in character, crisp, tangy, the edge of wood just a hint.",92,Henri Bourgeois 2008 La Bourgeoise  (Sancerre)
"Dry and fiercely tannic, this Petite Sirah's rustic nature shows in the astringency and uneven ripeness of flavors. Shows a spectrum of blackberries, raisins and wintergreen. Drink now.",84,Bianchi 2006 Plummer Vineyard Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)
"Super-peppery, this full-bodied Zin also has grilled blackberry and plum, mocha, licorice, beef jerky and gingersnap cookie flavors. The rich tannins call for grilled steaks and chops.",87,Peachy Canyon 2006 Snow Vineyard Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"This may be dry Chenin Blanc, but there is this tantalizing touch of honey that goes with the crisp apple and fresh quince fruits. The wine has delicious, refreshingly crisp acidity that counterbalances its natural richness.",88,Château la Varière 2009 Clos de la Division Chenin Blanc (Anjou)
"This is a soft, unfocussed wine with some acidity and a hint of strawberry fruits and a sweet candy flavor. Drink now.",82,Besombes Moc Baril 2015 Domaine des Lys  (Rosé d'Anjou)
"Warm and ripe, this has fine honey and yellow fruit flavors. It has well-integrated acidity, with a touch of apple that lends a crisp finish.",88,Joseph Drouhin 2010  Saint-Véran
"One of the bolder, more tannic red blends, this full-bodied wine has cedar and cinnamon aromas, flavors like boysenberry jam and a nicely gripping texture. Well balanced by firm acidity, it stays lively. The wine is made with 46% Malbec, plus Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon.",87,Jigar 2012 RAJA Cuvée Red (Mendocino County)
"Boasting aromas of sous bois, damp moss and mocha, this medium-bodied wine presents a pleasant blend of savory flavors, heavily underscored by tart, lemony acids. It's very crisp, which slightly limits its pleasure.",86,Twelfth Night 2012 Pinot Noir (Central Otago)
"A classic Bordeaux blend. Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment.",92,Andrew Will 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain)
"This round, soft, alcoholic wine deserves praise for its spicy-peppery warmth and abundant cherry fruit. Those same qualities are also its biggest shortcoming: The low acidity and high alcohol make it seem a bit heavy. —J.C",85,Temple Bruer 1998 Cornucopia Grenache (Langhorne Creek)
"From an up-and-coming estate in Umbria, this blended white (Trebbiano, Malvasia and Grechetto) opens with generous aromas of ripe fruit, apricot, caramel and honey. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy.",86,Trappolini 2010  Orvieto
"Simple and sharp in acidity, with jammy raspberry and cherry flavors commingling in an uncomfortable coating of sweet oak. This Rhône-style blend from Beckmen is a disappointment.",84,Beckmen 2009 Cuvée Le Bec Red (Santa Ynez Valley)
"94–96. Barrel sample. This is a big, powerful, fruity wine that has restraint from its dense tannins. It's foursquare, chunky in character, already balanced, the tannins merging with the acidity. There is great aging potential.",95,Château Montrose 2012 Barrel Sample  (Saint-Estèphe)
"Rather sharp and dominated by piquant cranberry and field aromas. Light in color, with lean red-fruit flavors. A little green and heavily oaked—the dill and pickle from the wood show boldly. Has some good characteristics, but they’re just too hard to get at. From the hotter reaches of southern Oregon.",82,Girardet 1998 Barrel Select Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley)
"This wine shows grapey and plummy purple fruit notes lead to an earthy palate, with hints of stem and coffee. No new oak was used, but it spent 22 months in barrel prior to bottling.",87,Twill 2014 Steelhead Run Vineyard Syrah (Applegate Valley)
"The Medieval Sancerre castle (Joan of Arc slept here) was built on the site of an ancient Roman fortress. Now owned by the producers of Grand Marnier liqueur, the vineyard produces an attractive, open style of wine. It has just the right tangy acidity along with delicious ripe apple and citrus fruits. The wine is ready to drink.",89,Château de Sancerre 2015  Sancerre
"Crafted from 50% Chardonnay, 45% Pinot Gris and 5% Pinot Blanc, this straw-colored wine offers aromas of lemongrass and almond blossom. It is balanced in the mouth, with flavors of tropical fruit, pineapple and understated flowers.",90,Purcari 2012 Alb de Purcari White (Moldova)
"This super-smooth but hearty red blend made from Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre smells smoky, meaty and oaky. It tastes savory and a bit peppery before a good dose of ripe, plummy flavor joins in. It feels full-bodied, and almost soft in texture because of light tannins, but has enough acidity to keep an appetizing balance.",88,Vasco Urbano 2012 The Sheriff Red (Livermore Valley)
"Tropical aromas of pineapple and melon are simple but clean, while the palate is fresh yet a little plump, with pineapple, mango, apple and banana flavors. This one will wet the whistle but it turns monotone on the finish. Drink as soon as possible for maximum vitality.",84,Bodega Norton 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Mendoza)
"Alluring aromas suggest crushed blue flower and perfumed berries. The easygoing palate delivers dense black cherry, cedar and a hint of espresso. It's round, ripe and ready to enjoy now.",88,Nottola 2012  Rosso di Montepulciano
"Dark and earthy, slightly pruny and alcoholic, finishing on notes of tar and molasses.",83,L.A. Cetto 1999 Petite Sirah (Valle de Guadalupe)
"Butter and honey make for a rich, hedonistic tone to this mildly structured white. A soft, malleable texture provides creaminess without complexity.",87,Alyris 2014 The Audition Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Sleek, elegant and refined, this is a subtle, evocative and seamless wine. Layers of plum and black cherry, cola and earth, sea salt and caramel entwine gracefully. The 18 months in oak brings in sweet baking spices. Delicious already, it should drink very well at least through 2025.",93,Vidon Vineyard 2010 Barrel Select Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"This is finished dry, at 13.3% alcohol, and puts the emphasis on citrus and grass, cracker and grain. There is a smidgeon of varietal perfume—a whiff of rose petal—but overall it's trending more toward Sauvignon Blanc than most Gewürztraminer. Nonetheless there is an impression of sweetness on the palate, from the nicely-ripened fruit.",88,David Hill 2006 Estate Gewürztraminer (Willamette Valley)
"Sweet and somewhat disjointed, this 100% Sauvignon Blanc offers ripe apricot and peach before becoming slightly sour and herbal on the finish.",83,Marilyn Sauvignon Blonde 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"This wine comes from the négociant side of the Muré business, which buys grapes from the hot, sunny slopes above Rouffach, south of Colmar. The exposure gives this wine a particular richness for the year, with aromas of citrus fruits and apples. It is already ready to drink.",87,René Muré 2001 Riesling (Alsace)
"Mount Veeder Cabernets usually have tough tannins, making the Cabernets ageworthy, but this 100% varietal bottling neither requires cellaring nor will reward it. Enjoy the tight astringency now for its upfront blackberry, black currant and cassis flavors.",91,Conn Creek 2008 Newton Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder)
"Leafy underbrush, mature blackberry, scorched earth and clove aromas lead the way. The straightforward, accessible palate offers fleshy black cherry, star anise and a hint of game alongside ripe tannins. While it lacks complexity, it has a juicy, immediate appeal. Drink through 2019.",88,Canneta 2011  Brunello di Montalcino
"Now perfectly mature, this ripe, spicy wine is delicious. It shows a fine balance between botrytis, fruit and acidity, keeping it at once crisp and richly sweet. Ready to drink.",90,Château Dauphiné Rondillon 2008 Cuvée d'Or 
"Loamy blackberry aromas register as ripe, while notes of pastry, toast and shoe polish add complexity to the nose. This single-vineyard wine displays raw power and angularity, while juicy plum flavors carry herbal, spicy elements. This lightens up a little on the finish while maintaining a raw, sinewy style that suggests aging will be beneficial. Drink through 2025.",90,Contino 2011 Viña del Olivo  (Rioja)
The wine has plenty of ripe fruit and generous tannins. The blackberry fruitiness and acidity are backed by a dry core that will allow this full-bodied wine to age. Drink from 2018.,88,Château Belcier 2015 Château de Monrecueil  (Bordeaux Supérieur)
"Soft, sweet red cherries and berries contrast leafy green and peppery notes in this dry-style Cabernet Franc rosé. It's a bit candied and confected, yet green in character with a quickly dissipating finish.",82,Lucas Vineyards 2014 Dry Rosé (Finger Lakes)
"This wine starts off with great aromas of baking spice, plum and vanillin. The palate has some nice fig and prune flavors, but there is also a charred oak note that is bitter. Disjointed in body, it has austere acidity, an opulent body and rough tannins. It finishes long, dry and bitter.",82,Narmada 2013 Reserve Cabernet Franc (Virginia)
"This blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Sangiovese and 5% Cabernet Franc opens with intense aromas of black-skinned fruit, purple flower, oak and exotic spice. The taut, elegant palate offers black currant, black cherry, chopped mint and white pepper alongside bright acidity and polished, fine-grained tannins. It's still youthfully austere, so give it time to fully develop. Drink 2020–2033.",94,Marchesi Antinori 2013 Solaia Red (Toscana)
"This is a wood aged wine, full of vanilla flavors as well as fragrant fruitiness. It has great flavor intensity, with bright notes of juicy green plum and grapefruit that are framed by acidity and a tight, mineral texture. It needs some years aging, so drink from 2018.",92,Poeira 2014 White (Douro)
"Vuj does a nice job of portraying those rich aromas of peach, melon and white rose that are natural to the promising Friulano grape. Made with the banner variety of northeast Italy, this easy white wine shows fresh fruit layers and balanced acidity.",86,Puiatti 2012 Vuj Friulano (Isonzo del Friuli)
"A clean, fresh, appealing sort of Tempranillo with cola, earth, black cherry and berry aromas followed by a bright, forward, spicy cherry palate. Honest, snappy, healthy and juicy; nice and solid for La Mancha.",87,Montgó 2008 Flor del Montgó Tempranillo (La Mancha)
"Red cherry, kola nut, root beer, brown spice and a touch of smoke pull the nose deeply into this bottling by Blair Fox and Eli Parker. Baked red and black plum, a touch of mulberry and bloody, earthy flavors mark the palate, which is quite complex and bound together with a strong tannic structure.",92,Epiphany 2013 Grenache (Santa Barbara County)
"Honeysuckle and fresh grass mingle with aromas of nectarine and apricot pit on the bouquet, while the mouth offers vibrant flavors of sweet citrus and juicy fresh peach slices. Balanced and easy to drink with a kiss of toast on the close. Drink now.",86,Laurent Miquel 2009 Nord Sud Viognier (Vin de Pays d'Oc)
"Muted aromas of tart gooseberry and lime peel dance in the bouquet, while pithy flavors of plum skin, currant and citrus rind unfold on the lightweight, slightly astringent palate. Pleasant hints of fresh herbs and saline make a fleeting impression on the close.",86,Waterkloof 2015 Circumstance Sauvignon Blanc (Stellenbosch)
"This is the family's top wine—a blend of selected Pinot Noir and Chardonnay lots from their 25 acres. Made to be aged, it still shows its extra-crisp fruit and acidity, needing time to soften and bring out its full, rich potential. Drink from 2019.",92,Liebart-Régnier 2011 Excélia Brut  (Champagne)
"This gorgeous wine bursts open with loads of ripe fruit, blackberry, tar, asphalt and pipe tobacco. It's a thick, velvety expression with a high caliber of concentration and intensity that would pair with roast lamb or barbecue pork chops. Age 5–7 more years.",91,Farnese 2005 Opi Riserva  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo Colline Teramane)
Here's a bright rosé with a pretty peach color and mature aromas of berry and stone fruit. It has a flat but smooth mouthfeel with some notes of bitter almond on the close.,85,Fratta Pasini 2007 Chiaretto Rosé (Bardolino)
"The new French oak (60%) and rich fruit aromas and flavors play perfectly off each other. Notes of dark roasted coffee beans and bittersweet chocolate meld with fresh herbs and dark cherries. It's rich and layered with abundant fruit and barrel flavors capped off by a tart, lingering finish. Best after 2020.",92,Sleight of Hand 2012 The Illusionist Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Here’s a rich, solid Cab from a good winery with a proven track record. Made in the Bordeaux style, with 72% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Franc, it’s got ripe black-currant and plum aromas and flavors and a solid dose of toasty new French oak. Very balanced and complex. The tannins are soft enough to drink it tonight, but it can also age, if you want.",92,Merryvale 1997 Profile Red (Napa Valley)
"This is smooth, ripe with toffee and spice flavors that give a dense texture and a soft character to this approachable wine. It has a fine touch of acidity to keep it fresh.",88,Barão de Vilar NV Feurheerd's Tawny Reserve  (Port)
"A mix of blackberry and red currant flavors play on the nose and palate. Fruit is undoubtedly the core of this wine, with easy tannin and fresh acidity channelling it into a pleasant, fruity red for early drinking.",84,Judith Beck 2012 Zweigelt (Burgenland)
"This is possibly the most savory rendition of Syrah made on the Central Coast, each vintage as feral as the last. This bottling shows bloody lamb, crushed peppercorn, soy and barnyard elements on the nose. The palate is tense with tarry structure, revealing unusual kelp, stewed peppercorn, black miso and teriyaki flavors.",96,Stolo 2014 Estate Syrah (San Luis Obispo County)
"Produced from organically grown fruit, this is a pure cleanly crisp wine. It has great acidity and generous red fruits that are shot through with acidity. The 50% of Mouvèdre in the blend gives the wine its perfumed, structured character. Drink now.",90,Figuière 2016 Première Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This pleasant, fruity wine has lemon-lime crispness. Hints of apricot flavor prove the Alvarinho grape is far from its northern Portuguese homeland. Drink now.",84,Adega Cooperativa de Borba 2015 Senses Alvarinho (Alentejano)
"With strong new-wood character, this wine has vanilla and toast flavors. The concentrated red-berry fruits are suppressed, giving a wine that needs time to develop. Drink from 2018.",87,Quinta do Pôpa 2011 Pôpa Vinhas Velhas Red (Douro)
"Blue and red fruit wrap around ample, tangy acidity in this medium-bodied, velvety textured wine, so classically styled for the appellation. Pomegranate, rhubarb and floral rose are all highlighted along its gradual evolution in the glass.",94,Siduri 2015 Bellflower Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Earthy aromas of plum, leather and corn tortilla are sketchy. This feels full but sort of flat, with soupy, herbal berry flavors. Olive, weedy notes and saucy berry flavors control the finish.",85,Nieto Senetiner 2014 Bonarda (Luján de Cuyo)
"Considering the coolness of the vintage, this wine seems surprisingly ripe with notes of cherry, strawberry, herbs and ash. It's thick and weighty in feel, making it seem a bit ponderous.",86,Foris 2011 Maple Ranch Pinot Noir (Rogue Valley)
"This is a lightly fruity wine with attractive acidity and citrus and apricot flavors. It is light and lively, fresh and crisp. There is a just a touch of spice and pepper at the end. Drink now.",84,Château de Brigue 2016 Brigue Vin de Provence Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This mashup of 62% Syrah, 16% Petite Sirah, 8% Tempranillo, 7% Grenache, 5% Zinfandel and 2% Malbec delivers aromas of black cherry and Chinese five spice as well as mint and black earth. The palate picks up blackberry-laced iced tea with sprigs of mint and pinches of cardamom, alongside spicy gingerbread cake.",93,ONX 2012 Reckoning Red (Paso Robles)
"As one might expect from a Rhône-based producer, this is a meaty, earthy rendering of Shiraz. It's only medium bodied, but frames its black olive and spice flavors in dry, dusty tannins. Drink now–2020.",90,Tournon by Michel Chapoutier 2012 Shay's Flat Vineyard Shiraz (Pyrenees)
"A dusty drink of blackberry, lean and structured with resolved tannins and a clean finish.",87,Jason-Stephens 2010 Estate Malbec (Santa Clara Valley)
"A candy-flavored wine, this is soft and missing acidity. Some spiced apple flavors are masked by the sherbet flavor.",82,Manciat-Poncet 2014  Pouilly-Fuissé
"Orchard fruit and citrus aromas emerge on this vibrant white while the slender, linear palate shows nectarine zest, apple and a hint of mineral. It's savory if a bit lean, with bracing acidity and lots of verve.",87,Tenuta La Ponca 2014 Ribolla Gialla (Collio)
"Give this wine a few minutes to open up, and once it does it's a lovely example of cool climate Chardonnay. Subtle notes of ripe lemon, stone fruit, butter, and smoke lead into a slippery textured, medium-weighted palate. More lemon and stone fruit mark the flavors, and toast and smoke show on the finish.",90,Bird in Hand 2015 Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)
"This is a single-parcel wine from old vines (which date back to the 1970s). Aged in wood, this very fine wine shows sophisticated tannins, complex spice, black-plum fruits and a judicious shot of acidity. It is a fine wine, still young and showing a good potential for aging. Drink from 2019.",92,Domaine de Cause 2014 La Lande Cavagnac Malbec (Cahors)
"This combines fruity and savory aromas, with a rich but tannic texture and full body. Aroma recall black olive and cedar, while flavors focus on the fruit components. Everything is in place for an enjoyable, well-structured dinner wine.",88,Longevity 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley)
"This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot has some oak flavors on top of the jammy blackberries and cherries. It's simple and direct; ideal for drinking now.",85,Decoy 2010 Red (Napa Valley)
"Flavors of candied lemon, lime and pineapple are brightened by crisp acidity in this unoaked  Sauvignon Blanc. The wine reflects this cool-climate Monterey appellation with its clean, brisk character.",85,Mercy 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Arroyo Seco)
"Modest and generally clean on the nose, this features little more than a touch of berry. It feels tight and juicy, with citrus flavor and not much complexity. A note of pink grapefruit shows up on the finish.",86,Marqués de Gelida 2009 Pinot Noir Brut Reserva Rosé Sparkling (Cava)
"Earthy aromas of leather, tilled soil, ripe dark-skinned berry and a funky whiff of game lead the way. The robust, chewy palate delivers juicy black cherry, raspberry, cake spice and dried herb alongside hearty, tightly wound tannins that will carry this through 2023.",90,Cascina Morassino 2013 Ovello  (Barbaresco)
"A blend of Cabernet from Grand Ciel (31%), Ciel du Cheval (30%), Upchurch (28%) and Klipsun (11%) vineyards, wood spice aromas start out up front. The cherry flavors are light and elegant, with the tannins bringing some grip.",90,DeLille 2013 Four Flags Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"Aromas of pickled lime and not much else define the nose on this medium-bodied brut. Flavors of lettuce and lime are dry, while this remains dry and fresh on a clean, simple finish.",87,Aranleón NV Deshora Brut Orgánico Sparkling (Cava)
"At first, this smells gaseous and rubbery, but airing reveals ripe blackberry aromas, graphite and warmth. In the mouth, this Mencía is jammy and woody; flavors of resiny, salty black fruits are chunky, while barrel influences carry onto the finish, which tastes of hickory, mixed spices and cassis. Drink through 2017.",89,Abad Dom Bueno 2012 Mencía (Bierzo)
"This wine shows the characteristic granitic texture of the region. Berry fruits smother the firm tannins to give a rich, juicy wine that's bold, ripe, and ready to drink.",88,Caves Aliança 2011 Aliança Red (Dão)
"Inspired by Sancerre, but with grapes from other parts of the Loire, this soft, herbal and green-fruit flavored wine is refreshing and lightly textured. Drink now.",85,Fournier Père et Fils 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Val de Loire)
"Blades of spearmint and cardamom are prominent on the nose of this wine, followed by a palate rich in pine and black cherry. Lithe with a dense ripeness, the finish is prickly in Asian spice.",88,Reaper 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County)
"Fresh and green-fruited, with mildly sweet, talcum powder aromas. Turns more stark in the mouth, and toward sour apple and grapefruit. Fairly acidic, and thus more zesty than substantive. Lemony and sharp on the finish.",85,Chono 2009 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"Very honeyed and sweet, with bold flavors of apricot and mango that seem almost caramelized in their sugary intensity. Drink now and over the next few years.",90,Castell 2007 Casteller Schlossberg Trockenbeerenauslese Silvaner (Franken)
"There is lovely richness here, with fresh acidity and red berry fruit flavors. The texture is round, lightly chewy, with some wood and final stalky fruit.",88,Château la Bassonnerie 2007  Pomerol
"An intoxicating whiff of musky floral perfume persists throughout this bright, full-bodied Sauvignon Blanc. Gooseberry and white grapefruit flavors are tart and crisp, gaining plushness through the addition of Chardonnay in the blend. Elegant and substantial in mouth feel, it finishes long.",90,Channing Daughters 2014 Mudd Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Long Island)
"A wonderfully complex, dry white wine, rich and acidic, with subtle flavors of citrus fruits, white flowers, vanilla, minerals and honey. Feels smooth and creamy, an interesting combination of richness and tartness and, above all, elegance. Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Viognier and Grenache Blanc.",92,Koehler 2009 Quartette White (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Here's an oak-driven Brunello that needs time to evolve—give it five years or more. Glimmers of bright fruit emerge despite the presence of toasted almond, cedar wood and vanilla extract. The wine is concentrated with soft tannins and a lovely rich feel in the mouth.",92,Mocali 2007  Brunello di Montalcino
"This wine is rich and full in the mouth, with a generous texture and tangy acidity. It is refreshing with its crisp fruitiness and apple juiciness, a bright wine with good depth of flavor.",88,Clos des Rocs 2013 Les Mûres  (Pouilly-Loché)
"From outlying vineyards in the Côte d'Or, the heartland of Burgundy, this wood-aged wine is full of red currants and attractive, easy acidity. With a touch of spice and a juicy aftertaste, it is ready to drink.",86,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2014  Bourgogne
"Black, ripe elderberries, with a tart but supple body make this an appetizing, lighter wine that holds an unusual aromatic intensity. There is an intriguing hint of wilderness and a streak of fresh acidity that makes this soft wine an ideal match for lighter foods. Drink this while it's young and vibrant.",89,Hannes Reeh 2012 Unplugged Zweigelt (Burgenland)
"The aromas are much more closed and dense than the regular bottling. Airing reveals plum, currant and cinnamon, and a good dose of toasty oak. Thick and dense, with fine fruit, intricate tannins, and oak. Delicious now, but will gain complexity with short-term aging. Only 329 cases produced.",89,Schug 1997 Heritage Reserve Merlot (Carneros)
"Prickly aromas of vinegar, pickled rhubarb and bramble don't exactly roll out the red carpet. The palate has a decent feel, but it's thick and borderline cloying. Tastes both green and sweet, with creamy vanilla and carob flavors. Burnt tasting on the finish.",83,Dehesa de Luna 2008 Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"From this small enclave in the foothills of the Basque Pyrenees, this blend of Gros Manseng, Petit Manseng and Petit Courbu is crisp, cool and perfumed. White stone fruits and a ripe tangy texture are cut with acidity and a bright, tight aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",89,Lionel Osmin & Cie 2015 Euskal Egun White (Irrouléguy)
"There's a reason few wineries nowadays produce Barbera. It's a boring wine, and just because it comes from as fine a producer as Reverie can't change that fact. The wine is dry, tannic and dull, with unevenly ripened flavors.",82,Reverie 2008 Estate Barbera (Diamond Mountain District)
"From 30-year-old vines, this lively and thoroughly delightful wine pushes a swath of honey down the core. It's smooth and supple, with bright candied-citrus flavors. You'll find a lick of butterscotch also, as the wine has terrific penetration and length. It's perfect for solo sipping, slightly chilled.",92,Brooks 2015 Bois Joli Vineyard Riesling (Eola-Amity Hills)
"A winner from a consistently excellent winery. A distinctive tropical fruit aroma leads to lively apple and lemon flavors. It's balanced, complex, and lingering on the finish. Try with soft cheeses or shellfish.",90,Navarro 2012 Premiere Reserve Chardonnay (Anderson Valley)
"Bright and savory, this foaming dessert wine comes with the enticing aromas and flavors of ripe apricot, yellow peach, sage and tangerine. Crisp acidity brightens the rich creamy flavors.",90,Mongioia 2015 Belb  (Moscato d'Asti)
"This smells like orange marmalade. It feels smooth and creamy, but not terribly thick due to fine acidity, with flavors of orange, honey, peach and spice. Long and creamy on the finish, this is a fresh, delicious wine that should impress anyone with a sweet tooth.",92,Ochoa 2010 Vino Dulce Moscatel (Navarra)
"The nose is initially closed but opens to reveal rose petal, red berry and white pepper aromas. The warm, forward palate offers dense black cherry, espresso and alpine herbs alongside a solid tannic backbone.",89,Ca'Romè 2009 Rapet  (Barolo)
"Enticing scents of woodland berry, new leather, blue flower and baking spice meld together in the glass. The focused yet full-bodied palate delivers raspberry, Marasca cherry, clove and a hint of dried herb. Velvety tannins and fresh acidity provide framework and balance. Drink 2021–2033.",93,Bel Colle 2013 Simposio  (Barolo)
"This pretty blend of Aglianico, Montepulciano and Piedirosso delivers great intensity and persistency to the senses. The wine exhibits black cherry, forest berry, tobacco and black stone. Its structure is tight and firm and the wine could stand up to grilled prime ribs with a spicy barbecue sauce.",89,Tommasone 2005 Pithecusa Red (Ischia)
"Tastes direct and ripe, with pie-filling, almost sweet flavors of blackberries, black cherries and smoky oak. Could improve over the short term.",86,Juliet 2005 Juliet Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This Amarone has ripe blackberry aromas, with hints of raisin and spice. The palate shows black cherry, black pepper and prune notes. It has tight tannins and fresh acidity, but needs time to unwind and develop; drink after 2016.",90,Farina 2010  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"There's a very savory, gamy element on the nose of this wine, which shows wild berries, woody shrubs, rusty iron and turned forest-floor aromas. The palate is punchy at first, with decent acidity and cranberry-plum-raspberry flavors, then clings to a pencil-lead core deeper into the sip. It offers quite a bit of complexity.",92,Lincourt 2013 Lindsay's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Supple and rich, this medium-bodied wine is slightly sweet, blending berry and cherry flavors with milk-chocolate accents. The sweetness softens the texture and makes it feel broad and mouth-filling.",86,The Cleaver 2014 Red (California)
"This wine is a unique in the state blend and features Cinsault (35%), Grenache (35%) and Mourvèdre. Pale peach in color with a slight bronze tinge, the aromas are light, with notes of strawberry, citrus zest and mineral. The flavors are dry, sleek and high acid. It's a perfect summer wine.",89,Syncline 2016 McKinley Springs Vineyard Rosé (Horse Heaven Hills)
"A brilliant Chardonnay. It's powerful and ripe in fruit, offering a blast of pineapple, green apple, Key lime pie and Meyer lemon tart flavors, accented with the buttered toast of oak. As intense as the fruit is, it's balanced by keen acidity and a stony minerality. Defines the elegant, opulent Russian River style.",94,Rochioli 2010 Rachael's Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Florally pungent, with sweet peach and apricot notes, this smells great. It's richly textured and balanced.",88,Holly's Hill 2010 Estate Roussanne (El Dorado)
"Aromas of rich, concentrated blackberry preserves are accented with spice and char on this medium-bodied wine. Soft acidity adds refreshment to the midpalate, guiding a moderately long finish tinged with granite and fine-grained tannins.",88,Raphael 2010 Estate Merlot (North Fork of Long Island)
"Earthy aromas of underbrush, game, overripe berry and tilled soil lead the nose on this soulful wine. The palate offers the same gamy note alongside spiced blackberry, blueberry, orange zest and clove. Firm but fine-grained tannins provide support.",89,Occhipinti 2010  Cerasuolo di Vittoria
"This is the winery's more accessible and approachable Cabernet, ready to drink. Robust flavors of tobacco and brambly blackberry provide a nod to the mountain provenance. The wine spent more than a year in oak, 30% of it new French and 10% of it new American. The wood flavor is pronounced, a taste of vanilla an endpoint to the finish.",86,Laurel Glen 2012 Counterpoint Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Mountain)
"This huge, ripe wine is packed with sweet fruit and a sense of structure. It is concentrated and intense and has good aging potential for the next four or five years.",89,Anselmi 2002 San Vincenzo White (Delle Venezie)
"Appropriately youthful and flashy, this is textbook Barossa Shiraz, full bodied and rich. Dusty tannins and mouthwatering acids support dark berry fruit, cedar and vanilla. It's drinkable now, but should add savoriness over the next 10 or more years.",93,Langmeil 2013 Orphan Bank Shiraz (Barossa)
"A very dry, somewhat herbal Merlot, with a brittle, tannic mouthfeel. It has flavors of black cherries, currants and sage. Feels elegant and sophisticated in the mouth, a wine to drink now.",88,Waterstone 2006 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Light in structure and made for early drinking, this Pinot is crisp and dry, with cherry, cola and minty flavors. High acidity gives it a searing taste that calls for rich fare, like ahi tuna tartare.",87,Pessagno 2006 Central Avenue Vineyard Pinot Noir (Monterey County)
"Ripe, earthy aromas of cola, coconut, blackberry and cassis are healthy and heady. Reflecting a warm year, this wine feels both flush and fleshy, with mild tannins. Flavors of blackberry, mocha and coffee finish clean, open and easy, with nothing overbearing. Drink through 2019.",91,Resalte 2012 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"If what you're looking for is a medium-weight red wine with bright fruit and bounce, this is it. It's not complex or weighty stuff; instead it's focused on jumpy cherry and raspberry flavors and a snappy feel. Totally pedestrian but good in its price category.",85,Santa Rita 2005 120 Shiraz (Maipo Valley)
"Sweet honeysuckle, lime blossoms and honeydew show on the very flowery nose of this bottling from a newer property near the old mining town of Pozo. The sip tightens up smartly with Anjou pear and honeysuckle flavors, but it's the powerful acidity that makes for a compelling palate.",89,Vintage Cowboy 2016 Chardonnay (Paso Robles)
"Toasty oak yields a smoky nose, but the fruit aromas are mild and hidden, showing only basic apple notes. With ample oak, the wine is slightly resiny in feel, with tropical fruit flavors followed by a wave of oak flavor. Ditto on the finish, which feels solid and good.",86,Quintay 2009 Clava Coastal Reserve Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)
"How do you make a Riesling this good and sell it for seven bucks? Juicy and fruity, it's absolutely loaded with citrus and stone fruit flavors, but offers supporting acidity, good length, and a touch of minerality.",88,The Ghost in the Machine 2011 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A Southern Rhône-style blend of 62% Grenache, 31% Cinsault and 7% Syrah, this is loaded with flavors of wild herb and bright berry. From the Cinsault comes a hint of mushroom, while the Syrah lends muscle and peppery fruit. This has excellent concentration, complex flavors and appealing length.",91,Covington 2008 Artisan Series Ma Belle Red Red (Yakima Valley)
"This vintage mixes fruit from Red Mountain and Alder Ridge (in the Horse Heaven Hills). Aromatic and soft, it's a five-grape Bordeaux-style blend, half Cabernet Sauvignon, and it carries that grape's herbal stamp. Tannins are a bit earthy, but the time in bottle has smoothed their rough edges. Drink up!",87,Hightower 2010 Murray Cuvée Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"From a vineyard at the western end of the Côtes de Provence, this is a smooth, caramel and spice-flavored wine. It has a tangy herbal character that brings a contrast to the bright red fruits. Drink now.",88,Château Fontaine 2016 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Despite what increasingly looks like a weak vintage, the pedigree of this vineyard shines through, making the best of a bad situation. The wine is nowhere near Longoria's wonderful 2004 and 2005, but shows a classic, silky mouthfeel and enough cherry, currant and clove flavors to satisfy. Drink now.",88,Longoria 2006 Fe Ciega Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Rock-solid aromas of toasty oak, black fruits and leather are textbook for Ribera del Duero. This is structurally sound, with deep earthy blackberry, coffee and chocolate flavors that announce quality wood work. A long warm toasty finish means this ends as well as it opens. Drink through 2020.",92,García Figuero 2012 12 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"Cool, subtle aromas of cola, rooty black cherry and blackberry precede a flush, racy, tannic palate. Toasted, roasted blackberry flavors come with accents of coconut and peppery spice, while coconutty oak returns on the finish. Drink through 2022.",91,Marqués de Cáceres 2008 Gran Reserva  (Rioja)
"Light and crisp, this wine has a smooth apple flavor and soft acidity. It is fragrant and fruity, with some sweetness on the finish. It would make for a good apéritif.",84,Domaine du Vissoux NV Blanc de Blancs Brut  (Crémant de Bourgogne)
"Fleshy, opulent and exotic, this offers tropical notes reminiscent of apricot and mango that finish rich and warm, with odd spice notes.",83,Yellow Tail 2016 Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia)
"Lemon, mineral dust and quince aromas lead the invigorating nose. The light-bodied palate is snappy with acidity, yet balanced, and shows juicy lemon-lime upfront. While short, the finish is quinine in nature, making this zesty sipper a perfect partner for briny shellfish.",87,Blustone 2013 Chardonnay (Leelanau Peninsula)
"Even in inland Alentejo, the Portuguese think of the ocean and of seafaring. This smooth, fruity wine, with its soft tannins and touch of spice, is ready to drink. With a round texture, rich berry fruits and balanced acidity, it is a fine, fruity wine for now.",88,Herdade de São Miguel 2014 Atlântico Red (Alentejano)
"Soft, ripe and fruity, this lightly spicy wine is full of red fruits and crisp acidity. It balances between the fruit and the tangy, textured aftertaste. Drink now.",86,Château Tassin 2016 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
"A big, rubbery, gaseous nose is not clean, welcoming or lush. That said, this tannic, hard-bodied Tempranillo is pumping savory oak flavors as well as baked blackberry, baking spice and salty notes. A toasty, massive finish simmers away before spilling hard tannins and overt oak. Drink 2016–2022.",91,Muga 2010 Torre Muga  (Rioja)
"This wine, even at the age of four-plus years, remains dry, tannic and acidic. It has modest raspberry and cherry jam fruit, but isn't going anywhere.",85,Due Cani 2009 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
This off-dry Riesling offers an abundance of juicy lemon and green apple refreshment. It's approachable and fresh with a lingering sweetness that's not at all cloying. The finish is brisk and clean.,87,Max Ferd. Richter 2014 Mülheimer Sonnenlay Zepplinlabel Riesling (Mosel)
"While initially quite closed, time and aeration seem to replace dusty mineral and smoke tones on the nose of this dry rosé with prettier notes of blossom and cherry. It's delicately concentrated but revitalizing and refreshing.",87,Wagner 2015 Rosé of Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes)
Aromas of herb and red fruit lead to dried out but lightly gamy fruit flavors.,85,Basel Cellars 2013 Estate Double River Vineyard Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Sweaty citrus aromas are neither focused nor friendly. This feels flat and greasy, while it tastes like chicken fat and bitter citrus fruits. Nothing on the finish brings it around.",81,Val de Los Frailes 2014 Rosado (Cigales)
"This wine comes from hills well inland in Provence, giving it a fresh, lively character. It is rich but the strawberry fruitiness is dominant and finishes the wine with delicious acidity. The blend is 50% Grenache, 35% Cinsault, 35% Syrah; there was no barrel aging.",90,Château Carpe Diem 2014 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Zesty lime pith and lemon notes abound in this lively off-dry Riesling. It's feather-light in body yet radiant, offering loads of pristine tangerine and apricot flavors. It's juicy and approachable yet effortlessly elegant. A widely appealing sip to enjoy from now to 2021.",91,Balthasar Ress 2015 Hattenheim Schützenhaus Kabinett Riesling (Rheingau)
"Delicate aromas of wild berry, crushed violet, baking spice and a whiff of menthol take shape in the glass. The firm palate offers ripe black cherry, ground pepper, clove and licorice while fine-grained tannins provide polished support. Drink through 2020.",92,Livernano 2011 Casalvento Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico)
"Light wisps of raspberry and strawberry highlight a restrained sense of winemaking, allowing soft tannin to buoy the fruit and medium acidity.",90,Corner 103 2012 Merlot (Alexander Valley)
"One of the two luxury wines from Château d'Esclans, Les Clans is rich, wood-aged and full of ripe and rounded fruit flavors. With the extra year of aging, it has lost some initial freshness but has gained complexity and structure. The wine is full-bodied while remaining very stylish. Drink now.",91,Château d'Esclans 2012 Les Clans Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This lively white opens with aromas of peach blossom, crushed stone and whiff of toasted nut while the linear palate shows yellow peach, lemon zest and vibrant acidity. A mineral note closes the finish.",88,Tercic 2013 Ribolla Gialla (Collio)
"This eponymous label of winemaker Nathaniel Rose is one of his many endeavors in the Michigan wine scene. While the name “Left Bank” evokes Bordeaux, this is clearly a New World-style red, boasting bouncy fruit aromas of dark cherry and spiced raspberry, with cola and cough-syrup notes in the background. The medium-bodied palate is supported by grainy tannins, yet there's a good balance of juicy, red fruit and streaks of granite.",87,Nathaniel Rose 2012 Left Bank Abigail's Vineyard Domaine Barrien Cabernet Sauvignon (Lake Michigan Shore)
"At the age of nearly five years, this Syrah is soft, mellow and sweet. It has flavors of raspberry jam, bacon, brown sugar and cinnamon spice. Won't get any better, so drink up.",86,Azari 2008 Shiraz (Sonoma Coast)
"Heavy oak aromas sit atop wiry plum and spice scents. This feels tannic and tough, with up-front oak and herbal berry flavors. A dry tannic, spicy finish features palpable oak that tastes forced and like plastic.",84,Venta Morales 2015 Made With Organic Grapes Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"Smoky, brambly notes persist from nose to finish on this dry, intensely savory Pinot Gris. Fresh lemon and apple flavors on the palate are concentrated, but finish on a green, vegetal tone.",86,Blümel 2013 Kirchberg Grauburgunder (Rheinhessen)
"Here's a spicy selection, with aromas of black pepper and cherry accompanied by smoky tones. The palate delivers ripe black-cherry and white pepper flavors in a fresh and enjoyable style that's meant to be drunk young.",87,Zenato 2011  Valpolicella Superiore
"Crème brûlée informs the creamy backbone of an otherwise high-toned Chardonnay, the acidity brisk on the palate without veering over the edge. Layers of apple and pear give additional lift in between a yeasty texture.",91,Fritz 2012 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Soft and sweetly jammy, with a thick mouthfeel and lush flavors of blackberry jam, melted chocolate and anise liqueur. Okay for BBQ.",83,Cupcake 2007 Petite Sirah (Central Coast)
"The largest of the Beaujolais crus makes relatively soft wine, and this is no exception. It has open fruit flavors dominated by red berries and tinged with acidity. The background is soft tannins and the foreground is all fruit.",88,Château de la Terrière 2006  Brouilly
"A vibrantly aromatic wine, with notes of petrol, marmalade, citrus and flowers. It's rich and honeyed, with a lightly smoky, lingering finish.",91,Cave Spring 2011 Indian Summer Select Late Harvest VQA Riesling (Niagara Peninsula)
"Fruity and fresh, this easygoing semidry Riesling offers heaps of sweet peach and citrus flavors. It's not complex, but is crisply balanced with a clean, refreshing finish. Drink now.",87,Sun Garden 2015 Riesling (Nahe)
"Spicy, peppery, herbal aromas are meaty, a bit leafy and blackened. Prickly, lively acidity creates tension and tightness on the palate, while blackened plum and berry flavors end dry, dark and toasty.",87,Cousiño-Macul 2014 Syrah (Maipo Valley)
"A great value wine, this fruity Syrah opens with bright blueberry, cherry and plum woven between subtle nuances of leather, spice and smoked bacon.",86,Tasca d'Almerita 2009 Sallier de la Tour Syrah (Sicilia)
"With feline aromas of juniper bush, grass and sweaty citrus, this is true Sauvignon Blanc. Oak aging has lent an easiness to the mouthfeel, which shows good acidity. Flavors of green fruits, melon and pithy bitterness end in chalky clarity. This is one of Argentina's best Sauvignon Blancs.",89,O. Fournier 2010 Alfa Crux Sauvignon Blanc (Uco Valley)
"A deep amber color and a rich, almost thick mouthfeel support tempting aromas and flavors like honey, orange marmalade and toasted almonds. Complex and interesting, it's super sweet and syrupy, but still stays light in weight.",90,Monte Volpe 2011 Dolce Alexandra Late Harvest Tocai Friulano (Mendocino County)
"Classic Nebbiolo aromas of red berry, leather, crushed flower and a balsamic note unfold in the glass. The full-bodied palate doles out juicy black cherry, licorice and tobacco alongside firm, refined tannins. Drink 2018–2026.",93,Mirafiore 2011  Barolo
"So upfront in spectacularly ripe raspberry, cherry and mocha flavors, it's hard to keep from draining the bottle now. This shows the classic tannins of Stags Leap, soft and sweet but potent. Drink it now and enjoy for sheer opulence, but you might be missing out on something really special around 2016.",94,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2008 Fay Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Fresh herb and green floral aromas lend a breezy, invigorating character to sweet yellow peach and honey flavors in this medium-sweet Riesling. Rich and fruity, yet bristling with tart tangerine acidity, it's a deeply satisfying sipper.",91,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt 2012 Piesporter Goldtröpfchen GL Spätlese Riesling (Mosel)
"Yellow pear, fresh-squeezed lime, light mint and wet-cement aromas show on the brisk nose of this bottling by veteran Adam Tolmach. A grippy texture and lively acidity frame the palate, where green apple and lime flavors show. It's clean, pure and easy.",89,Ojai 2014 McGinley Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Plum and currant aromas are supported by asphalt, dried leather, herbal hints and grit on the bouquet. The palate is full, ripe and steady, while flavors of currant and wild berry are peppery and spicy. An elegant, lightly toasted finish is what this fine Cabernet deserves and delivers. Drink through 2022.",92,Echeverria 2011 Founder's Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"This shows dark berry aromas with hints of toast and sandalwood. The palate delivers black fruits layered with licorice, spice and espresso, but it's a bit shy on length.",87,Fattoria di Grignano 2009 Grignano  (Chianti Rufina)
"Great fruit concentration and depth give power to this full-bodied wine from Cakebread, better known for its Napa-grown Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay. Not tricked up with too much oak, it tastes energized, deep and layered. Black cherry, rhubarb and cedar fan out across the palate, lingering a long time on the finish. Best from 2018.",93,Cakebread 2014 Two Creeks Vineyards Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"A layer of toast accompanies the principal aromas of white apricot and papaya. It feels slack and cushiony, with ripe tropical flavors.",83,Bluestone 2011 Viognier (Virginia)
"Deep ruby in color, this wine has a nose of black cherry and green bell pepper. The well-balanced flavor profile features notes of cherry, strawberry, smoked meat, Mediterranean herbs and eucalyptus. A network of generous tannins supports a persistent sensation of brightness on the side palate and smoky notes across the center of the tongue.",92,Jerusalem Wineries 2013 3400 Premium Cabernet Sauvignon (Judean Hills)
"Medium to dark pink in color, this semi-dry rosé has aromas of rose petals, freshly picked cherries and cherry blossoms. It has just the right touch of sweetness and flavors of early summer strawberries and dried rose hips. In the mouth it shows roundness and the finish shines with pronounced astringency.",88,Batič 2012 Semi-Dry Rosé (Vipavska Dolina)
"This ripe, rich wine can't quite get around its alcohol level, which is 15.8%. That gives it some heat, as well as a sweetness that makes the blackberries, cherries and raspberries taste like jam. Earns points for the clean, unapologetic interpretation of Paso Robles fruit.",87,Cerro Prieto 2008 Paso Bordo Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Bernardot is a bold and plump expression of Barbaresco with soft, ripe tannins and expressive aromatic layers of cherry, plum, prune and new leather. The elegance and detailed nature of Nebbiolo shines through but the emphasis here is on opulence and richness overall.",92,Ceretto 2006 Bricco Asili Bernardot  (Barbaresco)
"Blended almost equally with Sauvignon Blanc and Semillon, and aged in French oak, this white Bordeaux-style wine has plenty to like. It's ripe in Meyer lemons, limes, tropical fruits and peaches, brightened with crisp acidity. Finishes a little lush and ripe.",86,Pure Cru 2010 Purety White (Napa Valley)
"Aromas of tree bark, cola, mushroom and black olive get this Cab going, while on the palate it keeps that savory-over-fruity character by showing meaty, mildly herbal flavors. It's full, a bit tannic and grabby. But overall it has an honest feel and integrity.",87,Caliterra 2005 Tribute Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"It's not often that you see Charbono in a Cabernet bottling, but it works. This wine boasts aromas of ripe cassis, red cherry and woody chocolate. The tannins are pronounced and chalky, giving a full mouthfeel, with sharp flavors of tart cherry and a strong acidity.",91,Sextant 2012 Kamal Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Merlot and Syrah are added to Portuguese varieties to give a solid and fruit-driven wine. Rich berries and generous tannins are dominant partners, with juicy acidity giving balance. It's a wine that is ready to drink, full of fruit and generous.",87,Quinta Vale do Armo 2011 Vila Jardim Tinto Red (Tejo)
"This is soft, rounded and light. Baked apples and a creamy texture come with a refreshing burst of acidity tempered by a lightly toasty character. The wine is ready to drink.",85,Louis Chevallier 2013  Bourgogne
"This is a blend of Grenache Noir and Syrah. It's enormously rich in blackberry, cherry and cola fruit, with a long, spicy finish. It's a flashy wine, with its glycerine lending an overall softness.",87,Epiphany 2009 Revelation Red (Santa Barbara County)
"Atypically gold in color, this also smells atypically ripe, of red apples and strawberries. Flavors are of baked Golden Delicious, complete with a dusting of cinnamon. Low acid makes it plump, and it finishes short.",85,Merk 2001 Pinot Grigio (Friuli Aquileia)
"The vineyard has been a consistent source of good to great Pinot Noirs for Paraiso winery. Now La Rochelle dips into it, with successful results. It's a dry, elegantly silky but complex wine, with an array of cherry, raspberry, rose flower, cinnamon spice and smoky vanilla flavors, heightened with crisp acidity. Drink now.",90,La Rochelle 2005 Paraiso Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"This opens with subdued, mature yellow apple, acacia and almond aromas that carry over to the abrupt, tangerine-inflected palate. It has a lean, bitter finish.",85,La Rajade 2015 Pinot Grigio (Collio)
"Light floral aromas and more rich and savory flavors make this wine satisfying to drink. It's light-bodied, fairly soft in texture and has a light sugary finish.",86,Geyser Peak 2014 Pinot Grigio (California)
"Superoaky in vanilla, buttered toast, honey and smoky flavors, this Chardonnay stands up to all that wood power with ripe pineapples, pears and lemons. It's a delicious, New World wine meant to dazzle, and it largely succeeds.",88,William Hill Estate 2008 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Pair this Syrah with the right food, and it will be fantastic. The wine does need some intervention via pairings to tame its exuberantly ripe red fruits, mocha and smoky oak.",87,J. Lohr 2009 Gesture Syrah (Paso Robles)
"A cranberry-cherry flavor permeates this light-bodied, crisp and fruity wine. The aromas are as bright as the flavors, and it's also lively in texture.",86,786 Wines 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"A dark, brooding and concentrated wine, this boasts rich black-fruit aromas and flavors of blackberry, boysenberry and cherry that are flecked with accents of tar, licorice, leather and peppery curing spice. Additional notes of tea leaves, sweet spice, licorice root and chicory grace the finish. The texture is like crushed velvet, with spicy tannins that linger long. Delicious now, but this should age well through 2022.",93,Fable Mountain 2011 Syrah (Tulbagh)
"The delicate but intriguing nose on this wine from young but experienced vintner Michael Callahan shows dried honey, lemon blossoms, beach sand, yellow cake and a touch of coconut shavings. It's rich and waxy on the palate, with flavors of cooked Meyer lemon, yellow flowers and a petrol-driven grip.",91,MaidenStoen 2013 Coast View Vineyard  Chualar Canyon Riesling (Monterey County)
"This has smooth, rich fruit, with sweet berries, ripe tannins and strong layers of wood. The wine is powerful; the stalky and bitter chocolate edge contrasts the sweet, ripe fruit. This is meant for long-term aging.",93,Château Olivier 2009  Pessac-Léognan
"A delicate balance of geranium, peach blossom and ginger cookie shows on the nose and palate, with an additional herbal hop notes chiming in for the flavors. There's good acidic verve to counterattack the broad palate, making this rich white a solid choice for cedar-plank grilled fish.",86,Brennan 2015 Viognier (Texas)
"This presents a rather fresh take on this often extracted grape, with raspberry and boysenberry juice, black pepper, dried strawberries and a touch of wild mint. There are nice coffee elements on the palate, along with sage and brown spices, but the boysenberry and fresh purple fruits shine throughout.",91,Cinnabar 2012 Burbank Vineyard Tempranillo (Paso Robles)
"Tight, angular aromas of cranberry, red plum, crushed mineral and dried leaves lead to a tough palate with black fruit flavors led by prune. A very concentrated, powerful wine based on Carignan and Syrah, with lemony oak and pounding tannins. Should be more tame by now; hold another year or two, and keep your fingers crossed.",87,Miguel Torres 2005 Cordillera Reserva Privada Red (Central Valley)
"A dry wine to be sure, although one with great fruit as well as a rich texture from the 80% Pinot Noir in the blend. It is a crisp elegant wine with its citrus and apple flavors along with the fine tight acidity. This bottling is still young and, like any dry Champagne, needs to age. Drink from 2018.",94,Lombard et Cie NV Brut Nature Verzenay Grand Cru  (Champagne)
"This appellation blend is one of the more well-rounded Sauvignon Blancs on the market, with dried lime, Anjou pear, herb and apple cider scents on the nose. The palate is both grassy and mineral, its wet pavement flavors intertwined with pine needle and grapefruit pith.",90,Dragonette 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
"Rich notes of ripe peach and plum hover over more homely, ripe apple fruit. This enticing nose announces yet another Viennese field blend of immense and immediate charm. The idea here is of an easy-drinking but never facile wine of total local character that expresses typicity, freshness and joy. The verve of fresh lemon zestiness carries from the first sip to the last crisp echo of aftertaste. This is lip smacking and moreish.",90,Mayer am Pfarrplatz 2015 White (Wiener Gemischter Satz)
"The aromas of coffee, chocolate and exotic spices are brooding. Flavors are concentrated and layered, showing a good sense of texture and a light grip of tannins. The oak needs time to fully integrate.",92,Woodinville Wine Cellars 2012 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Thick, raisiny and a heavy on first take, with meaty aromas. Feels jammy and soft, but the middle layers aren't well defined. Tastes dark and sweet, with fig, prune and lemony oak. Bulky, but struggles to reach a higher plane.",85,Morandé 2008 Edición Limitada Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley)
"This is an appealing Chardonnay. It's a little sweet in apricot jam, peach, green apple, honey and buttered toast flavors, but the sweetness is balanced with crisp, citrusy acidity and a nice cut of minerality.",87,Grove Street 2009 Dijon Clone Block Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley)
"Facing almost due south, this Premier Cru vineyard produces some impressively rich wines. This bottling from the crisp 2014 vintage still shows ripe character, contrasting deliciously with intense acidity. The balance is just right, with a structure built to age. Drink from 2019.",93,La Chablisienne 2014 Mont de Milieu Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"The raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors are delicious, and the oak brings just the right touch of sweet, smoky toast. The tannins are rich and fine, and the palate bears a streak of citrusy acidity that cuts right down the middle. It should mellow with 5–6 years in the bottle.",88,Williams Selyem 2010 Vista Verde Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Benito County)
"Previously from all Seven Hills vineyard grapes, this estate bottling now sources almost half its grapes from the high-altitude, mineral-driven Ferguson vineyard. Peppery spices elevate the nose, leading into a young, tight wine with compact cranberry and strawberry fruit. The depth and minerality are exceptional.",91,L'Ecole No. 41 2011 Estate Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of scorched soil, used leather and game. The aromas follow over to the funky palate along with mature plum and black pepper. It's already accessible, with evolved tannins. Enjoy soon.",87,Guicciardini Strozzi 2011 Sòdole Sangiovese (Toscana)
"This wine has herbal, floral aromas and a candied lemon flavor. Medium-bodied, it is fruitier and seemingly sweeter than many of its peers.",82,Peltier 2014 Hybrid Sauvignon Blanc (Lodi)
"This fresh, softly mellow and creamy wine is utterly captivating with bright summer red-berry and tree-fruit, vanilla, cherry liqueur, brown sugar and toast flavors. Absolutely delicious now, it is a silky feast for the senses and should easily negotiate the next 8–10 years.",92,Williams Selyem 2011 Olivet Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"A hard, piercing blackberry aroma forms the greeting on this full-bodied, dark-styled Merlot. Look for roasted, peppery black-fruit flavors and a spice-dominant finish that comes with mint and herbal notes.",86,Casa Silva 2010 Reserva Merlot (Colchagua Valley)
"Smoky and with strong wood flavors, this wine also has an attractive crisper edge that gives it a bright character. A lively wine, it's both rich and crisp. Drink now.",87,Meurgey-Croses 2015 Vieilles  (Viré-Clessé)
"Opening with a creamy tropical fervor, this wine is rich and rewarding in pineapple and a touch of lemongrass, its acidity lingering and supportive of the ripe fruit.",90,Broman 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Simple and fruity, this has crisp apple and grapefruit flavors. It is light and refreshing and is ready to drink over the next few months.",85,Louis Max 2010 Saint-Jean  (Chablis)
"This unoaked Chard has a somewhat Chablilsienne quality to it, with a beautiful mineral-driven freshness supported by delicate aromas of white peach, green apple and lively orange citrus. Light and immensely refreshing, it's a perfect apértitif sipper to be enjoyed with cheese and crudité.",86,Heron Hill 2008 Ingle Vineyard Unoaked Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"Classically powerful and rich, this is a concentrated wine. With spice from the wood aging prominent, it is still young. That spice is balanced by the ripe yellow and baked-apple fruits. The aftertaste has delicious flavors of honey and lemon. Drink this wine from 2020.",93,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2014  Corton-Charlemagne
"After starting out quite reduced, this wine offers aromas of vanilla, barrel spices, flowers and earth. The flavors show a lot of restraint for the variety but the reduction is hard to get around.",86,Kestrel 2012 Signature Petit Verdot (Yakima Valley)
"Soft and fruity, this has gentle flavors of pear, citrus and white fruit that are balanced with light acidity. Drink now.",85,Louis Max 2010 Beaucharme  (Bourgogne)
"Lightly toasty in character, this is a rich and creamy wine. Here the Alvarinho, far south of its home territory, shows a warm, ripe side with a tropical and yellow fruit character. The aftertaste is full and fruity.",90,Ribafreixo 2013 Gáudio Alvarinho (Alentejo)
"Grapes from Grand Cru vineyards on the Montagne de Reims and Côte des Blancs go into this elegant wine. A crisp, tight, mineral character is balanced by the crisp apple flavor and fresh acidity. This bottling has some age so is quite ready to drink.",92,Baron-Fuenté NV Esprit Grand Cru Brut  (Champagne)
"As it develops in bottle, this wine retains all its intense acidity. But it has now brought in a toast and yeast character that gives it even greater complexity. It is a wine that is also a Champagne, now in full flow of mineral richness, still with a long way to develop.",95,Duval-Leroy 1996 Cuvée Femme Brut  (Champagne)
An appealing nose of pepper and chocolate lead to raspberry and spice flavors that are balanced by medium tannins and an acidity that offers a mineral spin. Good and accessible.,84,Casa Rondeña Winery 2005 Cabernet Franc (New Mexico)
"Tight and tart, wrapped up in a core of smoky black currant fruit. The acids seem a bit adjusted, and the wine needs time to breathe open, but the main thing is that it's a clean and well-defined evocation of the almost 40-year-old vineyard, the oldest in the Rattlesnake Hills.",87,Bonair 2006 Morrison Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rattlesnake Hills)
"A smoky tinge to the garnet color and savory, forest-floor aromas give a slightly earthy character to this deceptively full-bodied, fascinating wine. The flavors kick in vivid rhubarb, raspberry and pomegranate notes, while firm tannins, brisk acidity and a nice, dry mouthfeel add good structure.",93,Waits-Mast 2013 Nash Mill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"This Bordeaux-style blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot is shy and demure now, requiring a decant or time to air before opening up to reveal notes of red-plum flesh, muddled raspberry and soft sweet spice. Medium weight, with soft tannins and an herbal finish.",88,Domaine du Castel 2010 Petit Castel Red (Judean Hills)
"Perfumed green fruits, a crisp texture and layers of tight acidity all point to a wine that is too young to drink. Its hints of ripe white fruits and tangy orange peel are still developing. Drink from 2017.",88,Nicolas Gaudry 2014  Pouilly-Fumé
"Off-dry to sweet in style, this has lime, mango and honey flavors that are balanced by crisp acidity.",85,Armida 2011 Antidote White (Sonoma County)
"This wine offers pleasing aromas of raspberry, coffee bean and butterscotch. It is easy on entry, with flavors of cherry, cranberry, toffee, mocha and mint. Soft tannins glide over the palate into the almond-toffee finish.",89,Recanati 2015 Yasmin Red Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Galilee)
"Plum and berry aromas come with a floral accent. This feels raw and a touch abrasive, with woody, saucy flavors of berry fruits and plum. The oaky, heavily spiced finish brings a grippy tannic feel.",86,Calcu 2012 Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"Intensely aromatic with notes of orange blossom, honey and tangerines, this juicy, fruity Riesling is delicate in body with a refreshingly crisp acidity. Whiffs of lanolin and dried herbs add complexity and finesse.",91,Dr. Loosen 2011 Erdener Treppchen Spätlese Riesling (Mosel)
"Named after the traditional boat used on the Douro River, this dessert wine, made from 50% Tempranillo, 34% Touriga Nacional and 16% Tinta Cao, is a muddy brown-red color and shows aromas of concentrated raisin and turned earth. Pipe smoke, prunes, kirsch and caramel flavors combine for a very lasting finish, allowing this to function much like Scotch and work well with cigars.",88,Quinta Cruz 2008 Rabelo Pierce Ranch Port (San Antonio Valley)
"Sourced entirely from the Winter's Hill vineyard, this is a lively mix of raspberry, lime, pineapple and cherry candy. Young and tart, it needs more time to flesh out and show more detail. Currently the baking spice accents from aging in one-third new oak, appealing as they are, stick out a bit. Give this until 2016 or so to bottle age.",90,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2012 AVA Series Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"A concentrated, inky black wine with woodshop tones that are still very evident. Let this wine settle five years to allow for prettier spice tones and more delicacy in terms of its fruit. This is a big chewy wine at this stage with blockbuster tannins. Drink after 2015.",92,Tenuta I Greppi 2004 Greppicaia  (Bolgheri Superiore)
"A very soft-textured Cab, unusual for its high-elevation origins, with sweet red fruit and dark plum nestled around a trace of chocolate.",87,Lava Cap 2009 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (El Dorado)
"This opens with floral aromas of violet, iris and a whiff of sunbaked earth. The straightforward palate offers wild black cherry and a hint of dark spice alongside polished tannins. Enjoy through 2018.",87,Carpineto 2015  Chianti Classico
"Too ripe for balance or longevity, the blackberry and currant flavors in this Cab veer into raisins, with a bitter finish. It's also soft and very oaky, more like a warm, interior valley wine than one from this fine appellation. Drink now.",84,Matthew Daniel 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"Pinched and fiery at first, the bouquet on this Mallorcan blend evolves to show earthy cherry and plum scents. A flush, mouthfilling body is dry and classy. Flavors of baked, earthy, savory cherry and plum come with a load of spice and herbal accents, while the finish is fit and complex. Drink through 2015.",90,Ànima Negra 2010 Àn/2 Red (Vi de la Terra Mallorca)
"This tastes like a warm climate, soft, round Cabernet, full-bodied and etched in dark, smoky tannins. The alcohol reaches 14.8% but does not burn; the fruit is a mix of figs and plums and ripe black cherries. Already four years old, it's drinking very well now and may be at its best over the next couple of years.",87,Pheasant Valley Winery 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (OR))
"A fruit and barrel style predominates on this wine, with aromas of Mounds Bar and spice playing off the variety's red and black fruit. The flavors are elegantly styled yet bring a pretty texture followed by a tart, cranberry-filled finish.",90,Goose Ridge 2011 Estate Bottled Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
Olive and espresso notes are backed by bright cherry fruit in this medium-bodied Syrah. It's a pleasant quaff that turns slightly dry on the finish; try it after 2011.,86,Paul Jaboulet Aîné 2005 Le Grand Pompée  (Saint-Joseph)
"Gritty, roasted berry aromas are rubbery and hint at Band-Aids. In the mouth, this is O.K. in feel, albeit a bit jammy and thick. Short, generic berry flavors come with minty accents and some green on the finish.",84,Rutini 2012 Trumpeter Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"This rich and seductive pour leads with intense aromas of buttered toast, candied nuts, honeydew and grilled peach, with a touch of orangy citrus. The medium-weight mouthfeel is plush yet balanced by medium acidity that lends nice vibrancy to the mouthfeel and spicy finish. Drink now–2019.",91,Alheit 2014 Radio Lazarus Single Vineyard Chenin Blanc (Western Cape)
"A relatively light-tasting wine from a sometimes heavy grape variety, this shows a mix of savory and fruit flavors, including cucumber, celery and white pepper. It tastes dry and almost austere, which is appealing in the right pairing, such as with goat cheese on toast.",87,Acquiesce 2015 Viognier (Lodi)
"Partly a blend of old vines in a field blend, this fruity wine with its tropical aromas and pink grapefruit and pineapple flavors is crisp and taut with a mineral texture. It is intense, the fruitiness given a firm shape by the tangy acidity. Drink now.",88,Quinta do Pôpa 2016 Pôpa Branco White (Douro)
"The aromas on this wine are quite reserved, while the flavors bring down a hammer of rich, tightly coiled, jammy black fruit flavors. If the aromas and flavors come together it goes up a notch or two.",90,Full Pull & Friends 2012 Angela's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"A solid effort for North Fork Cabernet, which has a tendency towards inconsistency. This has dark cassis fruit underlined by a weedy, herbal streak and a dried-fruit nuance as well.",84,Gristina 1998 Cabernet Sauvignon (North Fork of Long Island)
"Aromas of underbrush, scorched earth, mature dark berry, menthol and dark baking spice lead the nose. The full-bodied palate delivers dried black cherry, licorice, chewing tobacco and clove while ripe, bracing tannins provide structure. Drink 2019–2029.",91,Luigi Oddero & Figli 2009 Vigna Rionda  (Barolo)
"A good wine. It's nicely dry, with crisp acids and adequate tannins. There's a pretty good balance between plum and berry flavors and earthy, herbal ones. It's rough around the edges, with a burnt-rubber quality, but okay drinking for everyday occasions. —S.H.",84,Coastal Ridge 2000 Shiraz (California)
"While easy to grow in Virginia's vintage-variant climate, there still needs to be some work in the cellar for this Southwestern France transplant. The bottling is a variety of flavors and textures that don't quite seem to meld: honeycomb wax, citron and a slight char seem disjointed on the flabby palate.",83,Winery at La Grange 2014 Catherine's Vineyard Petit Manseng (Virginia)
"Not showing well now due to the tannins. It's dry and tough, with a resistance to the richness. Yet the core of flavor is enormous. Shows concentrated, flashy flavors of cherry marmalade, raspberry, orange blossom, cola, licorice, rose tea and spices that go on and on and continue to develop in the glass. The texture is pure silk and satin. Needs 4–6 years to develop, and could go beyond that.",97,Williams Selyem 2007 Allen Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Passion fruit and citrus aromas are straightforward and a bit sharp. This feels lemony yet wan, with tangy, lean flavors of lemon-lime mixed with fresh green herbs. Notes of scallion and tarragon blend with lingering lime on the finish.",86,Inurrieta 2013 Orchidea Sauvignon Blanc (Navarra)
"Although this presents itself on the bouquet as being a bit soft and mealy, the palate is solid albeit chunky and blocky. Standard citrus and lemon flavors hold onto some tang on the finish. Overall, this is clean and friendly but a bit dull.",85,Concha y Toro 2012 Casillero del Diablo Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"Leather-boot black in color, this fine Petite Sirah is distinctive in herbal, almost eucalyptus aromas and intensely huge blackberry fruit. Earthy and soft with curtains of tannin, the wine is a complex version of the variety, rich. Age it until 2017–2021 and see if the eucalyptus mellows or intensifies.",92,Sean Thackrey 2010 Sirius Eaglepoint Ranch Petite Sirah (Mendocino County)
"While somewhat withdrawn aromatically, this Syrah has integrated flavors of cinnamon, plum and raspberry. It's structured with a tinge of sweetness and finishes on a leathery note.",86,Putah Creek 2009 Syrah (Solano County)
"For a rosé, this wine is hefty and bold, with strawberry and plum flavors, with a dash of earthiness. One reviewer found it too creamy; another found lots to like about its spicy, fresh-herb finish. With such diverse evaluations, this is a wine to try for yourself.",85,Morandé 2001 Edicion Limitada Rosé de Pinot Noir Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)
"A blend of 68% Cabernet Sauvignon and 32% Merlot, this offers aromas of high-toned red fruit, French-oak spice and herbs that lead to luxurious but still in-check dark-fruit flavors. Tart black-tea accents persist on the finish.",90,Soos Creek 2014 Soleil Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Attractive, softly fruity wine, with some citrus character as well as pear and apple juice. It is crisp, fresh, ready to drink. Winebow.",85,J. Portugal Ramos 2010 Loios Branco White (Alentejano)
"In its youth, this is intensely grassy, the grapefruit and green pepper flavors adding to the general crispness of the wine. It will be an attractive wine, full of pep, with a fine edge of minerality, spice and vivid white fruits.",91,Château Ferrande 2008  Graves
"This is made from 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, with the balance Merlot and Cabernet Franc, all aged 22 months in half new French oak. It's brooding, with notes of dark chocolate, cherry and herbs. It shows more direct tannic heft than often seen at this site and will benefit from some time in the cellar.",91,Tamarack Cellars 2009 DuBrul Vineyard Reserve Red (Rattlesnake Hills)
"Soft and slightly sweet, this Pinot Grigio drinks like the syrup in a can of apricot and peach fruit.",81,Barra of Mendocino 2009 Pinot Grigio (Mendocino)
"Made with 63% Syrah and 37% Cabernet Sauvignon from Red Willow and Shaw vineyards, this appealing offering brings notes of plum, smoke and blue fruit. It's full bodied, plush and ripe in feel, with silky tannins supporting coffee and blue fruit flavors. A guaranteed crowd pleaser.",90,William Church 2011 2 Spires Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is ripe Chardonnay, maybe missing the more typical minerality but making up for it with the ripe apple and apricot fruits. The wine is now showing some good age while still retaining a fresh character. With its hints of almonds and vanilla, it balances fruit and maturity. Drink now.",93,Jean Laurent 2005 Blanc de Blancs Millésime Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)
"From the plateau that lies between the Loire and Vienne rivers, this is a firm, mineral structured wine. It has power and juicy red fruits that also show dark, dry tannins. It's a concentrated and dense wine for medium-term aging.",91,Jean-Maurice Raffault 2010 Les Picasses  (Chinon)
"Lovely, fresh and lightly sparkling, this vibrant, delightful wine opens with heady violet and red berry scents. The refined, almost ethereal palate delivers crushed raspberry, strawberry, tangerine and ginger notes alongside tangy acidity.",90,Cleto Chiarli NV Vecchia Modena Premium  (Lambrusco di Sorbara)
"Clean and crisp apricot, nectarine and green-melon aromas are typical for the variety. The solid, fresh palate is crystal clear, while flavors of peach and nectarine finish as smooth as glass.",90,Paco & Lola 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
Frappato is a light and fruit-forward Sicilian grape that makes a crisp and refreshing red wine that is often served slightly chilled with pasta or fish. Paolo Calì shows deep expertise with the variety and offers an extremely food-friendly expression with bright berry nuances.,86,Paolo Calì 2008 Mandragola  (Vittoria Frappato)
"This accessible Barolo leads with a pretty fragrance of crushed blue flower, wild rose and bright berry. The palate delivers Morello cherry, black raspberry and cinnamon notes alongside fresh acidity and supple tannins.",89,Virna Borgogno 2010  Barolo
"A blend of Sangiovese (53%), Cabernet Sauvignon (35%) and Merlot, this wine is aromatically locked up with notes of wet copper penny, cherry and herbs. The flavors are soft in feel with the oak seemingly dialed back. With time, the aromas and flavors may join together better.",85,SuLei 2012 Dona Rae Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This wine brings aromas of bright flowers, fresh green herbs, green olive and lemony citrus. There is an exquisite sense of weight, balance and deftness to the palate that carries through the extended finish, with expertly managed tannins that back it all up. The green edges may turn off some, but others will look beyond it and find much to enjoy.",92,B. Leighton 2012 Petit Verdot (Yakima Valley)
"As always with a grand cru from Gevrey-Chambertin, this wine shows immense power. It is dominated by black fruits as well as signs of the 60% wood aging. Behind, the red cherry fruits are developing along with the lively acidity. It needs to age and should not be drunk before 2019.",95,Roche de Bellene 2012  Charmes-Chambertin
"Quite the classic, with rich toffee and nut-like aromas that come through with piercing power. The briny palate is all about dried citrus and nuts, while the earthy, long finish has an unmistakable and very nice mushroom quality. This is a precise, somewhat reserved and dainty amontillado, but it's structured and quite real as far as style and impact.",91,Sandeman NV Royal Esmeralda Fine Dry Amontillado Sherry (Jerez)
"Dark spice, camphor, menthol and crushed herb aromas take center stage in this wine. The palate offers dried black cherry, mocha and licorice flavors alongside assertive, close-grained tannins. A hint of candied orange zest signals the close.",88,Ca' del Baio 2014 Autinbej  (Barbaresco)
"This pure expression of Sangiovese delivers aromas of blackberry, plum and cassis, plus accents of spice and tobacco. It is easygoing and crisp, and it would pair well with grilled sausages or pork chops.",87,Pieve Vecchia 2008 Chorum  (Montecucco)
"This ripe wine is smooth and creamy, fresh with acidity and rich with red fruits. Open and generous, it will make a great apéritif.",86,Domaine du Grand Cros 2014 Jules Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Aromas of apple, citrus, hay and a whiff of medicinal herb carry over to rather lean palate along with a note of bitter almond. Racy acidity gives it a brisk finish.",86,Tiefenbrunner 2014 Pinot Grigio (Vigneti delle Dolomiti)
"Here's a soft, high alcohol, slightly hot Zin, lacking in acidity. What it lacks in structure, it more than makes up for in sheer, exuberant taste. Floods the mouth with raspberries, cherries, dried fruits, dates, bacon, prosciutto, vanilla, smoky sandalwood and all sorts of other umami flavors.",87,Rangeland 2007 Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"Fog Crest's Chardonnays have been getting sweeter and oakier, it seems, and this is their most desserty-sweet yet. It's like a vanilla cream cocktail, infused with pineapple liqueur, with a slice of tangerine.",87,Fog Crest 2008 Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"For a wine from this appellation, this is surprisingly soft. It has black fruits and tannins that are already softening. Spice and berry fruits are lifted by acidity. This fruity wine will be ready to drink from late 2017.",87,L. Tramier & Fils 2015 Collection  (Gevrey-Chambertin)
"Smells and tastes semisweet, with vanilla and molasses on the nose. The palate runs sweet as well, with root beer, brown sugar and brownie flavors. It's enjoyable and made right, but with less acidity and cut than many Sherries. Finishes with a mocha blast and some grabby thickness.",88,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L. NV Oloroso Sherry (Jerez)
"Crisp and steely, touched by white perfumes and intense acidity, this is a wine with a sharp blade of flavors that cut through the texture. Apples, citrus and kumquat all blend attractively together.",88,Willm 2009 Réserve Riesling (Alsace)
"Subtle aromas of white fruits, talc and powdered sugar are totally what they should be given that this is an extra dry Cava. The palate is a little sudsy and active, but the flavors of citrus and white pepper are balanced and not overly sweet or confected. Shows good clarity from start to finish.",87,Segura Viudas NV Extra Dry Sparkling (Cava)
"This is sourced from a longstanding, well-respected vineyard, and it does the windswept, foggy site justice. Tightly woven and youthful, it shows broad, juicy black cherry, wild strawberry, baking spice, compost and brawny oak flavors.",91,Anaba 2014 Las Brisas Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros)
On display here are bright aromas of red fruit and forest berry followed by deeper tones of dark chocolate and licorice. The wine is smooth and round with rich texture and well-proportioned sweetness on the close.,89,Zeni 2008  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"Except for a taste of cooked grapes, this is a pretty good Sangiovese. It's dry and crisp in acidity, with a nice earthiness behind the cherries. But you can taste the burnt berries that just got roasted under the hot sun of this vintage.",83,Pietra Santa 2004 Sangiovese (Cienega Valley)
"A good-value Cabernet Sauvignon that's straightforward in texture, body and structure. Its dark cherry and herbal tones are just right for meaty mid-week dishes, including that old standby, roast chicken.",85,Monogamy 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (North Coast)
"Light lemon and melon aromas lead the nose, but the wine slips in the mouth, becoming creamy and flabby in constitution, with only mild citrus, papaya and bitterness for flavors.",83,DiamAndes 2011 de Uco Viognier (Uco Valley)
"Summer flower aromas with touches of honey give an immediately attractive, fresh character. To taste, it's a crisp and steely wine, full of white fruits and a delicious juicy character. Drink now.",87,Willm 2013 Réserve Riesling (Alsace)
"Pleasant red fruits awash in chocolaty oak craft an accessible, broadly open Syrah. Though it seems a bit generic, it is balanced and tasty; a good bottle for near-term drinking with simple grilled meats.",87,Coeur d'Alene 2008 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Aromas of underbrush, menthol and a whiff of cellar floor carry over to the palate, along with dried cherry and licorice. Astringent tannins provide support.",87,Camigliano 2009 Gualto Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"A very faintly aromatic wine that has you leaning far into the glass searching for something. The palate drinks medium sweet with tropical flavors, but lacks the acidity to hold them together.",83,Willow Crest 2013 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Yakima Valley)
"Ripe and wood aged, full bodied and rounded, this is now mature. Its broad features are tempered by a shot of minerality and a steel note that add a crisp texture to the tropical fruits.",87,Georges Duboeuf 2009 Sélection  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
"This blend of 65% Grenache and 35% Mourvèdre from a very promising winery in Paso shows both primary Concord grape tones alongside deeper elderberry fruit on the nose, with Dr. Pepper and baking spice aromas as well. The palate is very candied with blackberry fruit and caramel, proving quite easy to drink if a tad on the sweeter side of dry.",90,Seven Oxen 2014 Cassidy Red (Paso Robles)
"Blossomy floral and bramble notes accent ripe black currant and raspberry flavors in this zesty blend of Dornfelder, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. It's plush and velvety in mouthfeel and maintains intensity through a moderately long finish. Drink now through 2018.",88,Weinreich 2014 Basisrot Red (Rheinhessen)
"The wine has ripe Merlot with red-berry fruit flavors and balanced tannins. It's fresh with the acidity of the year. Here it is contrasted with spice, a smooth surface texture and a ripe cherry aftertaste. This is an attractive wine to drink from 2017.",88,Château Tour Bayard 2013  Montagne-Saint-Émilion
"A rich, cherry- and black fig-flavored wine, layered with smokiness, some wood and a dry, firm core of tannins. There is a juicy quality from the blend's Blaufränkisch, while Cabernet Sauvignon lends the tannins. Aging over 3–4 years.",89,Schloss Halbturn 2004 Impérial Red (Burgenland)
"Sweet scents of toasty oak introduce this Syrah-based red wine. Soft and accessible, it has plenty of vanilla and tobacco notes, along with easy-drinking, light plum fruit.",86,The Ghost in the Machine 2010 Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Tart red currant, rhubarb and strawberry come together in a very refreshing, rounded and appetizing fashion. The frothy, foaming mousse is exuberant and highlights these strawberry shortcake flavors brilliantly, while a totally dry palate makes sure that this stays classy. This is very satisfying, fun and fruit-driven, with a serious core and a bright, lemony finish.",90,Lucien Albrecht NV Brut Rosé Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"With its fine aged-wood and fruit character, this is a sweet yet complex wine. Toast, almonds, a hint of spirit and the palate and delicate acidity all combine easily in a harmonious wine whose closest comparison is with a great amontillado.",91,Burmester NV 20-Year-Old White  (Port)
Delicate sweetness and lip-smacking juiciness come together in this off-dry Riesling. It's zesty and light-footed but chock full of peach and grapefruit nectar glazed with caramelized sugar. Drink now through 2018 to maximize its youthful energy.,88,Wagner 2013 Semi Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Completely dominated by oak, it offers aromas of toasted wood, vanilla and roasted coffee bean. The palate is extremely evolved, showing dried-up fruit, espresso and vanilla alongside the warmth of alcohol and astringent wood tannins.",86,Castiglion del Bosco 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
"A vibrantly fresh wine, its green fruit flavors positively glowing with acidity and lemon and tangerine flavors. There is some depth beneath all this fruitiness, giving structure. But, in the end, this is a lively, crisp wine. Screwcap.",86,Machherndl 2007 Kollmutz Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
Modest green-apple fruit is married to earthy grapefruit and lime flavors in this effort by Channing Daughters winemaker Larry Perrine.,83,Channing Perrine 1998 Oregon Road Riesling (Long Island)
"Grassy hints mingle with riper yellow pear notions. The palate turns out to be tenderly pear-fruited, with a core of warm ripeness and a slender, soft footprint of pear fruit salad. Incredibly elegant and fine-boned, notwithstanding its definition.",92,Leth 2013 Scheiben Roter Veltliner (Wagram-Donauland)
"The aromas are light, with notes of white flowers, green herbs and peach. The flavors are tart and elegant in style, seeming quite watery in concentration.",84,Kestrel 2015 Falcon Series Estate Viognier (Yakima Valley)
"Smooth, soft, rounded tannins envelop a taste of dried cranberry and bacon, giving a sense of gamy goodness. Robust in weight and power, it continues the theme with leathery girth, especially on the finish.",88,Pine Ridge 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"This Riserva Sangiovese from Central Italy opens with sweet notes of candied fruit and cherry followed by a light and lean feeling in the mouth. Try pairing it with a simple pizza marinara (with tomato, garlic and oregano).",87,Tre Monti 2009 Petrignone Riserva  (Sangiovese di Romagna Superiore)
"A blend of Merlot (60%), Cabernet Sauvignon (35%) and Cabernet Franc, this wine brings aromas of dried leaves, coffee, green pepper and black cherry. The blackberry and licorice flavors are full bodied, showing depth and lingering on the warm finish.",90,J. Bookwalter 2013 Conflict Conner-Lee Vineyard Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A sappy combo of spiced tomato, cinnamon and candied aromas makes for a sketchy nose. This blend of Syrah, Cabernet and Carmenère feels raw, while forced flavors of buttery oak clash with herbal berry fruit. Green and herbaceous on the finish.",82,La Playa 2014 Estate Series Red (Colchagua Valley)
"Here's a hearty blend of Sangiovese, Sagrantino and Merlot that opens with earthy aromas of tilled soil, truffle, tobacco and meat juice. The lush palate delivers juicy black cherry, blackberry, spearmint and thyme alongside rippling but refined tannins.",90,Milziade Antano 2010 Riserva  (Montefalco Rosso)
"Underbrush, oak, mature black fruit and a leather note lead the nose on this wine. The ripe palate begins with lush black cherry accented with grilled sage, thyme, black pepper, vanilla and mocha. But the fleeting tannins, soft acidity and lack of energy show this is already evolved. Drink through 2019.",87,PianCornello 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
"Aromas of this medium-bodied, un-oaked wine suggest sliced pears and apples, while the flavors are equally fruity but have a leaner feel. The texture is dry, firm and crisp, making this a great pairing for shellfish and many other dishes.",89,Wente 2015 Eric's Small Lot Unoaked Estate Chardonnay (Livermore Valley)
"A modestly flavored Chard, marked by dryness and acidity that make the mouth water, with a touch of green apple and nectarine fruit. Really needs food to enrich it.",84,Waterstone 2006 Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Previous vintages have impressed more than this one, which admittedly wasn't an easy year in Marlborough. The marriage of toasty oak and ripe fruit comes across as similar to popcorn, aligned with linear notes of pineapple and citrus that extend through the long, clean finish.",88,Cloudy Bay 2014 Chardonnay (Marlborough)
"This would pair perfectly with the sweet and savory qualities of a dish like Roman saltimbocca—veal scallops wrapped with prosciutto and sage. Black cherry, cassis, dark spice and tobacco flavors all play a part in the wine's appeal.",88,Arduini 2010  Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso
"Blackberry, violet and ash aromas rise toward a light vanilla and fudge profile on the nose of this bottling. The tannins are prominent on the tip of the sip, followed by raging acidity. Next juicy flavors of black fruit pleasingly commence, accented by purple flowers, white pepper and cocoa powder.",89,Le Vigne 2013 Di Ranchita Vista Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)
"Altaïr is a fortressed high-end Cabernet blend with mineral and charred aromas announcing a palate coated with dense berry flavors, tobacco, vanilla and balsamic notes. It's a complex wine that is fairly tough out of the bottle. Ideally it should be cellared for another three to five years.",93,Altaïr 2004 Altaïr Red (Cachapoal Valley)
"This is a smooth, attractively ripe and aromatic wine. It has soft black fruits, and full tannins. Developing quickly, it already shows attractive fruitiness Drink from 2016.",86,Château Tour Haut-Caussan 2011  Médoc
"Spicy, oaky aromas grab attention, followed by black plum and cherry flavors and a firm structure of tannins and acidity. This is full bodied and rather powerful in both flavor and mouthfeel.",87,Cartlidge & Browne 2013 Merlot (North Coast)
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah, Montepulciano, Sangiovese and a drop of Petit Verdot, this has aromas of pressed blue flower, dark-skinned berry and toast. The firm, straightforward palate offers black currant, clove and a hint of tobacco. Fine-grained tannins proved the frame work.",88,Tenuta La Badiola 2013 642° Il Canapone  (Maremma Toscana)
"Four clones comprise this vineyard blend, which opens into a moderately soft, well-rounded palate with sweet spice, pumpkin bread, a dash of Dr Pepper and plenty of strawberry and cherry fruit. It's already quite accessible and drinking deliciously. Pop this while waiting for some of the other 2013 Adelsheims to develop further in bottle.",92,Adelsheim 2013 Boulder Bluff Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"This presents the opulence that many Chardonnay fans enjoy. It bears flavors of caramel, orange, pineapple, tapioca, vanilla, honey and cinnamon, which are wrapped in a creamy texture.",86,River Road 2011 Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Coconut, smoke and sweet aromas of cola, berry jam and fine tobacco make the bouquet inviting. In the mouth, it maintains freshness due to good acidity, while the flavors of earthy blackberry and plum come across dense and right. Firm and tannic on the finish; drink from 2012–2016.",90,Finca El Quiñón 2008 Chafandin  (Ribera del Duero)
"Winemakers Hélène Garcin and Patrice Levêque have coaxed a ton of character from 70-year-old Malbec and Cabernet vines, and the result is juicy but dark, with asphalt and tar aromas sitting in front of tight but generous black fruit (cassis and blackberry). Finishing notes of coffee, mocha and char leave you happy.",93,Hélène Garcin 2003 Poesia Red (Mendoza)
"This delicious blend of Sangiovese, Barbera and Sagrantino opens with expressive floral scents of rose and violet alongside notes of berry and orange peel. The palate offers dense black cherry, white pepper and licorice notes balanced by big but polished tannins.",89,Tabarrini 2010  Montefalco Rosso
"This, like the winery's other wines from this remote northern region, carries a soupy, stewy, leathery set of aromas. In the mouth, the acidity level is high. Rustic, earthy flavors of beef stew, leafy berry fruits and marinara sauce finish blunt, oaky and herbal.",88,San Pedro 2010 1865 Limited Edition Syrah (Elqui Valley)
"From the only producer to source Zin from this famous vineyard, this wine is abundant in a complexity of baked bread, blackberry jam and vanilla, with endless depth on the palate. Fresh and juicy, it balances its fruitiness with mountain-sized tannin strength and concentration.",94,Robert Biale 2014 Stagecoach Vineyard Zinfandel (Napa Valley)
"Ripe sweet peach and nectarine flavors are slightly caramelized in this semidry Riesling. Its spry zesty demeanor is deeply refreshing though, finishing on a revitalizing citrus note. Drink now through 2018.",88,Konrad Hähn 2015 Piesporter Michelsberg Riesling (Mosel)
"An attractively round wine that's full both of fruit and acidity. The two complement each other well, highlighting the light apple and white peach fruits. The aftertaste is all about crisp, bright texture.",87,Kuentz-Bas 2012 Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
"A solid and nuanced sip of this varietal for a fair price, this bottling of older vines from Paso's eastern flanks shows plump elderberry and cedar on the elegant nose. A smoked-chocolate flavor hits the palate, bolstered by blackberry syrup, white pepper, bay leaf and dried basil, with plenty of both tannin and acid.",91,Clayhouse 2013 Old VInes Rio Cedar VIneyard Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)
"A light and elegant Malbec, soft and fruity with berry fruits and gentle tannins. It has a rounded, polished feel with light acidity at the end. Drink this year.",85,Pelvillain Frères 2012 Gariottin Sélection Malbec (Cahors)
"Rich and structured wine, this is full of opulent black fruits, sweet tannins and an immediately attractive smooth and juicy character. The wine has obvious weight and concentration. Ready to drink in the next 3–4 years.",91,Vieux Château Chauvin 2009  Saint-Émilion
"While this wine has pleasant fruit, there are also some dark edges of black berries and rough tannins. The focus is shaded, still developing.",87,Château Haut Bages Libéral 2007  Pauillac
"Rose, violet, wild berry and menthol aromas unfold in the glass. The bracing palate offers dried black cherry, licorice and clove alongside assertive, close-grained tannins that leave a mouth-puckering finish. Drink after 2020.",89,Carlo Giacosa 2010 Luca Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"This wine is a vineyard selection, aged in wood for 12 months. A structured blend of Fer Servadou and Cabernet Sauvignon, it has black fruits, firm tannins and acidity, all in balance. The wood aging is only a hint of smoothness with the rich fruit. Drink from 2018.",89,Domaine Laurens 2013 Cuvée de Flars  (Marcillac)
"A deliciously drinkable Pinot for drinking now with a great steak. Shows the good acidity of Carneros, with a light silky mouthfeel and ripe wild cherry, red currant, rose petal and white pepper flavors, accented with smoky, caramelized oak barrels.",89,La Crema 2008 Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"Seemingly overly oaked and manipulated, this is all about buttered toast and buttered popcorn flavors, slathered over a note of pineapple jam.",82,J. Wilkes 2010 Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"From the fine Spring Mountain appellation, this has sweet-and-sour flavors of apricots, pineapples and brown sugar.",82,Keenan 2006 Chardonnay (Spring Mountain District)
"This is quite light, with berry fruit running into tongue-scraping tannins. Flavors of earth and stem add still more grip and herbaceous character, outstripping the mild fruit.",87,Township 7 2014 Rock Pocket Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Okanagan Valley)
"Brooding aromas of lemon curd, fresh herb and citrus lead to broad citrus and herb flavors in this wine. It lacks concentration.",87,Januik 2016 Sagemoor Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This big, spicy wine is very smooth and rich now, but also has the potential to age. Dusty tannins, perfumed fruits and a rich dense character offer the potential to drink in a year. This is a great expression of Cahors.",90,Clos Troteligotte 2011 K-lys Malbec (Cahors)
"Dusty dark cherry and blackberry fruit dominate the nose, with secondary aromas of game, peppery spice and tobacco. The dark fruit character continues on the palate, transitioning into the finish, which is laced with hints of mocha and spice. Medium weight, with nice vibrancy in the mouth. Drink now-2015.",89,Lions Drift 2009 Silkbush Mountain Vineyards Pinotage (Breedekloof)
"Rubbery and warm on the nose, with earthy plum and blackberry aromas. The palate is full and bouncy, with appropriate plum, berry and cassis flavors. Nice for standard New World Cab, with fig, chocolate and no buttery, sloppy oak.",86,Bodega Norton 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"This wine is 35% Merlot, 34% Cabernet Franc, 27% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Malbec. It brings a whole lot of appeal with its aromas of coffee, woodspice, blackberries and dark cherries. The palate shows a mixture of grace and power and the finish won't quit.",93,Tenor 2011 2:2 Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The wine is subdued and clean on the nose and it doesn't exaggerate or mask the quality of fruit. This is executed in a bright, compact and streamlined style that combines freshness and firmness.",89,Baricci 2007  Brunello di Montalcino
"Made in a ripe, extracted style, this pleasant Cab-Merlot blend has flavors of currants, plums, cedar and spice. Seems at its best now and for a couple years.",86,Jaffe 2005 Metamorphosis Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
"Sharp, spicy, tight, and focused, this is one of the best of the numbered Cabs from Dunham in the past few years. It's sleek, polished and sappy, with perfect balance, and a riveting depth of black raspberry, black cherry and cassis fruit. The tannins are soft and polished, hinting at black tea and coffee grounds.",93,Dunham 2006 XII Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This Pinot Noir is raisiny on the nose but maintains a fresh outlook. The palate runs heavy, almost to the point of feeling flat, while the flavor profile offers ripe berry, cherry and raisin notes. It's plump and soft on the finish, with a resin-like taste. Only 48 cases produced.",87,Kingston Family 2011 Alazan CJ's Barrel Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)
"Made from organically grown grapes, this is crisp and clean. A straight line of bright red and citrus fruits is sharpened by acidity. It has a refreshing aftertaste.",86,Domaines Pierre Chavin 2015 Villa d'Ariane Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This is the best Enemigo Cabernet Franc to date. It's pure, heady, powerful juice with integrated smoky oak and spice aromas. Pure in the mouth, this is dense and full of quality. Blackberry and chocolate flavors are ripe and modern in style, while the finish is full, leathery, a touch salty and savory. Drink through 2019.",93,El Enemigo 2011 Gran Enemigo Gualtallary Single Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Mendoza)
"A tropical hint of passion fruit hits the nose before more definite notions of tart apple and citrus appear. There is concentration on the midpalate and lots of freshness, with a clean, dry finish.",89,Henri Schoenheitz 2014 Linsenberg Riesling (Alsace)
"Generic pear and apple aromas are simple but good. This wine runs light on oak and feels juicy and correct. Flavors of apple, pear and vanilla turn more briny and salty on the finish, which circles back with sweetness as it fades away.",86,Tilia 2014 Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"A medium build and managed acidity combine for a crowd-pleasing wine that will satisfy in melon, lime and vanilla. The oak is never obtrusive or unsupportive of the whole.",86,MacMurray Estate Vineyards 2014 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Is this the best Cabernet that Viu Manent has ever bottled? We think it very well might be; the wine is midnight madness, meaning it's dark as night and richly draped with blackberry, cassis, black plum and overall lushness. It's a hulk of a wine, with jammy fruit, fine tannic structure and handsome shadings. Drinkable now and probably better over the next two or three years.",92,Viu Manent 2006 Single Vineyard La Capilla Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"This appealing blend of 70% Montepulciano and 30% Sagrantino offers up aromas of bright fruits and meat juices. The savory palate delivers flavors of juicy plum, raspberry and licorice. It's round and ready, with polished tannins, so enjoy soon.",88,Castello di Montegiove 2009 Elicius Red (Umbria)
"This wine is soft and fruity, with just a minimum of tannin. It offers strawberry and red currant, combining softness with acidity. The aftertaste, with its acidity, is dry while fresh. Drink from 2016.",86,Château la Colombière 2013 Vinum Negrette (Vin de France)
This firm and structured wine is also warm and rich with blackberry and black currant fruit. Its structure lends weight while the juicy fruit and acidity show strongly. It will be a rich wine to drink from 2020.,88,Château Chatard 2015  Côtes de Bordeaux
"Dusty citrus aromas show a hint of butterscotch. This feels about right, with modest lift coming from mild acidity. Dry simple flavors of white pepper and generic bitterness close this out.",87,Cruzat NV Extra Brut Cuvée Réserve Sparkling (Valle de Uco)
"This sweet sparkling rosé is clean and crisp. It has attractive strawberry fruit, soft texture and a light mousse. Drink now.",83,Adega Cooperativa do Cartaxo NV Plexus Rosé Castelão (Tejo)
"Soft notes of earth and gentle red fruit appear on the nose. The palate is very soft, smooth and centers on autumnal earthiness rather than fruit. Its pleasing backbone of freshness gives direction to the softness.",86,Kuentz-Bas 2013 Collection Pinot Noir (Alsace)
"This is made from the most widely planted red grape in Vinho Verde, Vinhão. It is soft and juicy with a ripe character and almond and caramel flavors. Drink now.",84,Quinta de Paços 2016 Casa de Paços Rosé (Vinho Verde)
"A 50-50 blend of Pinot Bianco and Chardonnay, this opens with aromas of peach, honey and white rose. The quality of the bubbly perlage is tonic and crisp, but both grape varieties provide the wine with medium structure.",87,Piera Martellozzo 2010 075 Carati Extra Dry Sparkling (Veneto)
"A tiny percentage of Merlot added to this Sangiovese-based wine brings a touch of color, concentration and power. It shows raw, rustic aromas of smoked ham or bresaola alongside dark fruit, spice and moist earth.",87,Fattoria di Montemaggio 2007  Chianti Classico
"This would be easy to mistake for Grenache—it's ruby-colored, cranberry-flavored, with hints of strawberry and licorice. Clean, crisp and noticeably acidic, it would be most enjoyable with a richly sauced breast of duck.",85,Jigsaw 2008 Pinot Noir (Oregon)
"Sometimes concept exceeds the wine itself, and this may be a case in point. The blend is odd, and the fact that each grape comes from a different part of Spain is potentially more odd. As for the wine, it has a nice perfume to it, courtesy of the Rhone varieties in the mix. And while the cherry/berry fruit is forward, it's maybe too sweet and basic in terms of length, structure and mouthfeel. Still, it's worth a try for the experimental tasters out there.",85,Bodegas Concavins 2000 Proyecto 4 Red (Conca de Barberà)
"This is a super-extracted and modern interpretation of Barbera that almost goes overboard. The wood elements are distinct and not integrated yet, so you should give this wine a year or two more in the bottle. It's also jammy, thick and raw with dense, chewy extraction.",86,Marcaurelio 2007 Terranuda  (Barbera d'Asti)
"Walla Walla Valley-designated whites are a rarity. Here aromas of vanilla, toast, honeysuckle and peach show nuance and detail and lead to sweet, light bodied, lightly spritzy stone-fruit flavors with a long finish that commands attention.",90,Abeja 2014 Estate Grown Viognier (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"One of the lusher, richer Pinot Gris on the market. It's dry and crisp in Central Coast acidity, with ripe citrus, peach, vanilla and honey flavors. On the downside is a sugary sweetness that makes it almost a dessert wine.",86,Laetitia 2010 Estate Pinot Gris (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"A very tight, tart and tannic Pinot Noir, almost impossible to open up despite hours of breathing. Acidic and unyielding, the rating is a compromise between what it is currently showing and what it hints at if you probe deeply enough.",88,Gypsy Dancer 2005 Cuvée Romy Pinot Noir (Oregon)
"Not one of the generally declared vintages for Port, this year produced some ripe, sweet single quinta vintages. It also was a good year for rich, sweet tawnies. This is ripe, toffee-like in character packed with ripe raisin and sultana flavors. It is a luxurious wine, of course ready to drink.",94,Kopke 1978 Colheita Tawny  (Port)
"All Pinot Noir, fermented in neutral oak and put through partial malolactic, this belongs in the rosé category. A pretty, pale-copper color, it offers a pleasing toasted-cracker frame around stone fruit and supple acids. Drink this chilled to white wine temperature.",90,Swick 2014 Cancilla Vineyard Blanc de Noir Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"With 75% Corvina Veronese, 15% Rondinella and 10% Sangiovese, this Amarone stands out thanks to its dramatically different aromatic profile. The Sangiovese component must be responsible for the wild strawberry, cherry candy, pressed blue flowers and white licorice. It's fresh too, with a sweet, but crisp close.",92,Brunelli 2006 Campo del Tìtari Riserva  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"This simple wine has some attractive citrus fruit. It is light, bright with plenty of acidity to keep it all fresh. It should be drunk now.",84,Georges Duboeuf 2013 Domaine des Chènevières  (Mâcon-Villages)
Cypresses is a direct and charming expression of Sangiovese from Tuscany that seems designed for informal dinners with family and friends. Simple aromas of berry and forest fruit are followed by fresh crispness.,86,Villa Pillo 2008 Cypresses Sangiovese (Toscana)
"The wine is rich, solidly tannic with a dry core. It has the dense color associated with this grape, more normally found in Bordeaux. There are juicy black elements and balanced acidity, with a dry core that makes for a firm wine. Drink now.",88,Dona Maria-Júlio Bastos 2013 Petit Verdot (Alentejano)
"Crisp, fresh wine, with a creamy texture, full of green apples with a pear pepperiness. The wine is light, very drinkable, a great aperitif style. Screwcap.",85,Salomon-Undhof 2007 Hochterrassen Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
Raisins and ripe fruit combine in this LBV that has some richness while remaining on the dry side. Blackberry jelly is layered with acidity and a dark tannic structure. For drinking now.,87,Cálem 2006 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port)
"If Standish's Relic is the feminine side of Shiraz, this is in a more masculine vein, with slightly coarser tannins and more weight, but still possessing great intensity without any heaviness. Cassis, blueberry and black olive flavors are tinged with hints of asphalt and espresso, leading into a warm, lingering finish. Drink now-2025.",96,Standish 2005 The Standish Single Vineyard Shiraz (Barossa Valley)
"This bottling shows touches of smoke, flint, Meyer lemon peel, honeysuckle and crisp jicama on the nose. A hint of ripe nectarine kicks off the palate before its knee-buckling acidity takes hold, bringing forth lemon peel, lime juice and more honeysuckle elements.",94,Center of Effort 2013 Chardonnay (Edna Valley)
"A beautifully deep shade of purple, this bottling shows tightly wound aromas of blueberry, black currant, violet and licorice on the nose. The palate's dark fruit flavors are lifted by touches of cocoa and espresso, framed by tannins that are very chalky but not obtrusive.",92,Rendarrio Vineyards 2014 The Rocker Clare Ranch Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Smooth, sweet and savory, this Cabernet has forward flavors of blackberries, black currants, cola and sweet oak. It's an easy wine to drink now.",85,Windsor Sonoma 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"There's been a huge jump in production of this wine since the past vintage, which may signal some surge of interest in white Pinot, which has lately become a bit of a trend in Oregon. The wine is simple, neutral and perfectly quaffable, but carries no hint of varietal character.",87,Left Coast Cellars 2013 White Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"A beautiful wine, smooth, polished, with rounded corners. Its intense fruit is balanced and harmonizes well with the sweet tannins, the layers of wood and the red berry flavors. Certainly powerful, it impresses equally with the pleasure it will give in 7–10 years.",98,Clos de Tart 2005  Clos de Tart
"Jolts of lemon-lime acidity reverberate throughout this dry, mineral-focused wine. Golden apple, pear and lemon flavors are ripe and concentrated, but the palate maintains a svelte, spry style.",91,Fritz Haag 2014 Juffer Trocken GG Riesling (Mosel)
"Aromas of black cherry, cassis and desert brush hint at complexity. A flush, structured palate deals blackberry, cassis, spice, herb and chocolate flavors. Despite mild heat and rubbery tannins on the finish, this is largely a complete Monastrell.",89,Sierra Norte 2014 Porta Regia Colección Privada 5 Meses Monastrell (Jumilla)
"Chunky aromas of apple cider, pineapple, pine and juniper are challenging. This feels juicy, with sharp acidity. Nectarine is the lead flavor, while apple and pithy bitterness push the finish.",85,Attis 2013 Xión Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"A classic blend of local Alentejo grapes along with Cabernet Sauvignon has produced a smoothly structured wine. With its juicy black fruit acidity and layer of dry tannins under the fruit, it is both ripe and ageworthy. Drink from 2018.",89,J. Portugal Ramos 2014 Vila Santa Reserva Red (Alentejano)
"With a bright pink color, this shows slightly heavy aromas of watermelon and red apple skins. It is medium to full in body but fresh, with candied red-fruit and citrus flavors. A fresh, properly acidic finish does the job.",85,Cepa 21 2013 Hito Rosado Tinto Fino (Ribera del Duero)
"The wine has plenty of juicy red fruits as well as a firm structure. It is on the fresh fruity side, with red currant and berry flavors. The acidity is very present, needing to calm down to become really drinkable. Wait until 2018 to drink.",88,Château la Favière 2014  Bordeaux Supérieur
"This is a straightforward but easy-to-enjoy selection, boasting upfront aromas and flavors of peach, watermelon rind and white currant. Light weight and bright in mouthwatering acidity, a hint of fresh-cut grass graces the clean finish.",85,Arrogant Frog 2015 Lily Pad Pink Rosé (Pays d'Oc)
"This is a bright, engaging and vibrant 100% varietal wine, lovely in currant, cranberry and a sanguine earthiness. The acidity is weaved throughout and entirely supportive, uplifting the fruit to greater heights of freshness and focus.",94,Laurel Glen 2013 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Mountain)
"After a somewhat gritty start, the bouquet settles on aromas of perfumed red fruit and lemony oak. It feels full, with nice acidic cut, offering flavors of leather, earth and savory baked fruit. Fairly long and mildly herbal on the finish.",86,Bodegas Torreduero 2008 Peñamonte 3 Meses de Barrica  (Toro)
"Dark golden in color, this light-bodied, vibrantly fresh wine has a twinge of creamy oak influence. That's just enough to give it body and complexity in an otherwise bright package of preserved lemon and a warm, lengthy and salty finish.",91,Camp 2014 Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"Shows the exotic side of Viognier, with tangerine preserve, apricot, tobacco, white flower, golden currant and white pepper flavors that finish absolutely dry and crisp in acidity. Elegant and clean, an interesting wine to pair with a wide variety of ethnic foods.",89,a-non-ah-mus 2009 Curtis Vineyard Viognier (Santa Barbara County)
"Extremely light in the glass, this bottling demonstrates both the delicate and action-packed aspects of the grape, much like many world-class Pinot Noirs. Vivacious and fruity bramble and hibiscus aromas meet with anise and nutmeg on the nose. The palate refreshes with red plum and spice flavors.",90,Betwixt 2014 Grenache (Chalone)
"An unusual late release to the American market, this wine shows its maturity, but elegantly. It still boasts bright black cherry flavor, but also prominent tones of mushroom, earth and leather. Puckery acidity adds freshness to the finish.",89,Weingut Weber 2008 Monzinger Frühlingsplätzchen Trocken Spätburgunder (Nahe)
"Raw, earthy plum aromas are spicy and lightly herbal. This feels saucy yet monotone. Tomato, red-plum and herbal flavors end with a hint of brown sugar and a continuation of the wine's herbal plum character.",85,Chilensis 2013 Reserva Estate Bottled Merlot (Maule Valley)
"This is a warm, honey- and apple-flavored wine. It's fresh and full in the mouth with tight mineral acidity. It could well age a year or two, but is ready to drink now.",86,Domaine Talmard 2011  Mâcon-Chardonnay
"This wine's nose has a sharply spiced tinge, with wet herbs, cola, and cranberry aromas. At first, it's a bit muddy on the palate, but then the strong acidic backbone presents both herbal tones and tart cranberry against an earthy core.",89,Mansfield-Dunne 2012 Peterson Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Initially this doesn't distinguish itself. The nose deals typical Chilean Chardonnay aromas of corn and stalks, along with warm-weather fruits. In the mouth, however, this is minerally and intense, with driving acidity pushing flavors of oak, cinnamon, toast and baked apple. On the finish, the fruit fades rather quickly while vanilla and resiny oak flavors settle in and take over.",89,William Fèvre 2011 Chacai Chardonnay (Pirque)
"Light in color but loaded with pungent lemon-lime, ocean brine and lettuce aromas, this cleansing spritzy SB offers tangy lime, lettuce and gooseberry flavors. A dry peppery finish with acidic cut provides for a fresh ending.",89,Garces Silva 2016 Boya Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley)
"Crisp acidity and citrus fruitiness combine with a riper, textured character. The wine shows the strong minerality inherent in whites from Pernand-Vergelesses, as well as a richer streak. Because of its structure, it should age. Drink from 2016.",91,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2012 Creux de la Net Premier Cru  (Pernand-Vergelesses)
"On first take, this smells murky and baked, but with airing it freshens up. In the mouth, this features hard acidity while the flavor profile leans towards prune, earthy plum and toasty oak. There's heat and roughness to the finish along with woodsy, spicy berry flavors. Drink through 2020.",89,Consejo de la Alta 2008 Alta Río Reserva  (Rioja)
"This attractively fruity wine has just a touch of tannin in the tangy, zesty structure. At the same time it offers crisp apple and grapefruit fruitiness. It's balanced, a great success with its combination of fruit and tense structure.",91,Jean Laurent NV Blanc de Noirs Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne)
"This is a lovely wine, with flavors both rich and racy—cool minerality meets ripe lemon/lime, with a dollop of creamy custard. It's mouthfilling and smooth, with lingering, delicious flavors that resonate beautifully.",93,Matello 2012 Durant Vineyard Chardonnay (Dundee Hills)
"A heady, minty nose is joined by fuller fruit of green and yellow pear. On the palate, highlights of pepper appear amidst lemon and grapefruit peel. This is sleek and slender, with wonderfully zesty concentration and brisk freshness. Take your time drinking this, there is a lot going on.",92,Markus Huber 2014 Obere Steigen Grüner Veltliner (Traisental)
"Vegetal notes of asparagus mingle with accents of chalk and sweet grass on the nose, while ruby grapefruit and underripe mango flavors burst in the mouth. Vibrant and clean; drink now.",87,Plaisir De Merle 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape)
"This is a beautifully floral, high in acidity white made in small quantities that offers classically lean layers of wet stone and lemon. With a low imprint of oak, it remains structured on the palate and entirely pleasing from start to finish, its honeysuckle aromas singularly inviting.",90,Renteria 2013 Chardonnay (Los Carneros)
"Aromas of baked plum, resin, vanilla and brown spice slowly emerge in the glass. The aromas carry over to the palate but this is still tight and closed. Give this time to unwind and fully develop. Drink after 2018.",88,Castello di Neive 2012 Gallina  (Barbaresco)
"A lush, somewhat soft eiswein, with aromas and flavors of superripe oranges or orange marmalade, balanced by a touch of dry, minerally extract on the finish.",89,Ernst Bretz 2003 Eiswein Riesling (Rheinhessen)
"This wine tastes like a rosé Champagne without the bubbles. It has a classic light salmon color, light aromas like white cherries and raspberries, and a surprisingly layered texure that curls around the tongue. And what a great value, too.",87,Rare NV Grape 4 Blend Rosé (California)
"Stewed, saucy aromas of grassy tomato and herbal berry fruits are foxy. This feels cutting and rough, while minty green-berry flavors come with a note of animal fur.",83,Cruz Alta 2014 Reserve Malbec (Mendoza)
"Like an underripe nectarine, this tart, crunchy wine needs a bit time to mature. But instead of 2–3 days, think 2–3 years. Lime and mandarin orange notes are lean and crisp on the palate, austere for now, but surely going to blossom in time.",91,Leeuwin Estate 2013 Art Series Riesling (Margaret River)
Aromas of saddle leather and sour cherry are followed by lightly styled tart cherry flavors and gritty tannins.,86,Almquist 2010 Smitten Winemaker Nebbiolo (Washington)
"Whiffs of raspberry are accented with bramble and dried herbs on this bold, richly textured Cabernet Franc. Big, bitter tannins frame delicate red fruit flavors, finishing with a kiss of cranberry acidity. It's brawny still, but should meld beautifully from 2016–2020.",88,Macari 2010 Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island)
"Made with 80% Sangiovese and 20% Syrah, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this has aromas of underbrush and scorched earth. The evolved palate shows dried black cherry, raisin and clove alongside rather tired tannins. Drink soon.",85,Impostino 2011  Montecucco
"Iris, pressed rose, pine forest, woodland berry and a balsamic note are just some of the inviting aromas you'll find on this delicious wine. The smooth concentrated palate doles out layers of raspberry compote, juicy Marasca cherry, cinnamon and clove framed in velvety tannins. A salty mineral note lingers on the finish. Drink through 2027.",94,Ciabot Berton 2012 Rocchettevino  (Barolo)
"This racy, fresh, cool-vintage blend is a touch rubbery on the nose, with berry and cassis undertones. A tight palate delivers a mix of dark plum, blackberry, baking spice and chocolate flavors in front of a peppery, dry, crisp finish. Drink through 2019.",90,Maquis 2010 Lien Red (Colchagua Valley)
"What a nice Paso Cabernet, perfect for drinking now. While dry in style, it's rich and sweet in black currant, anise and cedar flavors, and the thick tannins are just what you want in a full-bodied Cab. Wonderful with hearty beef dishes.",88,Sextant 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"With a light layer of tannin, this structured wine comes from the heart of the Beaujolais Villages area. It has black cherry and red-fruit flavors balanced by the right amount of acidity. Drink now. The Colonge family has been growing grapes in Beaujolais since 1789.",87,Domaine André Colonge 2014  Beaujolais-Villages
"Selected from a portion of the family vineyard, this soft wine, named after the owner of the estate, is gently ripe but with the potential to bring out even more fruitiness. The aftertaste is crisp and ripe.",87,Château Hermitage Saint-Martin 2016 Enzo Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Fresh, clean and easy with ripe aromas of red apple flesh and hard nectarine on the nose and a solid lime-driven citrus core that livens up the palate and the finish. Drink now.",86,Riebeek Cellars 2010 Collection Chardonnay (Swartland)
"Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas produces this label with her father and winemaker Joey Tensley, whose handiwork unleashes aromas of white pepper, black cherry, a cornucopia of dark berries and earthy minerality. Bright acidity on the palate partners with blackberry soda flavors, quite racy for the variety.",90,Ferguson Crest 2011 Private Reserve Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Fresh, herb and miso-tinged yeast for now is the chief flavor on this zesty, fresh and punchy yet slender little number. There is pepper and pear, but also soy and salt, with a lovely hint of both fizz and peach framed by super-zesty lemon freshness. You simply want to drink more.",91,Schloss Gobelsburg 2015 Langenlois Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"Apple and citrus scents mark the nose, and then the wine adds mineral notes of crushed vitamins on the palate. It's plump and medium in body, with a crisp, citrusy-minerally finish that would go well alongside Asian dishes without too much sweetness or spice.",87,Prinz Salm 2007 Prinz Salm Kabinett Riesling (Nahe)
"Auxerrois, a cross between Pinot Noir and Gouais Blanc, creates an aromatic, lively, citrus and pear fruit-flavored white wine with a delicious mix of fruit, spice and even a hint of white chocolate. Fresh and more interesting than many Chardonnays, this is a sure-fire crowd-pleaser at any picnic or barbecue.",89,Adelsheim 2009 Ribbon Springs Vineyard Auxerrois (Ribbon Ridge)
"Aromas recall crushed raspberry, anisette, tilled earth and a whiff of cellar must. The soft palate doles out ripe black cherry, licorice and white pepper alongside polished tannins. It doesn't have much complexity but it's savory and already enjoyable. Drink through 2017.",88,CarlindePaolo 2011  Barbaresco
"A lovely Merlot, this is pure, vibrant and elegant. It has classic cherry, red-currant and cedar flavors, and while there's a sweetness at the core, the finish is thoroughly dry. Wonderful to drink now with steak or lamb.",91,Duckhorn 2009 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Big, ripe and juicy, this solidly based wine also has great fruitiness. Black fruits, some bitter chocolate and licorice point to ripeness and wood aging. It has a rich texture, its spiciness bringing out the plum and damson fruits. For aging over the medium-term, drink from 2017.",90,Château Cormeil-Figeac 2011  Saint-Émilion
"Smooth and sweet, like a cream Sherry is supposed to be. On the nose, this one easily shifts from ripe apricot and peach fruit to nuts and saline. The palate starts with a blast of coffee and mocha and then folds in brown sugar and spice. Sweet, long and generous, with accents of cinnamon, clove and mild chocolate. Uncomplicated, which for $13 is a virtue.",90,Hidalgo NV Morenita Cream Sherry (Jerez)
"This is a soft, lightly earthy style of wine produced from grapes from across the Loire Valley. It has a strong herbal character and a touch of grapefruit. Drink now.",85,Fournier Père et Fils 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de France)
"This Octagon is dark and charred smelling, with aromas of blackberry, cocoa, savory spice and cherry. The palate is tight yet finessed, bearing vigorous yet manageable tannins that should eventually fade with time to reveal a charming wine. Flavors of graphite, fines herbes and coffee grounds add interest to the finish.",90,Barboursville Vineyards 2009 Octagon Red (Virginia)
"Opens with a dry, dusty firmness that comes through both on the nose and in the mouth. This is fresh and tightly woven with very fine aromas of cassis, spice, crushed stone and milled white pepper. Very firm and tight; age 10 years.",93,Fattoria La Lecciaia 2006 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"While hints of earth and bramble on the nose seem a touch savory, the palate of this concentrated semi-dry wine is richly flavored with fresh peach, orange and apricot. It's juicy and fresh, accented by soft orange acidity and a brisk finish. Drink now through 2018 to enjoy its fruity vitality.",88,Barnstormer 2015 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"This complex, assertive dessert wine starts with aromas of orange marmalade, honey and tobacco spice, and on the palate, its smooth, integrated flavors of honey, citrus, cigarbox and spice are both elegant and unique. Its spicy, dry finish is an extra boost.",89,Morgenhof 2002 Estate Noble Late Harvest Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch)
"A distinct headiness to the gardenia blossoms that perfume this Riesling contrasts with the bright, tropical pineapple, candied fruit and tangerine flavors that dominate in the mouth. A touch of minerality and racy acidity round out the finish.",85,Knapp 2009 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Light in color and texture, this wine at first is muted and shy, getting spicier and earthier as it goes, with a baked strawberry-compote flavor at its core.",88,Calstar Cellars 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Quadra's Brut Rosé sparkling wine offers a delicate pink color and compelling aromas of stone fruit, toasted bread, crème de cassis and subtle waves of cinnamon spice. The mouthfeel is smooth, rich, long-lasting and offers a piquant touch of crushed white pepper.",89,Quadra NV Brut Rosé Sparkling (Franciacorta)
"A big Pinot Noir; it's a little heavy for the variety, with the weight of a Rhône, but no denying the deliciousness factor. Floods the mouth with concentrated pie-filling black cherry, red currant, licorice and beef jerky flavors. Best opened soon for freshness.",88,Foley 2008 Barrel Select Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Blueberry compote, blackberry and dill-butter aromas are strung together with threads of raisin and medicinal mint. Integrated, medium-grained tannins and proportioned acids create an agile mouthfeel, although the flavors seem to drop out a bit on the midpalate.",85,Augusta Winery 2009 Chambourcin (Augusta)
"Combine masses of American oak with high ripeness and the result is this warm woody wine oozing with vanilla, molasses and cedar. It's full and plush, but lacks complexity and cellaring potential. Drink it now.",87,Mollydooker 2014 Enchanted Path Shiraz-Cabernet (McLaren Vale)
"Floral sensations of acacia flower, jasmine and herbs meld with tropical fruit, citrus and sage. The medium-bodied palate also offers a flinty mineral note and a whiff of smoke, while bright acidity leaves the palate refreshed.",88,Velenosi 2012 Villa Angela Pecorino (Falerio)
"This is a structured rich wine. It has great ripe fruit, generous with red berry and acidity in fine balance. It has a solid backbone of tannins although these are already well integrated into the opulent wine. Drink from 2021.",93,Château de Santenay 2015 Montée Rouge Premier Cru  (Beaune)
"While this may not be the strongest Clos de Sixte the Jaume family has made, it's still a very good effort. The red fruit aromas and flavors seem slightly confectionary, but carry enough pie-cherry flavors to see them through, backed by hints of dark chocolate. The tannins are supple, turning to a cocoa-powder texture on the crisp finish. Drink now–2018.",89,Alain Jaume et Fils 2011 Domaine du Clos de Sixte Red (Lirac)
"Peppery lime fruit highlights this single-clone effort. The impressive minerality brings clean flavors of wet rock into play. It's terrifically refreshing, with the crisp acidity to age nicely over the next six to eight years.",93,Durant 2014 Raven Chardonnay (Dundee Hills)
"An ordinary effort, with tart fruit just approaching ripeness. Sour cherries fade quickly into a thin finish.",85,Hawkins Cellars 2009 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Rubbery, slightly gritty aromas of olive and balsamic berry fruits are solid and introduce a well-balanced palate. Loamy berry and baked plum flavors are ripe and solid. Overall, this delivers an authentic taste of modern Argentina while not veering away from what's familiar; drink through 2020.",92,Sur de los Andes 2012 Premium Blend Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"This Chardonnay underwent aging in new French oak and sur lie battonage, yielding a wine that's certainly rich, but also jammy with flavors of pineapples, oranges and vanilla cream.",85,Midnight 2012 Estate Chardonnay (Paso Robles)
"Pure lemon zest mingles with peppery pungency and makes for pepper-speckled refreshment. Linearity and focus abound and this wine is so lively, it seems to fast-forwarded into the future.",92,Bründlmayer 2013 Berg Vogelsang Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"Some diesel and cracker on the nose, along with the usual Gewürztraminer mix of citrus and soap. The fruit is substantial and fills out the midpalate, offering peaches, apricots, suggestions of papaya and some crisp, apple acids. In keeping with past vintages, this new release is finished at just under 3% residual sugar. It should stand up nicely to spicy noodle dishes.",87,Columbia Winery 2007 Gewürztraminer (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Dusty mineral and pollen notes lend earthy complexity to tart lemon, tangerine and sugar cookie notes on the nose of this feather-light Riesling. It's gossamer in texture yet full of juicy sweet pink-grapefruit flavor. High-toned acidity drives a cutting finish marked by a pleasantly bitter ring of lime pith and hazelnut skins.",91,N. Kendall Wines 2013 Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"This broad-shouldered, burly and feral wine is ripe with smoky cherry and vanilla notes. Smoothly textured, it imparts dusty leather and black licorice accents amid a serious slathering of oak.",88,VGS Chateau Potelle 2014 Syrah (Mount Veeder)
"This semi-dry rosé offers strawberry, rhubarb and a touch of medicinal spice on the nose, followed by strawberry and sweet cherry on the palate. A hint of spice livens things.",84,Vaeni NV Makedonikos Rosé Semi-Dry Wine Rosé (Macedonia)
"This Merlot is thin and common, but dry and drinkable, with cherry, cola and oak flavors. Gulp it down with anything you like.",82,Eye Candy 2012 Merlot (California)
"At a time when so many California rosés are blah, Fort Ross' is the real deal. Dry and crisply structured, it shows raspberry, cherry, lavender, thyme and pepper flavors that have an edge of mouthwatering bitterness.",87,Fort Ross 2007 Fort Ross Vineyard Rosé of Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Attractive aromas of mineral and slate are hampered by some musty notes. Nonetheless, the palate is well-structured, with refreshing acidity reinforcing mineral notes. This is an austere, dry style perfect for those who shy away from the fruitier examples.",86,Domaines Schlumberger 2006 Les Princes Abbés Riesling (Alsace)
"A blend of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenere, Merlot and Barbera, this simple, bright red blend offers simple layers of cherry and blackberry, with background tones of black olive and cheese rind.",88,Ricci Curbastro 2008 Vigna Santella del Gröm Red (Curtefranca)
"A ripe, bold and fruity wine, that is rounded and packed with black currant flavors. Its soft tannins are comfortably embedded in the rich fruitiness. Made from classic Douro grapes, the wine is ready to drink.",88,Quinta da Pacheca 2013 Pacheca Colheita Red (Douro)
"From one of the estate's west-sloping blocks, this wine sizzles in acidity, with seductive layers of kirsch, maraschino cherry and raspberry, counterbalanced by Carneros earth and spice. Lengthy and full bodied, it's luxurious and beautiful, integrated in oak, with a lengthy end note of orange peel spiked in cloves.",94,Donum 2013 West Slope Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"There's a lot happening on nose of this wine from Sta. Rita Hills pioneer Richard Sanford's recently rejuvenated Alma Rosa label. Aromas suggest light butterscotch, baked pear, fresh pluot and jasmine. Once sipped, the flavors don't live up to the aromatic promise, but apple, pear and a sharper tangerine rind round out the flavors.",88,Alma Rosa 2011 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County)
"Chardonnay fans will like the pineapple and pear flavors, with their creamy, spicy edge of vanilla and pepper spice. It's a direct, dry wine at a pretty good price.",84,SKN 2007 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"A beautiful Merlot, soft, ripe and complex, and front-loaded with cherry, plum, chocolate macaroon and sweet tobacco flavors. Shows rich, fine Alexander tannins that will let the wine age for up to a decade.",88,Mojon's Bench 2004 Estate Merlot (Alexander Valley)
"The impressive Victorian baronial chateau of Cantenac Brown is one of the landmarks of Margaux. The wine is getting better each vintage. This is ripe and generous, full of freshly minted tannins and layers of wood over the ripe berry fruit. Drink this wine from 2024.",94,Château Cantenac Brown 2014  Margaux
"This is an assertive, flavorful and robust wine, with a medium to full body, a mouthfilling texture and fine-beaded bubbles. A creamy viscosity and wonderful layers of butter, apple, vanilla and ginger make for a delicious palate.",93,Roederer Estate NV Estate Bottled Brut Sparkling (Anderson Valley)
"La Nerthe's late-ripening Mourvèdre typically shines the brightest in warm vintages, which 2008 was not. The result is a leathery, peppery wine with rather crisp, cherry-inflected fruit. Drink it over the next several years.",87,Château La Nerthe 2008 Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape)
"Earthy berry, spice, leather and vanilla aromas are textbook for the region. This Crianza feels fresh but sturdy, with meaty tannins. Briar, cherry and medicinal plum and berry flavors finish with sweeping chocolate and brambly spice notes.",91,Torres 2012 Celeste Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"Leathery, herbal aromas suggest compost. A full, hard, tannic palate is home to rubbery flavors of herbal blackberry and pepper, while a medicinal dark-berry character controls the finish. This is a decent wine with mild weediness.",83,Tarantas 2011 Monastrell (Jumilla)
"A bit of choppy wood announces a fully oaked wine, and yes, it's a touch hard-coated. But underneath the veneer of barrel there's lively red fruit and a natural brambly character. The palate is just acidic enough to be lively, and the finish is healthy and settles upon chocolate due to the wine's generous oaking. Very good mouthfeel and depth make this more than solid. Drink now–2011.",91,Masies d'Avinyo 2003 Abadal Selecció Red (Pla de Bages)
"A fine Cabernet, this is dry, full bodied and softly tannic, with real Napa elegance. Feels smooth in the mouth, offering concentrated blackberry, currant, dark chocolate and sweet oak flavors. Drink over the next six years.",89,Buehler 2010 Papa's Knoll Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Fresh juicy pear has a touch of bergamot zest on the nose that lends a heady enticing note. That same aromatic zesty touch pervades the entire palate, perfuming the rich ripe pear fruit and providing a wonderfully bright firm structure. There is a warm energetic core to this wine and quite some warmth, but this is beautifully countered by the citrus freshness. Right now all the notions are primary and delicious but this will evolve and develop. The concentration certainly is there. Drink 2017–2035.",94,Marc Kreydenweiss 2015 Moenchberg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Starts well, with pineapple and gooseberry aromas, but it doesn't seem that intense or concentrated on the palate. This is a medium-bodied, slightly creamy-textured wine that's easy to drink.",86,Konrad 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"This is the least successful Judd's Hill Cabernet in recent memory. The current '04 bottling is lean, with cherry tea and mint flavors. A disappointment.",84,Judd's Hill 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This wine's restrained nose just hints at blueberry and cinnamon. The palate comes in with freshness, verve and balance. Crunchy red cherry fruit is at the core, balanced by freshness and a taut structure. An elegant, ripe, medium-bodied red.",91,Netzl 2015 Classic Zweigelt (Carnuntum)
"Ironstone's aim with this Bordeaux blend seems clear, to produce an ageworthy wine of distinction. They have largely succeeded, although it's a very different style than you'll find from anything on the coast. It shows the briary, brambly tannins and tastes usually associated with Foothills Zinfandel, but the black currant and cherry flavors belong to Cabernet Sauvignon, which constitutes 80% of the blend. Will hold and improve through 2013.",92,Ironstone 2005 Reserve Meritage (Sierra Foothills)
"Subdued aromas suggesting yellow apple and a touch of citrus emerge after a few twirls of the glass. On the tangy palate, a vein of mineral and crisp acidity underscore juicy tastes of nectarine, pear and a hint of crystalized ginger.",88,Klaus Lentsch 2014 Amperg Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
"A note of yeasty vanilla graces apple and citrus aromas. This feels chalky and minerally, with a touch of spritz. Dry lime and green-apple flavors finish clean and long, with no funk to speak of.",88,Hiruzta 2015 Txakolina Hondarribia Hondarrabi Zuri (Getariako Txakolina)
"Savory black-olive aromas lend some funk to the nose of this tight pointy massively tannic Tempranillo. Flavors of olive, black fruits and chocolate finish with hard drying tannins and flavors of black coffee, additional chocolate and peppery spice. Drink from 2018–2030.",91,Val Sotillo 2011 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)
"Sweet oak notes are followed by cherry, chocolate and vanilla. This is a rich Cabernet Sauvignon with a modern and very pleasurable approach that puts emphasis on power, softness and intensity. Vibrant cherry flavors last many long minutes on the palate.",91,Castellare di Castellina 2005 Coniale Cabernet Sauvignon (Toscana)
"The granite soil with its strong texture translates into a tightly woven wine full of spice as well as rich yellow fruits. It's complex, packed with acidity, touches of vanilla and a richly smooth aftertaste. Drink from 2016.",92,Bonnet-Huteau 2013 Les Laures Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"This wine's woodland berry, rose petal, dark spice, chopped herb and espresso aromas fill the glass. Elegantly structured, the palate offers Marasca cherry, clove and star anise flavors framed by fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity.",91,Rivetti Massimo 2014  Barbaresco
"The 2013 vintage may not have been good in Spain, but this is really struggling. Green aromas are sharp and suggest vinegar. This feels hard as a pile of rocks, with herbal flavors of green tomato and rustic plum. An herbal-tasting astringent finish will win no new friends.",82,Marqués de Vargas 2013 Conde de San Cristóbal  (Ribera del Duero)
"This wine is 60% Grenache, 20% Syrah, 10% Cinsault and 10% Mourvèdre. It opens with aromas of white pepper, potpourri, herbs and raspberries. The flavors are soft, displaying a very pretty mouthfeel and a pleasing sense of restraint.",90,Covington 2011 Ma Belle Olsen Vineyard Red (Yakima Valley)
"Nice fruit flavors show yellow fruits, stone fruits, some melon and hints of apricot. The wine is 100% varietal, 13.5% alcohol, and sourced from the Upland vineyard on Snipes Mountain. Overall good balance and length.",88,Covington 2008 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Touches of balsamic vinegar, violet and wet granite lend complexity to this crisp, elegant Pinot Noir. Black cherry and plum flavors are penetrating and pristine, finishing with a fringe of dusty tannins.",88,Millbrook 2013 Proprietor's Special Reserve Pinot Noir (New York)
"This is an impressively complex Vinho Verde, obviously made for food. With its tangy acidity and tense mineral texture, this blend of a range of the regional grapes is structured and with a delicious, refreshing aftertaste. Drink now.",88,Casa do Valle 2016 White (Vinho Verde)
"Tastes sweeter and fruitier than the 2009, which was dry, so if you like orange marmalade, pineapple tart and vanilla cookie sugariness in your Sauvignon Blancs, it's for you.",86,Captûre 2010 Les Pionniers Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County)
"Canned fruit—both peach and pineapple—show good depth against a slightly smoky backdrop. Round and silky on the palate, there's a balance of acid to give brightness.",87,McPherson 2015 Castaño Prado Vineyards Albariño (Texas)
"Spiced plum, crushed blue flower, black currant and a whiff of warms spice waft out of the glass. The high-toned palate delivers ripe blackberry, date and dried cherry accented with notes of nutmeg, licorice and black pepper. Velvety tannins provide structure.",92,Monte del Frà 2009 Scarnocchio  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"A blend of 28% Cabernet Franc, 23% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Malbec, 18% Petit Verdot and 10% Merlot, this is a big, bold and powerful wine, with superb balance and a firm, concentrated structure that promises great long-term aging. Dense aromas and flavors of blackberry, boysenberry, cherry and fig are layered with notes of cocoa powder, roasted espresso bean and cigar tobacco. Ripe, rich and lush, but not overdone, hints of charred oak and black pepper linger on the finish. Drink 2018–2025.",94,Mvemve Raats 2012 MR de Compostella Red (Stellenbosch)
"This has a dark ruby appearance, opening with succulent aromas of black cherry, bitter chocolate and licorice. It boasts loads of intensity and a youthful, astringent quality to its tannins. Let it age 10 years or more.",91,Moccagatta 2009 Bric Balin  (Barbaresco)
"The majority of grapes within this red are grown in Yountville and certified organic. Simple aromatics make way for a touch of reduction on the nose, while flavors of brushy sage, cedar and clove offer more spice than fruit. Sharp tannins lie beneath.",86,Grgich Hills 2013 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A chunky, solid wine, its tannins as important as its fruitiness. It shows black fruits, ripe bitter cherry flavors, along with dense tannins. Offering a powerful blast of Pinot Noir, and worth aging for three years.",88,Nuiton-Beaunoy 2011  Pommard
"Packed with ripe blackberry fruits, this is a dense, concentrated wine. It has a powerful structure that is filled out with delicious jammy fruits. The wine is perfumed and fresh with acidity while keeping its solid, dark character that is at its heart. Drink now, although the wine will be even better from 2018.",91,Barão de Vilar 2011 Statement  (Port)
"Citrus, pear and peach open the bouquet. The palate shows a soft, creamy perlage, with a tangerine note and even a touch of crushed clove, giving this sparkler a unique personality.",87,Gregoletto NV Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"While ripe, this also has a firm structure, with a mix of rich yellow-fruit flavors and austere minerality. With the acidity just beginning to soften, it will turn into a full and more rounded wine.",87,Domaine de la Garenne 2009  Mâcon-Azé
"With 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a structured wine, firm with tannins that contrast with the black-currant fruits. Still full of young tannins, it will develop well over the next few years. Wait to drink until 2019.",90,Château Laffitte Carcasset 2013  Saint-Estèphe
"Mild apple and white-fruit aromas are a bit wheaty like bread. Conversely, the palate is tight, with pulling lemony acidity. Like the nose, this tastes wheaty and like stone fruits, while the finish is distinctly leesy.",88,Luna Beberide 2015 Godello (Bierzo)
"Rich aromas of late summer are here: the ripe peel of yellow pears, luscious peach and yellow Mirabelle plum plus some dried hayflower notes. There is power and depth, along with some alcoholic heat and balancing acidity—beautiful now but it will get even better. Drink until 2020.",95,Salomon-Undhof 2012 Alte Reben Berglagen Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"Soléna really ups their PG game with this latest vintage, a super rich, succulent effort that is packed to the core with fresh pear fruit flavors. Light touches of cinnamon, and a sense of sweetness from ripe fruit, not residual sugar, keep the flavors expanding through a lush and creamy finish.",91,Soléna 2015 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"Herbal and toasty, this is a smooth, open and forward Pinot. It is showing plenty of barrel influence at the moment, but the fruit seems to thin out a bit in the finish. As it's young, it could certainly flesh out and balance itself with a bit more bottle age.",88,Luminous Hills 2010 Lux Pinot Noir
"This Verdejo hits the sweet spot, with a crisp nose focused on green-apple aromas. The palate has a free-flowing feel and well-presented flavors of apple, peach and melon. An easy-fading finish ends this well.",89,12 Linajes 2015 Verdejo (Rueda)
"Structured and at the same time fruity, this is a wine with good potential. Its tannins and its acidity are balanced to give a warm wine that will be fine to drink from 2019.",86,Château Timberlay 2015  Bordeaux Supérieur
"Enosi is a cool-climate blended white with a beautifully aromatic component that would pair with dishes flavored with wild herbs and fresh cheese. A welcoming floral component is followed by passion fruit, kiwi and chopped basil.",90,Baron di Pauli 2010 Enosi White (Vigneti delle Dolomiti)
"From a vineyard that's bisected by a seasonal creek comes another excellent showing from this vintage, with black slate, lightly smoked blackberries and bloody iron on the nose. The palate is quite lush, with more smoke, brambly berries and roasted fennel, all clinging to a strong graphite core.",93,Mercy 2012 Griva Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco)
"Pink grapefruit, a linear chalky component and the aromas of apricot jam on brie cheese rind show on the nose of this bottling from one of the region's oldest vineyards. There is tight focus to the palate, where green pear skins, pomelo pith, lemon zest and lime juice weave into an acidity that's strong yet expertly integrated.",92,Fess Parker 2014 Sierra Madre Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"This wine comes from a select lot from Boushey Vineyard. Reserved aromas of mineral, funk and dark fruit are followed by taught, layered cranberry and cherry that show precision and deftness.",92,Sequel 2012 Bin 898 Vintage Select Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
Penon stands out for the purity and the directness of its varietal characteristics. Pinot Bianco delivers more in the mouth in terms of structure than it does to the nose. You feel that density here followed by stone fruit and melon.,88,Nals Margreid 2011 Penon Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
"Engaging scents of wild berry, rose petal, aromatic herb and spice lead the nose. The full-bodied palate slowly reveals red cherry, anise, black pepper, clove and tobacco framed in assertive tannins and bright acidity. Give this time to fully open and develop. Drink 2019–2031.",93,Vietti 2011 Ravera  (Barolo)
"Too ripe, with prune, chocolate and raisin flavors that taste hot and sweet in high alcohol. With hard tannins, it could almost be a minor Port.",83,Mounts 2010 Estate Grown Malbec (Dry Creek Valley)
"Clean, balanced and simply refreshing, this Sauvignon Blanc from Sebeka fits perfectly within their line of good, affordable wines. Crisp, clean, but flavorful with tropical fruit, it makes for a dependable summertime classic on the patio.",85,Sebeka 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape)
"This Bordeaux variety more often than not produces a light, fruity wine of charm and early drinkability. Here, the sour cherry fruit is framed in dry, dusty tannins and soft acids. There's an elegance and spicy aftertaste that are very nice. —S.H.",87,Yorkville Cellars 1997 Cabernet Franc (Yorkville Highlands)
"A disagreeable wine, unripe and vegetal, with just a trace of blackberries. Sweet toasty oak adds a little richness.",82,Materra Cunat Family Vineyards 2008 Merlot (Oak Knoll District)
"Initial notes of yeasty citrus are lifted by pear and white blossom on the nose. The citrus-driven palate brings additional blossomy tones alongside Gala apple, with a slight undercurrent of bitter grapefruit pith. Light, fresh and clean, this sparkling Grüner is an attractive option as an apéritif.",86,Mari 2013 Scriptorium Sezession Brut Sparkling Grüner Veltliner (Old Mission Peninsula)
"This is a sculpted, mature wine that has good complexity to its aromas, a core of vivid blackberry flavors and a seamless but moderately tannic texture. It's a very good example of a well-balanced dinner wine that's not a blockbuster.",89,Karine 2012 Love Ranch Vineyard Syrah
"This medium-bodied wine with lightly-ripened red berry fruit flavors is a great showing for the winery's regular bottling. Light touches of herb, cola and earth carry through the finish.",88,Twill 2014 Stormy Morning Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"A rounded, wood-aged wine that shows rich tropical fruits, pineapple and white peach flavors. Hints of vanilla create a warm feeling. It should be aged until at least 2016.",89,Château d'Estoublon 2011 Grenache Blanc (Vin de France)
"Judicious use of new oak meets gorgeous fruit flavors in this generous, warm and softly tannic wine. It's undeniably delicious, broad and satisfying in texture and almost viscous in mouthfeel. Enjoy it now through 2023.",91,Naggiar 2012 Le Grand Pere Estate Reserve Red (Sierra Foothills)
"The new wood and spice flavors still show in this wine. A dry, woody character is still keeping the fruit back. Black coffee flavors show that there was heavy extraction. This 20-acre property is one of four in the greater Saint-Émilion area owned by the Lannoye family.",82,Château Moulin de  Clotte 2012  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux
"White talc and pressed flowers come to mind and color a pristine sparkler with pretty luminosity and a generous disposition. The wine has a soft, yielding texture and offers peachy fruit flavors on the close.",85,Vigne Matte NV Rollmatt Brut  (Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene)
"Going for structure as much as fruit, this is a cool wine with black currant flavors giving high acidity. It feels light, fresh, although there are tannins and spice to give some final weight.",86,Adega Cooperativa do Cartaxo 2007 Bridão Classico Red (Ribatejo)
"This 12-acre estate has produced a ripe, fruity wine, with fine tannins boosted by the spice from the wood aging. Black currant fruits and acidity give freshness to the structured aftertaste. Drink from 2016.",87,Château Lamour 2012  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux
"Made with organically-farmed Catarratto grapes, Beleda is a fragrant white wine with aromas of dried flower, kiwi, mango and lime. There's a sharp, tonic, zesty quality to the mouthfeel.",87,Cantine Rallo 2010 Beleda Catarratto (Alcamo)
"Clearly well-origined, to judge from the fine structure and essential purity. But it's a very tannic, closed wine, with a mouth-numbing astringency that accentuates the acidity. Even so, it's so ripe in blackberries and currants it's almost drinkable now, with a good decant. But you're best off cellaring a good 4–6 years.",90,Cobblestone 2005 Cobblestone Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Aromas of berry, cherry and earthy schist are what the Priorat is known for. This wine feels tight and pure, with firm tannins and a gritty personality. Toasty flavors of mocha, black cherry, raspberry and cassis are generous, while the finish is fresh, tight, balanced and indicates that midterm aging will only help; drink 2017–2022.",93,Marco Abella 2013 Mas Mallola Red (Priorat)
"Whiffs of caramelized sugar and grilled peaches lend a ripe, fruity tone to this otherwise, brash, lean wine. Refreshing on the palate, it's zesty and spry, concluding with a steely, mineral tone.",88,Binz 2013 Nackenheimer Kabinett Trocken Pinot Gris (Rheinhessen)
"Light aromas of wet stone, smoke, stone fruit and white flowers lead to ethereally light yet sweet and flavorful peach notes. It's a very pretty and compelling expression of the variety.",90,Cayuse 2013 Cailloux Vineyard Viognier (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"The wine is subdued and clean on the nose and it doesn't exaggerate or mask the quality of fruit. This is executed in a bright, compact and streamlined style that combines freshness and firmness.",89,Baricci 2007  Brunello di Montalcino
"Dry spice and plum flavors are lean but fair. This feels snappy, crisp and high in acidity, while flavors of plum and berry are loamy and finish mild except for a touch of residual zesty acid.",86,Santa Carolina 2012 Reserva Merlot (Colchagua Valley)
"This blend of 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc displays aromas of cherry, blueberry and bramble berries, backed by aromas of vanilla, nutmeg and cinnamon. The palate is medium bodied with supportive tannins and shows flavors of red berries and baking spices. Leather and cedar carry to the finish joined by a swath of acidity.",88,Becker 2014 Chevaux Noir Cabernet Franc-Merlot (Texas High Plains)
"Briary plum and cherry cough-drop aromas give way to a crisp, fairly full palate with chewy tannins. Plum and peppery spice flavors are kept simple, while this finishes with some dark-berry character and a touch of bitterness.",87,Finca Hispana 2012 Cuvée Monastrell (Jumilla)
"Always a big, ripe wine, Calera's '08 Viognier is a blast of tropical fruits, vanilla, toffee and buttered cinnamon toast. It's a little sweet and one-dimensional, but tasty.",86,Calera 2008 Viognier (Mt. Harlan)
"Castilla y León can be good bargain country, and all of the 2006 Volteo wines are Best Buy qualifiers. This varietal Tempranillo has a clean, fruity nose backed by bright berry flavors built on a floor or two of structure. It's a composed quaffer with pure flavors, adequate length and overall balance.",87,Volteo 2006 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"Subtle and crisp in minerality, this Pinot Blanc has a rich texture and a taste of apple and pear with a savory, herbal element throughout. It would serve nicely as an alternative to Chardonnay, especially on the dinner table.",89,Wente 2012 Small Lot Pinot Blanc (Arroyo Seco)
"Aromas of plum, stewed cherry, milk chocolate and vanilla are accented by notes of smoke. Fruit and barrel flavors intertwine on the palate, with fruit winning out on the finish that narrows a bit.",87,Columbia Crest 2015 H3 Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills)
"This is a sweet white wine with some of the nice qualities of a dry table wine, including distinct apricot aromas and flavors, good acidity and a smooth texture.",86,One Leaf 2013 Moscato (California)
"Light while also intense with good acidity and unctuous honey flavors, this is already a delicious wine, even though it is young. Ripe orange and lemon go with the honey to give a fine wine that could be drunk now, although that would be a shame. It would be much better to wait until 2017. With just over 200 acres of vines, Quarts de Chaume is a tiny enclave in the Layon Valley.",92,Domaine des Baumard 2011  Quarts de Chaume
"Very ripe, almost like the berry-cherry filling from a pastry, this Zin also has notes of chocolate and sweet roasted coconut. It's rough and ready in the mouth, with jagged tannins, and needs meats and cheeses to balance it.",83,Calcareous 2004 Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"This creamed-apple flavored wine is soft, smooth and ripe. It has a dense texture, concentrated structure and rounded corners attractively touched by acidity. The aftertaste is crisp with a fresh, clean finish. Screwcap. Artisanal Cellars, Select Wines.",87,Tegernseerhof 2012 T26 Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"Named for the soil layers important to wine's terroir, this Pinot is sourced from a variety of sites and multiple clones, providing a complexity of wild strawberry, high acidity and an herbaceous, oaky backdrop. A teasing kiss of toffee and chocolate on the finish is deliciously intriguing.",92,J Vineyards & Winery 2012 Strata Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This is a straightforward wine showing ripe tropical fruits and a melon rind character, while mint and lemon peel ride out in the background. The fruit disappears quickly on the finish but a lovely herbaceousness takes its place.",86,Kennedy Point 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"This is a simple Merlot, but it's dry in style with tart sour-cherry flavors.",82,Round Hill 2011 Merlot (California)
"Spicy plum and currant aromas have an earthy note about them. This feels raw and lean. Berry and plum flavors are candied, with oaky/spicy accents. On the finish, it's peppery tasting then bitter once the fruit fades.",84,Santa Carolina 2013 Reserva Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)
"Winemaker: Johan Malan. A blend of 66% Roussanne, 28% Grenache Blanc and 6% Verdelho, this opens with pretty scents of tangy orange zest, crisp pear and melon rind, all framed by hints of fresh hay, savory herbs and a chalky minerality. The medium-weight palate is round and soft, yet enlivened by bright acidity that carries through to the finish, alongside notes of clove-spiked orange and toasted oak. Drink now–2020.",91,Simonsig 2015 Cape Winemakers Guild Mediterraneo White (Stellenbosch)
"Yellow peach, lemon, Asian pear and citrus peels show on the nose of this bottling by Matt Villard. It's very light and reserved on the palate, which is what makes it refreshing, with flavors of ripe nectarine, pan-seared apple and cider. A sizzle of acidity runs through it.",89,MCV 2016 Viognier (Paso Robles)
"Once you get beyond the billowing violet and gardenia notes on the nose and palate, you're likely to find a surprisingly delicate sip that's bright with lime-juice acidity and honeyed pineapple and hibiscus-nectar flavors.",88,Mazza Vineyards 2010 Ice Wine Vidal Blanc (Lake Erie)
"Very broad but also complete and elegant aromas show on this bottling, including Asian pear, yellow apple, Meyer lemon, wet stone and a touch of browned butter. The mouthfeel is very tense though not overly sharp in acidity, with lemon and key lime citrus. That tension holds deep into the sip.",92,Testarossa 2015 Soberanes Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Strained, funky aromas of corn chips don't include much fruit. This is mostly acid on the palate, while it tastes raw, choppy and citric. A tart finish fails to rescue this substandard rosé.",82,Alta Vista 2015 Malbec Rosé (Mendoza)
"Strong wood aging and toasty flavors dominate this wine. They give a hard extracted edge which takes away from the black-currant fruitiness. While this will soften, the fruit in this vintage should have been allowed more expression. Drink the wine from 2020.",88,Château Mongravey 2014  Margaux
"Tangy and juicy, this is a bright, still tight wine. A strong mineral character dominates the texture and suggests the wine needs time to allow the crisp citrus and acidity to come through. Drink from 2017.",86,Domaines Devillard 2014 Domaine de la Garenne  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
"Delicate aromas of honeysuckle, white stone fruit and citrus present themselves to the nose while the fun, simple palate shows green pear and a hint of lime. Zesty acidity gives it a tangy close.",85,Castello della Rosa 2014 Pinot Grigio (Vigneti delle Dolomiti)
"A lovely Cabernet, richly attractive and deeply flavored in blackberries, blueberries and black currants. Made from vineyards scattered across Napa Valley, the wine has been blended with a splash of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. It shows a dramatic structure marked particularly by firm, smooth tannins, and it finishes dry. Shows the stuffing to age for 10-plus years, but it's polished enough to drink now, after decanting.",95,Yao Ming 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This is a lovely wine to drink now. It's so dry and elegantly constructed, with wonderfully ripe tannins and great integration of oak with the fruit. There's a nice balance of acidity to balance the blackberry, cherry and cola flavors. Drink now, with a brief decant.",91,Steven Kent 2007 Smith Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley)
"Effusive and inviting fruit and spice aromas plus tangy, tasty black-cherry and cranberry flavors inhabit this full-bodied, beautifully focused wine. It's solidly balanced, not at all shy about oak flavors and engagingly complex. Drink now through 2020.",93,Black Kite 2013 River Turn Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Spices, a hint of honey, a texture of pears and white plums—this is a rich, soft wine with a good intensity of taste and ripeness.",85,Domaine de Granajolo 2009 Blanc Vermentino (Corse Porto Vecchio)
"Robustly concentrated, this is a rich rewarding wine exuberantly layered in black raspberry and blackberry flavor. Boldly structured, with depth and length for days, it hits the palate with pleasing jolts of cinnamon, clove and black licorice.",92,Quivira 2015 Anderson Ranch Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"Full-bodied wine, with red fruits, an attractive bite of spice and a background of the crispest acidity. The wine has richness, making it food friendly. Screwcap.",87,Les Maîtres Vignerons de Saint-Louis 2010 Terres de Saint-Louis Rosé (Coteaux Varois)

"Aromas of woodland berry, baking spice, orange zest, crushed rose and a whiff of balsam come together in the glass. It's savory and elegant, with tightly wound, fine-grained tannins that support ripe wild cherry, raspberry, cinnamon, mineral and menthol.",91,Nicosia 2012 Vulkà Rosso  (Etna)
"Lots of black rocks and turned earth gives depth to the dark black-cherry core elements on the nose of this blend of 55% Syrah and 45% Cabernet Sauvignon. Dried cherries, asphalt, espresso bean and chopped herbs arise on the palate.",89,Pianetta 2012 Bilancio Red (Monterey)
"This is an unusually complex Shiraz for the price, ably marrying meaty-savory notes with tart berries and plenty of weight on the palate. Crisp structure, finishes long, with lingering acids. Drink now–2018.",90,Hungerford Hill 2008 Heavy Metal Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)
"This wine with great potential is produced by the husband-and-wife team of Jorge Serôdio Borges and Sandra Tavares da Silva. it is structured, although the fruit is already rich enough to indicate its ripe character. Drink this smoky, wood-aged wine from 2020.",93,Wine & Soul 2014 Pintas Red (Douro)
"A blend of Sangiovese, 15% Canaiolo and 5% Mammolo, this has earthy aromas of truffle, tilled soil, iris and ripe dark-skinned fruit. The chewy palate doles out juicy black cherry, ripe blackberry, black pepper, clove and a hint of mocha alongside solid tannins.",90,Le Casalte 2012  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano
"Aromas of raspberry compote, vanilla, clove and a balsamic note slowly emerge on this structured red. The firm yet elegant palate shows dark cherry, cranberry, licorice, chopped herb and mineral.

"This luminous Greco di Tufo offers pretty aromas of peach, vanilla, banana and light mineral shadings. It's easy and fresh in the mouth with lime and citrus flavors that characterize its crisp close. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers.",85,Benito Ferrara 2007  Greco di Tufo
"The 11th vintage of Abacela's Albariño is a racy wine, with excellent varietal character. Fruit flavors suggest a mix of cucumber, apple, citrus and melon. There's a trace of oyster shell minerality and a bracing whiff of sea breeze on the finish.",89,Abacela 2011 Albariño (Umpqua Valley)
"This easygoing, informal wine offers subdued aromas suggesting cassis, raisin and a note of dried herb. The simple palate shows mature plum and a hint of clove alongside fleeting tannins.",84,Umani Ronchi 2015 Podere  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo)
"Big and tannic, but tempting and tasty at the same time, this wine tastes ripe, full bodied and fruity, wrapping a blanket of fine tannins around the richness to keep it from being too sweet or overripe. It's half Merlot and half Petite Sirah.",87,Twisted Twig 2011 Sommelier Quality Fifty-Fifty Red (El Dorado County)
"Fragrant blue flower, rose, new leather, cake spice and wild berry aromas set the tone on this classic Barolo. On the full-bodied, savory palate, solid tannins wrap around a juicy cherry-raspberry core while notes of cinnamon and clove add depth. Drink 2019–2028.",93,Rivetto 2013 del Comune di Serralunga d'Alba  (Barolo)
"Red fruit dominates this attractive, light wine that shows the acidity of the year while also suggesting light tannins. The aftertaste has a touch of smokiness. It will develop quickly.",87,Faiveley 2014  Bourgogne
"This is a structured wine, with dry tannins and notes of berry and red cherry. The fruit comes through the smoky character, bringing sweet-tasting acidity. Give this wine 3–4 years to age.",85,Château le Moulin de la Jaumarde 2009  Bordeaux
"Concentrated and bright, this blend of 63% Grenache and 37% Syrah has deep flavors of strawberry and licorice. Ready to age for several years, it has a mountain's worth of tannins, and yet it is incredibly light on its feet.",92,Prospect 772 2010 The Brat Grenache-Syrah (Calaveras County)
"This medium-bodied, succulent wine blends three varieties into a complex and harmonious whole. Melon, stone fruit and grapefruit flavors are tinged with hints of peppery-gingery spice, then end long and mouthwatering.",90,Hunky Dory 2016 Tangle Estate Grown Organic Pinot Gris-Gewurztraminer-Riesling White (Marlborough)
"This firm, perfumed, dry wine has concentrated spice and raisin flavors. Owned by the group that also owns Taylor Fladgate and Fonseca, Romariz continues to forge its own identity.",92,Romariz 2009 Vintage  (Port)
"Very dark and dramatic, this delicious wine combines great balance with power. It has exotic fruit flavors and a light spiciness. The smooth, sculpted mouthfeel comes with rich, almost thick tannins that seem to extend the finish. This will find its full potential sometime after 2020.",93,Borjón 2014 Reposado Petite Sirah (Amador County)
"Intensely mineral on the nose with aromas of wet granite and steel, this delicate dry Riesling builds in floral, fruity exuberance on the palate.

"Some wines are meant for immediate consumption. Others require age. This wonderful wine satisfies on both sides. It's softly rich and polished in tannins, with accessible blackberry, cassis and oak flavors. Yet it has the structure and depth to go for years. Now–2016, at least.",95,Blackbird Vineyards 2007 Paramour Red (Napa Valley)
"Ripe Bosc pear with its textured peel sets the tone. An underlying base of luscious ripeness, is cut through with lively, zesty lemon freshness. It resonates with fruit at the very height of its expression: a pleasant edge of bitterness, ample texture, concentration and authenticity.",94,Pichler-Krutzler 2013 Kellerberg Riesling (Wachau)
"This small-production Malbec (75 cases) dances in and out in terms of balance. On the nose, prune, raisin and blueberry aromas are ripe and effusive. On the palate, however, high acidity makes this jumpy. Plum, berry and cassis flavors qualify as fruity, while the finish drills away due to potent, cutting acidity.",89,Nunum 2011 Malbec (Uco Valley)
"This has the sharp, spicy excellence of the best Washington Syrahs; it's got precision, depth and texture. The fruit flavors are compact, buttressed with earthy flavors that include iron and mineral and herb. There is a leafy edge to the tannins suggestive of tobacco. It's a complex and fascinating wine that should age well.",91,Januik 2005 Lewis Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Beautifully intense and elegant, this opens with fine aromas of spice, dried fruit, cola, tar and ground licorice. It delivers a long, silky sensation in the mouth.",92,Beni di Batasiolo 2006 Vigneto Cerequio  (Barolo)
"A light, sweet wine that has a faint prickle and candied-strawberry flavors. It is ready to drink.",83,Casa de Vilacetinho 2015 Flamingo Escolha Rosé (Vinho Verde)
"Oak plays a prominent role in this Chard, giving it a wealth of sweet vanilla custard, butterscotch, toast and caramelized aromas and flavors. Under that coat is a ripe wine packed with pineapples and Meyer lemons. Drink this flamboyant wine now.",90,Stuhlmuller Vineyards 2006 Reserve Chardonnay (Alexander Valley)
"There are some unripe, vegetal flavors in this Pinot Noir. It's dry and simple, although it does boast some cherry and currant flavors, and has a nice, silky texture. Ready now.",84,Simple Math Cellars 2008 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"A good Grenache from the standpoint of a dry red wine. The wine is extraordinarily rich in cherry fruit, and is nicely silky, with firm, juicy acidity. Neutral oak adds just a touch of smoke. Drink now.",89,Standing Sun 2009 Camp Four Vineyard Grenache (Santa Barbara County)
"Bright but basic plum, spice and leather aromas are uncomplicated. This feels grabby and rugged, with chewy tannins. Leafy red-fruit flavors offer a jammy side note, while this finishes with dry, scouring tannins.",86,Finca Patagonia 2015 Expedicion Syrah (Maule Valley)
"This ripe wine is full of apple and pear fruit with a touch of citrus. It is full, the acidity just pointing up the richness. There are almond flavors as well as spice from the wood aging. Drink from 2018.",86,Adega Vila Real 2016 Premium White (Douro)
"This wine's light aromas include herb, black pepper, licorice and cherry notes, showing volatility. It's full bodied on the palate, with black cherry flavors that run a bit sweet.",87,Corvus 2014 Mourvèdre (Red Mountain)
"Thick and foresty, this Pinot Noir embodies the extremes of the Perli Vineyard. It bursts with dark blue and earthy red fruits that are tempered by a savory undertone. This wine takes time to reveal itself, so age it for 5–7 years, and pair it with stews, risottos or seasoned braised lamb.",91,Arista 2010 Perli Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino Ridge)
"Concentrated, with a strongly tannic element that is balanced by ripe fruits. It makes for a well-structured, impressive wine that also has a fruity element. Age for 4–5 years.",90,Château de Pitray 2010  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux
"This 100% Merlot wine from 30-year-old vines is one of the producer's limited productions. The wine is superrich in the plump, generous style. Its black-plum fruits give it the weight and ripeness as well as the smooth texture. There is a bite of pepper from the alcohol that spoils the opulent full aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",89,Bernard Magrez 2012 Egregore Cuvée d'Exception  (Côtes de Bourg)
"Oaky aromas of maple and molasses are overriding and ponderous. In the mouth, this is tannic and punishing. Flavors of coconut and chocolate are overly dominant, leaving nothing but candied stickiness and wood resin on the finish.",82,Larchago 2009 Reserva  (Rioja)
"Honey, white flower, peach and lemon blossom are some of the pretty aromas on offer. Light and delicate, it also feels creamy, rich and sweet on the finish.",87,Mauro Sebaste 2011  Moscato d'Asti
"Underbrush, oak, mint, blackberry and licorice sensations all come together on this full-bodied Rosso. Showing the warmth of the vintage, it's forward and very accessible so enjoy now with hearty first courses.",87,Pietroso 2012  Rosso di Montalcino
"The nose on this wine smells candied for the most part, with a pinch of minerality to go with sweet red berry and red licorice scents. The mouthfeel is crisp and fresh, while cherry, red plum and cassis flavors lead onto an active finish.",86,Federico Paternina 2008 Marqués de Valparaiso Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"Comprised of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this bears aromas of clover honey, char, dark chocolate and a late-to-develop savory meat tone. On the palate, there's enough flesh to buffer its high amount of fine-grained, muscular tannins. A rose petal note unfurls across the midpalate, leading to a finish marked with enduring grip.",86,Boxwood 2010 Red (Virginia)
This wine shows an almost-black core with a red rim. Jammy blackberry aromas lead to rich and mouth-coating fruit flavors that are ripe. The full body and firm tannins create a thick texture. This rich wine begs for aged cheese or a chocolate dessert for accompaniment. It's made with 50% Syrah and 25% each of Petite Sirah and Zinfandel.,93,Renwood 2012 Red (Amador County)
"This opens with earthy aromas of forest floor, tilled soil, dark berry and a whiff of baking spices. Made with very old vines, the concentrated palate doles out black cherry, blackberry, clove and anise alongside fresh acidity.",89,Vinchio-Vaglio Serra 2013 Vecchie Vigne 50  (Barbera d'Asti)
"Made from fruit grown in the eastern reaches of the Vaca Mountains, a warm place for grapes, this 100% varietal wine delivers a voluptuously smooth experience, shining in baked cherry and plum. Amid its biting tension of ripeness awaits a swath of dark chocolate and tobacco.",93,Hall 2013 Eighteen Seventy-Three Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Light and clean in the nose, with attractive hints of nutmeg and other baking spices. It's certainly not dull, what with its fresh grapefruit, nectarine and tangerine flavors. A crisp, refreshing finish is the final act, making it perfect to accompany shellfish.",88,Frog's Leap 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Subdued but promising apple-ripeness on the nose leads to a rounded, fully mature palate that rings with fresh and dried apple. There are hints of hay and and a wonderfully, clean core of lemon freshness that is supremely well cushioned on these rich, intense flavors. Drink 2016–2019.",91,Frédéric Mallo 2010 Rosacker Grand Cru Vieilles Vignes Riesling (Alsace)
"Pretty aromas of red berry, menthol, savory herb and cooking spice lead the nose. The palate offers tart red cherry, white pepper and Mediterranean herb alongside firm, refined tannins and bright acidity. It needs time to develop fully. Drink 2017–2022.",90,Ruffino 2010 Greppone Mazzi  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"This is a pleasant bottle, with delicate fruit flavors that suggest watermelon and strawberry—nothing riper. There's a distinct impression of white balsamic vinegar, adding a high-toned lift that's just on the edge of too much, at least for some tasters.",87,Cathedral Ridge 2013 Dampier Vineyard Pinot Noir (Columbia Gorge (OR))
"Light, lean wine that has some firm structure. The fruit, though, is really not there, just hints of black currant floating past.",86,Château Lynch-Moussas 2006  Pauillac
"A Bordeaux blend of five grapes, this melds blackberry and black cherry fruit with plenty of toasty oak and ground coffee. It's a nice mix of fruit and barrel, dark and smoky, but not too heavy at 14.2% alcohol.",91,William Church 2007 Sur La Mer Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Earth and smoke join fruity, fresh apples on the nose. The palate is equally apple-fruited and very appetizing, full of freshness and friendly fruit on a dry, slender body. The juicy, poised cleanliness lingers beautifully.",90,Kuentz-Bas 2013 Geisberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"Fresh, green fruit is topped by a creamy texture. It is apples and cream, with a touch of cinnamon—just like mom used to bake. And at the same time, there is minerality and lively acidity.",90,Josef Jamek 2006 Ried Achleiten Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"Ripe fruit aromas of cherry and blackberry jam appear on the nose and give this wine a sunny personality. Make no mistake, this is an easy, decidedly un-complex wine, but it is fun and refreshing to drink over an informal meal with family and friends.",84,La Colombaia 2006 Terre delle Fornaci  (Chianti Colli Fiorentini)
"Brambly raspberry aromas are accented with a dusting of minerals on this dry, refreshing rosé. The palate is delicate with subtle red-cherry flavor but finishes elegantly with a lingering cherry blossom perfume.",89,Fox Run 2013 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes)
"Next door to the top grand cru of Chambertin, this vineyard, with its east-facing exposure, is one of the stars of Gevrey-Chambertin. This vintage is hugely rich—ripe with voluminous fruit and smoky hints from the wood aging. It has density and the potential for long aging. Drink from 2025.",96,Louis Jadot 2014  Chambertin Clos de Bèze
"The blend, dominated by Grenache, produces a ripe wine. It is softly textured, full of red berries and the typical edge of pepper from the Grenache. There is a juicy spicy aftertaste. Drink now.",88,Château Barbeiranne 2016 Tradition Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This creamy, oaky Malbec opens with aromas of rubber and raw oak, although with airing black plum, blackberry and chocolate scents rise up. Full, creamy and jammy in feel, this tastes of black plum, blackberry, chocolate and vanilla. A heady, oaky, sticky finish wraps it up.",88,Don Miguel Gascón 2012 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza)
"The Rockpile appellation's extreme growing conditions make this wine hugely concentrated and powerfully rich. Offers explosive blackberry jam, currant and dark chocolate flavors, wrapped into big tannins. High alcohol gives it a warm mouthfeel.",88,Carol Shelton 2009 Rockpile Reserve Rockpile Vineyard Petite Sirah (Rockpile)
"This is a brand-new bottling from Merry Edwards. It's her first from Westside Road, which is warmer than her haunting grounds around the southern part of the valley. It's quite a promising debut. The wine is round, soft, charming and complex, with elaborate cherry, blackberry, licorice and cola flavors. It feels important and ageworthy. Drink now, with several hours of decanting, or cellar through 2020.",95,Merry Edwards 2009 Georganne Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Tropical fruit, banana and citrus aromas are flat and not fully convincing. This is narrow in feel, with bland stone-fruit flavors. The finish follows the palate, meaning it's good enough but unremarkable.",85,Val do Sosego 2015 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Soulful and smooth, this conveys classic Sangiovese fragrances of ripe black cherry, leather, scorched earth, baking spice and crushed violet. The savory palate doles out ripe wild cherry, cinnamon, grilled herb, tobacco and mineral alongside big, velvety tannins and surprising freshness for the vintage. It's already delicious but will age for years. Drink through 2027. Grand Cru Selections, Oliver McCrum Wines.",94,Il Paradiso di Manfredi 2007  Brunello di Montalcino
"This vibrant red opens with aromas of ground pepper, dark-skinned fruit and blue flower. The tight palate delivers ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper and aromatic herb along a backbone of firmly packed, polished tannins and bright acidity. It's still young and needs to unwind. Drink 2017–2022.",90,Tenuta San Mauro 2012  Barbaresco
"An oily character of tangerine skin, peach flesh and condensed nuts meets with caramel, pinched soda and cut stone-fruit freshness on the nose of this top bottling from the Los Gatos producer. The palate shows ripe Granny Smith apple flesh, seared pears and almond oil, with a sea-salt splash on the finish.",93,Testarossa 2013 Diana's Chardonnay (California)
"This new wine from the Laroche family of Chablis is a good, though standard, Chilean Chardonnay. Peach, ctirus and wax aromas lead to a round palate with ample acidity. It tastes like apple, banana and other tropical fruits, with sweetness and honey on the finish.",86,Laroche 2011 Punto Niño Reserva Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)
"Great depth of flavor with fruit and a layer of mature almond nuttiness. The wine shows some wood, but also dried figs, prunes and some mature acidity. Not quite dry, but edging in that direction.",89,Rozes NV White Reserva  (Port)
"Grown on Antinori's original property, high on Atlas Peak, although you'd never know it from searching the front or back labels. It's a very fine wine, dry and elegantly constructed, with little of the baby fat over-the-topness that affects some Napa Cabs. Within that firm structure are extraordinarily complex blackberry, black currant and spicy plum flavors. Delicious now despite the firm tannins, and should develop over the next 8–10 years, at least.",94,Antica 2007 Antinori Family Estate Red (Napa Valley)
"Steely and smoky, this luscious, full-bodied wine has a gorgeous mineral tone. The palate is dry, yet decadently fruity and floral, with loads of dainty blossoms and yellow cherries. A rich, nuanced, impeccably balanced wine.",92,Kühling-Gillot 2009 Nierstein Pettenthal GG Trocken Riesling (Rheinhessen)
"An enormously fruity sparking wine, this one offers complex aromas of raspberries and baked bread, with a hint of lime. It really comes alive in the mouth, thanks to refreshing acidity and fine bubbles that scour the palate. This clean wine has just enough of a dose of sweetness to prod the fruit forward. Only 125 cases produced.",90,Iron Horse 1995 Vrais Amis  (Sonoma County)
"Pure Alicante Bouschet, this wine is rich and generously ripe. At this young stage it does seem to have surfeit of toasty wood and hopefully this will integrate. It's certainly not shy, with its bold black currant flavors and balanced acidity. Drink this wine from 2017.",90,Terras de Alter 2014 Terra d'Alter Alicante Bouschet (Alentejano)
"Soft and ripe, this is a refreshing wine that has a dash of Moscatel in the blend to give a perfumed character. It is light in texture, very fruity and ready to drink.",84,Cooperativa Agricola de Santo Isidro de Pegoes 2014 Dona Helena Branco White (Península de Setúbal)
"The winery's smaller Zin projects are fantastic, and this is a great example, with aromas of strawberry extract mingling with mint, anise and leather. The palate is even more savory, with mushrooms, olives and herb-crusted roast beef, benefiting from ripe plum fruit as well.",92,Peachy Canyon 2012 Snow Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"Right away this goes wrong; the nose is smothered with charred, burning oak that smells harsh and like chemicals. A tannic, resiny palate is barely acceptable, as are bitter, burnt, resiny blackberry flavors.",80,Sembro 2012 Vendimia Seleccionada  (Ribera del Duero)
This fruity wine features strawberry and bitter cherry flavors. A lightly tannic structure accompanies a very fragrant and smoky character. Wood shows through at the end. Drink from 2015.,86,Bouchard Père & Fils 2012 Réserve  (Bourgogne)
"A good wine in many respects, but it has dry, astringent tannins that make it feel harsh and sticky. The cherry and blackberry flavors are ripe and somewhat medicinal.",83,St. Francis 2004 Syrah (Sonoma County)
"This extracted Malbec blend deals full doses of blueberry, blackberry, balsamic vinegar, vanilla and mocha aromas. The palate weighs in on the jammy, overripe side, with almost no acidic cut. Soupy, ultraripe flavors of crème de cassis, carob and prune finish raisiny. Drink this syrupy wine through 2017.",88,Bressia 2010 Profundo Red (Mendoza)
"Light to the point of being watery, it has dilute red berry flavors. A toasty edge, perhaps from new oak, is not fully integrated.",85,Eight Bells 2011 Red Willow Vineyard Sangiovese (Yakima Valley)
"Almond blossom, stone fruit and a tiny touch of exotic spice or cracked white pepper shape the nose of this luminous, bright and very elegant sparkler. The wine has a creamy, sweet personality and offers loads of peach flavors on the finish. Particella 68 is a vineyard designate from the Vidor area of Proseccoland and the enologist employs special methods to maintain those fresh fragrances.",90,Sorelle Bronca NV Extra Dry Particella 68  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
"Ripe, full-bodied black cherry fruit shines here, with good tannin support. The wine is rich across the palate, with clean, focused, lingering flavors that really extend into a terrifically long finish.",93,Erath 2009 Leland Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"88-90 Barrel sample. Perfumed, light, hinting at minerality, the wine has a smooth veneer over the dusty tannins. The final effect is rich and polished.",89,Château Fontenil 2008 Barrel sample  (Fronsac)
"Too sweet and Porty with sugared, caramelized wild berry flavors, and a pie-filling sweetness made heavy by high alcohol.",83,Hawley 2005 Ponzo Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
"A rich, tight, warm wine from organic grapes. Red plum, firm tannins and a sophisticated feel give this wine both structure, dark fruits and an ageworthy character. This is a fine wine, balanced and with fine acidity.",90,Mas de Gourgonnier 2009 Red (Les Baux de Provence)
"A serviceable Syrah, with somewhat muted blueberry and huckleberry fruit, pepper and herb. Medium concentration, with more of the herbal and stem flavors coming through in the tannins.",86,Pomum 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The Flying Pig is a blend of 60% Cabernet Franc and 40% Merlot. Bursting with a ripe, succulent cherry flavor, it offers layers of blackberry and spice, with floral highlights of talcum powder and rose. It's has a potpourri tone that dots the long, spicy finish. Perfect for ribs in a sweet barbecue sauce.",93,Cayuse 2009 Flying Pig Cabernet Franc-Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (OR))
"Troon's reserve is not all that different from the regular bottling. The color is a bit darker, and the tannins have been boosted. The fruit is compact and tightly wound.",85,Troon 1999 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Applegate Valley)
"A blend of two-thirds Chardonnay and one-third Pinot Noir, this emits an inviting whiff of caramel apple. On the palate, the frothy mousse is dry and balanced.",90,Scharffenberger NV Brut Excellence Sparkling (Mendocino County)
"An herbal edge of lemon balm plays amidst the citrus and pineapple-scented nose of this immensely concentrated Riesling. Pleasantly bitter notes of apple and pear peel add an earthy quality and a firm structure that allows citrus aromas of lemon zest, pink grapefruit and tangerine peel to soar.",93,Malat 2013 Das Beste vom Riesling Reserve Riesling (Kremstal)
"Chardonnay grown at the mouth of the Loire is as crisp and green as you would expect. This unoaked wine has touches of pear and definite citrus, very fresh and light.",85,Château du Coing de Saint-Fiacre 2007 Domaine du Coing de Saint-Fiacre Cuvée Aurore Chardonnay (Vin de Pays du Val de Loire)
"Showing excellent concentration and structure, this sharply etched wine sets vivid fruit flavors of raspberries and pie cherries against buoyant acidity. The focus is excellent, right on through a crisp finish.",90,Mercer 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This vintage is even better than the prior version, which is almost unimaginable, but there it is. Floral and as tempting as blueberry pie, this concoction from Jesse Katz is velvety smooth and silky on the palate. White chocolate dances around its edges, along with a strong suggestion of cigar, which may perhaps come from the fine lady on the label.",95,Devil Proof 2013 Farrow Ranch Malbec (Alexander Valley)
"With the goal of adding subtle aromatics and structure, this wine was given eight months in 50% new French oak puncheons, with the other 50% in neutral. The wine intrigues as much as refreshes, with crisp acidity and bright sparks of citrus prominent. Medium bodied, it has a complexity of baked apple and pear lurking in the background.",92,Gary Farrell 2013 Rochioli-Allen Vineyards Oak Puncheon Fermented Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This wine opens with the fresh liveliness of stemmy earth and black tea notes, growing funkier and more herbal on the midpalate. Brightly layered and deeply flavored, it's a full-bodied rendition that remains true to its variety.",91,Davis Bynum 2014 Jane's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"From a great Douro vintage, this is a ripe wine, packed with generous fruit and concentrated tannins. Berry flavors and juicy acidity dominate a wine that has plenty of power while keeping elegance and stylishness. Drink now.",93,Quinta do Sagrado 2011 Reserva Red (Douro)
"Elegant and silky on the nose, this bottling shows aromas of pressed violet, rose bud, grape candy, cherry blossom and lilac. There is a lot of cinnamon and star anise spice on the palate as well as a strong touch of licorice that's laid across deep olallieberry fruit and a lavender florality.",93,Fiddlehead 2011 Lollapalooza Fiddlestix Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Bursting with floral aromas, this loads the palate with flavors of rose petals, lychee, grapefruit and spice. Finishing dry, it has outstanding concentration, tension and length.",91,Tinhorn Creek 2013 Gewurztraminer (Okanagan Valley)
"A rich, rounded wine, benefiting from concentrated fruit. There are solid tannns, dark bitter cherry fruits, licorice and fine ripeness. The aftertaste is ripe and sweet.",90,Domaine du Vissoux 2006 Les Trois Roches  (Moulin-à-Vent)
"This is a light, juicy and snappy Chardonnay, with peach and pineapple notes held in line against crisp green-apple acidity.",85,Brengman Brothers 2013 Estate Grown Artist Series Crain Hill Vineyards Unoaked Chardonnay (Leelanau Peninsula)
"A blend of Fernão Pires and Arinto, this fruity wine is deliciously refreshing and crisp, with great acidity. It is bright with lemon acidity finished with pink grapefruit. Drink now.",86,Wines & Winemakers 2016 Samora Branco White (Tejo)
"Lean and tough, but not without a certain charm, this Cab's blackberry and currant flavors are wrapped in hard, edgy tannins. The sweet core of fruit will wake up when paired with rich beef dishes.",86,Brander 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Intensely plush aromas of peach, daffodil, sweet rose and even pineapple show on the nose of this botting. There's lots of sizzle to the racy sip, where tart green apple, green pear and green-tomato flavors make for a tangy, refreshing wine.",89,Brecon Estate 2015 Albariño (Central Coast)
"The winery makes this wine from vines planted in 1959 that it now farms organically. In this vintage, they produced a hearty, sizable wine, ripe, soft and intense, in need of time to coax the blackberry and cassis fruit forward. Enjoy through 2025.",92,Grgich Hills 2010 Yountville Selection Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A bouquet of white peach, honeysuckle and rose petal with a whiff of freshly mowed grass yields to flavors of cantaloupe, Turkish delight and nutmeg joined by a touch of salinity. Soft mouthfeel and well-integrated flavors make way for a bright floral splash on the finish.",89,Tabor 2013 Adama Sauvignon Blanc (Galilee)
"Full bodied and fruity, the 2010 estate Syrah from Va Piano is rounder and less herbal than the 2009. Which style you enjoy is a matter of individual preference. Big and approachable, with lovely blueberry fruit, the 2010 seems to stop a bit short, but with more bottle age may reveal details that are currently in hiding.",90,Va Piano 2010 Estate Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This wine tastes like a superripe, late-harvest and lavishly oaked version, so that all the aromas and flavors seem to be in overdrive. It smells like cinnamon and vanilla, tastes like strawberry jam, and has a little white pepper in the finish.",86,Whiplash 2013 Zinfandel (Lodi)
"The cool 2011 vintage was kind to Calera's Viognier, helping to rein in the fruit which sometimes can be overwhelming. You still get plenty of tropical fruit and honeysuckle flavor, but it's just part of a package that also includes acidity, oak and minerals.",90,Calera 2011 Viognier (Mt. Harlan)
"Pungent and assertively herbal, this blend of Chehalem's three estate vineyards has aromatics to spare, along with an earthy mix of root, stem and brambly fruit. There's a streak of cola also, and it delivers plenty of power for a cool vintage wine that clocks in at 12.7% alcohol.",89,Chehalem 2011 Three Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This Chardonnay's acidity and minerally structure are finely balanced, and its palate already shows richness. Full, fruity and textured, the wine's touch of toast creeps into notice. This is worth aging for 2–3 years.",88,Joseph Faiveley 2010  Puligny-Montrachet
"This is 100% Pinot Noir, which gives richness to the wine. It is generous, with red apple and pear flavors, still very fresh. An attractive final bite says that it will age.",91,Thiénot 2002 Cuvée Garance Blanc de Rouges  (Champagne)
"The largest Chardonnay parcel in the Thomas Fogarty estate portfolio at slightly more than four acres, this slice still only amounts to four barrels of wine. The 2011 starts with a candied, chalky smell, reminiscent of white Smarties, and the flavors lean toward cooked stone fruit, such as caramelized pluot, and charred daffodil.",88,Thomas Fogarty 2011 Langley Hill Vineyard Estate Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"A direct and appealing wine, with notes of wild strawberry, wet stone, cherry and cranberry. It's fruity and concentrated while still retaining lightness of expression. Drawn out fruit flavors linger on the finish.",91,Peller 2011 Icewine Cabernet Franc (Niagara Peninsula)
"Very young, juicy, loaded with boysenberry and black cherry fruit. There is a strong streak of licorice, hints of tobacco and vanilla, but plenty of muscle and stiff tannins. A substantial effort, this ranks at the top of the list of Washington Cabernet Sauvignon priced under $10.",89,Washington Hills 2007 Summit Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Offering deep complexity, this bold, brazen wine is decadent in caramel and toffee aromas and flavors, with a foundation of ripe Gravenstein apple and hazelnuts. The oak is pronounced but it adds more than it subtracts. Cellar through 2018.",91,D.R. Stephens 2013 Star Vineyard Chardonnay (Rutherford)
"Here on display are all the elegance, finesse and ultimate power possible in wines from this exceptional AVA. Tart raspberry fruit, stiff tannins and supporting acids are nuanced with citrus, herb and a light touch of vanilla. Drink this from 2020 to 2030.",91,Quintet 2014 Flanerie Vineyard Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge)
"This mature Tempranillo shows aromas of fig and sherry vinegar along with raisin. A ripe yet pinched feeling palate deals aged flavors of raisin, caramel and toffee, while a chocolaty finish is low on vital fruit. This gran reserva exhibits multiple sherry-like characteristics.",86,Pata Negra 2005 Gran Reserva Tempranillo (Valdepeñas)
Decadent aromas of warmed chocolate and hazelnut coffee lead onto the pliant palate. Chalky tannins keep the vanilla-tinged finish grounded.,85,Canyon Wind 2009 Merlot (Grand Valley)
"Massive, dramatic, beautiful, intense, but young and firm in tannins, with a cut of fresh acidity. Shows concentrated blackberries, black currants, violets, minerals and cedar, leading to a long, penetrating finish. Very great Cabernet, vibrant and potent, just tremendous in structure. Potentially a near-perfect wine with 4–6 years in the bottle.",97,Hestan 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"There are suggestions of wintergreen mint and tart rhubarb, but the cherries save the day, giving enough richness to make the wine interesting. Despite the high acidity and dryness, I don't think it's an ager, but it's a beautifully complex, food-friendly Pinot.",90,Anthill 2005 Demuth Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Popcorn, paint thinner and other oak-driven aromas control the nose on this resiny, woody wine. Like the nose, the flavor profile is barrel dominated. It finishes with resin, sawdust and bitter flavors.",84,Bodega Catena Zapata 2013 Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"Heavily oaked, with peanut aromas masking the fruit. But in the mouth it has more accessible fruit—mostly cassis—and once again the full allotment of wood. It's no surprise when it finishes buttery, and with coffee flavors. A tough one to call now. Will the wood integrate? Will the fruit emerge?",90,Whitehall Lane 1997 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Villa Prandone Navicchio is a pretty expression of Pecorino from Central Italy with resiny aromas of mature apricot, cola and white peppercorn. There's depth and personality here and the wine offers a unique experience.",87,Il Conte 2007 Villa Prandone Navicchio  (Offida Pecorino)
"Cherry fruits and firm tannins band well together in this rich wine. It offers spice from light wood aging, a touch of banana, and full forward fruitiness. The structure suggests it needs to age for a year.",88,Jean-Claude Debeaune 2011 Domaine Mont Chavy  (Morgon)
"Subtle red fruit aromas show a flash of lemon peel. This medium-bodied Malbec is regular in every way—the flavors are a touch earthy, with spice and plum notes. The finish hums along while offering nothing new.",86,Notro 2012 Malbec (Luján de Cuyo)
"This attractively colored sparkler is a light peachy-pink hue, with fragrant aromas of oranges, lemons and tropical fruit. It's light in weight (only 5.5% alcohol) but also rather sweet, and could use just a little zip to help balance out the sugar.",85,Innocent Bystander 2007 Moscato (Victoria)
"Appearing deeply ruby-red to the eye, this semi-sweet wine offers aromas of black cherry, freshly ground black pepper and vanilla bean. There is an interesting touch of coolness amid fruit flavors, especially blueberry and blackberry with notes of custard, caramel and Mediterranean herbs. Smooth tannins and a hint of mint make for a pleasing finish.",90,Teliani Valley 2013 Kindzmarauli Saperavi (Kakheti)
"Sizzling lemon and Asian pear-tinged acidity give this wine an electricity on the palate that finds its companion in the richer overtones of racy cardamom and nutmeg. The 40% new French oak imparts structure and spice rather than an overt influence, letting the complex stone minerality and depth of fruit linger on the finish.",95,Sojourn 2013 Durell Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"A blend of 54% Mourvèdre, 27% Grenache and 19% Syrah from the vineyard's sunniest slope, this very dark wine shows tar, stewed black plum, boysenberry, dense peppercorn, dried lilac and roasted-lamb aromas. The still-young palate is all about density and depth, with asphalt, black pepper and elderberry-crusted beef-roast flavors.",92,Alta Colina 2013 Sun Worshipper Red (Adelaida District)
"Packaged in a massively heavy bottle, Tamurro Nero is a blend of grapes indigenous to Basilicata. It deals spicy tones of cinnamon and sweet tobacco, with notes of dried fruit and black cherry.",88,Tenuta Le Querce NV Tamurro Nero Red (Basilicata)
"Dark, rustic and plummy with layers of earthy meat and licorice, this medium-bodied wine is sourced from Tracy Hills and Lake County. Smoothly textured it's ready to go with cured meats and cheese.",88,Rosa d'Oro 2012 Montepulciano (California)
"Lime and white grapefruit flavors form a bracing backbone of acidity in this rich and fruity, yet breathlessly elegant Riesling. The midpalate boasts plump yellow cherry notes, but the long finish is laser focused and steely.",92,Johannishof 2013 Johannisberg Hölle GG Erste Lage Riesling (Rheingau)
"More tannin than fruit, this is an austere wine that will always be tough. It has a hard edge, very dry in style. Drink from 2017.",84,Château Haut Coteau 2011  Saint-Estèphe
"This delivers the soft, velvety texture you want in a nice Merlot, along with ripe black-cherry, anise, cola and sandalwood flavors that finish dry and spicy.",88,Firestone 2008 Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Tannic, thick and mired in tar and oak, this estate wine has a lack of fruit that puts it off balance.",83,Noble Tree 2013 Wickersham Ranch Estate Merlot (Sonoma County)
"A slightly different flavor spectrum makes this pale-colored, lean and crisp sparkling wine stand out. With notes of honeydew melon and cucumber, and great balance from juicy acidity, it tastes slightly sweet and as refreshing as those fruit descriptors would suggest.",89,Bodkin NV Extra Dry Cuvee Januariis Blanc de Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County)
"This ripe, rich, almost decadently thick wine is about as close as a Washington vintner can come to the decadently ripe style of the cultish Bordeaux blends of California. Along with the unctuous New World fruit, sap and flesh, there are thick, ripe tannins and a vivid acid underpinning. It drinks well right out of the bottle, the flavors beautifully wrapped together, mixing black fruits, black olives, herb and earth, smoke and coffee and toast.",91,Nicholas Cole Cellars 2004 Reserve Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
Hints of wet earth marry lemony flavors with ripe and generous overtones of peach. The lemony center lends structure to the entire wine and makes for a bracing but ripe and earthy mouthful.,89,Hirsch 2013 Gaisberg Reserve Riesling (Kamptal)
"Dark, dry and puckering with a stewed plum aroma and flavor, this wine offers a depth of tannin and herbal notes. A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Cabernet Franc and 8% Merlot, it spent 20 months in French oak.",84,Ehret 2010 Bellarina Meritage (Knights Valley)
"Rich and exotic, this Zin offers a blast of ripe wild blackberry, briary currants, mulberry, mocha, pepper and spice flavors that are wrapped into sturdy tannins. It's a strongly flavored wine that needs powerful fare to match it.",87,XYZin 2006 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"Sun-baked pineapple and mango aromas abound on this ripe, tropical Riesling. The palate is juicy and a touch sweet with yellow peach and quince flavors. Despite it's dainty, sprightly body, it's slick and silken in texture with a lingering honey finish.",89,Keuka Spring 2013 Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Sourced largely from the Martin Stelling Vineyard behind the winery in the western shade of Oakville, this wine opens with charred oak and a smoky, meaty character that intrigues. Seamless on the palate in soft, perceptible tannin, it delves into characteristics of cedar and brushy sage as it goes, unveiling a wildness that's hard to contain. Its bright, fresh finish gives it a roundness that's ready to enjoy now.",95,Far Niente 2013 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"The peachy color of this bubbly wine is appropriate because the aromas and flavors are effusively peachy, too. It is light bodied, very sweet and has been flavored with something other than grapes.",83,Weibel Family NV Peach Mango Demi-Sec Sparkling (California)
"Winemaker: Bernhard Veller. This is a surprisingly concentrated and wood-dominated Sauvignon Blanc, with initial aromas of yellow melon, grilled peach, cedar plank, orange cream and baking spice. It's full and round on the palate, with a smooth, somewhat flabby texture and forward oak flavors that overwhelm the fruit character.",89,Nitida 2015 Cape Winemakers Guild Swan Song Sauvignon Blanc (Durbanville)
"Smells green and weedy at first, and then oak aromas rise up to cover the green overriding character. Clacky in the mouth, with green-leaning berry flavors and oak. Finishes herbal, with a lasting flavor of pole bean.",82,Concha y Toro 2010 Casillero del Diablo Reserve Merlot (Rapel Valley)
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese, this offers aromas of dark-skinned fruit, exotic spice, French oak and a whiff of underbrush. Smooth and firmly structured, the elegant palate delivers cassis, black cherry and star anise alongside polished, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2018–2028.",91,Castello d'Albola 2013 Acciaiolo Red (Toscana)
"Underbrush, toast, truffle, mocha, oak and berry aromas take center stage. The firm palate offers black cherry, coconut, espresso, powered sage and oak extract alongside tightly packed, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2017–2025.",89,Cascina Morassino 2012 Ovello  (Barbaresco)
"Bread crust, citrus, chopped herb and orchard fruit aromas lift out of the glass. The vibrant palate offers lime, nectarine and toasted hazelnut alongside vibrant acidity. An elegant mousse carries through to the crisp, bone-dry finish.",91,Fattori 2010 Roncà Pas Dosé Metodo Classico  (Lessini Durello)
"Rich in the mouth, this creamy and textural wine mixes fruit flavors of peach, apple and pear in equal proportion. It's a bit heavier than the previous vintage, with less of the floral character, but it offers, instead, a richness that lingers into a satisfying finish.",88,The Four Graces 2007 Pinot Gris (Dundee Hills)
"Take a walk on the wild side with this Rhône-style red. The meaty, spicy, earthy aromas lead to enjoyable fruit, spice and mocha flavors that rest on a firm bed of fine tannins and good acidity.",87,Terre Rouge 2012 Tête-à-Tête Red (Sierra Foothills)
"Elements of this thick, ripe, almost late-harvest SB succeed. The palate is creamy and layered, and it works that angle to its advantage. By the same token, it's flat and won't last for much longer, and the finish is pithy and borderline cloying. Drink right away.",85,Simone 2008 Special Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Maule Valley)
"This single vineyard wine is full bodied but crisp, with savory notes of roasted meat and campfire more in evidence than bold fruit. It finishes long and a bit tart.",89,D'Arenberg 2011 The Vociferate Dipsomaniac Singe Vineyard Shiraz (McLaren Vale)
"Notes of orchard apple, peach skin, yellow melon, orange blossom and a touch of beeswax unfold on the bouquet of this nuanced rosé. It's medium in weight, with a softness on the midpalate that's lifted on the close by ample acidity.",88,Château d'Anglès 2016 Classique Mourvèdre-Syrah-Grenache Rosé (La Clape)
"A good, strong, rustic wine, with firm tannins and low acidity. The flavors are rich and complex, ranging from fresh summer blackberries to dried fruits, cocoa, licorice and briary spices. Nice as a smoother alternative to Zinfandel.",87,Obscurity 2008 Murill Vineyard-1916 Vines Carignane (Amador County)
"This is a sound, rustic red wine. It's comprised of undisclosed varieties, but tastes basically like a Rhône blend, with simple cherry, cola, herb and oak flavors.",84,Courtney Benham 2009 Lucca Red (Paso Robles)
"An interesting aromatic ensemble of exotic fruit, white mineral, natural rubber, almond skin and perfumed flowers set the tone. In the mouth, this unique wine made from the little-known Pecorino grape offers ripe yellow fruit flavors, and a waxy, creamy texture.",86,Il Conte 2006 Villa Prandone Pecorino (Marche)
A bitter green element to this otherwise medium-sized wine detracts from any of its fruit.,82,Taft Street 2013 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Aromatic notes of orange zest, combine with an intriguing hint of caramel on the nose and palate of this wine. It's fresh, balanced and juicy, walking a tightrope between lusciousness and brisk refreshment. The body is fruity but dry.",90,Domaine Charles Frey 2015 Vieilles Vignes Riesling (Alsace)
"Earthy notes of forest floor and white field mushroom precede the fruitier notions of ripe fresh and dried pear on nose and palate. This wine has a balm-like quality to the texture and a depth of developed flavor. The dried apple finish is dry, lasting and clean.",91,Wunsch & Mann 2013 Cuvée Reine Clothilde Reserve Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Stunning and sophisticated, it leads with intense aromas of elder flowers, tropical fruit, spice and hay. The structured but elegant palate delivers creamy peach, melon, and exotic fruit accented with notes of spice and energizing mineral purity alongside vibrant acidity. Throughout, it shows impeccable balance and depth.",94,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano 2012 Sanct Valentin Sauvignon (Alto Adige)
"Full of red fruits, it also has a strong structure and firm tannins. For now, the wine is textured and dense. It needs to age and broaden out to give a softer feeling. Drink from 2018.",88,Domaine du Prieuré 2011 Moutier Amet  (Savigny-lès-Beaune)
"There a lot of complexity on the palate of this dryish brut, with flavors of limes, raspberries, yeast, toast and vanilla. It's a tad scoury in the mouth, with a sandpapery roughness. Not an ager, so drink up.",87,Chandon 2007 Vintage Brut Sparkling (Mount Veeder)
"This popular brand's white version is soft and smooth. There are some citrus flavors to give the wine a crisp edge, although the main thrust of the wine is more towards apricot and perfumed green plums. Drink now.",85,J. Portugal Ramos 2016 Marquês de Borba Branco White (Alentejo)
"Nicely balanced and smooth, this starts with red cherry and raspberry aromas with hints of spice. It continues to fresh, tangy fruit flavors with a lively, bright texture. A nice touch of tannin firms up the finish.",89,Witching Stick 2012 Dowser's Cuvee Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"A very Grenache-like wine, with red berries, rhubarb, meat and spices on the nose. Earth and anise notes in the mouth add interest, and there is a fine fruit-acid balance here. Sweet berries, a strong mineral component and fine tannic structure shine on the solid finish. Tight now, it will show better in two or three years.",88,Domaine Gramenon 1998 Les Laurentides Red (Côtes du Rhône)
"An attractive, fruity wine, very pure in character, with some minerality along with dry tannins. The wine does keep a little sweetness, but remains on the dry side.",89,Croft 2008 Quinta da Roêda Vintage  (Port)
"This is a dry, elegant young Pinot Noir. It's rich in acidity, and the cherry and cola flavors are sprinkled with zesty white pepper. Seems to be giving its best now.",87,MacRostie 2008 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Cherry and pepper are the hallmarks of Zweigelt. Here, they are very aromatic: While muted on the nose, the palate is fresh, lively and very authentic. Merlot adds riper fruit while Blaufränkisch contributes more pepper and structure. This is a very harmonious blend. Lovely now but with the mileage to last a number of years in the cellar. Aromatic cherry fruit echoes on the palate. Drink now until 2020.",91,Netzl 2013 Cuvée Red (Carnuntum)
"Sharp, chewy and aggressively tannic, this simply refuses to emerge from its tannic shell. The stiffly herbal flavors dominate, while any ripe fruit seems to be in hiding at the moment, despite lengthy aeration.",87,DanCin 2014 Trata Pinot Noir (Southern Oregon)
"Fresh and fragrant, this is a lively, bright and tangy wine. With crisp acidity and raspberry fruit that is twisted with orange peel it is ready to drink.",85,Château de Blaignac 2015 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
"This inky-colored zesty wine offers aromas of sour cherry, leather and a hint of dried herb. The extremely simple, easygoing palate shows red plum and a hint of clove alongside loose knit tannins.",85,Gru 2015  Montepulciano d'Abruzzo
"A tight, brambly field-like blend of Carignane, Petite Sirah, Zinfandel and Alicante Bouschet, this black, dense and mouth-coating wine offers savory leather and spice. Black cherry and plum form the core of its fruit, with vanilla and oak intensifying on the finish, the overall wine getting juicier as it opens.",89,Ravenswood 2012 Icon Native Sonoma Mixed Blocks Red (Sonoma County)
"From one of the emblematic estates of Cahors, this entry-level wine is all fruit. It shows the tannic character of Malbec, contrasted with juicy black currant flavors and attractive acidity. The wine can be drunk now.",87,Domaine de Cause 2012 Tradition Malbec (Cahors)
"This has subtle aromas suggesting beeswax, green pear and a whiff of nut. The lean, racy palate offers lemon zest, crisp Granny Smith apple and bitter almond alongside brisk acidity.",86,Castellari Bergaglio 2014 Rolona del Comune di Gavi  (Gavi)
"This blend of 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 17% Syrah, 8% Petit Verdot and 3% Cabernet Franc offers plummy chocolate and leather notes and dense, layered tannins. Toasty oak adds to the concentration and body, before a lift of acidity closes out the finish. This wine is available in three Halloween-themed labels all created for Flora Springs by CD-cover artist Wes Freed.",91,Flora Springs 2013 Ghost Winery Red (Napa Valley)
"Aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, fig, resin, leather and exotic spice lead the nose on this just-released ten-year-old. The full-bodied palate offers dried cherry, raisin, licorice, ground pepper and truffle while polished tannins provide support. It has already hit the start of its ideal drinking window so enjoy sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit.",89,Gianni Gagliardo 2005 Serre 10 Anni  (Barolo)
"This leads with toast, oak, nut and balsam aromas. Those oak-driven notes follow through to the palate, which shows coconut and exotic spice notes but lacks fruit richness. Astringent, grainy tannins close the finish.",85,Pelissero 2014 Vanotu  (Barbaresco)
"This wine opens in a reduced way, with plenty of barrel influence apparent. It develops in the glass into a mix of chalky tannin and red and blue fruit, with accents of black licorice and white chocolate. Aged in new French, American and European oak, it has a tannic finish that should benefit with time. Drink now through 2021.",90,Trentadue 2013 La Storia Estate Bottled Petite Sirah (Alexander Valley)
"87-89 Barrel sample. Initially closed, the wine is tight, mineral, with tannins that are hard and dense. The fruit is perhaps too light for all this weight of structure.",88,Château Monbrison 2008 Barrel sample  (Margaux)
"Beautifully floral, this wine sings with red cherry and cassis notes and bright acidity. Beneath its façade of freshness and perfume lies a weighty foundation of toasted oak, forest floor, clove and dark chocolate flavors. Balanced and full-bodied, it shows the dustiness of the appellation in a measured, elegant way.",94,Elyse 2013 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"Tastes like it has residual sugar. Either that, or the enormously high alcohol is giving it a glyceriney taste. Maybe both. Whatever the cause, this Syrah is uncomfortably sweet through the finish, giving the blackberry and cherry flavors a candied quality. Ready now.",84,Calcareous 2007 Syrah (Paso Robles)
"Friendly, ripe pears and stone fruits seem to smile from the glass with this wine. Zingy citrus freshness provides zip on the dry palate that has a fruitful, rounded body and a perfume akin to pine and spruce. It's an appetizing, refreshing composition!",90,Domaine Charles Frey 2015 Granit Riesling (Alsace)
"This wine has structure and some dense tannins. Even though there is plenty of black and red cherry fruit, the wine's dry core and tight, mineral texture are still developing. Drink from 2017.",90,Georges Duboeuf 2014 Domaine du Moulin-à-Vent  (Moulin-à-Vent)
"A young, powerful wine, dominated by bitter chocolate, cocoa and dense ripe black fruits. The wood element lifts this mix of flavors and gives a great sense of structure. Dark figs and herbs add complexity, while the tannins are powerful.",92,J.M. da Fonseca and Van Zeller 2004 Domini Plus Red (Douro)
"Red berry and plum aromas form the base of this wine's fresh, uncomplicated bouquet. It feels juicy and bright, with good layering and aggressive flavors of berry and plum. The finish is dry and snappy, with mild oak and spice flavors.",88,Rafael Cambra 2009 Soplo Garnacha (Valencia)
"A soft, fruity wine, it comes straight from tank without any wood aging. It's a fine barbecue wine with its black currant fruitiness and light, dry tannins. Drink 2014.",84,Wines & Winemakers 2012 Dona Helena Colheita Castelão (Península de Setúbal)
"Pear blossom, baked lemons, packed lemon flowers, apple juice, walnut and a touch of quinine pop on the nose of this wine from a challenging grape. The palate is rich but zesty with walnut oil, chamomile, lime, apple and pear notes, offering lots of textural intrigue.",86,Epiphany 2014 Camp Four Vineyard Roussanne (Santa Barbara County)
"A blend of 86% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Merlot, 3% Cabernet Franc and 2% Malbec, this wine is more about elegance and detail than outright power, though it brings plenty of that as well. The blackberry, dark coffee and herb flavors are alternately light but rich, showing plenty of nuance and precision as well as great length.",93,Januik 2012 Reserve Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Smooth, ultra-rich, ripe wine, packed with dense but sweet tannins, warm southern herbs and black plum flavors. There are layers of toasty wood here, blending well with the fruit tannins. The effect is big, powerful, but there is acidity as well, just edging the concentration.",90,Mas Belles Eaux 2005 Cuvée Sainte Hélene Red (Languedoc)
"Here is a beautiful and charming Rosso di Montalcino (the wine sometimes referred to as a “Baby Brunello”) with spice notes, toast and black mineral wrapped carefully around a core of cherry fruit. The wine shows good crispness, polished tannins and would pair with pasta and meat sauce.",89,La Mannella 2008  Rosso di Montalcino
"This Shiraz-based blend—with splashes of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Viognier—is lush and rich, with notes of ripe blackberry, cherry and strawberry preserves backed by hints of fruit-cake spice and black pepper. The plush mouthfeel boasts similarly concentrated dark-fruit flavors, and the finish boasts a decadent fudgy chocolate note that shows good staying power. Drink now–2016.",91,Saronsberg 2008 Full Circle Red (Tulbagh)
"The winery's basic Cab, with no vineyard designation, shares the qualities of the more expensive bottlings. It's dry and tannic and ultraconcentrated in varietal character, with explosive cassis, cherry and new oak flavors. Impresses now for its luxurious mouthfeel, and should develop through 2013.",91,Von Strasser 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)
"Aromas of underbrush, scorched earth, toasted hazelnut, dark spice, menthol and new leather emerge in the glass. The firm palate delivers dried black cherry, raisin, coffee and chewing tobacco while fine-grained tannins provide the framework. It finishes on a slightly bitter note.",89,Tedeschi 2012  Amarone della Valpolicella
"Thick and tannic, this wine, among all the single-varietal offerings from Griffin Creek, shows a bit more ripeness to the black, muscular fruits. It's dense in the mouth, with cassis, cocoa and coffee, bolstered with sharp, piercing acidity.",87,Griffin Creek 2012 Cabernet Franc (Rogue Valley)
"This smooth and easy-drinking wine blends 60% Pinot Gris with equal amounts of Chardonnay and Riesling. It's light blush in color, with hints of honey on both the nose and palate. A good, all-purpose white, it should be consumed over the next year or two.",87,A Blooming Hill Vineyard 2016 Mingle White (Chehalem Mountains)
"The 54-acre Landat vineyard, dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, has produced a powerful, wood-aged wine. The wood shows in the firm and dense tannic structure and gives the wine a dry perspective. Black currant and acidity provided a more juicy aspect to this concentrated wine.",88,Château Landat 2012  Haut-Médoc
"As usual for Casa Silva, this Carmenère is foreceful, minty, herbal and spunky on the nose, with a bold fruit aroma. The mouthfeel is robust and juicy, and the flavors run from herbal plum to berry to carob. The finish is herbal, with length and texture.",88,Casa Silva 2009 Los Lingues Gran Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"This opens with earthy aromas that recall leafy underbrush, leather, stewed prune, toasted hazelnut and dark baking spice aromas. The firm, tightly wound palate shows dried black cherry, clove and bracing tannins that leave a somewhat raspy finish. Give the tannins a few more years to unwind then drink.",88,Piero Busso 2012 Albesani  (Barbaresco)
"Topped with 18% Malbec, aromas of wood spice, vanilla, pencil lead and dark cherry lead to juicy full-bodied dark-fruit flavors that show a lovely sense of balance, despite the wood being forward. It's a very pretty expression of Cabernet.",90,Ambassador Vineyard 2014 Estate Grown Sunset VIneyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"On the nose, this suggests thyme, toasted nut and ripe orchard fruit. The firm palate offers mature citrus zest and ripe pear flavors while a bitter almond note marks the finish.",87,CàMaiol 2015  Lugana
"Pineapple and other tropical fruits comprise the simple, straightforward nose. Pear and tangerine flavors come across sharp, as does the finish. The wine is a bit edgy and lean on its own.",83,La Palma 2002 Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Cachapoal Valley)
"A great find, this is fully ripe but not too full bodied, offering opulent dark plum and black currant aromas, broad and rich flavors, and a plush, velvety texture. Subtle cedar and spice tones from oak barrels add complexity to the dark fruit notes, and soft tannins fill in the texture and help the finish linger.",92,Sol Rouge 2010 Cabernet Franc (Red Hills Lake County)
"Bright and fruity, with pretty cherry and raspberry notes. There's also a certain leafy complexity, with hints of smoke and coffee on the finish. Good wine. Good price.",89,Murphy-Goode 1999 Merlot (Alexander Valley)
"Components of salty toffee and honey provide a luxurious texture to this otherwise floral, nicely balanced wine, a subtle cradling of oak never in the way of its tense minerality. Green apple and Meyer lemon make appearances along the way.",93,Anaba 2013 Denmark Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
A smooth and rounded wine that is full of ripe fruits. It has a hint of steely texture and minerality but the white fruit is the immediately attractive aspect of the wine. Drink this wine now.,89,Saget la Perrière 2015 Domaine de Terres Blanches  (Sancerre)
"Fiesta is the lightest, most fruit forward of the four different Tempranillos from Abacela. In a great year such as this, it's also substantial and authoritative, with deeply driven flavors of red and blueberry fruit, a whiff of oak and slightly grainy tannins. This wine clearly over-delivers for the price.",91,Abacela 2014 Fiesta Tempranillo (Umpqua Valley)
"Muted, broad orchard fruit and lemon flavors are etched with acids that become more lifted on the finish. An easy-drinking wine to pair with mild white fish, like tilapia.",84,Naked Mountain 2011 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Virginia)
"This structured, full and ripe wine shows great cherry fruits, some chewy tannins and a delicious juicy character. It is balanced and with its tannins should age. Drink now and until 2017.",89,Fabien Collonge 2012 L'Aurore des Côtes  (Chiroubles)
"Made entirely with native grape Trebbiano Spoletino, this conveys aromas of chamomile, candied fruit and a hint of acacia. The round palate offers dried fruit and a honey accent alongside soft acidity.",87,Perticaia 2013 Trebbiano Spoletino (Umbria)
"This is a terrific wine to pair with pizza or a heaping plate of spaghetti and meat sauce. Informal, bright and fruity, this Montepulciano d'Abruzzo delivers clean blackberry aromas and an easy but sufficiently extracted finish.",86,Farnese 2009  Montepulciano d'Abruzzo
"While the nose seems a bit savory, with muted apple and honeycomb notes, this dry, full-bodied Riesling is quite fruity on the palate, with pleasant peach and nectarine flavors. It's brisk, with lemon-lime acidity and just a hint of astringency on the finish.",86,Heinrich Vollmer 2012 Medium Dry Riesling (Pfalz)
"This charred specimen smells resiny and of blackened oak, with grapy berry scents thrown in. In the mouth, this is rock solid and balanced. Heavily oaked resiny flavors rest on top of core blackberry fruit, while this shows woody dry tannins and salty baked berry flavors on the finish.",91,Alma de los Andes 2013 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza)
"Aromas of toasted oak, vanilla and yellow apple skin emerge from the glass. The palate is linear and elegant, revealing subtle flavors of vanilla, citrus zest, mineral and walnut. Notes of butterscotch and mineral close the finish.",89,Borgo del Tiglio 2013 Selezione Chardonnay (Collio)
"Spice, tobacco and berry fruit work the nose on this firm, medium-bodied Ribera wine. A mouthfeel that's fresh and snappy might be seen as short and choppy by anyone seeking more extract and body, but overall the wine pushes forward with purpose and intent. Firmness is its calling card, so look for a tightness of being and no excess fat, oak or heft. A good wine for food.",87,Portia 2006  Ribera del Duero
"From a vineyard 1,700 feet above the small town of Corralitos comes this tasty wine that begins with aromas of smoked apple, lemon zest, honeysuckle and sea salt, as well as a struck-match element. The palate shows flavors of fresh apple, chamomile and a dusting of crushed vanilla, all set against a chalky grip.",92,Sante Arcangeli 2013 Split Rail Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Yellow in color, with heavy dusty flat aromas of apple and citrus, this feels low on acidity and thus flat. Cidery apple and lime flavors finish chunky and leesy with an oily texture.",85,Galizeus 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"This is an attractive, ripe red-fruited wine that is showing its best already. Soft tannins, juicy red berries and a light shot of acidity all come together easily and freshly. Drink now. Screwcap.",87,Höpler 2012 Zweigelt (Burgenland)
"Made with a blend of Mediterranean and Caucasian grape varieties, Jassarte shows a green note of medicinal herb with forest berry and bramble. The wine is tight, bright and nicely acidic on the close.",88,Podere Guado al Melo 2007 Jassarte Red (Toscana)
"There's an assertive green character to this wine, presented in notes of green bean, pepper, tomato leaf and lime peel on the nose and palate. The mouthfeel is broad and slightly flat, with a jalapeño accent on the finish.",82,Eikendal 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Stellenbosch)
"Young and fruity and with a light prickle on the tongue, this is an immediately drinkable wine. Freshly sliced apple and lemon aromas open to a crisp texture and a dry, bright aftertaste. Screwcap.",85,Forstreiter 2012 Grooner Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"With grapes from long contracted growers, this wine represents the structure as well as the ripe fruit of the appellation. It imparts a smoky character from wood aging as well as a tense layer of tannins that give it a dry edge. Drink from 2021.",91,Louis Jadot 2014  Nuits-St.-Georges
"This luminous Greco di Tufo offers beautiful tones of stone fruit, pear, Golden Delicious apple, herb and white stone. The wine is fresh and fragrant with a polished feel and a crisp close.",87,I Capitani 2007 Serum  (Greco di Tufo)
"This wine is ripe, with attractive red cherry fruit flavors. It bursts with fruitiness, fresh acidity and just the lightest structure.",85,Henry Fessy 2014 Nouveau  (Beaujolais)
"While a tad more slender in frame than many of 2015's single-vineyard Kabinetts, this delicate Riesling offers a zesty punch of sweet-tart tangerine and quince flavors. It's irresistibly thirst quenching, finishing on a salty tang of mineral and lime.",90,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler 2015 Bernkasteler Badstube  Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"This is a well-built and elegant Cabernet Sauvignon (with 5% Sangiovese) with thick layers of cherry, forest bramble, caramel, molasses and smoky tobacco-like tones that are deep and penetrating. It scores high in terms of intensity, complexity and ends with fresh, menthol nuances on the finish.",93,Castello dei Rampolla 2004 Sammarco Cabernet Sauvignon (Toscana)
"You won't find many $7 wines better than this Garnacha. The bouquet of fresh berries is like a bowl of black fruit. The palate is lively and a touch creamy, with medicinal, candied flavors of plum and cherry. This wine, like most Borsao reds, delivers above its price point.",87,Borsao 2011 Viña Borgia Garnacha (Campo de Borja)
"A stylish wine, with mineral tannins and a dusty texture. It is cool, elegant and with a tight layer of acidity. There's plenty of firm structure, with berries and sweet fruit to finish. Age for 2–3 years.",88,Falua 2009 Red (Tejo)
"This 100% Sangiovese opens with aromas of dried black-skinned fruit, menthol, pressed flowers, allspice and leather. The palate offers dried black cherry, licorice, espresso and tobacco alongside tightly knit but refined tannins. Drink now.",89,Tenuta di Capraia 2011 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"A slightly earthy note colors the apple and lemon aromas on the nose. The palate shows lots of freshness and has a tart, light and dry body. The finish is lemony and fresh. Drink while aromas are expressive.",87,Joseph Cattin 2016 Riesling (Alsace)
"Good flavor concentration and a sense of power help this stand out. A dark red color goes almost to the rim, with aromas that suggest blackberries and raisins. Flavors go deep into sweet oak and dark fruit. The tannins support the wine's overall richness, adding a little grip to the texture.",89,Ehrenberg 2010 Zinfandel (Lodi)
"Mulchy on the nose, with compost, leather and purple fruit notes. There's decent body to the wine but the flavors are stalky and green, with burnt, stemmy leftovers on the finish. A blend of 60% Malbec and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon.",84,Nemesio 2007 Proprietor's Reserve Blend Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon (Patagonia)
"Dried purple flowers and dark cardamom spices are layered across aromas of blackberry, roast beef, soy, jerky and peppercorn on the nose of this blend of 52% Syrah, 40% Mourvèdre and 8% Grenache. A solid, nearly chewy structure unveils dark flavors of beef char, pencil lead, blueberries and a touch of asphalt.",90,Adelaida Cellars 2013 Version Red Anna's Vineyard Reserve Red (Adelaida District)
"Smooth and ripe, this Bordeaux blend pleases for its rich array of blackberry, cherry and spicy plum flavors. The texture is soft and chocolaty. Loses a point or two for the sugary finish, though. Drink now.",85,Peachy Canyon 2004 Para Siempre Red (Paso Robles)
"Steve Shaw devoted his entire harvest of Gewürztraminer in 2013 to the production of this wonderfully strange yet beautiful orange-style wine. Dusty florals on the nose mutate into flavors of dried apricot and fig in this deeply textural, rippling wine. The finish is fringed with tea tannins and bristling lemon acidity. Unfiltered and unfined, it maintains a murky streak of sediment that may be visually unappealing, but for those with open minds, this is quite a fun wine.",90,Shaw 2013 Vin Rustique Gewurztraminer (Finger Lakes)
"Mint and jammy plum and raspberry aromas are a touch spicy. This is astringent in feel, with dry, oaky red-berry and tomato flavors. An angular, tart finish fades quickly.",83,Palacio del Burgo 2014 Tinto  (Rioja)
"Enticing notes of ripe yellow apples make for an utterly appetizing opening. The flavors swirl even more exuberantly on the palate, assisted by soft dosage which boosts the fruitiness. This is counteracted by crisp freshness and a soft mousse. The palate finishes dry with lovely notes of apple and honey.",90,Domaine Sipp-Mack 2012 Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"This is an easy, no-fuss expression of Falanghina that opens with direct aromas of citrus and stone fruit and follows through to the palate with a tonic, refreshing feel. It would work with fried vegetable appetizers or light lunches.",84,La Casa Dell'Orco 2009 Falanghina (Beneventano)
"This gets the Cabernet basics done, with ripe, jammy blackberry and cherry flavors, full-bodied tannins and a dry, spicy finish. It's a good everyday Cab, and the bag-in-box packaging means you don't have to rush to finish it.",84,Bota Box 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Wild flower, dried jasmine, wild berry, hazelnut and ginger open the beautifully fragrant bouquet. The mouthfeel is tight, elegant and silky with polished tannins and fresh menthol overtones. Give this wine 10 more years.",92,Poderi Luigi Einaudi 2008 Costa Grimaldi  (Barolo)
"The wine has plenty of ripe fruit, raspberry flavors and light spice. With a crisp streak of acidity, it is beginning to show a good balance. Drink from 2017.",85,Château Queyssard 2014  Bordeaux Supérieur
"Golden caramelized oak supports a fleshy, full-bodied sensation of pear and fig in this bold, rich wine. Resolved on the palate and possessed of moderate acidity, it finishes in a plume of nutmeg.",90,Gibbs 2014 Bacigalupi Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"The winery aims for Loire valley characteristics in its wines, hence the reference to Côt, as Malbec is known in the region. This is grapy, purple and young. At this point it's difficult to see much else beyond the fruit and lip-sticking acids. It's a good warm-weather quaffing wine, best served slightly chilled.",87,Leah Jørgensen Cellars 2014 Crater Lake Vineyard Loiregon Côt Malbec (Rogue Valley)
"This silky-textured, medium-bodied wine starts off with aromas of toasted marshmallow and ripe citrus. The flavors show more range, covering hints of melon, white peach, lime, pineapple and roasted cashew, before finishing long and crisp.",91,Sidewood 2015 Mappinga Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)
"There's a lightness to this 90% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Petit Verdot that surprises, making for a friendly, approachable entry. Cassis, raspberry and cedar mix around rounded tannins and a medium-length finish.",87,Pine Ridge 2012 Estate Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
Fresh red fruits are smoothed out with caramel and spice flavors that give a ripe feel to this wine. It's light and ready to drink.,85,Le Roi des Pierres 2014 Rosé (Sancerre)
"In a classic combination of ripe flavors and lip-smacking structure, this full-bodied wine wraps concentrated black cherry and mint aromas and generous cherry and blackberry flavors in muscular tannins that keep the texture fresh.",90,Easton 2013 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Shenandoah Valley (CA))
"Perfumed and a touch exotic for Rioja, with coconut and floral berry aromas. Definitely full and ripe in the mouth, with sweet flavors that go back and forth between baked and sugary and rich and rewarding. A sweet, mature wine at its core, with molasses and brown sugar.",90,Marqués de Murrieta 2006 Finca Ygay Reserva  (Rioja)
"This big but harmonious wine made from white Rhône grape varieties pulls off the fully oaked style very well, starting with its buttered baguette aroma and continuing on the palate with baked apple and ripe pear flavors and smooth, creamy texture. It has a wonderful, lingering finish too.",92,Cobden Wini 2015 Clondaire Vineyards White (Calaveras County)
"This wine is high-toned with flamboyant aromas of pomegranate, cherry and grape. Cherry is front and center on the palate, with subdued notes of resinous oak and baking spice coming through. Mocha-tinged tannins lead on the finish.",85,Stinson 2013 Tannat (Monticello)
"Tones of lemon, yellow apple and cereal with milk carry on the nose and palate. Not overly complex, it's a nice easy-drinking wine. Thin in body, with a short but pleasant finish.",85,Veramar 2016 JB Winemaker Series Chardonnay (Virginia)
"In this wine, a red-black color and ripe, spicy aromas first grab the attention. Then cherry and black plum flavors spill out of the firm and dramatically tannic texture.",85,Butternut 2013 Pinot Noir (California)
"Rusty in color, with rubbery, chemical aromas. Feels tight, tannic and clampy, with hard, compromised flavors and bitterness to the finish. Astringent and just not that appealing.",82,Benegas 2008 Libertad Vineyards Sangiovese (Mendoza)
"Boasts slightly oily rose and lychee scents that leave no doubt as to what grape variety you are smelling. This is a big-boned wine with a healthy alcohol level, but one wishes for more persistence on the finish.",83,Bedell 1998 Gewürztraminer (North Fork of Long Island)
"Mouthwatering acidity combines with a sweet aftertaste to give a wine that could be unbalanced but, surprisingly, has an attractive soft texture and easygoing fruitiness. Drink immediately.",83,Le Pépin 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de France)
"MorAle offers tight and simple fruit tones with raspberry, blueberry and red rose petal. The mouthfeel is simple and clean with balanced freshness on the close.",86,Poderi Morini 2011 MorAle  (Sangiovese di Romagna Superiore)
"Oaky on the nose, with a whiff of caramelized honey, this ripe, robust wine finds its balance through a veneer of fruity tarte Tatin and rocky minerality. Still unwinding in the bottle, it needs time to open. It'll drink nicely now through 2022.",93,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2012 Ritchie Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This is a soft and juicy wine, with ripe red fruit notes and a gentle, tannic structure. It is open and generous, showing plenty of acidity to sustain its freshness.",86,Monte da Penha 2009 Montefino Red (Alentejano)
"Rich berry and graham-cracker aromas announce a ripe, easygoing Monastrell-Syrah blend. Chewy and slightly sinewy in feel, this offers heaps of tasty but creamy oak and vanilla to go with spicy, herbal berry fruit. A creamy, thick finish is fitting for a warm-climate wine like this.",90,Ego Bodegas 2014 Marionette Red (Jumilla)
"This is a faultless Albariño that checks out up front, on the palate and late in the game. Tropical aromas are melony, fresh and minerally. The mouth is peachy and smooth in texture, with kicking acidity. Pithy citrus and nectarine flavors are textbook, and the citrusy finish is long and true.",90,Nora 2012 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"This offers a firm, dense structure, with dark tannins and big, ripe, opulent fruits. At the same time the elegance that is the hallmark of the domaine is equally present with stylish red fruits and a velvet texture. The wine needs to age to be at its peak, although it is beautiful now. Drink from 2020.",96,Domaine Jean Grivot 2013  Clos de Vougeot
"The first release for Tranche from Blue Mountain (estate) fruit, this classic Cabernet benefits from the same extended aging in barrel and bottle that sister winery Corliss gives its wines. Toasty, smoky and precisely defined dark fruit hold down the core, a muscular mix of black cherry, cassis, dried herb and leaf. Firm and compact, with well-integrated barrel flavors (two thirds were new), this balances Euro elegance with New World vitality.",92,Tranche 2007 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Subdued aromas of underbrush, pressed violet, ripe berry and cake spice slowly emerge in the glass. Made entirely with Sangiovese, the palate offers dried black cherry, blackberry, ground pepper, licorice, tobacco and sage alongside assertive, grippy tannins. A note of grilled sage signals the close. It's still tightly wound and needs time to come together. Drink 2017–2022.",91,Il Macchione 2010  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano
"This structured red features aromas of tilled soil and ripe berry. The palate delivers violet, mature black cherry, crushed berry and ground white pepper alongside smooth, polished tannins. It's ripe and ready, so enjoy soon.",89,Fattoria Le Pupille 2011 Riserva  (Morellino di Scansano)
"Smoky oak surrounds robust black fruit, peppercorn and a soft, supple core of easygoing texture and rounded richness. The fruit is sourced primary from the relatively cool Oak Knoll District.",86,Levendi 2014 Sweetwater Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Capellanes waded through some weak efforts in 2002 and 2003, but this vintage marks undisputed excellence for a reserva. The wine has alluring smoky, sultry notes to match its bold fruit, while the flavors of blackberry, dark spice and chocolate announce perfect raw material and a deft winemaking hand, i.e. controlled oak. Delicious now through 2014.",93,Pago de los Capellanes 2004 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)
"With a dominance of Clairette in the blend, this wine has a rich, lightly salty character as well as juicy green-plum flavors. It comes from organically grown grapes in one of the small parcels that make up the vineyard. Ripe and fruity with just a tang in the air, it is ready to drink.",91,Domaine de la Bégude 2015 White (Bandol)
"A wine without great varietal character, although with an attractive, light feel to it. The acidity gives a final mineral edge.",84,Domaine Specht 2009 Riesling (Alsace)
"Intense with botrytis and concentrated dried apricot and fig flavors, this is a finely balanced wine. It's ripe and opulent, certainly, but it also has the potential to age very well. Drink from 2024.",96,Château Doisy-Daëne 2014  Barsac
"Chunky obtuse aromas of berry fruits are a bit damp and volatile. This is heavy and severely tannic, while blackened berry and prune flavors come across a bit stewed. A drawing tannic finish brings this to a close.",87,Alidis 2014 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"This dry rosé is perfumed with red-currant fruits. On the palate, the theme of crisp red fruits continues, with acidity, a touch of pepper and smokiness from the Cabernet Franc in the blend. Drink the wine, with its tight acidity at the end, now.",85,Bougrier 2016 Pure Loire  (Rosé de Loire)
"Strawberry, red plum and a strong hint of tomato leaf work the nose, followed by tangy raspberry flavors and a wash of acidity. Seems sort of scratchy and edgy, with a hard, dry peppery quality.",83,Campo Viejo 2003 Reserva  (Rioja)
"This wine is gorgeous from the moment the cork is pulled. Sweet fruit—berries, currants and jam—is perfectly matched to more subtle scents of sassafras and tobacco. Nicely woven together, this youthful wine coasts along on a magic carpet of seamless flavors, gently sliding into a lightly toasty finish with a lick of bacon fat. Though fairly soft, it seems like a good candidate to improve for 5 or 6 years.",91,Le Cadeau 2006 Rocheux Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This delicious rosé is a combination of sweet strawberry and a touch of lemon crispness on the nose and the palate. Its light, elegant character is supported by a dancing acidity and a balance of ripe berry flavors and minerality. A great food pairing choice or stellar solo sip.",90,Simonsig 2007 Kaapse Vonkel Brut Rosé Sparkling (Stellenbosch)
"Juicy in dusty berry cobbler flavor, layered with a touch of spicy dark chocolate, this is a medium-bodied, approachable wine with well-integrated oak and supple tannin. Blackberry and coffee mingle on the finish.",88,Kunde 2012 Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley)
"Soft and fresh, this medium-bodied wine has clean, neutral flavors and is easy to sip. Aromas are a little peachy while flavors suggest pears. The texture is mild.",85,Bota Box 2014 Pinot Grigio (California)
"Cerasuolo di Vittoria is one of the most exciting red wines to emerge from southern Italy in recent years. This is made with organic fruit, and it shows bright tones of raspberry and cassis, with some tones of toasted almond and light spice at the back.",88,Feudo di Santa Tresa 2010  Cerasuolo di Vittoria Classico
"Light aromas of spice, dried herbs and plum lead to plump blue-fruit flavors with a touch of sugar stitching them together. This doesn't bring a lot of complexity but still has appeal.",87,Skyfall 2012 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The black pepper and cocoa flavors that always mark this fine vineyard show up again in this dry, tannic wine. So do the blackberries and cassis that make it so sweetly fruity. The acidity is awkward, though, and tastes like it was added to balance out a high alcohol wine.",86,Deep Sea 2008 White Hawk Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"This Livermore Valley producer travels to Lodi to make this Zin, a smattering of 4% Petite Sirah blended in. Intense in cherry-watermelon candy aromas, its flavors develop into tart cherry, blueberry and spice. With soft tannins this wine is straightforward, with the finish all about dusty cigars.",86,Longevity 2010 Zinfandel (Lodi)
"Lots of stone fruit ripeness marks the nose of this wine, with aomas of nectarine and peach cut by the sharpness of apple skins. The palate is all green apples and lime juice.",85,Magnolia Court 2013 Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"Ritual is Veramonte's top label from Casablanca and this wine is up to snuff. Grassy, green aromas of lettuce and tropical fruits set up a clean, medium-weight palate with grapefruit, gooseberry and lime flavors. A touch of bitter pyrazines rise up on the finish and dance with residual citrus notes and minerality.",90,Ritual 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"This supple, savory Shiraz is approachable now. Hints of vanilla and black olive accent mixed berry fruit, while the texture is rich and creamy. Meat and mocha take over on the long finish. Drink now–2020.",92,Kaesler 2009 Old Vine Shiraz (Barossa Valley)
"The welcoming aromas of red berry and cherry are slightly smoky and spicy. Showing good body, this has light tannins, with flavors of toasty plum, berry, chocolate and spice. It's round, mellow and easy on the finish.",87,Salvatore Principe 2011 Malbec (Mendoza)
"This shows a hint of mineral along with tropical fruit. This is a seductive combination that shows richness and a taut, nervy character. Age for at least six years.",93,Domaine Jean-Paul et Benoît Droin 2010 Montmains Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"This is a simple, clean wine, with light fruit and approachable acidity. The finish is soft and easy.",84,Ravoire et Fils 2011 Domaine Fontanyul Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This blend of 66% Shiraz, 16% Mourvèdre, 14% Grenache and 4% Cinsault is pure and balanced, with an immediately perceptable core of brambly berry that's accented by notes of white pepper, charred cedar, forest floor and cocoa nib. The medium-weight palate is fleshy yet firm, with spiced-fruit flavors and structured tannins. It's certainly drinkable now, but this will continue to mature and evolve nicely through 2018.",92,A.A. Badenhorst Family Wines 2009 Red (Swartland)
"Aromas of cocoa, baking spice and herb are followed by cocoa and vanilla-speckled flavors. The tannins bring a slight sense of astringency but overall it offers some appeal.",87,Apex 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Taut and cool with swathes of fresh tarragon and crisp melon rind, this elegant dry Riesling has a nervous vitality throughout. The palate is zesty and bright, highlighting tart flavors of tangerine and apricot before fading into a dusty mineral finish.",89,Domdechant Werner 2013 Hochheimer Hölle Kabinett Trocken Riesling (Rheingau)
"This delightful rosato (made from the Lagrein grape of Northern Italy) opens with fragrant tones of wild berry, white almond, stone fruit, white cherry and sweet cassis. It feels fresh and light in the mouth and would pair with smoked salmon.",87,Muri-Gries 2011 Lagrein (Alto Adige)
"Big, round and lush, this is the fourth vintage for this wine, one of the best Chardonnays in Washington state. In this vintage it did not go through full malolactic, leaving a nice underlying acidity with a leesy, creamy freshness. Golden apples, stone fruits and a lick of butterscotch add to the luscious, generous finish.",93,Gorman 2009 Big Sissy Conner Lee Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"An atypically lean, focused Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, with the emphasis on minerality and leafy components rather than tropical fruit. Citrus, wet stones and tomato leaves make for a slightly austere impression, finishing crisp and clean.",85,Nautilus 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"This is appealing for its richness, but it's heavily oaked with buttered toast and butterscotch flavors that overwhelm the underlying fruit. Too bad, because it's a nice Chardonnay with bright pineapple and orange flavors supported by fine acidity.",86,Kunde 2011 Wildwood Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley)
"Round aromas of chocolate-covered raisin set up a loaded palate. Salty berry, cassis, baking-spice and chocolate flavors finish with a full helping of berry and plum fruit, while this maintains a moderately full outlook on the finish. Drink through 2021.",91,Cielo y Tierra 2012 Don Juan Nahuel Malbec (Mendoza)
A faint nose of tart red currant turns into a subtly flavored palate rich with cranberry notes and gentle herbal notes of hay flowers. This subtlety is also expressed in the fine mousse and the long dry but very full-fruited finish.,89,Domaine François Schmitt NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Alsace)
"Dry tannins dominate this wine. Pavie's style has become less exuberant, more restrained, which allows the terroir to show through in its tannins and concentration. This is for long-term aging.",94,Château Pavie 2008  Saint-Émilion
"Lemon and freshly squeezed lime give this attractive wine a crisp, bright texture that is rounded out at the end with perfumed flavors from the Moscatel in the blend. This fruity, textured wine needs a few more months before drinking. Drink from late 2015.",86,Duorum 2014 Tons de Duorum White (Douro)
"Vanilla and green wood aromas are at the fore, followed by cherry and herbs. The fruit flavors are sweet and elegant, with the oak nearly completely overriding them.",86,Revelry 2011 D11 Dionysus Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Made from a clonal selection of the estate's best Cabernet Sauvignon, this cheerful red is concentrated and extracted with a seductively sweet-smelling nose. It is by no means simple: Background aromas of tar, root beer, espresso, chopped mint and bright berry speak to its Tuscan roots. It's still a bit thick and chewy in the mouth, so drink it after 2012 and give it time to open.",94,Tenuta di Nozzole 2004 Il Pareto Cabernet Sauvignon (Toscana)
"Toasty aromas fold in baked apple notes. Sharp, sizzling and high in acid, the palate is citric and tough to navigate. Flavors of orange, lemon and sour apple are no shock given the palate.",85,Budeguer 2013 Cuatro Mil Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"Firmly tannic, this tough wine shows signs of over-enthusiastic extraction. That gives a bitter character that will always leave the wine with a dry core. The black fruits skins give acidity and some final freshness. Drink from 2018.",87,Château de Belcier 2012 Les Armoiries de Belcier  (Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux)
"Bright and clear, this young wine is powered by racy cranberry and raspberry fruit. It's a wine that will appeal to those who love primary, juicy, tangy red fruit, but will carry a long way in the cellar for those who value the extra dimensions that well-aged Pinot can convey. Tuck a few bottles away and watch as they blossom into complex wines with dusty elegance. Drink now through 2030.",94,Elizabeth Chambers 2014 Lazy River Vineyard Pinot Noir
"An attractive wine. The Chardonnay is fresh, lightly mineral, with flavors of red apples, lemon zest and crisp acidity. A great party wine.",85,Barton & Guestier NV Cuvée Réservée Brut Chardonnay (Vin Mousseux)
"Wisps of smoke and spice lend an earthy tone to bright red cherry and plum flavors on this smooth, richly textured Cabernet Franc. The palate is velvety plush with layers of fine, soft tannins and soft berry acidity. Easy going but satisfying.",86,Six Mile Creek 2012 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes)
"A solid Pinot Noir, dry and nicely tart in acidity, with raspberry, cherry, cola and mint flavors. It's an easy wine to drink now.",88,LaZarre 2009 Pinot Noir (Central Coast)
"The nose on this Malbec is loaded with oak and pencil eraser aromas; there's also a raisiny quality to the bouquet. This feels a touch stewy, although strong acidity functions as an offset. Blackberry, licorice and clove flavors come in front of a raw, tight, narrow finish with stomping tannins.",88,Bodega Noemía de Patagonia 2011 J. Alberto Single Vineyard Malbec (Río Negro Valley)
"Lovely aromatics conjure up rose petals, a dash of body powder and ripe citrus. The fruit is very ripe, with almost a candy character, and there's a sensation of powdered sugar. But despite the almost 14g/L residual sugar, it's more sweet/tart than syrupy, keeping it sappy and refreshing.",92,Brooks 2015 Orchard Fold Vineyard Riesling (Eola-Amity Hills)
"An eccentric wine, very high in alcohol, yet there's a strange vegetal element. Otherwise, it's all about sweet blackberry jam, mushu plum sauce, white pepper and charred bacon. The green veggie note, which winemaker Matthias Pippig describes as “savage”, persists into the finish.",86,Sanguis 2010 1/1 Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"Cabernet Sauvignon (84%) makes up the majority of this wine, with the rest Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Herb, dark fruit, tobacco, carob and spice aromas are followed by ripe, tannic fruit flavors that seem to tussle at times.",90,Tenor 2012 1:1 Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Well roasted and toasty, with plenty of barrel power and underlying black berry fruit. The palate is tight and fully tannic, while the palate has plum and sweet berry flavors. Ripe, a little grating and uncomplicated.",87,TerraNoble 2006 Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"Whiffs of wildflowers, fennel and slate combine in this deliciously blossomy, complex wine. While dry in style, it's a touch softer and riper than the HJW or Josef Vineyard bottlings, coating the palate in a supple silk of peach and grapefruit flavors. Powerful and concentrated, it lingers long on the finish. Delicious now, but sure to improve through at least 2023.",93,Hermann J. Wiemer 2013 Magdalena Vineyard Riesling (Seneca Lake)
"Named after the last private owner of what is now a charitable foundation, this ripe, full Chardonnay has enormous flavors. Wood, sweet caramel and vanilla aromas are balanced on the palate with tropical fruits, peaches, apples and creamy acidity to give it a touch of freshness.",92,Villa Russiz 2001 Gräfin de la Tour Chardonnay (Collio)
"Here's a bright and very polished Riserva Barbaresco with clean and focused aromas of white cherry, cola, wild berries and dried currants. This expression from the Pora cru (known for its cellar-worthy wines) shows good acidity and drying tannins.",90,Produttori del Barbaresco 2005 Pora Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"Grüner Veltliner, though still rare, shows good promise in Oregon. This is a big, sappy, ripe version that's borderline syrupy, with big flavors of peaches and apricots. But the supporting acids, and a lick of mineral, keep it from crashing.",87,Raptor Ridge 2012 Estate Grüner Veltliner (Chehalem Mountains)
"This is mainly Semillon and Sauvignon Blanc, with 25% Chardonnay and 9% Pinot Gris to round out the midpalate. Apple and citrus flavors dominate, and there is a certain plumpness to the wine but it retains its essentially citrusy character throughout.",85,Henschke 2008 Tilly's Vineyard White (Barossa-Adelaide Hills)
"Here's a dryer, more mineral-driven take on a Prosecco Dry with pretty floral notes and subdued notes of stone fruit and pear. The wine is easy and streamlined in the mouth with a full palate of fruit flavors.",87,Le Colture NV Cruner Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
"The Cabernets here, if you hadn't already guessed, are Sauvignon and Franc. There's a distinct herbal element to the nose, creating a “green” aromatic sensation. Meanwhile, the palate is coarse and on the acidic side, with red-fruit flavors accented by tarragon and oregano. Spicy but hot on the finish.",84,Finca Las Moras 2006 Black Label Cabernet - Cabernet Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc (San Juan)
"Easy, fresh and delightful, pair this lively Soave with fried calamari or sardines. The wine offers easy aromas of citrus, tangerine, yellow flower and melon. The mouthfeel is silky and fresh.",86,Corte Adami 2012  Soave
A profusion of green Conference pears and refreshing spritz make this crisp and pale white ideal for a summer party.,89,Nastl 2013 Klassik Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"Corton is the largest grand cru in Burgundy (all of 240 acres) and its style can vary widely. Bouchard has gone for a relatively soft style, emphasizing fruits, raspberry, myrtle and black currants, topped with acidity. It is a light, delicious wine, but probably not for aging.",93,Bouchard Père & Fils 2006  Corton
"Haras is the base-level label for Haras de Pirque, and frankly this Chardonnay tastes, smells and feels like a base-level wine. There's a damp lack of clarity on the nose as well as sweet apple, cinnamon and spice flavors. Finishes fleshy and bland.",81,Haras 2007 Estate Chardonnay (Maipo Valley)
"Warm and ripe wine, very open with its red fruit acidity well integrated. There are tannins and a more dry character of course—this is a 2010 wine, but the main effect is of weight and some power.",89,Georges Duboeuf 2010 Château des Capitans  (Juliénas)
"This wine is full of juicy fruit along with a dark, smoky character. A firm undertow of very dry tannins brings out a firm structure. The hard edge needs to soften, so wait to drink until 2018.",88,Château la Patache 2011  Pomerol
"Structured, with a juicy backbone of fruit, this full-bodied, 100% varietal wine features aromas of baked bread joined by a taste of blackberry jam. Jolts of cedar and green herb provide a classical touch to the lengthy finish. Drink now through 2020.",91,Madrigal 2012 Estate Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley)
"Clean, crisp and bright, this was fermented in stainless (with just 10% in neutral wood), and not put through malolactic. The blend is 60/40 Chardonnay/Pinot Noir, yielding fresh fruit flavors of apple and melon that are focused and precise. A streak of ginger runs through racy acidity.",90,Argyle 2012 Vintage Brut Sparkling (Willamette Valley)
"A rich, thick, heavy Merlot, a little too soft and melted in structure, but so delicious, it's easy to like. Shows flashy black cherry jam, chocolate, roasted almond and caramel flavors, rather like a granola candy bar.",86,Robert Losey 2008 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"A smooth and round wine, with citrus flavors that have been tamed by yellow fruit and melon flavors. That gives the wine richness as well as a fresh and crisp aftertaste. Drink until 2018.",89,Benoît Daridan 2012 Sauvignon Blanc-Chardonnay (Cheverny)
"Opens with aromas of tomato leaf, fresh salsa and rubber. Later on red fruit enters the picture, and on the palate there's adequate raspberry and plum with a hint of chocolate. Feelwise, it's a touch gummy. But overall this wine from Patagonia is solid and proves that Argentinean Pinot Noir has its merits.",85,Chaltén 2007 Reserva Pinot Noir (Neuquén)
"Starts out oaky and cheesy, with baked berry, leather and clove-like aromas. The palate has lots of size, clacky tannins and acidity, while flavors of berry, mocha and tobacco are nice and lead to a toasty, grabby finish. Typical for RDD in that it's tough and tannic but full of brash flavor; drink now–2015.",88,Ébano 2006 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"Drying mineral tones set the stage and the wine is otherwise neutral from an aromatic point of view. You'll get some fruit in the mouth with flavors that recall peach and passion fruit and the wine has a lean, easy texture. Made with a grape called Pallagrello.",85,Fattoria Alois 2007 Caiatì Pallagrello (Campania)
"Deep ruby to the eye, this wine made with native Turkish variety Kalecik Karasi has a nose of blackberry, cherry and caramel. Barely-there tannins and a pleasing vein of acidity offer a backdrop for flavors of black cherry, cranberry, white chocolate and orange peel that remain on the palate through the zippy finish.",89,Turasan 2012 Kalecik Karasi (Turkey)
"Crisp green apple flavors are immediately apparent—lactic inflections and floral notes appear too, alongside wood sorrel and moist brioche. The palate has electric English acidity and a very creamy, fine mousse that gives shapely curves to its slenderness.",91,Wiston Estate Winery 2010 Cuvée Brut Sparkling (England)
"A little earthiness on the nose blows off to reveal a very concentrated and sweepingly apple-flavored palate which pitches generous, ripe fruit against welcome, tart freshness. This is open and and very joyous, fresh and utterly fruit-driven with a lasting, very moreish finish.",92,Emile Beyer 2014 Eichberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"An almost neutral nose opens into a zesty, light-bodied palate that swings with yeasty savoriness and a whole lot of grapefruit zest. Slender, focused and very refreshing. Goes down easily and has that moreish tanginess.",91,Wieninger 2014 Wiener Grüner Veltliner (Vienna)
"This 100% Sauvignon Blanc isn't fully ripe yet it's dry and crisp, with a mouthwatering cleanness. There's an edge to the Meyer lemon, lime, green melon and vanilla flavors.",86,Baehner Fournier 2012 Vogelzang Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (58%), Merlot (33%) and Cabernet Franc. Each show themselves in turn, with aromas of high-toned herbs, spice box, pencil lead, cherries and flowers. The tart cherry flavors are still tightly wound, showing balance, focus and persistence. The finish lingers. Best consumed after 2018.",92,Tamarack Cellars 2012 Sagemoor Vineyards Reserve Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A blend of local Alentejo grapes has produced a structured while also opulent wine. Layers of dark fruits and solid tannins give dense character. Red fruits burst out of the structure, adding acidity and a perfumed aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",90,Herdade dos Machados 2012 Morgado da Canita Red (Alentejano)
"A terrific Cabernet made from a blend of various Paso Robles vineyards. Just delicious, a young, softly appealing wine brimming with blackberry, cherry, currant, mocha and cedar flavors. Beautiful now, especially with a grilled steak or lamb chop.",90,Falcone 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Made entirely from Grenache, this wine is whole-cluster fermented and aged in stainless steel. It's a dry, light expression that's pretty on the nose and palate, with inviting strawberry notes alongside hints of lemon and orange. It offers refreshing acidity alongside a meaty body and wet-stone minerality.",90,Anaba 2016 Rosé of Grenache (Sonoma Valley)
"The winery held this Chardonnay back a year later than their far more expensive Journey bottling. Hard to say why, but the consumer is the beneficiary. That extra bit of aging has mellowed the wine, giving it a creamy, buttery richness. It has good acidity, too, that gives a lift to the ripe tropical fruits.",92,Matanzas Creek 2010 Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"Light and fruity, this has flavors of creamed apple and ripe Williams pear. The wine is crisp and tangy, and it's shot through with lemon zest and acidity. Ready to drink in one year.",87,Domaine Charly Nicolle 2011 Cuvée Ancestrum  (Chablis)
"Visitors to Sonoma Valley are familiar with the beautiful Cherryblock Vineyard, which has been Sebastiani's flagship Cabernet source for decades. The 2010 vintage was kind to it, producing fruit that's not only exceptionally ripe, but well structured. Balanced acidity and soft, intricate tannins house luscious black cherry, currant, anise and new oak flavors. The wine should age in the bottle for at least eight years.",91,Sebastiani 2010 Cherryblock Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley)
"In this vintage, the blend is 66% Tempranillo and 34% Cabernet Sauvignon. The earthy funk is well integrated with black cherry and hints of stem and bark. Still tight and herbal, this is a well-balanced, well-crafted wine, with medium body and length.",91,K Vintners 2009 En Chamberlin El Jefe Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Angel Vine sources excellent fruit, and makes what is arguably the most hedonistic, California-style Zinfandel in the Northwest. Here blended with 13% Primitivo, the sweet and liquorous berry fruit flavors are deep and luxurious. Buttressed with juicy natural acidity, this wine does not show its 14.8% alcohol.",91,Angel Vine 2009 Zinfandel (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This creamy, fresh wine opens with orchard fruit, citrus and banana scents. The medium-bodied palate delivers white peach and nectarine flavors, with bright acidity that leaves a tangy finish.",88,Zenato 2016 San Benedetto  (Lugana)
"Cabernet Sauvignon comprises 95% of the blend, along with 5% Merlot. Sourced from the Beckstoffer Georges III vineyard, this wine shows the enormous ripeness and softness that vineyard is known for, with rich, opulent black cherry jam and mocha flavors, balanced by acidity and tannins. There's a lot of new oak. Drink now–2018.",90,Ellman Family 2010 Jemma Red (Napa Valley)
"A landmark wine for the Valpolicella region, Vigneto di Monte Lodoletta is surely among the biggest, boldest and most concentrated red wines on the planet. Thanks to the appassimento process, extremely low yields and long oak aging, this Amarone takes intensity and richness to new extremes. The tannins are still astringent and tight, and the wine will absolutely not ready be to drink any less than a decade from now.",95,Dal Forno Romano 2004 Vigneto di Monte Lodoletta  (Amarone della Valpolicella)
"Lush aromas of pineapple and yellow apple ride over undertones of vanilla, coconut and butter on the nose. Concentrated flavors of pineapple, chamomile, vanilla and apple meld effortlessly on the palate. While the feel is round and silky, bright acidity keeps the balance. The finish is long and smooth.",88,Early Mountain 2016 Quaker Run Chardonnay (Virginia)
"Viognier makes up just over 8% of this wine and it shows itself with perfumed aromas of flowers and orange peel, along with brown stems, freshly ground herb, black olive, mineral and whiffs of smoked meat. The palate is all about texture and layers, while never losing its exquisite sense of balance, gliding on the extended finish. Superb stuff, with an emphasis on elegance.",94,Delmas 2014 SJR Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"A big mouthful of ripe yellow peaches, apricots and spicy pears, creamy in texture, this is an opulent Champagne. It has plenty of weight but doesn't lose sight of Piper-Heidsieck's stylistic delicacy. It is a fine apéritif Champagne for those who want something softer.",87,Piper-Heidsieck NV Cuvée Sublime Demi-Sec  (Champagne)
"Aromas of beeswax and lemon oil, the flavors following along with tangerine, orange and peach. Very dry, with exceptional concentration of fruit, and well-integrated flavors of cracker and grain. This was barrel fermented, and delivers a long, concentrated finish.",90,Gård 2007 Lawrence Vineyards Dry Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))
"An elegant rendering of the appellation, this is only medium bodied, yet packs in plenty of complex flavors. Cracked pepper, cured meat, blueberry and plum notes finish with a soft dusting of silky tannins. Drink now–2020.",91,Vidal-Fleury 2010 Brune et Blonde de Vidal-Fleury  (Côte Rôtie)
"Herbal citrus and asparagus aromas lead this plucky white from Spier. On the palate, fresh, clean citrus and slate mingles with grass and fresh fruit. An excellent warm weather sip: pair with seafood and poultry dishes.",87,Spier 2008 Private Collection Sauvignon Blanc (Coastal Region)
This is a tight and firm style of Prosecco with lively perlage and aromatic characteristics that veer towards talc powder and white flower more than they do peachy fruit or honey. It's an Extra Dry Prosecco but the sweetness is not immediately obvious.,84,Natale Verga NV Extra Dry  (Prosecco)
"Named after the French author who came from Provence, this wine is a bright, fruity style with pepper and caramel flavors. It has plenty of red fruits and attractive final acidity.",87,La Belle Collection 2015 Colette Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"In its distinctive carafe-shaped bottle, this Champagne commemorates the French king who first said that Champagne had to be bottled (so the bubbles would not disappear). It is dominated by Chardonnay, giving a chalky, mineral texture to this ripe wine. While the fruit is still deliciously fresh, the wine is just beginning to add toast flavors to its repertoire. Drink now, or better from 2017.",93,De Venoge 2006 Louis XV Brut  (Champagne)
"A standout in a flight of more expensive wines, this five-grape blend leans heavily on the Bordeaux varietals, with a bit of Syrah as well. Firm and complex, its black cherry, cassis and plum fruit flavors are nicely accented by baking spices and red licorice. The balance is perfect; the finish carries a suggestion of dried leaf.",90,Smasne Cellars 2008 County Line Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Mint and oak aromas mingle with berry tones on the nose. Upon entrance the wine feels flabby, however after a few seconds the juicy acidity kicks in. Flavors of underripe berry and olive dominate the palate, with a slightly oaky finish.",84,Santa Alicia 2013 Reserva Espiritu de Los Andes Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"Too much acidity in this dry wine, making it almost sour. Yet it has an enormous core of red and black cherry fruit, with a tasteful application of smoky oak, and a lovely, silky texture. Seems too unbalanced to age, so drink up.",84,Bargetto 2008 Regan Vineyards Reserve Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
This wine has ripeness and a kind of sweetness in the aroma. Good fresh cherry flavors glide along nicely on the smooth texture. It is medium bodied and balanced for easy enjoyment.,85,Red Rock 2014 Reserve Pinot Noir (California)
"Labeled dry and tasting very much so, this clean, floral-scented Gewürztraminer has a pleasingly dusty aspect; rose petals with a thin veneer of incense. Long and complex.",90,Foris 2009 Dry Gewürztraminer (Rogue Valley)
"Cherry and plum aromas are ripe, sweet and inviting. There's plenty of body and roundness to this Bonarda, while exotic blueberry and boysenberry flavors finish fresh, with a light herbal aftertaste. Overall this shows lots of fruit and good balance.",90,La Posta 2014 Armando Bonarda (Mendoza)
"A butterscotch note hits the nose first, before fading to reveal scents of tea, leather and cedary spices. Medium to full-bodied, the succulent palate bears a supple core with a mineral edge. A flavor of dried strawberry marks the tangy finish. This is a blend of 35% Merlot, 25% Petit Verdot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc.",87,Stinson 2011 Meritage Red (Virginia)
"Known in other regions as Blaufränkisch, Frankovka is widely grown in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. This wine is garnet in the glass, with aromas of black cherry, cherry cola, and black plum. Flavors of black cherry and anise linger on the palate right through the spicy finish.",88,Vino z Czech 2012 Hrabal Frankovka (Moravia)
"Made with Sangiovese, this vibrant red opens with aromas of fresh violet, woodland berry, underbrush, new leather and a balsamic note. The linear, elegant palate delivers crushed raspberry, wild cherry, star anise and a hint of white pepper. It boasts youthful tension, with taut polished tannins and bright acidity that give it an ageworthy structure. Give it a few more years to come together. Drink 2019–2028.",93,Marchesi de' Frescobaldi 2013 Montesodi Sangiovese (Toscana)
"This is an expression of Dolcetto that shows many qualities, including a distinct sense of informal elegance. There are mineral aromas balanced by ripe fruit tones and the wine shows a higher than expected level of complexity.",90,Bricco Maiolica 2008 Sorì Bricco Maiolica Superiore  (Dolcetto di Diano d'Alba)
"This blend of Petit Verdot (40%), Grenache (29%), Shiraz (29%) and Mataro (2%) ends up being a pleasing recipe at an even more pleasing price. Mulberry, plum and vanilla flavors emerge from the glass, while the mouthfeel is full and lush. Probably best over the next year or so.",87,Rocland Estate 2007 Ass Kisser Fine Red Wine Red (South Australia)
"Toast, oak, coconut and mocha aromas take center stage and carry over to the palate along with star anise and baking spice. It lacks fruit richness while bracing tannins grip the finish.",87,Cavalier Bartolomeo 2010 San Lorenzo  (Barolo)
"This is a big Pinot Noir, full-bodied and dry, and a little heavy. But it's rich, offering delicious waves of cherries, raspberries, red currants, licorice, cola and savory spices. Unclear if it will age, but nice now with steaks, chops, grilled salmon.",88,Arista 2009 Pinot Noir (Mendocino Ridge)
"While initially a bit earthy and savory on the nose, this ethereal kabinett abounds in fruity, floral complexities. Cutting and spry, its sweet, tangy citrus and stone-fruit flavors seem to dance nervously on the palate. It's nuanced and minerally, with a deliciously salty finish.",92,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef) 2015 Bernkasteler Badstube Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"Aromas of ripe berry, toast and a whiff of scorched earth emerge in the glass. The palate is more expressive, offering cherry marinated in spirits, roasted herb and licorice alongside firm refined tannins.",89,Mario Gagliasso 2012 Tre Utin  (Barolo)
"This is a terrific vintage for this blend, helped by the decision to bump up the alcohol and reduce the residual sugar, now down to 16g/L. Though off dry, this retains a spine of steely acid, highlighting the bright and spicy lemon curd, orange peel and pink grapefruit flavors. It will be delicious with pork roasts or simply sipped with mild cheeses.",92,Chehalem 2014 Three Vineyard Riesling (Willamette Valley)
"Dominated by Fronton's own native Négrette grape, this is a spicy, earthy wine. A green bell pepper undertow gives freshness while also an unripe character. The wine should be drunk now.",84,Chateau Saint Louis 2012 Red (Fronton)
"Fragrant overtones of acacia honey play alongside lemony notes on the nose, adding a touch of restrained, exotic decadence. A hint of chalk contributes grounding dimension. All combine to make a fragrant nose. These themes play out again on the slender but expressive palate. Pure lemon freshness brightens the notions of honey and chalk, while tiny bubbles provide endless explosions of deep, sustained flavor. This wine seems still young and taut, but the energy suggests great future development. Lemon purity on the finish appeals with its clean and invigorating nature. Drink 2017–2027.",94,Exton Park Vineyard 2011 Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (England)
"The grapes for this 100% Sauvignon Blanc are sourced from estate American Canyon vineyards as well as an estate plot in Carneros. The result is intense in oaky apple skin and tropical, fleshy lime and guava. Large French oak casks were used for aging.",85,Grgich Hills 2013 Miljenko's Selection Essence Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Aromas of ripe strawberry, mint, pipe tobacco and a whiff of forest floor take center stage on this structured red. The full-flavored elegant palate boasts a nice depth of flavors including red cherry, raspberry, cake spice and a hint of new leather alongside polished tannins. Enjoy through 2020.",92,Abbazia di Novacella 2012 Praepositus Riserva Pinot Nero (Alto Adige)
"Lime and mineral notes are about all that arise from the bouquet. On the palate, this is a sizzler with blazing acidity and narrow flavors of lemon and green apple. Yes, it's very fresh and cleansing; but this is also acidic and lean.",84,Emiliana 2012 Natura Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"Steeliness exemplified in wine. This is crisp and structured, complex with its green fruits, structured acidity and touch of caramel and kiwi. It's the acidity that shows at the moment; needs 4–5 years.",92,La Chablisienne 2005 Montée de Tonnerre Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"Funky and smelling of pine and tarragon. That aromatic sharpness carries straight to the palate, where the feel is narrow and the flavors are short and tangy, with little to no big-time berry fruit. Simply an acceptable underperformer that's tough and sharp.",83,Finca La María 2005 Barrica  (Ribera del Duero)
"This white blend is two thirds Sémillon, one third Sauvignon Blanc. It has continued to improve from vintage to vintage, and this is the best yet. A Washington take on Bordeaux blanc, it's dry and fresh, with golden apple and sweet grain extending across the palate and on through a lingering, lightly peachy finish.",92,L'Ecole No. 41 2011 Estate Luminesce Seven Hills Vineyard White (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"From a 34-acre property that has vines both in Blaye and Bourg, this is concentrated, showing the ripe, generous fruit of the vintage. Still youthful, its blackberry juiciness lies behind its wood-aging flavors. Drink from 2020.",90,Château Métairie Neuve 2015  Côtes de Bourg
"Well made, well balanced and rich in flavor, this medium-bodied wine has fruit flavors that are almost sweet but countered by crisp acidity. It tastes spicy like vanilla and nutmeg on the finish.",86,Vigilance 2014 Chardonnay (Red Hills Lake County)
"The bottle looks like it's wrapped in leopard fur. The wine is off-dry, clean and simple, with crisp flavors of raspberries, strawberries, honey and vanilla.",85,Moreno BHLV NV Brut Sparkling (California)
"Powdery citrus aromas are mild yet friendly. In the mouth, this is both acidic and a touch sticky. Nutty, almondy flavors of stone fruits and bitterness finish with stalky notes of hay and stems.",83,Maitea 2012 Verdejo (Rueda)
"Made with Negroamaro, this offers aromas of coconut, toasted oak, plum cake and brown cooking spice. The one-dimensional palate delivers oak extract, roasted coffee bean, licorice, steeped plum and dried blackberry alongside firm, drying tannins.",87,Palamà 2012 Mavro Negroamaro (Salento)
"Ripe yet deftly balanced, this full-bodied wine offers an abundance of blackberry fruitiness balanced by tones of granite and dried herb. It's sumptuous and expansive on the palate, finishing long with fine, sharply edged tannins.",90,Harbes Family Vineyard 2013 Proprietor Reserve Hallock Lane Merlot (North Fork of Long Island)
"In 2000, this was still the property of Lily Lacoste, who also owned Pétrus. Latour à Pomerol was sold  in 2001 to a Catholic charity. The management, then and now, is with the Moueix family who make the most of the fabulous vineyard. The 2000 is a hugely opulent, velvet textured wine, but it retains hints of the elegance that is the hallmark of this property.",93,Château Latour à Pomerol 2000  Pomerol
"Spicy, smoky new oak leaps out of the glass, like a blast of caramelized meringue, but the fruit is so rich that the oak is in balance. The underlying flavors of blackberries, licorice and chocolate are, in a word, delicious. Now through 2011.",92,Provenance Vineyards 2005 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"Years ago Rotta released a very fine wine from this rare variety they labeled Sherry, and this wine does have a sweet Amontillado, almost Oloroso taste. It's deeply colored in copper and gold, with overtly sweet, honeyed flavors of pineapple brûlée and vanilla fudge. The alcohol weighs in at 19%.",90,Rotta NV Black Monukka (California)
"The intensity of this wine is almost overwhelming, with its crisp minerality, apple skin and green plum flavors and white stone fruits. The concentration is impressive for a wine that looks likely to need at least five years before drinking.",94,Tegernseerhof 2006 Steinertal Riesling (Wachau)
"Wiry cherry and herbal aromas create a raw bouquet with controlled ruggedness. Things follow that track in the mouth, which feels snappy and acidic on the midpalate, while flavors of herbal plum and spicy currant take over. A solid finish with a good feel and fresh, herbal berry fruit flavors is good.",89,Anakena 2010 Alwa Limited Edition Carmenère (Cachapoal Valley)
"This structured wine comes from one of the lesser-known Grand Crus of Vosne-Romanée. But it does have the structure and density of the wines from this run of grand crus, with bold tannins over the red-cherry fruits. It is likely to be a structured wine for many years. Drink from 2027.",95,Louis Latour 2015 Les Quatre Journaux  (Romanée-St.-Vivant)
"Still young, this wine has a tight character that needs to open up. Since there is plenty of fruit along with perfumed acidity, it will happen. Tannins and a bitter edge need to be softened, so wait until late 2016 for this wine's potential to really show.",85,Chavet Fils 2014  Menetou-Salon
"Fresh green apple, lemon and gooseberry notes abound in this gorgeously fruity and juicy Sauvignon Blanc. It's surprisingly bold on the palate: full bodied and supple yet balanced. Flavors of ripe white grapefruit and quince are concentrated yet brisk. A hint of musky spray marks the finish. Drink now through 2020.",90,Kontokosta 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (North Fork of Long Island)
"A brighter, more mineral- and acid-driven take on the often rustic Rhône grape, this kicks off with fresh smells of raspberry and rock. The palate brings tart cherry, followed by just-ripe black berry and really ripe raspberry on the midpalate, and a tartness on the finish.",88,Adelaida 2011 Anna's Estate Vineyard Mourvèdre (Paso Robles)
"Full-throttle lime, peach and strawberry aromas come through on the nose, with a trace of toast. It drinks as fruity as it smells. There’s some pretty toast and good acidity, and it finishes fruity and a little sweet.",86,Gloria Ferrer NV Brut  (Sonoma County)
"Just a tiny serving of this dark nectar will last a long time. The malty, porter-ish aromas intrigue, followed by incredibly rich and syrupy flavors accompanied by mouthwatering acids and enormous peristence. Layers of complexity gradually unfold in the glass, revealing hints of honey, caramel and beguiling rancio notes.",98,R.L. Buller & Son NV Calliope Rare Tokay (Rutherglen)
"The tart but tropical charm of passion fruit plays around the nose before more zesty citrus notes become apparent. The palate is generous with juicy peach, yellow pear and citrus. The vein of lemon freshness at the core is totally seductive. While the palate is patently dry, the absolute juiciness of the fruit will get you, as will the clean but aromatic finish. Drink 2017–2027.",94,Domaine Zinck 2015 Pfersigberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"Made with dried Grillo grapes, this opens with subdued aromas of citrus peel and a whiff of yellow peach. The palate is more expressive, offering dried apricot, fig and a hint of candied lemon zest.",87,Feudo Disisa 2008 Krysos Grillo (Sicilia)
"Fresh and fragrant, this offers aromas of pressed rose, violet and just picked grapes. Made entirely with the Sorbara grape, the bright, frothy palate doles out red cherry, crushed strawberry and a spicy ginger note alongside bracing acidity.",89,Paltrinieri 2014 Leclisse  (Lambrusco di Sorbara)
"From the Poujeaux section of Moulis, Dutruch Grand Poujeaux is still family-owned and -inhabited. This is deliciously fruity and the juicy black-currant flavor is firmly balanced by ripe, generous tannins. A concentrated wine that will certainly age well.",93,Château Dutruch Grand Poujeaux 2010  Moulis-en-Médoc
"The wine is mature both in its orange-pink color and toasty flavors. It has fresh acidity, although that is less important than the almond and spice secondary flavors. Ripe and full in the mouth, this is a rich rosé with a soft, ready-to-drink aftertaste.",91,Moët & Chandon 2006 Grand Vintage Rosé  (Champagne)
"Smooth, deep and fairly complex on the bouquet, with concentrated dark fruit aromas blending with coconut. The palate shows structure, tightness and full but integrated tannins, while the flavors of black fruits, herbs, tea and spice set up a full, toasted finish that satisfies. Drink now through 2020.",92,Protos 2004 Gran Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)
"This is a fruity wine with plenty of dried-fruit flavors and sweetness. There is a nice bite of spirit, a touch of wood and acidity to balance the sweetness.",86,Quevedo NV Special Reserve Tawny  (Port)
"Marked by gritty tannins and a tang of acidity, this non-vintage Bordeaux blend turns rich in blackberry and black currant flavors on the midpalate. It's very dry, despite the sweet fruit. You can drink it now, but it's tannic enough to hold over at least the next eight years.",91,Freemark Abbey NV 125th Anniversary History Red (Napa Valley)
"A delicate streak of honeycomb gilds layers of yellow peaches, apples and tangerines in this off-dry Riesling. Its concentrated fruitiness is lip smacking, but it's also quite elegant, reverberating long on a steely strike of acidity and minerality. Drink now through 2020.",90,Bischöfliche Weingüter Trier 2014 Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"This is certainly powerful, maybe too much so. It has all the richness and density of ripe and perfumed Malbec, solid with structure, with dark plums and enormous concentration. It is 100% Malbec, aged in new French oak barrels, fulfilling the brand's theme of “one family, one terroir, one grape.” No question, this is a wine to age. Drink from 2020.",93,Château Lamartine 2011 Expression Malbec (Cahors)
"Aromas of orange zest, apple cider and yeast come in front of a plump, slightly wayward palate with citric acidity. Generic citrus flavors finish lemony but with acidic scour.",86,Esperanza 2015 Verdejo-Viura (Rueda)
"A jump forward in quality for this pure Tempranillo. It opens with a dark, smoky nose—oaky but compelling. The midpalate remains tight and hard, but shows muscular black fruits, good length, and leads nicely into a balanced finish with ripe tannins.",91,Watermill 2008 Tempranillo (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Extremely dark in the glass, lavish aromas of black currant, black pepper, lilac, violet and blooming chaparral show on this bottling from a remote vineyard north of the Santa Maria Valley. It's a smooth sip at first, with ripe elderberry and black fruit, but the tannins stiffen quickly to reveal a masculine wine, with peppery spice, rounded vanilla and a strong acidic slice cutting through the density.",94,Barbieri 2014 Colson Canyon Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"This is a ripe and smoothly textured wine. It is already finely balanced, rich with toast, apricot fruits and a tight, mineral character. It is enjoyable now but will age well until 2022.",91,Domaine Sangouard-Guyot 2012 Quintessence  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
Penon Pinot Bianco is a fragrant and intense white wine with aromas of stone fruit and white rose splashed over a dense and creamy mouthfeel. This beautiful white wine would match northern Italian dishes such as paper-thin lasagna with a poppy seed cream filler.,90,Nals Margreid 2009 Penon Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
"This dark, concentrated number is new from the García family, known for the wines of San Román and Mauro. Like most reds from this clan, this is loaded with blackberry and toasty oak aromas. A massive, raw palate shows abrasive tannins. Oak-forward flavors of blackberry, cassis and coconut finish woody and powerful. Drink from 2018–2028.",93,Garmón 2014  Ribera del Duero
"Peach, yellow plum and underripe banana tones mark the nose. Banana makes an appearance again—in candied form—on the medium-bodied, almost oily palate. Sharp lemon citrus tones race on the finish.",84,Duchman Family 2014 Bingham Family Vineyard Vermentino (Texas)
"Still firmly tannic, the wine also promises rich black fruits. It has weight, a solid, firm structure and good balancing acidity. Complex and powerful, it's only spoiled by the show of pepper from the alcohol. Drink from 2016.",88,Château Brulescaille 2010  Côtes de Bourg
"Solid and dry, this is a tightly structured wine. Layered acidity and berry fruits lend a powerful, concentrated feel. It does need time to bring out its inherent fruitiness. Drink from 2015.",87,Château de Ricaud 2011 Grand Vin  (Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux)
"Red in color, and definitely smelling and tasting like Malbec. And while you want to like it more, there are some glaring flaws here, namely a weak bead that turns it flat. Furthermore, there's rhubarby sourness at the core. Has its moments but needs more work.",84,Reginato 2007 Celestina Rosé of Malbec Sparkling (Mendoza)
"Average red juice with sweet, rubbery aromas and flavors that match. It's Malbec in its most simple state: raspberry and cherry distilled into a quaffable liquid. Chilling might help.",83,Trapiche 2006 Malbec (Mendoza)
"A wine that smells so fruity, and with a soft, open texture, needs to be drunk young. This wine is all red berries coupled with acidity and some smoky tannins. It's a great idea to chill it slightly.",86,Domaine Rotier 2014 Esquisse Red (Gaillac)
"This wine has that wonderful but hard-to-pin-down Zinfandel essence that's extremely fruity but also uniquely spicy and brambly. It blends together ripe raspberry, creamy vanilla and red cherry on a smooth, nicely viscous and very full-bodied frame that helps the finish linger.",90,Wood Family Vineyards 2014 Big Wood Zin Zinfandel (Livermore Valley)
"A Bordeaux blend with all the usual suspects (except Malbec), Six Sigma's Cuvee has a huge Cabernet Sauvignon nose, all dark berry and plum with a hint of lavender. It has a huge brick wall of structure, with dusty tannins that finish long and meaty, and a slight blip of just-ripe blackberry.",88,Six Sigma Ranch 2008 Cuvée Red (Lake County)
"Hearty in toasty vanilla, this softly textured Primitivo has a wealth of blackberry fruit and weighty texture that veers dangerously close to overpowering before pulling back and finding its balance. The finish keeps you coming back for more.",88,Borjón 2010 Clockspring Vineyard Primitivo (Shenandoah Valley (CA))
"Pretty citrus tones are backed by white peach and soapy floral notes to produce a clean, fresh sparkler that is easy and approachable. The wine is beautifully crisp with smooth citrus flavors that leave a lasting impression.",86,Cantina Produttori di Valdobbiadene 2006 Millesimato Val d'Oca Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
"This is the first vintage for this wine, made by Syncline's James Mantone. A delectable blend of 48% Mourvèdre, 28% Grenache and 24% Syrah, aged in 100% neutral oak barrels, this is a sappy, concentrated, mouth-pleasing blast of plum, cherry and spice. As it rolls across the palate, the distinct impression is of chocolate-covered cherries.",93,Force Majeure 2009 Collaboration Series VI Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red (Red Mountain)
"A Bordeaux-style blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this is rich, rounded and full of fruit and balanced tannins. It has weight, although that is lifted by juicy acidity. This wine has completed its aging and it is ready to drink.",90,Château Thuerry 2009 L'Exception Red (Coteaux de Verdon)
"Made using techniques employed in crafting Pinot Noir, this wine has 5% Viognier blended in. It conveys a rustic sense of leather and black pepper, with waves of high-toned cherry, plum and brooding blueberry that combine in flavor. Its concentrated structure is lifted by a lilt of acidity on the finish.",90,Trione 2010 River Road Ranch Syrah (Russian River Valley)
"Made with organically farmed Nero d'Avola, this opens with aromas of toast, oak-driven spice and blackcurrant. The palate offers up prune, anise, oak extract and coffee alongside drying, fleeting tannins.",86,Masseria del Feudo 2012 Rosso delle Rose Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"Notes of ripe, almost overripe, pears make this a juicy, rounded and easy wine. There is something pliable and soft about this, all beautifully hemmed in with slightly pithy midpalate notes.",88,Boeckel 2015 Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"This village wine comes from a parcel of low-yielding 70-year-old vines. It is firm and concentrated with a strong layer of tannins over black fruits. Blackberry and black plum are balanced by the acidity. Together with the tannins, they promise aging. Drink from 2018.",91,Maison Stéphane Brocard 2014 Château d'Antigny La Rue du Port  (Pommard)
"Light fruit flavors of watermelon and strawberry, along with some thin black cherry and cola flavors are what you'll find here. This is pleasant and drinkable, but not a wine to cellar or match with any really spicy foods. A good quaffer.",85,Sweet Valley 2008 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Noà is a successful blend of Nero d'Avola, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon that offers rich and creamy aromas of blackberry jam, spice, leather and dark cola. The wine is firm and dense, with lasting berry flavors.",91,Cusumano 2007 Noà Red (Sicilia)
"Exotic fruit aromas and concentrated fruit flavors make this full-bodied wine an attention grabber at first sip. They hold the attention through a fine-grained mouthfeel and lingering finish. A focused core of black-currant flavor runs from first whiff to last impression. It needs time, so drink after 2017.",94,Spell 2012 Alder Springs Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino County)
"A heavy chaparral element consumes the nose of this wine, with sagebrush, eucalyptus, pencil lead and just a touch of elderberry fruit. The palate is all about tart cranberries and sour cherries, with a bit of graphite minerality holding it together. It's a brisk and earthy sipper.",88,Santa Barbara Winery 2013 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Aromas of grapefruit, lemon zest and white peach lead the way to flavors of apple and peach. There's a nice level of minerality and a crisp finish.",88,Toreta 2015 Premium Posip (Korčula)
"Currently, this Syrah has tough tannins that seem stringy and chewy. But the blackberry, black currant and dark chocolate flavors are plentiful. Cellar this for one or two years.",87,db Winery 2010 Larner Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"This Chiles Valley producer, on the eastern edge of the Napa Valley, has made a big Chardonnay that doesn't exude much aromatically at first and veers sweet, but is otherwise balanced and could develop some interesting minerality over time.",87,RustRidge 2008 Estate Chardonnay (Chiles Valley)
"Stone-fruit aromas of peach and nectarine include a hint of gardenia and bath soap, which is likely attributable to the 40% Muscat that leads Viura, Chardonnay and Verdejo. With a grabby oily texture and flavors of green melon and lychee, this is pleasant and easy to sip.",87,Vicente Gandia 2015 Hoya de Cadenas Night Harvest White (Valencia)
"Blended with small amounts of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, this lovely, earthy and herbal wine is lightly spiced with clove and pepper notes. Fresh with forest-like scents, it hails from Coombsville beneath Mount George.",91,Silver Stag 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"As rich as this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend is, and it is extraordinarily rich, there's something standard about it. It's as though the ripeness of the fruit has obliterated any trace of terroir. Offers a fantastically sweet explosion of blackberries, cherries, plums and chocolate, alongside caramelized, butterscotchy oak, but beyond the sheer power, the wine isn't displaying much subtlety. Hard to tell where it's going, if anywhere.",89,Frank Family 2010 Winston Hill Red (Rutherford)
"Maduro cigar and cherry brandy aromas power the nose on this heavily extracted, single-vineyard Sangiovese that Dave Corey makes under his Turchi label. Nothing like Chianti, aside from the decent tannins and acidity, this is all prune and plum soda on the palate. Serve with herb-crusted steak.",89,Turchi 2010 Hallauer Vineyard Sangiovese (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Red-currant jelly aromas and a floral character are followed by a soft-textured, caramel-flavored wine. It has a ripe feel, that's gentle and rather too easy.",86,Quinta do Portal 2011 Vintage  (Port)
"Expensive, but a perfect Pinot Noir to drink now for sheer luxury and decadence. Tastes so good, offering a tapestry of raspberry, cherry, licorice, mocha and sweet, smoky sandalwood. With finely ground tannins and near-perfect coastal acidity, it's addictively likeable. Now–2012.",93,MacPhail 2007 Sangiacomo Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Scratchy, minty aromas are the opening on this rough and rugged blend of Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon. In the mouth, this is hard as nails, with extreme tannic bite. Flavors of blackberry and chocolate are ripe and satisfying, while resiny oak, baking spice notes and rough tannnins define the finish.",87,Tinedo 2009 Cala N. 2 Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"Give this Syrah a few hours of decanting and drink it now. It's dry, full bodied and dense in blackberry, blueberry, bacon, pepper and oak flavors. Shows real elegance and class, but not an ager.",87,Broadway Vineyards 2009 Estate Grown Syrah (Carneros)
"Subdued aromas of red berry and rhubarb take shape in the glass. The reserved palate offers up crushed cherry, green tea and a hint of vanilla alongside fresh acidity and slightly astringent tannins.",88,Castelfeder 2012 Glener Pinot Nero (Alto Adige)
"Tannic, alcoholic nose, with a softer, rosier color tending toward brick. Old vines, soft, sweet, ancient flavors. The wine feels a little bit pushed — the alcohol is too high, and the finish is harsh, tannic and hot.",86,Edmeades 1998 Zeni Zinfandel (Mendocino Ridge)
"The powerful blend is as big as ever in this vintage, combining Zinfandel with Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah, Syrah and Charbono. The grapes are sourced from some of Napa Valley's finest sites, including Tofanelli Vineyard in Calistoga. It's expressive and expansive in tobacco and tar, thick and rich, with a finish of bittersweet chocolate.",87,The Prisoner 2013 Red (Napa Valley)
"An outstanding wine, the best California Cabernet Jean-Charles Boisset has ever produced from any of his properties. It stands out in any tasting of its peers. Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, and aged in 60% new oak, it shows satisfying, complex flavors of blackberries, blueberries, cassis, hazelnut-infused chocolate and spices. Hard to exaggerate its power and grace. Wonderful now and for a good six years, but it's difficult to predict its evolution beyond 2018.",97,JCB 2009 No. 1 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"The weather-wracked vintage of 2011 affected this sometimes stunning bottling, presenting bell pepper greenness with a hint of black earth. It's thin on the palate, which leans toward the greener side of the Cab spectrum, but remains very drinkable with cherry cola and mocha flavors.",85,Lucas & Lewellen 2011 Cote del Sol Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Barbara County)
"This opens with subtle aromas of dark berry, tobacco and exotic spice. The vibrant palate is more expressive, delivering a core of juicy black cherry accented by notes of raspberry, white pepper, vanilla, licorice and savory herb. This finessed wine is still young, but structured with tightly knit, yet fine-grained tannins. Drink 2016–2025.",94,Marchesi Antinori 2010 Badia a Passignano Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico)
"Earthy aromas of cola, coffee and saucy plum lead to a palate that at first seems loud and acidic but which comes around. Plum and berry flavors are accented by oaky vanilla and citrus peel, while this is bright on the finish due to lasting acidity. Drink through 2023.",90,Bodegas Franco-Españolas 2007 Rioja Bordón Gran Reserva  (Rioja)
"This wine has a glorious floral nose highlighted in honey and wildflowers, revealing richer gingerbread and toasted oak undertones as it opens. Its creamy texture provides a sense of unctuousness, complemented by tart green apple and lemon on the finish.",91,Duckhorn 2013 Toyon Vineyard Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Run, don't walk, to find this amazingly priced Cabernet. It's so good and rich, it easily holds its own against Cabs costing five times as much. Dry and smooth in tannins, it offers a burst of blackberry, black cherry, cassis and chocolate flavors, with a wonderful coating of oak. Drink now–2013.",93,Kirkland Signature 2008 Signature Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This is a perfect wine for outdoor receptions or apéritif time. This pale pink sparkler is refreshing and clean, with pretty berry and floral nuances, backed by a creamy mouthfeel and bright acidity. All these qualities make it perfect for pairing with a wide array of finger foods.",88,Vigne Regali 2007 Cuvée Aurora Rosé Sparkling (Alta Langa)
"Elegant and vibrant, this luminous Prosecco from the celebrated Cartizze cru offers aromas of white flower, talc powder and stone fruit. Persistent bubbling is offset by sweet peach flavors.",88,Bellussi NV Belcanto Cartizze  (Valdobbiadene Superiore di Cartizze)
"Herbal peppercorn gives this wine an edge on the nose that speaks to grapes that were picked not overripe. The palate offers thick, smoky oak and perceptible sandalwood and cedar. On the finish is more of that herbal greenness. The wine is blended with tiny amounts of Malbec and Petit Verdot.",86,Krutz 2011 Magnolia Series Stagecoach Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Soft notes of green bell pepper, nettle and grass give this a fresh aspect. The slender palate then adds lemon, giving a focused zestiness, with glimpses of boxwood. The wine is citric, slender and very refreshing.",90,Pratsch 2016 Ried Kittel Sauvignon Blanc (Niederösterreich)
"Smoke and flintstones play among green pear and savory yeast notes. The palate reveals a yeasty, cushioned texture, framed by grapefruit zestiness. The finish is clean-cut but persistent and is set to evolve over the years.",92,Bründlmayer 2013 Käferberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"Good and spicy, this well-structured effort shows some lightly ripened flavors of rhubarb, raspberry and hard cherry candy. A streak of jalapeño pepper runs alongside, delivering impressive definition and length for the price.",88,Joleté 2014 Cuvée Select Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Named after an 18th-century French admiral, this wine is made by the Gilardi family. It's a ripe, dry and sustaining wine that has ripe spice and pepper, fresh red fruits and a keenly refreshing aftertaste. It is ready to drink.",86,Bailli de Provence 2014 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Balanced and harmonious, Marabino's pretty Sicilian Chardonnay delivers stone fruit, jasmine, peach blossom and lingering tones of exotic fruit that give the wine length and persistency. The mouthfeel is lean and fresh and would pair with most seafood-based dishes.",87,Marabino 2007 Èureka Chardonnay (Sicilia)
"Sunbaked earth, ripe berry, baking spice and a whiff of menthol meld in the glass. The juicy palate offers red cherry, pomegranate, star anise, mocha and a hint of tobacco alongside fine-grained tannins.",90,Banfi 2011 Poggio alle Mura  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Winemaker: Louis Strydom. This Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant blend, with 30% Shiraz and 10% Merlot, opens with a lovely mélange of just-ripe aromas of blackberry, cassis and black plum, laced with notes of licorice, blackcurrant leaf and toasted whole spice. The mouthfeel is robust and full, with assertive tannins that lend a firm structure and perfectly frame the ripe black-fruit flavors. Flavors of plum skin, wood spice and bittersweet cocoa hang on endlessly to the finish. It's delicious now, but still a baby, with plenty of maturing and evolution ahead; try after 2020 and through 2026.",92,Ernie Els 2014 Cape Winemakers Guild CWG Red (Stellenbosch)
"Very much done in a mineral-driven Chablis style, this interesting bottling shows a tremendous amount of flint, crushed rock and struck match on the nose, alongside dried apple and yellow-grapefruit skin. Briny oyster shells and sandstone combine with a touch of smoke on the palate. Serve with shellfish.",90,Cooper-Garrod 2013 Gravel Ridge Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Red fruit aromas are a bit rough and scalped in front of a chunky palate. Charred, burnt, oaky flavors of raspberry and cassis stress ripeness and weight before finishing with buttery oak, a slightly greasy feel and roasted berry flavors. Drink through 2020.",90,Lecco 2009 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)
"A touch of black cherry with the faintest lick of licorice appears on the nose. The palate is equally reticent but incredibly juicy. Black-cherry notes billow and swell on the fluid body. This wine is fresh, firm and toned, brightened by acidity that adds elegance. A cool and profound red, it draws you in with its inherent freshness.",93,Jalits 2014 Steinberg Red (Burgenland)
"Fresh and bright, this is a light, fruity and easy rosé. It is aromatic, soft and ready to drink. Screwcap.",85,Henri Bourgeois 2011 Petit Bourgeois Rosé (Val de Loire)
"This may be a little sweet, hot and heavy, but it has such rich flavors of berry, currant, spice and mocha that it's easy to drink with ribs, chicken, burgers or vegetarian lasagna.",86,Roadhouse Winery 2010 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"You'll find all the pleasing aromas that you normally associate with a no-fuss Chardonnay such as apricot, honey and white stone in this wine. This is an easy, quaffable wine that lacks great depth but that would pair well with light, casual meals.",86,La Vis 2006 Dipinti Chardonnay (Trentino)
"The nose delivers a mix of herbal berry, cola and earth, while the palate is fresh and deep, with lightly medicinal cherry, cola, blackberry tobacco, mocha and more. Finishes rich and chocolaty, with a rush of textbook Chilean flavors including tobacco, herbs, olive and black fruits.",91,Antiyal 2007 Red (Maipo Valley)
"Funky aromas of barnyard, burnt tire rubber and game lead the nose and follow through to the bitter palate along with overripe plums and a note of almond skin. Dusty, almost gritty tannins give it an abrasive but fleeting close.",82,Caparra & Siciliani 2012 Volvito Rosso  (Cirò Classico)
"This big, strong Cabernet insists on pushing its blackberry, currant, plum and cocoa flavors across the palate. It's not subtle, and doesn't apologize for it. The grapes are from various vineyards in St. Helena, a warmer part of Napa Valley, and you can taste the incredible ripeness as well as the softness of tannins and acids that make drinking it so pretty now.",92,Anomaly 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
Here's a straightforward and fruity Nero d'Avola that offers delicious blackberry and black cherry flavors that are accented by a hint of Mediterranean herbs. The ripe palate is brightened by just enough fresh acidity.,88,Morgante 2012 Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"An attractive orange-pink wine, this offers ripe red berry and currant fruits. It is full in the mouth with a touch of tannin and bitterness from the recent bottling. It is tight at the end, crisp and needing some bottle age. Drink after 2015.",87,Charles Ellner NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne)
"Grapefruit zest dominates this wine right now, but ripe honeydew melon also is shining though. As the wine opens up, it also reveals peppery, tangy spice and a refreshingly clean finish.",93,Gruber Röschitz 2012 Hundspoint Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel)
"Jammy blackberry and blueberry flavors highlight this 100% Cab, along with plenty of sweet new oak. The tannins are bold, but ultra-refined. High alcohol lends some heat as well as a glycerine feel. It's an unctuous, delicious wine, although slightly overripe.",88,Louis M. Martini 2010 Lot. No. 1 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Wood-dominated wine, very structured. It is spicy, firmly dry, with juicy black currant fruit behind the wood. Give a year or two for the wood to soften out and the fruit to come forward.",87,Château Lacombe Noaillac 2009 Les Traverses la Franque  (Médoc)
"A Chardonnay-based sparkler, this rich and concentrated wine has a luscious mix of apricot, peach and papaya fruit flavors in a creamy, textural setting. Exceptional length and development in the glass, which keeps bringing in nuances such as vanilla and pepper.",90,Treveri Cellars NV Brut Sparkling (Columbia Valley (WA))
"White rose, tangerine skin and honey open the bouquet of this beautiful cool-climate Pinot Bianco. Its structure is firm and creamy enough to pair with Pacific seafood or grilled shrimp.",88,Fondazione Edmund Mach 2010 Istituto Agrario San Michele all'Adige Pinot Bianco (Trentino)
"Here's a lusty, full-throttle wine that's marked by strong flavors of black pepper, blackstrap molasses, blackberry jam and creamy dark chocolate. High alcohol gives it a touch of heat and glyceriney sweetness.",87,Collier Falls 2009 Primitivo (Dry Creek Valley)
"A plucky nose of fruitcake and spice leads off. On the palate, good, robust red fruit, a solid, dry and minerally backbone and a touch of oak offer dimension and balance. A bit rough and ready, the wine will benefit from pairing with grilled meats or spicy dishes that can match its energy.",83,Casa Rondeña Winery 2006 Calvin Clarion Red (New Mexico)
"Smells perky, prickly and tart, with sharp plum and raspberry aromas. Feels citrusy and pithy, with a cutting mouthfeel, and snappy flavors of berry and red plum. Tastes rubbery and slightly bitter on the finish.",82,François Lurton 2011 Hacienda Araucano Reserva Pinot Noir (Central Valley)
"Within a statement-sized bottle, this heavy, lush and aromatic Pinot Noir from a great vineyard could ignite debates about California Pinot styles. Aged about a year in all French oak, 65% of it new, it reveals an expanse of dark cherry fruit, velvety texture and plenty of structure amidst a leathery core and lengthy finish.",90,Guarachi Family 2012 Gap's Crown Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Dark to the eye, with bacon, ham, spice and savory fruit aromas. The palate is extracted and grating in feel, with dark berry, herb, pepper, smoke and barrel resin flavors. Spicy on the finish, with a blast of clove and cardamom. Very good but not as filled out as in prior years.",89,García Figuero 2008 Tinto Figuero 12 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"Shannon Ridge is quietly becoming the king of Lake County, offering wines of both quality and value and this is no exception. This blend is made of Zinfandel, Syrah, Petite Sirah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Mourvèdre. The kitchen-sink approach doesn't muddle the wine in any way; it remains a smooth, fruity, ripe quaff, with a kick of vanilla on the finish.",87,"Shannon Ridge 2010 High Elevation Collection, Wrangler Red Red (Lake County)"
"Tasting higher in alcohol than listed, this is a soft, somewhat jammy, simple wine. It offers raspberry preserves and chocolate around generous oak and sweet tannins.",86,Angelo Cellars 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
Reserved aromas of kiwi and banana lead to dry lightly styled grapefruit flavors. The concentration doesn't seem all there.,85,14 Hands 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Washington)
"A blend of 48% Chenin Blanc, 41% Chardonnay and 11% Viognier, this is an interesting white with slightly oxidized but rich notes of honeycomb, toasted hazelnut and baked apple thoughout. Medium weight with a touch of heat coming through on the long finish.",86,Lammershoek 2008 Roulette Blanc White (Swartland)
"This wine is smooth and refreshing, showing fresh raspberry and strawberry flavors and a texture that's mouthfilling but nicely crisp. It's quite fruity and light, especially considering the bold grape variety from which it is made.",87,Concannon 2016 Rosé of Petite Sirah (Livermore Valley)
"Scratchy aromas of red-berry jam are floral and lightly perfumed. This is spongy and dense in feel, with good focus. Deep berry and chocolate flavors take on a molasses note in front of a chocolate and fig finish. Drink through 2018.",90,Bodegas San Isidro 2010 Gémina Cuvée Monastrell (Jumilla)
"This basic Verdejo from Rueda offers minerally apple and citrus aromas in front of a zesty, citric palate. Flavors of orange and nectarine are nice but entirely regular, while the finish is crisp and chalky.",86,Nebla 2012 Verdejo (Rueda)
"Reddish in color, with raspberry and other high-toned aromas. The palate is fleshy but clean, with good acidity pushing slightly sweet cherry and raspberry flavors. Finishes with sugar and a good mouthfeel. Gets the job done.",85,Ilurce 2008 Rosado Rosé (Rioja)
"With Lodi fruit dominating the blend, this Cabernet is soft, sweet and simple. It has blackberry and cherry flavors.",82,Echelon 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Fermented and aged in neutral oak, this combines Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Syrah, Petit Verdot and Malbec. Nutty in aroma, it reveals flavors of cherry, raspberry and vanilla within a moderate body and gravelly texture. It's best enjoyed cold.",88,Des Amis 2016 Rosé (Napa Valley)
"This enormously rich, extracted Pinot Noir will please flavor-forward fans. It's explosive in raspberries, cherries, cola, figs, bacon, orange zest and other umami tastes, wrapped into a silky texture and brightened with crisp acidity. Seems best now and for a year or two.",89,La Fenêtre 2008 Los Alamos Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
"Run, don't walk, to buy this wonderful Merlot by the case. An unbelievable buy from Goldschmidt Vineyards, which is doing some of the most interesting things in Sonoma Bordeaux wines, it's a soft, ripe, complex wine that shows the balance and structure of a far more expensive bottling. Brims with briary cherry, blackberry, chocolate, cedar and spice flavors that were born for charbroiled steak.",90,Chelsea Goldschmidt 2006 Merlot (Dry Creek Valley)
"Falcor's previous Sangioveses both seemed underripe. This one's just the opposite, a soft, jammy wine with sweetened cherry and raspberry candy flavors.",83,Falcor 2004 Sangiovese (Napa Valley)
"Aromas of peach blossom, red berry and sunbaked earth waft out of the glass. The luminous fruity palate doles out juicy raspberry, red cherry and a hint of Mediterranean herb while a white almond note gives it a pleasantly bitter close.",88,Marulli 2016 Tenuta Paraida Rosato (Copertino)
"Ample aromas of dark berry, pipe tobacco, pressed violet and a balsamic note come together on this single-vineyard selection. On the structured palate, an energizing mineral vein wraps around mature black cherry, licorice, cinnamon and dried herb while a hint of game adds depth. This has years ahead of it. Drink 2018–2027.",93,Nervi 2009 Valferana  (Gattinara)
"Dusty aromas of yellow apple and cream soda are creamier than the palate, which is tangy, lemony and green. This tastes of briny citrus and green apple, while tangerine, lime and green-herb flavors define the finish.",88,El Xamfrà 2011 Brut Sparkling (Cava)
"You might not know it from the name, but this is a bit of a critter wine, as Bulldozer is a nickname for the hairy-nosed wombat. In any event, it's a step up from much of the competition, offering sturdy cassis flavors tinged with pepper and herbs and a clean, mouthwatering finish. Imported by MHW, Ltd.",86,Nelwood Wines 2004 Nelwood Station Bulldozer Red (South Australia)
"A majority varietal, this wine also holds small amounts of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Syrah. These combine well with one another to exude notes of licorice, plum and black cherry. Right now, it ends with sprinklings of dried herb. Dense and tannic, it will soften with time, through 2020.",91,Peju 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"With its restrained fruit, this wine is more food accompaniment than stand-alone quaff. The smoky, weedy aromas and flavors positively demand a juicy burger to bring out the underlying cassis and tobacco. —J.C.",84,Jacob's Creek 1999 Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)
"This tasty and full-bodied blend of Rhône varieties has an attractive, spicy, oak aroma that continues through the flavors. It finds ripe black-cherry notes in the core and enough concentration to form a lingering finish.",87,Dante Robere 2013 Dante's Inferno Red (California)
The initial wood flavors in this wine rapidly give way to rich fruit. Spice and black-plum flavors are built by a firmly tannic superstructure. The aftertaste brings out the acidity. This wine should develop well over the long term. Drink from 2023.,94,Château Phélan-Ségur 2014  Saint-Estèphe
"Supple pink papaya, underripe tangerine and bubblegum scents make for an intriguing combination on the nose of this bottling. The palate is tightly woven and full of citrus-driven acidity, with waves of light red fruit that ripple through the midpalate.",88,Demetria 2016 Rosé (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Stash this one in the cellar unil 2019 or 2020. Tasted in January 2014, it's tannic, tart in acidity and enormously rich in red cherry jam, pomegranate and persimmon fruit flavors, enriched with sweet, smoky oak. A real beauty from this well-respected vineyard.",92,Loring Wine Company 2012 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"This Viognier, Marsanne and Roussanne blend is the poster child for overoaked white wine. Buttered toast, butterscotch and caramel dominate the underlying tropical fruit, orange and lime flavors. Exceptionally high alcohol also adds to the impression of unbalanced sweetness.",84,Summerwood 2011 Diosa Blanc White (Paso Robles)
"While the nose is subdued, the palate brings out yellow apple peel and rounded, mellow spice, spiked with pure lemony freshness. Tingling pepperiness around the edges makes this pure apple-lemon combo so moreish. This is authentic, pure and has a lasting, clean finish.",92,Boeckel 2014 Clos Eugénie Riesling (Alsace)
"Gaseous berry aromas settle on pepper, oregano and earth tones. It feels tight, full and potent, with herbal, peppery flavors of black fruit and licorice. This turns more meaty and pumped up as it unfolds—much more rugged than refined.",85,Marqués de Valdueza 2007 Gran Vino de Guarda Red (Extremadura)
"Bright aromas of vanilla, toast and wood spice lead to a full-bodied, rich palate. The style gets out in front of the fruit but there's still much to enjoy.",88,Ryan Patrick 2014 Reserve Bacchus Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A delicate but earthy nose shows aromas of hibiscus, pencil lead, sagebrush and bay leaf. The palate packs a bright vibrancy, showing flavors of tart cranberry, crushed black pepper, clove, more sagebrush and juniper. This is action-packed but lightly framed.",90,Darcie Kent Vineyards 2012 Pinot Noir (Monterey)
"Here's a quality Merlot offered at a very reasonable low price. Sant'Adele is rich, succulent and smooth with bursting aromas of cherry, blueberry, spice and moist tobacco. Pair this wine with homemade roast chicken and garlic potatoes.",88,Villa Pillo 2008 Sant'Adele Merlot (Toscana)
"This blend of undisclosed varieties is a charming red wine to drink now. It's dry, smooth and ripe in blackberry, cherry, currant and spice flavors. Beef is its natural partner.",85,Buena Vista 2011 The Count Founder's Red (Sonoma County)
"This shows flavors of honey, tropical fruit, vanilla and smoky oak that are wrapped into a creamy texture. It will satisfy your basic Chardonnay needs.",85,Joanne Weir 2010 Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley)
"This dry, single-vineyard bottling is extremely aromatic, as only Gewürztraminer can be. The ripe lychee and grapefruit is subsumed in a cloud of baby powder. It's quite dry, and for those that want a supremely floral varietal expression of this grape, this is your go-to bottle.",91,Lumos 2014 Temperance Hill Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Oregon)
Pinot Bianco from the Collio region of northeast Italy generally tends to deliver firm structure and texture. This wine is an excellent example of the variety because it balances density and heat versus elegance of aromas. Pair it with Thai or Chinese chicken dishes.,87,Villa Russiz 2007 Pinot Bianco (Collio)
"Savory notes of fennel and exotic spice add a dose of complexity to the sweet apple and pear flavors of this dry Riesling. Crisp, clean and refreshing, it finishes with a delicate green-floral note.",88,Rooster Hill 2010 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"A blend that includes Grand Cru vineyards gives a ripe, full-throated Chardonnay. While there is crispness and the freshest apple juiciness, this wine is also rounded, generous and with a hint of maturity in its toasty edge. It is ready to drink.",90,Lancelot-Pienne NV Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)
"Grapes are sourced from both Stagecoach and Hyde vineyards in this wine that takes its time in the glass coming around. Funky brine and a tropical flourish open on the nose with a severity of oak that mellows slowly. Made in an opulent, full-bodied style, it'll pair well with buttery fare.",90,Patland 2013 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Made with Sangiovese and 5% Canaiolo, this medium-bodied red initially opens with rather funky aromas that eventually burn off in the glass to reveal dark berry, tilled soil and a whiff of baking spice. The ripe palate offers juicy wild cherry, ground pepper, dried aromatic herb and an earthy note of game alongside smooth tannins.",89,Castellare di Castellina 2012 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"Warm, rubbery berry aromas mixed with smoked meat and herbal accents make for a solid nose, and while the palate has clampy acidity and herbal notes, there's ample body, roundness and berry fruit to bring it home. Both leafy and candied on the finish.",87,Montes 2007 Alpha Merlot (Colchagua Valley)
"By “Old Vine Cabernet” the winery refers to vines that were planted in 1973. But somehow the fruit doesn't express old-vine character. Instead, it's a mix of sweet-tasting strawberry and bitter stem flavors that lack focus, with a peppery highlight.",86,Upland Estates 2009 Old Vine Cabernet Cabernet Sauvignon (Snipes Mountain)
"The aromas of red currant, raspberry and cranberry are quite ripe, with cedar notes providing an accent. The palate is high octane with the fruit not quite having the intensity to match.",89,K Vintners 2012 Northridge Vineyard Merlot (Wahluke Slope)
"Attractive white Bordeaux blend, much better than the red from the same estate. It has a delicious ripe fruit character with pineapple, lime and kiwi flavors and final acidity.",88,Château Grand Jean 2010  Bordeaux Blanc
"Blackberry and dark plum aromas are solid but not overly rich or oaky. In the mouth, this Tempranillo is juicy, flush and friendly in feel. Blackberry and plum flavors are big and loud, but also clean. Notes of licorice and herbs work their way onto a hard-driving finish.",88,Tineta Avante 2011  Ribera del Duero
"Initial tar and asphalt aromas yield to grapy berry and earth notes. It feels hard but not real deep, with a short wild-berry flavor that leads to a reasonably good but superficial finish. Juicy and fresh.",85,Callia 2011 Alta Shiraz (Tulum Valley)
"Although this wine has tannins, it's the fruit that shines, with its delicious black-currant flavor and acidity. It is more fine and elegant than it is powerful, a pleasant surprise from Saint-Estèphe in this vintage For medium-term aging.",93,Château les Ormes de Pez 2010  Saint-Estèphe
"Rubbery aromas and a pasty note are on equal footing with plum and cherry scents. This is choppy and mildly astringent in feel, with narrow plum and raspberry flavors that finish quick and with pinching tannins.",84,Vega Sindoa 2013 Merlot (Navarra)
"With wood aging and the rich flavors from lees stirring, this is a ripe wine, gently oxidative as well as full of yellow fruits. It is a broad wine, typical of the vintage, although happily with a crisper citrus aftertaste. Drink now.",88,Arnaud Baillot 2015  Bourgogne
"Hot, baked, rubbery aromas of black cherry and blackberry feed into a racy, pinched palate with astringent tannins. Herbal plum and berry flavors finish spicy and oaky, with a note of brown sugar. Drink through 2018.",88,Tres Palacios 2012 Cholqui Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"While this vineyard is close by the Russian River and is not considered the best of Rochioli's vineyards, winemaker Bob Cabral consistently makes its grapes into one of Williams Selyem's most compelling wines. This shows the impeccable tannins and acids of Rochioli fruit, with sweet, ripe, deep flavors of cherry and spice. Notes of pomegranate, rum punch, dark chocolate and smoky sandalwood add complexity. Beautiful to drink now, it should continue to develop for at least 10 years.",96,Williams Selyem 2010 Rochioli Riverblock Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This aromatic wine is delicious Pinot Noir. With fine ripe red fruits that are shot through with tannins for aging and crisp acidity for refreshing drinking, this is a rich wine that should be drunk now.",88,Domaine Michel Goubard 2015 Mont-Avril  (Côte Chalonnaise)
"A premier cru that could almost be grand cru in quality terms, this is a big, ripe wine, the powerful yellow and green plum flavors spiced with some wood aging. There's a great, full-bodied explosion of fruit in the mouth, but the mineral edge of the wine suggests aging potential, perhaps even more  ageable than the 2005 vintage.",92,La Chablisienne 2006 Vaulorent Premier Cru  (Chablis)
Herbal aromas of tomato leaf and thyme feed into a crisp raw palate. Leafy herbal flavors of tomato and dried green herbs finish with raw tannins that scratch. Think of this like you would basic Bordeaux.,85,Bossy Boots 2014 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maule Valley)
"Crisp lemon, green apple and riper stone-fruit aromas are hidden behind a slightly reductive and rubbery touch on the nose of this new brand from the Coquelicot team. Grassy flavors show on the sip alongside Anjou pear.",87,Rose & Son 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Barbara County)
Cinnamon and licorice gumdrop and sketchy cherry cough drop aromas make up the nose on this cloying Cab that also shows hard tannins. Baked berry and brown sugar flavors finish with little sizzle or balance.,83,Cascada Peak 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"A smooth, supple version of Zinfandel, this is full-bodied and rich but not overly showy or oaky. Blended from 90% Zinfandel plus Petite Sirah and Malbec, it has enticing wild blackberry aromas and flavors, touches of cinnamon and cedar and a lingering finish.",90,Ironstone 2012 Reserve Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi)
"This has a firmly tannic structure and juicy fruit, suggesting its aging potential. It is rich and ripe, with black cherry and plum flavors that create a generous finish.",88,Vignerons de Bel Air 2011 Domaine de la Source  (Chiroubles)
"This basic Tempranillo has many good things to offer. Although a touch heavy and oaky on the nose, it's generous and congruent. Initial flavors of raw wood and campfire settle down and are replaced by dark-berry fruit notes. On the finish, this is woody, with powerful berry and cherry notes in support.",86,Finca La Estacada 2015 6 Meses Barrica Tempranillo (Uclés)
"Produced from a selection of old vines, the wine is structured and dense. It has powerful tannins that are integrated with the dark black fruits and mineral acidity. This is a serious, concentrated wine, solid with its firm structure and with a good future. Drink from 2018.",93,Quinta Seara d'Ordens 2012 Reserva Vinhas Velhas Red (Douro)
"This crisp, clean, stainless-steel style of Chardonnay brings has mixed flavors of cucumber, celery, lime and light melon. It's fresh and immaculate—a wonderful sipper.",89,Six Prong 2010 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A candied, buttery aroma, ripe fruit flavors and full body characterize this wine. It seems to have a strong spicy influence that comes with firm tannins and an almost-sweet character.",86,Las Positas 2012 Estate Tempranillo (Livermore Valley)
"Pure blackberry aromas are dosed with spice, lemon peel and grit. This blend of Malbec and Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc is saturated and concentrated but still well balanced. Creamy, rich blackberry and chocolate flavors finish smooth, lusty and dark. This may not be overly complex but it tastes great and feels right; drink through 2022.",93,Riglos 2013 Gran Corte Red (Tupungato)
"The fruit is plenty ripe, offering rich flavors of blackberries and black currants, and the finish is thoroughly dry. The drawback with this Cab is its texture. It's rough and angular, suggesting unevenly ripe stems and seeds. Drink now.",84,R & B Cellars 2005 Reserve Bingham Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A sappy wild-berry aroma turns mulchy with airing. The palate feels sharp and puckery, with very high acidity that creates short, tart, ultrajuicy raspberry and red plum flavors.",81,Finca Antigua 2008 Crianza Red (La Mancha)
"This opens with prune, menthol, nail varnish and plastic aromas. The palate is tired and evolved, showing dried black cherry and fig flavors, with a hint of orange peel and worn tannins. It finishes short.",86,Punset 2012 Basarin Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"Despite some cherry and blackberry fruit, this is fairly simple and dull. It's soft and sweetly spicy.",81,McManis 2011 Syrah (California)
"Gritty earthy nutty aromas announce a slightly stale wine that comes up a little short in terms of purity of fruit and freshness. A good mouthfeel is a positive, while flavors of tomato, spice and gritty, roasted berry and plum finish toasty, peppery and burnt. Drink now.",89,Bodegas Valdemar 2008 Conde Valdemar Gran Reserva  (Rioja)
"A big, ripe wine, it shows richness from the superripe grapes. It is bold, full-bodied and packed with juicy black fruits. It's like a fruit bomb, but structure holds it together. Drink from 2015.",91,Herdade das Servas 2010 Reserva Petite Verdot (Alentejano)
"Light in color, aromas of vanilla, caramel, toast, char and wood spice lead to wood-forward fruit flavors backed by tart acids. The oak seems out of check but it still brings some appeal.",87,Castillo De Feliciana 2014 Rosebud Vineyard Red Wine Tempranillo (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This Brunello shows a pristine and bright bouquet that hinges on polished mineral nuances, like wet river stone, cherry cola, ripe blackberry, ginger and rum cake. The wine shows great evolution and complexity despite its young age and just enough fruity pulp to support the lively acidity.",90,Villa Poggio Salvi 2008  Brunello di Montalcino
"This bottling, from seven cool climate vineyards, makes a great intro into savory Syrah, showing all that peppery might without shoving it down the throat. Cracked peppercorn is redolent on the nose and palate, with the latter also showing raw lamb and beef char. The sip tends toward soy and leather, but with a core of dried blackberry fruit that's familiar to most palates. The texture is tightly woven.",93,Dragonette 2014 Seven Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Tight, dry and still astringent, this should evolve slowly over the next 10 years. It has a bright ruby color, and it opens with a compact berry note followed by elegant tones of spice and white truffle.",91,Bel Colle 2008  Barolo
"Teetering aromas of apple, oak and mineral don't hold much sway, while the palate is both chunky and oversized, sizzling with acid. A muddled flavor of white fruit leads to a finish where nothing sticks out.",83,Pantago 2010 Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"Stony lime aromas are lightly floral and appealing. This feels smooth and slightly round despite showing firm acidity. Nectarine and melon flavors end with lasting minerality and a stone-fruit character. As per usual, As Laxas doesn't disappoint.",91,As Laxas 2015 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"The nose gives little away except for a touch of reductive smoke. The palate then presents a streak of zesty freshness, a light ripple of lovely texture and shimmering nuances of white pepper, crushed chervil, salty soy and savory miso. All this comes on a very light body, finishing with a bright, friendly note of lemon.",91,Malat 2016 Ried Höhlgraben Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"Sweet and extra ripe, this pushes the peach and apricot fruit to a rich and focused center, and keeps the impact of new French oak at just 20%. Which is plenty, adding just enough sweet and toasty vanilla to the extended, rich finish.",92,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2012 Elton Chardonnay (Eola-Amity Hills)
"The nose on this SB is pure grass, bell pepper and hay. The palate is citric on one hand but still flat and wayward in feel, with globular green-fruit flavors and a bitter tasting finish.",81,Alto Los Romeros 2012 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Maule Valley)
"More restrained—and therefore more versatile with food—than many other Marlborough Sauvignon Blancs, this wine combines hints of cut grass with citrus on the nose.

"Aromas of mature apple and acacia carry through to the simple palate along with a hint of pineapple. It's fresh and informal, with bright acidity.",85,Piera Martellozzo NV Giade Extra Dry  (Prosecco)
"88-90 Acidity and fresh fruit are out of balance with smoky wood. The wine will need to integrate in the coming months, although all the elements are there.",89,Château Maucaillou 2010 Barrel sample  (Moulis-en-Médoc)
"Very dry, the fruit losing some freshness with the wood aging. However the structure is firm and dark. With the acidity, this could be a wine for aging over 1–2 years.",87,Quanta Terra 2008 Grande Reserva Tinto Red (Douro)
"This 100% Tempranillo was sourced from the Stonetree vineyard. It's soft on entry, with brambly red fruits, a wash of milk chocolate (from aging in 50% new oak) and a hint of leather.",87,Walla Faces 2012 Tempranillo (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Aromas of dark berry, fragrant blue flower, chopped herb and a whiff of baking spice float out of the glass. The lively enjoyable palate doles out juicy wild cherry, cranberry, thyme and a hint of anise alongside smooth, supple tannins and firm acidity.",90,Gianni Brunelli 2014  Rosso di Montalcino
"Opulently dense, this wine opens nicely in orange blossom and caramel apple, followed by a palate that's somewhat incomplete in fruit-flavor follow-up. Concentrated and full bodied, it packs a powerful punch, ending in oak.",86,Acacia 2013 Sangiacomo Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Yeasty aromas of bread dough, citrus and nut lead the nose on this 100% Chardonnay. The bright palate delivers yellow apple, tropical fruit and hazelnut alongside crisp acidity and small, persistent bubbles.",88,Ambo Secco NV Blanc de Blanc Brut Sparkling (Vino Spumante)
"The nose is a bit shy but eventually reveals underbrush, red berry and a toasted note. The straightforward palate is quite lean, offering raw sour cherry, a green note of powdered sage and a hint of ground pepper alongside raspy tannins that leave an astringent finish.",86,Il Grappolo 2012  Brunello di Montalcino
"Tight and tannic, this opens with aromas of Amaretto, ripe berry, Alpine herb and a balsamic note. The firm palate offers black cherry, licorice, white pepper and cherries marinated in spirits. Firm but refined tannins provide structure.",90,Dosio 2012 Serradenari  (Barolo)
"Ripe and juicy, this dense wine offers red-fruit flavors shot through with acidity. The old vines give depth to the rich wine that finishes with layers of bright fruit. Drink from 2018.",90,Château de Santenay 2014 Vieilles Vignes  (Mercurey)
"This is a real New Zealand-style Sauvignon Blanc. It's dry and tart, with rich gooseberry, lime, green apple, Asian pear, vanilla and white pepper flavors. A touch of oak brings a pleasant, buttery toastiness. The grapes come from the cool Arroyo Seco AVA and the warm San Lucas AVA, a brilliant blending decision that makes this wine especially balanced.",89,Morgan 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey)
"Plush black-currant aromas meet with light licorice and a plum-pudding note on the nose of this 70% Grenache, 28% Syrah, 1% Mourvèdre and 1% Viognier blend. It dries up tightly on the palate, showing blackberry alongside strong licorice and violet elements, all framed by a chalky structure.",94,Jada Vineyard & Winery 2014 WCS Jack John Red (Paso Robles Willow Creek District)
"This attractive and medium-bodied wine smells a bit like ginger cookies. It tastes nicely dry, fruity and well structured with tannins and acidity. Nutmeg and ginger notes add extra interest to black cherry and pomegranate flavors.",88,Alias 2013 Merlot (California)
"An interesting wine, not without problems. Pours intensely dark, and opens with aromas ranging from blackberries to  earth and white pepper. In the mouth, straddles the ripeness line, with deliciously fruity flavors kept in check by an herbal edge. A blend of Paso Robles, Edna Valley and Santa Ynez Valley.",90,Bridlewood 2000 Syrah (Central Coast)
"Tastes like the grapes got a little too ripe in the heat, resulting in a distinct raisiny taste that would be more appropriate to Port than a Cabernet Sauvignon. The alcohol is nearly 15% by volume. Hard to see this Cab aging well.",85,Trione 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Exemplary Gran Reserva Rioja blending modernity with the best traditions of this famed region. Perfumed, lush and complex to start, then vibrant in the mouth, with excellent integration of flavors, acidity and tannins. Tastes of fine tobacco, mulled blackberry, chocolate and dry spices. Proper as the textbook calls for but individual as well. Best from 2014–2018.",94,Muga 2004 Prado Enea Gran Reserva  (Rioja)
"Waxy aromas of baked apple and spices come in front of a full-bodied palate supported by citric acidity. Flavors of orange and nectarine are honeyed, while the finish starts out big then stumbles on the backside. Drink this Macabeo-led blend now.",87,Mas Blanch I Jové 2011 Saó Blanc Macabeo (Costers del Segre)
"A blend of mostly Grenache, with smaller amounts of Tempranillo and Syrah, this is smooth and polished, with dried fruit flavors. It bears a leaf note and a whiff of mint, with a muscular, tannic finish that adds complexity.",89,Thurston Wolfe 2010 The Spaniard Red (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Toasty and yeasty, this medium-full rosé opens with berry, rose and earth notes, and has full cherry-berry flavors with herb accents on the palate. Displays a good bead, and closes dry and long with berry flavors and appealing tarragon and ripe tomato notes.",89,Soutiran NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne)
"A ripe and spicy wine, this is structured with black-currant fruits and lively acidity. It is still very young: its exuberant fruitiness likely to calm as it matures. Give this ripe wine until 2019.",88,Château Haut le Valette 2015 Cuvée Caractères  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"A blend of local grapes with Syrah, this fruity wine enfolds a core of tannins. Stalky, smoky flavors balance with a red plum-skin texture and crisp acidity. It is young, the fruit still developing, so drink from 2017.",88,Union de Vignerons de l'Île de Beauté 2013 Domaine Vetriccie Red (Corse)

A fresh, comfortable finish solidifies this wine's value credentials.",88,Bodegas 1898 2008 Ramón Roqueta Crianza Cabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo (Catalunya)
"From a cool site near the town of Graton, this is a highly concentrated, slightly cloudy wine with strong Gravenstein apple and lemon-lime aromas. Wild anise flavors season the rich, bold palate, but the finish seems diluted.",86,Spell 2015 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"The first sniffs show plenty of toasty oak, with brambly, tart red fruits and a bit of stem in the tannins. This is a nicely textural Pinot, with hints of barnyard and compost woven around the solid cherry fruit. It feels a bit unresolved, with plenty of interesting components that need more cellar time to knit themselves together.",88,Le Cadeau 2005 Cote Est Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This perennial Best Buy is realiably tasty and easy to drink in 2012. A fleshy nose of peach and almond aromas sets up a simple, lighter-weight palate with peach flavors and an easygoing finish. This is short on acidity so drink sooner rather than later.",88,Condes de Albarei 2012 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Fresh and composed, with aromas of asparagus, mineral and citrus. The palate is mild and balanced, with green-infused flavors that hint at bell pepper, green apple and garden-fresh herbs. Slightly pithy and peppery on the tail end, but honest as Casablanca SBs go. Good for quaffing.",86,MontGras 2008 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"Deeply colored and lightly effervescent, this offers black-skinned fruit and dark spice aromas. The refreshing palate doles out blackberry and cassis flavors, with a note of bitter almond.",88,Cavicchioli 2016  Lambrusco Grasparossa di Castelvetro
"Taking off with a bright tangerine and lime nose, the citrus carries through to the palate, where grapefruit flavors take the varietal into curious yet compelling places. Acidity is at the forefront, thanks to the all-stainless-steel processing, but it feels strategically integrated.",91,Lucas & Lewellen 2012 Estate Vineyards Chardonnay (Santa Barbara)
"Aromas recall rose petal, dark berry and orange zest. The palate delivers mature blackberry, cocoa, mocha and a licorice note alongside firm, fine-grained tannins.",89,Valle dell'Acate 2011 Il Moro Red (Sicilia)
"While the wine does have some firm tannins, it also bears rich black fruits that envelop and cushion the dry core. They give the wine weight, ripe fruitiness and jammy red berry flavors. It would be worth aging until 2016, but can be drunk now.",86,Château Nozières 2012 Malbec-Merlot (Cahors)
"This is a broadly expansive wine in the mouth, but what it may lack in focus it makes up for in mouthwatering fruit intensity. Gooseberry and grapefruit lead the way, with just the right amount of herbal flourishes. Drink now.",89,Echo Bay 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Organic vineyards in the shadow of the Corton hill and the Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru provide the basis for this wine. It's ripe and full of apple and lime flavor, its minerality adding crisp texture. A touch of yellow fruit on the finish shows the richness of the vintage. Drink from 2018.",89,Domaine Laleure-Piot 2015  Pernand-Vergelesses
"Alessandro Locatelli represents the newest generation to carry forth the activities of this historic winery with roots spanning back to 1841. This wine is named after the estate's founder, Francesco Costamagna, and shows a very traditional and ethereal side to Nebbiolo. The aromas are feminine and delicate with small berries and shadings of sweet spice and herbs.",91,Rocche Costamagna 2005 Bricco Francesco  (Barolo)
"This wine has a gritty, broad quality that recalls overripe cherries, plums and dried currant berries. There's also a touch of milk chocolate or fudge and the wine ends on an astringent, bitter note.",85,Fattoria Scopone 2003  Brunello di Montalcino
"Fine and fresh, brightened by grapefruit, lemon zest and bright acidity, this is a delicious wine, ready for seafood, finishing so clean and crisp.",90,Gilles Morat 2008 La Roche  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
"Some will critique this Pinot as too big and bold, but it defines the ripe, exuberant California style. It's fabulously rich in berry fruit, mocha and spice flavors. Nothing shy about it, and not particularly subtle in its appeal, but it does show meticulous vineyard care and terroir. Its future evolution is unclear, but this delicious Pinot Noir is a natural partner to full-bodied lamb and beef dishes.",92,Notre Vin 2009 Clos Madeleine Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"A soft, fragrant nose of balsam, spice and cherry unfolds into integrated red berry and spice flavors on this poised red. Approachable yet elegant, the wine offers slight smoke and pepper on the palate which would pair it well with grilled or roasted meat.",85,Palivou 2004 Ammos Agiorgitiko (Nemea)
"Attractively ripe, this second wine from Château Léoville las Cases is initially fruity. The structure comes through only slowly to reveal itself.The wine is ripe yet shot through with acidity. Likely to develop quickly.",92,Château Léoville Las Cases 2010 Le Petit Lion  (Saint-Julien)

"This bright Refosco Riserva offers bitter notes of white cherry and cranberry followed by light spice and toasted nut. It's a lively, fresh red wine with a citrusy, crisp close. Pair it with chicken in creamy mushroom sauce and wild rice.",86,Bosco del Merlo 2005 Roggio dei Roveri Riserva Refosco (Lison-Pramaggiore)
"A restrained nose of Fuji apple does not reveal much about what is in the glass. This wine is a bit stiff on the palate, with floral and citrus flavors that never seem to completely come together on the taste buds.",84,Marani 2013 Kondoli Single Vineyard Rkatsiteli Rkatsiteli (Kakheti)
"Red apple, savory yeast and zesty lemon unite in this white field blend from lower Austria.

"Rich almonds, ripe peaches and a smoky, oxidized character all come together in this ripe, complex, fascinating wine. There is a great tang of apple acidity on the finish. Drink now.",92,Domaine Daniel Dugois 2006 Vin Jaune Savagnin (Arbois)
"A tough sell at this price. The nose is minty, green and smells of tobacco, spice and fern fronds, while the palate is tangy, clangy in feel and dry. Flavors of semisour, herbal cherry and plum are touched up by sweet oak, but overall it's rather dry and scouring.",84,Michel Torino 2005 Altimus Red (Cafayate)
"Intensely ripe on the nose and palate, with loads of sweet blackberries and cherries, this densely concentrated Merlot-based blend is an excellent offering from one of Long Island's best producers.

"Named for proprietor Marimar Torres' mother, the Doña Margarita Pinot is a study in cool-climate nuance and sophistication, elegant yet retaining plenty of stuffing. It is bright in wild strawberry and a decadent hint of kirsch—earthy, lithe and structured, with soft and silky tannins. On the finish is a touch of forest, as inviting as a walk in the woods.",93,Marimar Estate 2011 Doña Margarita Vineyard Mas Cavalls Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)

"So bone dry and acidic, the tastebuds start whistling at the first sip. Defines the racy personality of Sauvignon Blanc, with a palate-stimulating tang and lime, lemongrass and mineral flavors. The best Wattle Creek Sauvignon Blanc ever.",91,Wattle Creek 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Yorkville Highlands)
"This is hard in tannins and firm in acidity, which gives it fine structure. It's not shy in flavor, and it offers waves of blackberries, black currants and cassis liqueur, plus a note of toasty new oak. While it could develop well with age, the forward fruit suggests drinking it over the next five years.",89,Rock Wall 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)

"The warm climate of central Italy helps to develop this Viognier's ripe aromas of melon, honey and stone fruit. A glycerin-derived viscosity marks the finish.",87,Tenuta La Badiola 2011 Acquadoro Viognier (Maremma Toscana)
"Cool, earthy, rooty aromas of licorice, Graham cracker, cassis and blackberry are dark and brooding. This Malbec is loosely structured, with heavy extraction and blackened, gritty flavors of blackberry and toast. A dark, rubbery, blocky finish is giant like the rest of the wine. Drink through 2022.",92,Andeluna 2012 Pasionado Malbec (Tupungato)

"Fruity and floral on the nose, with plenty of sweet spice notes, balsam wood and depth.

"Along with the other top cuvées in the Charles Joguet range, this is a fine an expression of Loire Cabernet Franc. It has all the perfumes, smoky character and intense black currant fruits. all concentrated into a tight, coiled tannic structure. It shows every sign of aging well, so drink after four years.",92,Charles Joguet 2010 Clos du Chêne Vert  (Chinon)
"An amazing wine for less than $30, this bottling by veteran Winemaker Dan Lee starts with tightly wound aromas of dried yogurt, Meyer lemon peel, honeysuckle and Asian-pear flesh.

"Ultraripe black fruits—berries and cherries, along with raisins—reflect the high alcohol. Even so, the wine carries an impression of almost sugary sweetness, as if still not fermented completely dry. Spice cake and plum pudding, with heat on the finish, mark this as extreme by previous Fielding Hills standards. Drink soon.",88,Fielding Hills 2009 RiverBend Vineyard Syrah (Wahluke Slope)

Lovely blackberry flavors and black pepper make for a very balanced bottling that doesn't rely on bombastic power to tell the Syrah story.,92,Vie Winery 2011 White Hawk Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"Blossomy lemon-scented freshness streams from the glass. Underneath that, some crisp apple flavors appear. The same slender, refreshing and crisp notes pervade the dry palate which seems to be frothy and creamy at the same time.

"This is a lovely bottle from this Idaho producer with notes of hay, butter, spice and melon. It has a broad, creamy feel that lingers on the finish.",89,Periple 2011 French Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Washington)
"Austrians seem challenged to produce exotic blends. This wine with Riesling, Furmint and Sauvignon Blanc together, is an intriguing example. It is as rich, powerful and full-bodied. It is opulent in texture, and now mature.",88,Schandl 2006 Ruster Ausbruch White (Burgenland)
"This wine offers citrus—orange, grapefruit—and spice on the nose. On the palate, a sweeter array of apricot, tropical fruit and some lemon is buoyed by its minerality. A lusher style of Gewürtz that will pair well with spicy cuisine—think Indian curries.",88,Dr. Konstantin Frank 2007 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes)
"The nose is still closed: There is just a hint of dark fruit. The palate lightens with expressive and finely drawn fruit. There is pepper-tinged red cherry, fine notes of cranberry and red currant.

"Here's one for the cellar, not just because the tannins are so aggressive, but because the wine is so balanced. With alcohol only 13.8%, it's dry and rich in black currant fruit, almost a throwback to the Napa Cabernets of old that aged so well.

Made from 100% Cabernet grapes, it shows firm, plush flavors of blackberries and black currants, with a sour cherry candy tartness that's clean and piquant in the mouth.

Best 2012–2018.",95,Flora Springs 2007 Hillside Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"Fruity in black plum and ripe raspberry, it's structured and weighty on the palate, dark and brambly with firm, substantial tannins. The grapes come from both Rancho Carneros and the mighty Hyde Vineyard, both sites planted to relatively older vines, which show through in this wine's savory side.",90,Robert Mondavi 2012 Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"A curious wine. On the plus side is a tantalizingly tasty flavor, like fully-ripened raspberries and cherries crushed into a delicious nectar, then sprinkled with honey and white pepper.

"This wine heads the range of good value wines under the Monte Alentejano name. It has some weight and a tangy, structured character, and has not lost its black-plum flavors. Drink now.",88,DFJ Vinhos 2007 Monte Alentejano Reserva Red (Alentejano)
"Simple, sweet-tasting and slightly candied, this bouncy drink is best served slightly chilled. Think of it as an introduction to wine—something to explore after white Zinfandel. —J.C.",83,Rosemount 2001 Grenache-Shiraz Red (Australia)
"This lively Riesling offers aromas of citrus, apricot and honey, followed by layers of white fruit, spice and pepper. The wine has a slightly sweet fruity character but it's balanced by acid and minerals. A fun but impressive Riesling.",87,Fox Run 2007 Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"A wonderful follow-up to the debut vintage, this generous Chardonnay brings green apples, stone fruits and suggestions of pineapple, with a judicious use of new oak that refrains from becoming more than a pleasing nuance. Excellent balance, with a firm, lingering finish that brings in butterscotch and ripe, sweet lemon.",91,Olsen Estates 2007 Chardonnay (Yakima Valley)
"For years, Foxen has been producing one of the best Chenin Blancs in California, and with this 2009, they have outdone themselves. It's so rich in orange, honeydew and pineapple flavors, it might almost be Chardonnay, except it's drier and more minerally, and there's a wonderful note of dried herbs. Although production was only 575 cases, this wine is worth a special search, especially for sommeliers.",93,Foxen 2009 Ernesto Wickenden Vineyard Old Vines Chenin Blanc (Santa Maria Valley)
"An oaky aroma of buttered toast is elevated over ripe cherry and crushed black pepper. The palate shows more nuance, with tart red currant leading to juicy red fruit and granite dust. Slightly sandy tannins provide just enough grip to give this wine appropriate balance and structure.",87,Annefield Vineyards 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Virginia)
"Harsh and disjointed, this Pinot has a hot, prickly feeling. It tastes unevenly ripened, with minty flavors side by side with Lifesaver candy, raspberries and red currants.",83,Donum 2005 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This is a light wine, attractively fruity with peach and apricot flavors. Intense acidity gives a fine kick to the texture, while also showing a dry, citrus-dominated side. Ready to drink.",86,Domaine Charles Baur 2010 Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
"Refined and delicate on the nose, this offers aromas of white flowers and wet stone. Medium-bodied, with a silky palate, it presents flavors of tart pineapple, lemon rind and struck flint. A playfully textured lemon-custard note adds length to the finish. Drink through 2018.",89,Linden 2012 Hardscrabble Chardonnay (Virginia)
"Vividly fragrant, with silky smooth tannins framing the ensemble. The wine features black cherry, blackberry, sage, coffee, spice, anise, clove and a hint of bright raspberry on the finish. Full-bodied yet balanced and elegant, it is long and lush to the end.",92,Marguerite-Ryan 2000 Pisoni Vineyards Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Heavily charred and roasted plum and berry aromas become greener upon full inspection. This blend of Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc along with Syrah feels tight, with chewy tannins. Herbal plum flavors are peppery and spicy, with a green note popping up prior to a somewhat hot finish.",87,Trio 2014 Reserva Premium Red (Maipo Valley)
"Sparkling Shiraz may not be something you pour every day, but this is one worth reaching for. It delivers lots of upfront berry fruit and lashings of dark chocolate, then finishes relatively dry and clean.",88,Shingleback NV Black Bubbles Sparkling Shiraz (McLaren Vale)
"So incredibly big and meaty, this old-vine Zinfandel lists itself at 15.8% alcohol and is indeed sweet but not jammy.",83,Mettler Family Vineyards 2008 Epicenter Old Vine Zinfandel Zinfandel (Lodi)
"This wine from the Corton Grand Cru vineyard is packed with tannins as well as smoky fruit. It is richly structured and firm, yet the fruit is equally powerful, showing bold black fruits struck against bright acidity. The wine will need considerable aging; drink from 2025.",95,Louis Latour 2015 Château Corton Grancey  (Corton)
"Concentrated aromas of mocha, toffee and burnt coffee bound from the glass, followed by flavors of sour red cherry and berry. Sound balance and soft, dusty tannins make this wine easily enjoyable and easy to drink.",83,J. Fernández de Arcaya Galdiano 2003 Alate Kosher Tempranillo (Navarra)
"There are interesting aromatic layers here that include spring flowers, stone fruit, white mineral and dried herbs or grass. This Prosecco Extra Dry comes together well and offers piquant effervescence and crisp acidity that keeps the palate refreshed.",86,Bellussi NV Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
"Ripe melon and subtle white flowers meld with fresh apple and pear on the nose and palate of this lovely Malvasia from Ivica Matoevi´c. Quite voluptuous in style with a silky, slightly oily mouthfeel, the palate is bright with sweet stone fruit and a pleasantly bitter almond note that lingers on the finish.",88,Matošević 2009 Alba Malvasia (Istria)
"Ripe and juicy, this is a wine with structure and fine, dusty tannins that give it density. The red fruit is juicy, perfumed and has the freshness of the vintage, bright and forward. The underlying tannins are concentrated and will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2020.",92,Albert Bichot 2014 Domaine du Pavillon Clos des Maréchaudes Premier Cru  (Aloxe-Corton)
"Sunny tangerine acidity highlights the rounded, slightly creamy mouthfeel of this light-bodied dry Riesling. Bright grapefruit and quince flavors are forward and fresh, offset by stony mineral tones that linger on the finish. It's a delicate yet richly balanced wine to enjoy now though 2025.",92,Maximin Grünhäuser 2015 Herrenberg Riesling (Mosel)
"Light and fruity, this is a crisp, fresh wine. Hints of red apples and yellow fruits are cut with lemon zest. The wine is perfumed and ready to drink.",84,Château Grand Jean 2014  Bordeaux Blanc
"Aglianico and Piedirosso grapes are blended to produce a thick and broad wine with an inky black color and notes of very ripe red fruit. It has a sweet, chewy aspect with vibrant, albeit densely extracted fruit and soaring tannins. Try it with a beef stew or similarly heavy dishes.",89,Villa Matilde 2003 Red (Falerno del Massico)
"Almost black in color, this densely tannic wine is granular, dusty and mineral in character. The berry fruits shoulder the weight of the tannins easily, giving a ripe wine that will need until 2016 to develop fully",88,DFJ Vinhos 2012 Monte Alentejano Reserva Red (Alentejano)
"Subtle aromas of toasted oak, pressed flower and dried orchard fruit lead the nose. The firm palate offers nectarine, lemon drop, dried apricot and ginger alongside bright acidity. Drink soon to enjoy the remaining fruit flavors.",89,CàMaiol 2011 Fabio Contato  (Lugana)
"This is a rich, fruity wine that has a definite minerally character. The chalky texture is laced with lemon and apricot flavors, leading to a crisp, tight finish.",89,Bret Brothers 2010 Climat en Combe  (Saint-Véran)
"This producer remains committed to showcasing this rare variety, making this 100% version of it from 40-plus-year-old dry-farmed vines. He lets the grapes hang out sur lie for five months in mostly stainless steel, with a small amount of neutral French oak. The result presents as full bodied, though the ripeness is restrained, a celebration of apple, vanilla, spicy lemongrass and robust minerality.",90,Y Rousseau 2015 Old Vines Colombard (Russian River Valley)
"This is a rich style of Vinho Verde, smooth and ripe. Apricots and marmalade oranges dominate the flavor profile, while the citrus character pushes through strongly at the end. It's very fresh and could probably age until mid-2015.",88,Casa de Vilacetinho 2013 Colheita Seleccionada Avesso (Vinho Verde)
"Bright in acidity, and powerful in flavor, this Chard oozes ripe pineapple, green apple, mineral, honeysuckle and spicy flavors. Totally dry, it's a little tight, and could develop some bottle complexity in a few years. Nice with Asian fare.",88,Alma Rosa 2006 El Jabali Vineyard Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Delicate on the attack, with gentle orange blossom and honeyed lemon flavors, this mineral-driven Pinot Grigio builds in intensity and tangerine fruitiness on the palate. It finishes crisp, with tonic lime pith and herb notes.",88,Sivi 2011 Pinot Populus Pinot Grigio (Vipavska Dolina)
"Earthy, woody aromas suggest oak, coconut and coffee, while an herbal, olive note is also present. This is a bit sharp and shearing in terms of acidity, but creamy vanilla flavors mellow the wine's racy plum and cherry character.",85,Viña Casas Patronales 2012 Reserva Privada Cabernet Sauvignon (Maule Valley)
"One of the plusses to having a cash-flow brand like Yellow Tail in the portfolio is that it gives the owners the opportunity to properly age their high-end wines prior to release. At 10 years old, this has acquired a veneer of silkiness and elegance that enfolds the cassis and red-currant fruit. There's no shortage of smoky, vanilla and brown-sugar inflected oak either. Drink now–2025.",93,Casella 2007 1919 Cabernet Sauvignon (Wrattonbully)
"The cherry fruit seems fairly delicate and supple, but it's firmly supported by walls of cedar and vanilla and glides to a silky, mouthwatering finish. If you like your Pinots with a substantial coat of oak, you'll like this even more. Drink now–2018.",88,Brancott 2011 T Letter Series Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
"Charred, leathery aromas include popcorn and black fruits. This is angular and high in acidity, while the flavors run salty and rubbery, with black-fruit notes. A strained, lightly herbal finish tastes like roasted tomato.",83,Finca Las Moras 2011 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz (San Juan)
"A lively, strawberry fruit-colored wine, light, soft and creamy. There is an attractive vibrant feel to the texture, with a hint of red berries, lifted by crisp acidity.",88,Pascal Doquet NV Premier Cru Brut Rosé  (Champagne)
"This wine shows roasted beef with blackberry crust, fresh-cracked black pepper and tarry asphalt on the nose. The asphalt and charred meat play strongly on the heavy-duty palate that also offers blackberry balsamic reduction. It's brawny and burly, perhaps too much so for the everyday drinker.",90,No Limit 2010 All-In Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Syrah (Edna Valley)
"Rounded and sweet wine, its tannins buried in the rich blackberry fruits. It is dominated by its fruity character, although there is a chunky texture that gives a firm mouthfeel. Ready to drink in a year.",89,Château le Pape 2008 L'Excellence  (Pessac-Léognan)
"Spicy, with a hint of mint, this deftly integrated, late-release wine brings rhubarb and raspberry fruit into place. There's enough acidity to complement a nice, fatty piece of salmon, with a light streak of dried herbs running through the finish. It's drinking well, at or near its peak.",91,Carlton Hill 2010 Pinot Noir
"Tasty, with pie-filling cherries, blackberries and currants accented with smoky oak, but a little on the soft side. Fully developed, so drink now.",85,Work 2004 Reserve Merlot (Sonoma Mountain)
There's slight sweetness here in the form of soft oak elements that glide easily together with the natural fruitiness and freshness of Barbera. There's nice personality and dimension and the wine is smooth and soft on the finish (save for that prickly touch of acidity you should expect).,90,Scarzello 2006  Barbera d'Alba Superiore
"This ripe, creamy wine contains the rare Vital in the blend. That grape gives crisp, tight acidity while the Chardonnay brings out the smoother, richer side of this balanced and fruity wine. Drink now.",86,Companhia das Quintas 2015 Quinta de Pancas Chardonnay-Arinto-Vital White (Lisboa)
"This Bordeaux-style blend is fresh, showing aromas of red currant, tomato leaf, licorice and mint. These notes continue onto the palate along with shots of tart cranberry. This is zippy and enjoyable but needs a little more tannic structure to balance.",86,Early Mountain 2014 Novum Red (Virginia)
"There's a faint hint of pink in the color of this bright, cheery, light and appetizing wine. It combines flashes of crisp green apple with ripe pear, golden cherry and white peach for a cornucopia of delicious fruit flavor.",88,Bonterra 2013 Made With Organic Grapes Viognier (Mendocino County)
"This light offering shows berry-cherry fruit and an herb note on the nose. The palate is even and dry with bing-cherry flavors, but an evident greenness keeps the wine from blossoming fully. Finishes dry, with a mildly astringent and slightly woody note.",84,Middelvlei 1996 Pinotage (Stellenbosch)
"Despite showing hickory and barbecued aromas of wood spice, smoked meat and stewed dark fruit, this Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant blend is firm and tight in the mouth, with smacking acidity. Herbal, lightly woody flavors of spice and earthy berry fruits finish bold, with olive and green tobacco notes. Drink through 2022.",91,Viña San Vicente 2011 Lukai Red (Maule Valley)
"Stout, smoky aromas revolve around thick berry scents and minerally notes. This is rock solid in the mouth but not too heavy. Jammy blackberry, spice and herbal flavors are generous, while the finish is lightly oaked, with modest toast, vanilla and chocolate notes along with mint.",90,Tapiz 2012 Alta Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Nicely done in an Alsatian style, this Pinot Gris has subtle aromatics that blossom in due time into lemon, pear and tart apple, the whole richly layered and ideal for pairing with rich wintertime foods.",87,McFadden 2010 Pinot Gris (Potter Valley)
"Ripe and luscious, this reflects the fruitiness of the vintage very well. It has tannins that will develop, although the blackberry fruits and juicy acidity dominate at the moment. Drink from 2018.",88,Bernard Magrez 2012 Château Pérenne  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"Soft, overripe and simple. Tastes like a melted chocolate-cherry brownie, with a drizzle of cassis.",82,San Simeon 2005 Merlot (Paso Robles)
"Crisp and steely, it has aromas of freshly cut grass, hay and tropical fruit. The palate delivers white grapefruit, pineapple and white peach lightly accented with aromatic herbs. Pair with pasta topped with pesto.",87,Colutta 2013 Sauvignon (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"Aromas of Christmas spice, pepper and dried fruit fall more into the traditional category than modern, while the palate is snappy, a little lean and delivers strawberry and raspberry fruit with a light buttery oak note. Tight and dry on the finish, but lean. Ready to drink.",87,Marqués de Vargas 2004 Reserva  (Rioja)
"This is a modestly priced Napa Cabernet that's feral and brambly, the flavors well-composed and soft in black plum and black cherry. It's well balanced and structured, with ample tannins and length on the finish.",91,Renteria 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This is the second of Black Kite's 2009 Pinot Noirs to be released, following the Redwood's Edge last year. It's an impressive wine, dry, richly textured and crisp, showing complex cherry compote, chocolate-covered mint, spice and sandalwood flavors. It's clearly delicious, but gains extra charm from the smooth texture and elegance. Drink now-2015.",92,Black Kite 2009 Angel Hawk Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"With a soft mouthfeel and upfront cherry, blueberry and blackberry flavors, this Cabernet puts all its chips on sheer deliciousness. It's a winner, but not an ager. Drink now.",87,Valley Legend 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
"The tannins are smooth on this ripe, jammy wine. Its raspberry and cherry fruit flavors are finished with a white sugar opulence. The blend is Zin, Petite Sirah and Bordeaux varieties.",84,Cryptic 2011 Red (California)
"Cupano delivers an ace card in 2008 with its Brunello that has seemingly defied all the difficulties of the vintage. The wine is elegant and complex, with pretty layers of dried fruit, leather, tobacco, spice and dark chocolate. The acidity frames the brightness of the fruit and the mouthfeel is long and plush. Drink after 2018.",93,Cupano 2008  Brunello di Montalcino
"Aromas of wood-grilled peach, baked apple and sweet orange oil waft from the glass, all laced with threads of toasted oak and baking spice. The ample acidity keeps the palate lively and the finish fresh, although the woody accents dominate the close once the ripe fruit flavors subside.",90,Bouchard Finlayson 2010 Missionvale Chardonnay (Walker Bay)
"Dark, sappy and reductive, it shows skillful winemaking and sensitivity to vineyard management. The color is there, the aromas are pure and the flavors are balanced, without being overripe. It captures a pleasing mix of berries and currants. Tannins are quite dry and lightly peppery.",88,Hestia Cellars 2005 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Fully ripe black-fruit aromas are rubbery and edgy. This feels jammy, heavy and simple. Flavors of syrupy blackberry and crème de cassis finish sweet and grapy with a sense of syrupy weight.",85,Bodegas San Valero 2015 Particular Garnacha (Cariñena)
"This Sancerre-like effort shows amazing concentration and distinct, vineyard-driven flavors of grain and herb. Racy, textural, crisp and penetrating, it's lifted by a refreshing minerality. Lemon polish, citrus oil, a very delicate suggestion of honey in the nose and mouth, and above all a wonderful persistence make this a standout Sauvignon Blanc.",93,Woodward Canyon 2009 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Merlot (63%) takes the lead on this blend followed by Cabernet Sauvignon (23%) and Cabernet Franc. The aromas seem somewhat wound up at present, with notes of wood spice, vanilla and fresh herb. The palate is über-smooth, showing a fine sense of balance and polish.",91,Northstar 2013 Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
There is no sign of the tannic punch of Malbec in this wine. Instead the texture is soft and open with just enough tannins to give shape to the delicious black currant fruitiness. The wine is ready for a glass now.,85,Pelvillain Frères 2014 Gariottin Sélection Malbec (Cahors)
"This wine is flat and simple, with touches of herbaceous earthiness and cedar. Plum and blueberry-fruit flavors are welcoming if lacking in complexity, with the finish offering a hint of cinnamon.",84,Benziger 2014 Merlot (Sonoma County)
"Rich is the word for this Merlot. It flatters the palate with jammy black cherries, red currants, anise, cocoa and violets, accented with sweet, smoky oak. Turns a bit one-dimensional, but offers plenty of flavor.",87,Sean Minor 2006 4B Merlot (Napa Valley)
"The 2007 vintage was beautiful in Umbria, and this proves to be a stand out wine with enormous power, personality and depth. It delivers gorgeous intensity with pulses of black cherry, chocolate fudge, spice, leather and pipe tobacco. The finish is soft and rich.",93,Arnaldo Caprai 2007 Collepiano  (Sagrantino di Montefalco)
"The reserve gets 90% new French oak, and there is a strong scent of oaky toast, with flavors that follow. Plump cherry fruit fills a broad midpalate, finishing with rather hard tannins that show a green edge.",87,Reustle 2014 Winemaker's Reserve Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley)
"This structured, generously full-bodied wine offers deep layers of black raspberry and cinnamon, with an additional length of subtle black pepper and leather. It builds strength toward the finish before finishing surprisingly light and balanced.",88,Kristodd 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain)
"Tilled soil, lead pencil, thyme, iris and wild berry aromas take center stage on this fragrant red. It's vibrant and young, with crushed strawberry, red raspberry cinnamon and white pepper flavors framed in lively acidity and taut youthfully austere tannins. A licorice note closes the finish. Drink 2023–2033.",93,Mauro Sebaste 2013 Tresuri  (Barolo)
"Pretty good price for a nice, fancy Merlot. It's made in a restrained style, with a firm, dry structure framing cherry, currant, tobacco, herb and cedar flavors.",88,Frostwatch 2005 Merlot (Bennett Valley)
"This is a 100% varietal wine coming from Birch Creek Vineyard. The barrel fermentation shows with aromas of butterscotch melding with fig, lees and beeswax. The stone and tropical fruit flavors are plenty rich and stick around on the finish.",88,Bunchgrass 2013 Sémillon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"If this delicious bottling is any indication, this region is prime for Malbec. Aromas of grape soda, black slate, turned loam, blueberry and purple flowers make for a nicely even nose, and the palate is rich and full with balanced tannins. The juicy flavors include black cherries, plums, cassis and blueberry extract, to which crushed, dried herbs give necessary nuance.",93,Martin Ranch 2012 Thérèse Vineyards Dos Niñas Vineyard Malbec (Santa Clara Valley)
"Muted aromas rise from the glass to reveal wild strawberry and floral rose notes in this wine. Crisp, underlying acidity and strong, present tannins support its ripeness and concentration, the body medium and the oak well-integrated.",92,Siduri 2015 Lingenfelder Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Prieto Picudo is largely an unknown variety with a propensity for yielding weird wines. But this offering is made cleanly, and in an internationally familiar style. Aromas of licorice root, tobacco and cedar rest atop a base of black-fruit scents. The palate is juicy and tannic, while plum and berry flavors are surrounded by mocha, coffee and graphite notes. Drink or hold through 2018.",92,Dominio Dostares 2007 Cumal Prieto Picudo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)
"Honeysuckle notes hover over ripe pears. The palate boosts these notions even more with some residual sweetness that enhances the fruitiness. Edged with pleasant pithiness, the finish is off dry but balanced.",89,Joseph Fritsch 2015 Lieu-dit Altenburg Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Round and ripe, with an earthy character, this is a simple, fruity wine. Attractive apple and grapefruit flavors have been hit by a barnyard element that leaves a bitter taste in the mouth.",83,Eric Cottat 2012 La Vallée des Vignes  (Sancerre)
"A beautiful, ripe wine that shows the richness of 2006 in Chablis. The wine revels in its yellow fruit flavors, apricots, peaches even pineapple, underscored by new wood flavors. Then acidity comes through, a fresh lift that leaves the wine with a clean, smooth finish. And once these initial fruits soften, the secondary flavors promise some good aging. Screwcap.",94,Domaine Laroche 2006 Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis)
"Smooth and juicy in red fruit with an edge of more savory cranberry, this wine from a great vineyard source rises to its occasion and to its site, offering high acidity, medium weight and a lingering, nearly spicy finish. It's enjoyable now but should show well through 2018.",91,Bruliam 2013 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This light, bright and very fruity wine almost dances on the palate. Peach and apple skin flavors bring out a crisp, green acidity. A touch of minerality and texture give the wine character. Drink now.",87,Casal Paço Padreiro 2012 Aphros Ten Loureiro (Vinho Verde)
"Ripeness and richness reign over this full-bodied, almost-sweet wine. Oaky, maple-syrup aromas and lots of black cherry and boysenberry flavors partner with a smooth, posh texture. Think of it almost like a Port, but drier and not quite so high in alcohol.",87,Zinsane 2013 Zinfandel (Lodi)
"This is a medium-bodied, fruit-driven Syrah that seems built for immediate consumption. Black cherry fruit is in the lead, with hints of chocolate and lavender to spice things up. Eminently quaffable, with bright fruit and a lingering finish.",87,Vignobles La Coterie 2009  Saint-Joseph
"Though replanted, the vines designated for this bottling were taken from cuttings of the original vineyard blocks dating back to the early 1970s. Pretty in color, aroma and overall balance, this offers substantial black cherry fruit at its core, buttressed with barrel flavors of cacao. The wine shows good penetration and power, helped by aging 16 months in 38% new barrels.",91,Sokol Blosser 2013 Legacy Cuvée Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Grassy, floral and herbal, this nice white comes from a well-regarded site devoted to the variety. Melon and fuzzy peach flavors highlight its dry, diluted palate, with moderate acidity.",87,Portalupi 2016 Las Brisas Vineyard Vermentino (Carneros)
"This is a thick and vinous Dolcetto with bright grape and blueberry aromas followed by a touch of rubber and spice. It offers a slightly sweet aftertaste with dense, plump concentration.",87,Cascina Bruciata 2009 Vigneti in Rio Sordo  (Dolcetto d'Alba)
"Tobacco, rooty spice, black cherry and earthy aromas set up a high-acid palate that's racy and shearing. Flavors of toasty oak, plum, raspberry and carob finish long and wiry, with a note of citric acidity. Drink through 2023.",90,Campillo 2008 Reserva  (Rioja)
"The apple, pear and spice aromas and flavors display freshness. There is no apparent new oak influence, putting the focus on varietal purity. The finish lingers.",89,Charles Smith 2013 Eve Chardonnay (Washington)
"Rich, ripe bramble and berry notes penetrate deeply in this silky, supple Pinot Noir. It's intensely concentrated, but brightened by a shimmering streak of acidity and fresh herbal tones. A complex, impeccably balanced wine, it finishes long with a kiss of delicate tannins.",93,Friedrich Becker 2011 B Pinot Noir (Pfalz)
"A blend of Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier, this was made in the passito style—grapes were dried to concentrate sugars, then pressed and fermented. The result is a terrific and unusual dessert wine, with candied fruits mixing papaya, guava, banana, Meyer lemon and more. The center is simply lush and fruity; the finish tails off gently with a honeyed kiss.",91,Francis Tannahill 2008 Passito White (Oregon)
"The nose on this Albariño deals tropical fruit and vanilla scents. It feels citrusy, with modest flavors of papaya, peach and white melon. After showing moderate vitality on the palate, the finish softens up and slips into the netherworld. Seems as though it's beginning to fade.",85,Marqués de Vizhoja 2011 Torre la Moreira Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"A very appealing pale-peach color, this wine brings aromas of strawberry and cherry. The flavors are tart and decisive, with a lingering finish.",88,Underground Wine Project 2016 And Why am I Mr. Pink? Rosé of Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Full blackberry and black-plum aromas come with controlled but obvious oak. This feels tight and direct on the palate, with ripeness and weight. Blackberry, cassis and chocolaty oak flavors finish woody and peppery, with drying tannins. This is a powerful, oaky Garnacha made for the modern palate.",90,Alto Moncayo 2012 Garnacha (Campo de Borja)
Perfectly blends passion fruit with ripe peach and nectarine notes to yield a refreshing combination that folds in just enough herbal complexity. This medium-bodied SB's appealing flavors linger on the mouthwatering finish. Drink now.,90,Neudorf 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Nelson)
"Alienor Grand Vin hails from Kelseyville, in Lake County, a fine place for Bordeaux varieties. A blend of 51% Merlot, 48% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot, this is highly structured with a lot of herbal intensity. The typical fruit forwardness of many California reds is subdued; the wine may need time for the fruit to make its way through.",89,Alienor 2009 Grand Vin Red (Lake County)
Haermosa is made with organically-farmed fruit. It shows milky notes of peach yogurt and white chocolate. But it also shows zesty crispness on the close despite the thickness and fullness of the wine's overall texture.,84,Masseria del Feudo Grottarossa 2009 Haermosa Chardonnay (Sicilia)
"Aromas of red currant, blue flower and a whiff of baking spice come together in the glass. Made with 90% Schiava and 10% Lagrein, the easygoing palate offers toast, red berry and vanilla. It's made to be enjoyed young so drink soon.",87,Egger-Ramer 2013 Reiesegger St. Magdalener Classico Red (Alto Adige)
"This well-made wine is powered by lush red and black fruits and berries. The acids keep it lively and fresh, tannins are polished and the outstanding fruit is a real joy. It's unfiltered and aged in French oak, 50% new.",91,High Pass 2015 Zauberberg Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Deep burgundy in color, Felluga's interesting Moscato Rosa would make a good companion to stewed prunes or chocolate with cooked pears. The wine is easygoing and simple with aromas of blueberry and strawberry jam. Wood flavors come in at the rear to create a good balance between sweetness and tangy spice.",87,Marco Felluga 2004 Rosa Moscato (Delle Venezie)
"Full bodied and thickly concentrated, this is almost too much of a good thing, with nearly overblown orange, honey and truffle notes coating the palate. Shows touches of warmth and bitterness on the finish. Drink over the next few years.",89,M. Chapoutier 2006 Chante-Alouette Marsanne (Hermitage)
"Aromas of field greens and wax bean are restrained on the nose. This has a round palate with citric acidity. Flavors of briny green fruits finish slightly closed and bitter. This wine reflects the 2016 vintage which was a cloudy, wet one in Casablanca.",88,Kingston Family 2016 CJ's Barrel Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"This delicious wine shows Paso ripeness in the form of blackberry, cherry, anise and chocolate, with soft tannins and just enough acidity to balance the richness. The cool vintage played a part here, giving the wine long hangtime flavors while keeping the alcohol level low.",90,Falcone 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"This wine's flinty, mineral aroma gives way to lively citrus flavors, great acidity and smooth texture that carry into the finish. It's subtle and medium bodied, with very good balance and enough complexity to hold interest.",90,Brutocao 2016 Feliz Vineyard Estate Bottled Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino)
"Broad aromas of nectarine splashed with warm lemon juice mix with cut pear and ripe red apples on this bottling. The palate shows cooked apples, with slight hints of peach, all quite ripe.",85,Danza del Sol 2014 Pinot Grigio (Temecula Valley)
"This is thick, quite ripe and full-bodied wine rich in baked apple and vanilla custard, the layers concentrated and veering on sweet.",85,Michel-Schlumberger 2014 Platinum Collection Chardonnay (Dry Creek Valley)
"Simple and watery, with vaguely fruity flavors of peaches and citrus. Very dry, with adequate acidity.",83,Pepperwood Grove 2001 Viognier (California)
"This riserva shows ripe aromas of plum and wild cherry accompanied by notes of underbrush and oak. It has lush black-cherry, raspberry, mint and cinnamon flavors, and hints of vanilla and chocolate. It's enjoyable now, thanks to the soft, round tannins and easygoing palate.",90,Tolaini 2010 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"This blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon shows remarkable richness and smoothness. It delivers bright, fresh tones of black cherry and blackberry that are backed by touches of leather and tobacco. It's velvety and taut, not too heavy or extracted.",92,Terenzi 2008 Francesca Romana  (Maremma Toscana)
"Sweet and simple, with flavors of buttered toast, popcorn, white sugar and pineapple jam. Crisp acidity helps for balance. It's not really a dry table wine, but it's a good example of its style.",84,Pali 2010 Charm Acres Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"Plump black cherry and plum flavors resonate through the core of this juicy, ripe Cabernet Franc. Its fruity forward style is approachable and appealing but there's a good dose of elegance as well. Brisk cranberry notes brighten the midpalate, leading a delicately tannic finish.",90,Bellangelo 2014 Cabernet Franc (Seneca Lake)
"This frizzante expression of Pinot Nero (made as a white wine) opens with a transparent color and thick white foam. It delivers aromas of white flower, citrus and peach and shows balanced acidity against those soft bubbles.",85,Castello di Luzzano 2011 Magót Pinot Nero (Oltrepò Pavese)
"A wonderfully drinkable Pinot Noir, this wine shows the brisk acidity and long hangtime flavors of the Sonoma Coast. The fruit got exceptionally ripe, so the raspberries, cherries and persimmons are as sweet as jam. Yet the finish is dry and firm.",90,Renteria 2010 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This is a concentrated, full-bodied wine, full of sweeps of red fruits that are beautifully balanced by the citrus acidity. It is an appealing Champagne to drink now, although with its youthful acidity it will age into a ripe, mellow wine.",91,Lallier NV Grand Rosé Grand Cru Brut  (Champagne)
"Made entirely from Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and aged just over 10 years in barrel, Noble Companion is thick and hot, opening with a tawny taste of roasted pecans, viscous on the palate. It was bottled in 2015.",87,Prager NV Noble Companion 10-Year-Old Tawny Port (Napa Valley)
"This opens with aromas of orchard fruit, citrus and toasted bread crust. The firm palate offers lime, vanilla, oak and yellow apple skin alongside bracing acidity. A note of bitter almond marks the finish.",87,Castello Bonomi 2010 Dosage Zero Sparkling (Franciacorta)
"Aromas of baked plum, scorched earth, mint and menthol come together in the glass. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, raisin, ground pepper and a hint of Oriental spice accompanied by close-grained tannins. A licorice note closes the finish.",88,Caldera 2012  Barbera d'Asti Superiore
"The Touriga Franca is the most widely planted red vine in the Douro, giving, as here, a ripe and fruity wine that is full of red fruits that come right to the fore. The tannins are there in background to give the structure, while it is the exuberant fruit and acidity that dominate. Drink from 2018.",88,Quinta do Passadouro 2013 Passadouro Touriga Franca (Douro)
"This elegant and flavorful wine has a vivid salmon color. Aromas combine cherries and a slight earthiness, paired with a luxurious texture from the tiny bubbles and slight sweetness. Attractive layers of flavor and the rich texture keep it lingering on the finish.",86,Rack & Riddle NV Sparkling Rosé Sparkling (North Coast)
"From 60-year-old bush vines, this is rich, spicy and with a soft texture. Black fruits give a ripe character and a smooth texture that is beginning to bring in some secondary, earthy flavors. Drink this mature wine now.",88,Casa Cadaval 2012 Preta Vinhas Velhas Trincadeira (Tejo)
"Scoury and sweet in the mouth, this blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay has forward flavors of peaches, limes, oranges, honey and vanilla. With brisk acidity, it's a nice bubbly to drink now.",86,Korbel 2010 Natural Sparkling (Russian River Valley)
"Loaded with new oak, which in this case means it's cedary and very mentholly,  Under that is some tobacco and coffee.  Very drying tannins clamp down on the finish.",84,Pindar Vineyards 1997 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (North Fork of Long Island)
"In this new vintage of Sorella, Cabernet Sauvignon is again right out front at 72% of the blend. Here the fruit seems more subdued, the wine tight, the dense tannins showing graphite and mineral more than new barrel flavors. It definitely needs decanting.",96,Andrew Will 2007 Sorella Red Wine Red (Red Mountain)
"Ripe fruit dominates this forward, fruity wine. Caramel and blackberry flavors and firm tannins combine to make a wine that is almost ready to drink.",85,Kirkland Signature 2011  Bordeaux Supérieur
"A wine to fall immediately in love with, this vineyard-designated Barolo opens with dark extraction and superintense aromas of cola, cedar, licorice, plum and teriyaki sauce. Oak elements of spice and toast are also evident and will fall into the background as the wine ages in your cellar. Save for 5–10 years.",94,Podere Rocche dei Manzoni 2007 Vigna d'la Roul  (Barolo)
"A rare style of California white, this is made from 100% Sauvignon Blanc, but is not labeled that way. Striking smoky, white-pepper aromas and aggressive dried herb flavors jangle with apparent oak character. The combination of sharp acidity and soothing body begins to come together on the finish. It needs time to mellow and may improve after 2015.",89,Shared Notes 2012 Les Pierres Qui Decident Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley)
"Subtle green notes highlight concentrated fruit in this wine. Drilling down, it's something akin to celery leaf alongside nectarine and ripe citrus. It's plump in the mouth, with a long, balanced aftertaste. Well done, from start to finish.",91,Vavasour 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Awatere Valley)
"Easy, bright and sweet smelling, this vibrant Dolcetto offers an informal drinking match to home-cooked pasta and light meat dishes. The wine is soft and plush with firm structure.",87,Pe're Alessandro 2009  Dolcetto d'Alba
"Aromatically pleasing, this suggests fresh blueberry pie, with a whiff of smoked meat. It's straightforward with huckleberry and mocha flavors, trailing slightly toward the finish.",88,Columbia Crest 2012 Grand Estates Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Markus Huber manages to get great ripe, full flavors from his Grüners. That's the main character of this wine, from a single vineyard, that offers rich creamed pear and nutmeg flavors along with a shot of acidity to contrast. Screwcap.",91,Markus Huber 2012 Obere Steigen Grüner Veltliner (Traisental)
"Still young, this has fine potential. As it matures, the ripe gooseberry and apple fruit notes will open up to yield a rich, complex and mineral wine. It will always have a tight texture along with vibrant acidity to finish. Drink from 2017.",92,Saget la Perrière 2013 Le Domaine  (Pouilly-Fumé)
"Borgo Conventi (owned by Tuscany's Ruffino) brings us a creamy Pinot Grigio with rich nuances of citrus and passion fruits, mango and pineapple. The wine is perfectly round and proportionate in the mouth—it's light on the tongue yet dense and long-lasting.",87,Borgo Conventi 2007 Pinot Grigio (Collio)
"The vintage was a good one for Peju, resulting in wines that bear the winery's distinctive style of balanced elegance. This reserve is very ripe and flamboyant in blackberry and black currant flavors, with an opulent overlay of toasty oak. This is so delicious that it tastes like there's a squirt of milk chocolate in it, but the wine is, in fact, thoroughly dry.",94,Peju 2008 Estate Bottled Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"Almost entirely Chardonnay, with just a whisper of Pinot Noir, this is a dry Champagne. It is crisp, lively, steely and with great intensity. The apple and lemon flavors are just a part of this impressive wine that could age longer. Drink from 2019.",94,Le Brun de Neuville 2008 Grand Vintage Brut  (Champagne)
"Way too tannic to earn a higher score, although the dryness is welcome, and the blackberry and black cherry flavors are complex, augmented with floral, licorice notes. The tannins hit the mouth hard, and are unlikely to age out.",86,Steven Kent 2007 Ghielmetti Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Livermore Valley)
"Mourvèdre (40%) makes up the majority of this blend, followed by Grenache (37%), Syrah (19%) and Cinsault. It's locked up at present with brooding aromas of iron, cherry and dark berries that are followed by power-packed fruit flavors that show a pleasing sense of balance. It's bold but shows no shortage of detail.",92,DeLille 2014 Métier Red (Yakima Valley)
"Ripe, lifted blackberry and plum notes are tinged with game and garrigue in this luscious, full-bodied Meritage. An unusual dose of Carmenère lends an earthy, savory character that balances an otherwise plush, fruity palate. The finish is framed with fine, soft tannins and a lingering spice note.",88,Osprey's Dominion 2012 Flight Meritage (North Fork of Long Island)
"This is a jammy Syrah with earthy, saucy black-fruit scents and a sense of reduction. Round and smooth for the most part, this registers as soft in feel. Flavors of blackened spice, blackberry and chocolate finish with coffee and mocha notes, while moderate acidity means the finish is short.",88,Viña Tarapacá 2014 Gran Reserva Syrah (Maipo Valley)
"The aromas of this wine pop, with notes of fresh flowers, green herbs, olive brine, coffee, grilled asparagus, gravel and a touch of smoked meat lurking in the background. The fruit and savory flavors are plush and palate-coating in feel, with floral and smoked meat notes persisting on the finish. It's a very pretty interpretation of the area, with a compelling sense of balance.",94,Saviah 2013 The Funk Estate Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"A blast of fake-smelling clove is the dominant aroma on this sticky Pinot Noir. Clove returns as the singular flavor, while the finish is woody but not toasty or classy. This is uniquely one-dimensional, but in the wrong way.",81,Santa Rita 2015 Secret Reserve Pinot Noir (Central Valley)
"Light in color, with pecan pie aromas. There's nothing heavy or blowsy about this refined palo cortado; it's tight in the mouth, with narrowing acidity and tangy, oily flavors of citrus, almond and rancio. Long as they come on the finish, with zero excess weight.",91,Hidalgo NV Marqués de Rodil Palo Cortado Sherry (Jerez)
"This blend of Chardonnay (that sees some time in barrique) and Insolia offers deep and sophisticated notes of exotic fruit, chalky mineral and toasted hazelnut. This interesting combination works very well and the wine ends with pretty flavors of spice and almond.",88,Valle dell'Acate 2006 Bidis White (Sicilia)
"This is a bold dry wine from one of Bonterra's biodynamically farmed vineyards, and it has plenty of tannin in the texture and an abundance of ripe black-cherry, wood smoke and baking spice flavors to fill out that firm frame. For all its power the wine is also polished and velvety enough to sip with pleasure. Best after 2020.",92,Bonterra 2013 The McNab Red (Mendocino)
"Ripe cherry and blackberry fruit stars in this easy-drinking wine, with oak providing toasty sweetness. It's an everyday, cheeseburger-friendly Merlot.",84,Five Rivers 2011 Merlot (Monterey County)
A beautifully subtle scent of Williams pear makes for a soft opening. The palate is equally soft but totally driven by the ripeness of the juicy pear fruit streaked with lemon zest on the concentrated palate. Refreshment and enjoyment are programmed into this.,92,Nigl 2013 Hochäcker Reserve Riesling (Kremstal)
"This wine is a blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc, 10% Petit Verdot and 5% Malbec. Aromas of baking spice, red and black fruit and sweet spices are followed by dark-fruit flavors. The tannins come off as a bit dry and burly at present.",88,Three Rivers 2012 Svelte Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"There's a fleshy quality to this Cabernet that makes the term fluffy appropriate. It's rich and dry, with voluptuous flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar, as well as a touch of umami, dark chocolate and smoked meat. The tannins are fairly potent, suggesting 5–7 years in the cellar.",92,Meyer Family Cellars 2008 Fluffy Billows Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"A creamy, soft wine with a dosage that puts it on the sweeter end of Brut, this attractive Champagne is ready to drink. It offers good balance between acidity and the green-plum fruits. The aftertaste keeps up the soft theme of the wine.",86,Chanoine NV Tsarine Cuvée Premium Brut  (Champagne)
"This wine is laced with wood and spice. It is ripe and fruity, also having a strong pepper and toast character and a light sprinkling of tannin. Juicy cherries give a lift at the end. Drink now.",85,Patient Cottat 2013 Le Grand Caillou Pinot Noir (Vin de France)
"This young wine with its edge of dry botrytis is just starting out. Apricot aromas are a sign of what is to come, as its fine balance between honey and fruit comes into play. Acidity keeps everything crisp. Drink from 2020.",89,Château Tanesse 2015  Cadillac
"This wine from the Palos Verdes coastline is redolent with sagebrush, crushed anise and alpine strawberries on the herbally aromatic nose. The sage also powers the palate, alongside juniper and pine, all set against a wild berry frame. This is a big Pinot, though it is relatively light in structure and happily reliant on savory herbs rather than overly ripe fruits.",93,Villa Oneiro 2013 Pinot Noir (California)
"With a distinct pop of gas as it is opened, this light, fruity and lightly sweet wine is a classic summer refresher. Citrus and green apple fruits abound. Screwcap.",86,José Maria da Fonseca 2011 Twin Vines White (Vinho Verde)
"This new wine from the family that founded Navarro Vineyards takes a fascinating twist on Anderson Valley style, combining very concentrated, dark-fruit and black-pepper flavors on a relatively light body. It's easy to enjoy the black cherry, clove and wood-smoke notes, while feeling the lithe, moderately tannic texture lifting the mouthfeel.",92,Pennyroyal Farm 2013 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Dry and semisparkling, this opens with aromas of hazelnut, pear and a touch of bread crust. The crisp, vertical palate offers nut, apple skin and grapefruit alongside brisk acidity. Rather than sip as an aperitivo, try it with fish or lightly seasoned rice dishes.",88,Malibràn 2013 Credamora Col Fondo  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Dusty saffron, earth and bitter minerals lend a savory tone to this otherwise appley, lime-inflected dry Riesling. It's crisp and sheer on the palate but the finish is bold with a steely, cool resonance. Drink now through 2019.",88,Maximin Grünhäuser 2014 Trocken Riesling (Mosel)
"This is 95% Syrah, co-fermented with Viognier in the Northern Rhône style. The result is a very fine wine that is currently drinking quite young and tight. It's shut down in hard tannins and an immature reticence of fruit, although you can detect some ripe, delicious blackberries, plums, currants and dark chocolate. Give it 5–6 years in a good cellar.",92,Keller Estate 2010 Rôtie Red (Sonoma Coast)
"Earthy, murky aromas of cherry and plum lack freshness and brightness. This wine is jammy and a bit clumsy on the palate, with saucy, savory berry and plum flavors. An herbal, jammy-tasting finish leaves you wanting more.",85,Finca Adelma 2014 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza)
"There's no oak on this crisp, young wine, so all you taste is the pure fruit. It's a little sweet, with residual sugar of 1.9% that gives it a honeyed edge, but the acidity is quite high and balancing. Flavorwise, it's all about wildflowers, pears, passionfruit, vanilla and cinnamon spice.",86,Ventana 2007 Gewürztraminer (Arroyo Seco)
"Flavors of berry, vanilla and tar form around thick, rich tannins, giving this wine a puckering quality that may benefit from opening before enjoying. The finish is sturdy and robust in leathery black pepper.",86,Rosenblum 2012 Winemaker Selection Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
"A whiff of evergreen lends a cool, alpine touch to white grapefruit and lemon notes on this refreshing, delectably fruity Riesling. The palate is just off dry, bursting with ripe white peach and tangerine flavors. It's satisfyingly quaffable, yet finishes elegantly with a fringe of lime-zest tannins.",90,Fritz Haag 2012 Riesling (Mosel)
"Aromas of ripe plum, blue flower, tilled soil, truffle and a whiff of exotic incense lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. The juicy, chewy palate delivers mouthfuls of fleshy wild cherry, crushed black raspberry, baking spice and grilled herb framed in firm, velvety tannins. It's already delicious. Drink 2018–2023.",93,Ridolfi 2011  Brunello di Montalcino
"This Bordeaux-style blend comprises 68% Merlot, 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Cabernet Franc and a splash each of Malbec and Petit Verdot. The massive tannins dominate, to the detriment of balance and fruit. Perhaps those tannins will mellow with ample age, but that's a ways off. Right now it offers hints of plum and cherry, a dash of mocha, and a lot of stem and earthy tannins.",87,Township 7 2014 Reserve 7 Red (Okanagan Valley)
"Lots of funky yeast still hovers above the wine, underneath there is grassy, savory freshness, reminiscent of salty soy. Lime zestiness is edged with peppery verve. This is a layered superspicy Grüner that deserves your full attention. The textured palate makes it easy to linger and savor.",92,Markus Huber 2015 Terrassen Grüner Veltliner (Traisental)
"Almost a baby in Colheita Port terms, this is a bright, ripe and fruity wine. It does have some touches of wood aging although they are left behind by the honey and orange marmalade flavors that have a light sprinkling of ginger. Drink now.",89,Kopke 2003 Colheita White  (Port)
"This Hawke's Bay-based producer has drawn fruit from Central Otago for this wine, which shows some austere tannins and minty overtones. Cherry and cinnamon notes join wintergreen, while the finish is clean, dry and firm. Worth holding a few years to see what develops.",87,Paritua 2014 Pinot Noir (Central Otago)
"This is an irresistibly tasty wine, bursting with lovely berry and cherry fruits, soaked in deliciously decadent chocolaty barrel flavors. But it's not that simple. Propped up with sufficient acidity, ripe tannins and a slight tilt toward earthy underpinnings, it offers compelling length and complexity also. Drink now through 2022.",92,Le Cadeau 2014 Côte Est Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Lots of flashy blackberry and blueberry fruit in this rather forward Syrah. It's also quite tannic and spicy, the result of 100% whole cluster fermentation. With its fairly high alcohol, it has a mouth-warming fullness. Drink now.",90,Samsara 2009 Turner Vineyard Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills)
"From Klipsun and Hedges fruit, this muscular, aromatic Merlot begins with pretty berry scents, then develops flavors of currant and cherry. It's a wine with meat and muscle, still packed tight, but dense with potential. Give it plenty of decanting, or cellar it for five years.",90,Sparkman 2007 Outlaw Merlot (Red Mountain)
"Dry earthy aromas suggest rubber and sea shells along with mild red-fruit scents. This Garnacha from vineyards planted at 3,300 feet feels tight and rubbery. Savory, meaty plum and berry flavors are complex, finishing long and dry on a strong accent of woodspice. Drink now.",91,Comando-G 2014 Las Umbrías Rozas de Puerto Real Garnacha (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)
"Concentrated in toasted marshmallow and juicy blackberry, this is a large, full-bodied wine marked by puckering tannins that still need time to resolve. Powerfully built, it's big on flavor and intensity, with vanilla on the finish.",88,Murphy-Goode 2012 Reserve Zinfandel (Alexander Valley)
"Rich, full bodied and medium dry, it is powered by ripe fruits, lychees and pomegranates. A spicy undertow brings along some acidity to this concentrated wine. Drink from 2016.",93,Domaine Albert Mann 2010 Furstentum Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Swirls of honey melt into ripe, rich pink grapefruit and peach in this decadently fruity Riesling. Off dry in style, it's lip smackingly sweet-tart, anchored by a zesty streak of tangerine acidity. Drink now–2016.",90,Sheldrake Point 2014 Estate Bottled Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Big, rich and flashy, this is a wine of fruit-driven power. The notes of cherries, blackberries and currants are strong and jammy, and it's oaky, too. The finish is tannic and dry, so you may want to cellar it for a couple of years.",88,Migration 2010 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"Though not designated as such, this is a reserve-level effort, as noted by the special label (with Owen Roe in large, old-fashioned cursive lettering) and its overall concentration. Dense black fruits are strongly accented with flavors of espresso and baking spices. It's a powerful wine that is already drinking well, and should continue to do so into the late 2020s.",93,Owen Roe 2014 Merriman Vineyard Clandeboye Pinot Noir
"Purple/black and compact, this wine needs plenty of breathing time to reveal its layers. Klipsun vineyard fruit brings power and tannic muscle. The aromas are intriguing; a bit overripe and raisiny, but also offering truffle, smoked meat and burnt toast.",89,Page Cellars 2005 Syrah (Red Mountain)
"This is a complex and introverted vineyard-designate. Sour cherry, pomegranate and rhubarb surround a wildness of anise and medium-weighted tannin. Earthy and varietal, it should pair well with pork-driven fare.",90,Thomas George 2012 Baker Ridge Vineyard Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Sensations of white peach, apricot, citrus and mineral come alongside medicinal notes that leave a rather bitter taste.",85,Villa Matilde 2012 Tenute di Altavilla  (Greco di Tufo)
"This fruity, aromatic wine is fresh and crisp. It has a strongly herbaceous, citrus character and an intensely perfumed backdrop. Drink now.",85,Vignerons de Buzet 2013 Baron d'Ardeuil Vieilles Vignes White (Buzet)
"Good body and a fair amount of richness here. The nose is on the heavier, rubbery side, and it dulls down rather than expands. On the palate, Huique is warm, sweet, figgy and a little syrupy, with soft fruit and a touch of bitterness on the finish.",86,El Huique 2007 Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"While this is obviously Sauvignon Blanc, it also has some rich creaminess that makes it more rounded and rich. The citrus and crisp apple flavors are well-integrated into this ripe wine.",87,Closerie du Bailli 2011 Tradition  (Côtes de Bourg)
"Oily, nutty, gritty aromas show hints of white flower and tropical fruits. The palate is loud, broad, and somewhat oily in texture. Flavors of lychee and citrus finish heavy.",82,Viña Casablanca 2013 Nimbus Single Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Casablanca Valley)
"A new offering from this partnership, this wine brings aromas of jasmine, lime and dried Nestea Ice Tea. It tingles the palate with lightly spritzy, off-dry lemon and peach flavors with a floral finish.",87,Charles & Charles 2014 Riesling (Yakima Valley)
"Bravo to Long Point for making a Cabernet that counts in a cool climate. Rich aromas of anise, mocha and tobacco lead into structured, complex flavors of red berry, cigar and cassis. Spicy but balanced and slightly big, the wine will be great with grilled meat and stew.",86,Long Point 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (New York)
"This ripe wine from Albin Roux's estate is generous and packed with rich apricot and pear fruits. There is a steely edge to the texture, giving a final bite to the acidity of this opulent wine.",88,Domaine Roux 2015  Quincy
"There's an impressive freshness to this seven-year-old bottling, with both just-picked and baked blackberry aromas alongside pressed violets and dried ginger on the lavish nose. Vibrant olallieberries show on the sip, with violet-flavored cake adding to this study of purple flavors.",91,DENO 2009 Paso Rouge Alto Pomar Vineyard G-S-M (Paso Robles)
"A selection from the Quinta da Bacalhôa vineyard, this sumptuous wine layers the darkest fruit flavors with a structure that is solid, dense and powerful. Juicy plums, licorice and a firm, stalky edge go with wood aging and bone-dry tannins. Age for 5–6 years.",94,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal 2007 Palácio da Bacalhôa Red (Península de Setúbal)
A simple Sauvignon Blanc that tastes of cantaloupe. Serve it at a big outdoor party or any other time the focus is not entirely on the wine.,84,Cable Car 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino County)
"Lavish blossom, peach and tropical fruit notes perfume this big-bodied wine. Off dry in style, it fills the palate with rich stone fruit and pineapple accented with peppery spice and tangerine acidity. It's a powerful yet nicely balanced wine with pleasant astringency on the finish.",89,Lamoreaux Landing 2012 Estate Bottled Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes)
"Attractive floral scents of crushed rose and pressed violet are joined by perfumed berry and a hint of menthol. The elegant, focused palate delivers wild cherry, raspberry, white pepper, clove and chopped herb alongside a firm network of fine-grained tannins. It's still young and tight but loaded with finesse. Drink 2019–2031.",93,Paolo Scavino 2011 Cannubi  (Barolo)
"This wine doesn't seem to have fully ripened, with green, reedy aromas along with notes of cranberry and cherry Jolly Rancher. The full-bodied palate delivers more but seems disconnected with tart, tangy cranberry flavors.",86,Cana's Feast 2013 Northridge Vineyard Primitivo (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Big, jumbled and foxy, with forced berry aromas. Feels full and bulky, with roasted, herbal flavors that suggest cherry and cassis. Mildly astringent and chalky feeling on the finish.",83,Sundance 2009 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maule Valley)
"The Medieval Sancerre castle (Joan of Arc slept here) was built on the site of an ancient Roman fortress. Now owned by the producers of Grand Marnier liqueur, the vineyard produces an attractive, open style of wine. It has just the right tangy acidity along with delicious ripe apple and citrus fruits. The wine is ready to drink.",89,Château de Sancerre 2015  Sancerre
"From one of Amarone's premier producers, this delicious Amarone delivers generous black cherry flavors, with hints of raisin, white pepper, nutmeg and chocolate. It's soft and round, with smooth, velvety tannins and compelling intensity.",94,Masi 2009 Costasera  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"Pickled on the nose, with aromas that hint at white grapes such as Verdejo. This is jumpy and unsettled, with citrus and white grapefruit flavors leaving a tangy burn on the finish. Jangled and sharp.",82,Osborne 2007 Solaz Rosado Rosé (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"This soft, round wine is warm and full in the mouth, with only a hint of herbal character. Green fruits are filled out with ripe apricot and pear flavors. Drink this fruity, perfumed wine from 2016.",84,Chavet Fils 2014  Menetou-Salon
"Pommard and Wädenswil clones make up this cuvée. Chunky fruit flavors of sour plum and cherry are on display, with decent penetration and moderate length. Drink now through 2022.",88,A Blooming Hill Vineyard 2014 Trouble Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This has aromas of overripe black-skinned fruit, scorched earth and a funky whiff of barnyard. The rustic sensation carries over to the palate along with a bitter note. It lacks fruit richness while grainy tannins leave an abrupt, astringent finish. Tried twice and had the same notes.",85,Revello Fratelli 2011 Gattera  (Barolo)
"Simply sensational, this estate-grown Viognier raises the bar for everyone. It's a glorious mesh of citrus flesh and rind, elevated with spicy highlights of orange, tangerine and Meyer lemon. Outstanding concentration, focus and depth, with juicy acidity underlying an astonishing finish.",95,Abeja 2012 Viognier (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"A nice, crisp Chard that has pineapple, peach, pear and caramel-vanilla flavors that turn honeyed and spicy on the finish. From the Sonoma producer Ty Caton.",87,Racchus 2005 Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"The grape variety's floral aspects come out in the aromas of this big but well-balanced wine. Full of roses and violets, the perfume is unusual and inviting, and the flavors follow, piling on dry but ripe tones of blueberry and black olive, riding a richly tannic texture that seems to coat all corners of the palate.",90,Two Angels 2015 Petite Sirah (Red Hills Lake County)
"Wild berry, black cooking spice and a whiff of Mediterranean brush come together on this soft, straightforward red. The medium-bodied, concentrated palate offers ripe blackberry, raspberry jam and a note of anise alongside round, compacted tannins.",88,Alessandro di Camporeale 2014 Donnatà Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"A sense of sweetness from oak smooths out this medium- to full-bodied wine and complements the moderate tannins and smooth texture. A pleasant plummy thread winds through the aromas and flavors, lingering on the finish.",85,Sobon Estate 2012 Rezerve Primitivo (Amador County)
"This delicate, elegant NLH wine starts with alluring aromas of lush honey, apricot and citrus and offers a vibrant, lively balance of fruit and acid. Pair with cheeses and fruit salads.",88,Mulderbosch 2006 Noble Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc (Stellenbosch)
"Wood aging gives this wine's aroma its eucalyptus character. That perfume follows through to the finely structured palate, where oak flavors balance its delicious black plum fruit. It's warm, ripe and stylish. Drink from 2020.",90,Château le Grand Moulin 2015 Collection Grande Réserve  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"You might want to stash this Syrah away for a year or so to let it mellow. Right out of the bottle, it's tannic and fresh in red berry and stone fruit jam. Cool-climate complexities of pepper and grilled bacon enhance the pleasure.",89,Kessler-Haak 2011 Lafond Vineyard Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Even if this Cab shows eucalyptus on the nose along with asphalt and olive aromas, the bouquet is complex and true as far as high-end Chilean Cabs go. A saturated, syrupy body reflects a hot vintage, while baked flavors of earthy fruits, beef soup and chocolate qualify as stewy but tasty. A warm, flat finish says drink this Cabernet sooner rather than later.",90,Domus Aurea 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"This wine has a texture of softness and juiciness, with a leathery background. Tannic and rich in blackberry and powerful oak, it finishes lean.",86,J. Rickards 2012 Serpentine Ridge Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"This upper-tier label shows condensed strawberry fruit against an herbal backbone of marjoram, black cardamom, rainbow peppercorns, dried tobacco and green olive. The palate is tangy with woody fruits of elderberry and juniper, likely to thrive with age.",92,Potek 2013 Rancho La Vina Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Powerful, very rich and very concentrated, this epitomizes the opulent style of Cos d'Estournel. A sense of extraction is overwhelmed by the huge, ripe fruit. It shows velvet texture at first, but then the tannins come on strongly, leaving a wine that will age over many years. Drink from 2022.",94,Château Cos d'Estournel 2011  Saint-Estèphe
"A sweet rosé that is light and fresh from the crisp raspberry acidity. It is bright and fruity, ready to drink.",84,Quintas de Melgaço 2014 Lagar Rosé (Vinho Verde)
"With his background in Bordeaux, François Lurton knows how to handle Sauvignon Blanc to good effect. This wine is crisp and herbal, suggesting the cooler vineyards of the southwest in its style. It is packed with citrus and spice flavors. Refreshing and delicious, this is an immediately drinkable wine.",87,François Lurton 2015 Les Fumées Blanches Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de France)
"Like your Zins big and in-your-face? This one's for you, with its richly tannic, concentrated black currant, licorice, cola and pepper flavors and long, spicy finish. It's high in alcohol, but that's Rockpile Zin for you. Drink now with great barbecue.",88,Carol Shelton 2009 Rocky Reserve Florence Vineyard Zinfandel (Rockpile)
"A lighter style of Pinot Noir, but lovely for drinking now. It has flavors of tea, cola, strawberry jam and dusty spices, and is dry and silky. Fresh and easy, at a good price.",87,Babcock 2009 Rita's Earth Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Beautifully aromatic, this purple-hued wine offers generous plum and black cherry flavors that are cloaked in mocha, with muscular, earthy tannins. It spent over two years in barrel (half new oak), and will benefit from a bit more bottle age for all of its rich flavors to fully integrate.",92,Forgeron 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
This is an earthy wine with barnyard flavors. It does have some blackberry fruitiness under its more rustic character. The aftertaste has acidity and a bitter edge.,83,Casal da Coelheira 2011 Terraços do Tejo Red (Tejo)
The wine has plenty of ripe fruit and generous tannins. The blackberry fruitiness and acidity are backed by a dry core that will allow this full-bodied wine to age. Drink from 2018.,88,Château Belcier 2015 Château de Monrecueil  (Bordeaux Supérieur)
"Full of crisp fruit, this cru wine is bright with red-berry flavors. It is light and with a cool character that comes from the high altitude of the vineyards. There is an edgy texture that keeps the wine together. Drink now.",88,Georges Duboeuf 2015 Flower Label  (Chiroubles)
"Nice and dry, with a good cut of acidity balancing out the ripe black cherry and cola flavors. Fully drinkable now for the soft tannins, it's a pleasant wine that wants pairing with a grilled, salted and peppered steak.",87,Jorian Hill 2008 Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Intense aromas of smoke, spice and toast envelop layers of ripe blackberry and currant in this penetrating Cabernet Sauvignon. It's boldly oaked but elegantly balanced, bolstering without overpowering the fruit. Dark herb notes and bristling acidity lead an elegant, delicately tannic finish.",90,Wölffer 2013 Cassango Cabernet Sauvignon (Long Island)
"Meaty aromas of beef jerky and roasted game meet with licorice, black peppercorn and black raspberry on the nose of this bottling of a rarely used grape. The palate delivers lots of pepper and quite a bit of tannic grip, though flavors aren't too deep, with gamy elements the most prevalent.",88,Wolff 2014 Estate Teroldego (Edna Valley)
"Soft, ripe and thick, this is one of those Rhône-style Pinots that purists will find on the big side for a variety that's supposed to be silky and delicate. On the plus side, it's a dry, rich wine, with oodles of cherries, blackberries and cinnamon-spiced punch.",88,Russian Hill 2005 Tara Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Made from Pinot Noir, this is a dry, crisp young blush wine of some real interest and complexity. It has flavors of unsweetened orange pekoe tea, tangerine zest and vanilla, with a scour of dusty tannins.",86,Perbacco Cellars 2006 Chiaretto Rosé (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"This wine's underbrush, menthol, dried herb and game aromas follow through to the firm, linear palate, along with sour cherry, pomegranate, espresso and clove flavors. Tightly woven tannins provide grip while a star anise note marks the close.",88,Piero Busso 2013 San Stunet  (Barbaresco)
"Raspberry and clove characterize the nose on this single-vineyard bottling. The palate kicks off with vibrant black cherry, slips toward black olive on the midpalate and ends with bright acidity on a decent finish.",88,La Montagne 2012 Kessler-Haak VIneyard Theron Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"This Cab is minty and leathery, with overwhelming vanilla-y tannins at first—maybe from the time spent in all new American oak—that mellow with opening, giving it a soft mouthfeel.",85,Cache Creek Vineyards 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lake County)
"Coste di Rose is a gorgeous Barolo with impressive elegance and complexity. Aromas touch on delicate hints of violets, spice, cola and cedar and are beautifully unified and integrated overall. The texture is thick and dense yet the quality of the tannins is particularly polished and tight. Don't open this bottle before 2015.",94,Bric Cenciurio 2005 Coste di Rose  (Barolo)
"Light in color, this offers alluring peat, white pepper, herb, earth and raspberry aromas. It dances on the palate, showing elegance and sophistication and bringingplenty of intrigue.",91,Aubichon Cellars 2015 Reserve Grenache
"Showing copper reflections, this vibrant wine offers enticing scents of white wildflower and orchard fruit. The savory palate presents poached Bartlett pear, nectarine zest and a mineral note accompanied by firm acidity.",88,Venica & Venica 2014 Jesera Pinot Grigio (Collio)
"Katnook's top-of-the-line Cab, the Odyssey, already seems mature, with a touch of brick to its color and some dried fruit flavors. But even if this won't improve further, it's at a lovely spot right now, with a lush, creamy texture, pillowy-soft tannins and wonderful cedar and cigarbox notes. Drink now–2010.",92,Katnook Estate 2002 Odyssey Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra)
"Scented freshness of lemon and apple hits the nose. The palate follows with frothy lively mousse that majors on crisp lemon flavors. This is tart and bracing, refreshing and totally joyful. It leaves the palate tingling with English verve but also hints at hedonism underneath through some stony depths, then finishes with a brisk flourish.",91,Ridgeview Estate 2013 Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (England)
"Riserva Rancia opens with elegant hues of garnet and dark ruby and offers sophisticated notes of old spice, cured leather and dried currant berries. It achieves elegance, harmony and delivers pristine and persistent flavors that would marry red meat, pork or lamb.",92,Felsina 2005 Rancia Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"Licorice, berry and mocha cream are major elements in the seductive bouquet. Creamy, concentrated fruit, leather and black pepper on the palate ride the extracted but not too syrupy mouthfeel. This is a rich Aussie Shiraz with dense fruit and lots of oak—but also enough spine to keep its balance.",91,Heritage Road 1998 Reserve Shiraz (Limestone Coast)
"Spicy and ripe, it's immediately attractive. Dry tannins are easily balanced by the rich berry fruits and acidity. It's a polished wine, ready to drink now.",87,Casa Santos Lima 2011 Opaco Red (Lisboa)
"Claret is the old-fashioned word for Bordeaux, but it has no legal meaning in the U.S. This Cabernet-based wine contains some Syrah, which gives a smoked meat or bacon note to the blackberries and black currants. It's delicious, if a little sweet.",87,Bell 2006 Claret Red (Napa Valley)
"This blend of Montepulciano and Sangiovese opens with initial aromas of wet earth and blue flower, along with hints of berry and vanilla. The palate delivers ripe blackberry layered with chocolate, alongside dusty tannins. Not very complex but enjoyable and ready to drink now.",86,Ciù Ciù 2009 Gotico  (Rosso Piceno Superiore)
"This 100% varietal wine offers lightly volatile notes of vanilla, coconut, pepper and dried cherries. The fruit flavors show good concentration along with a beguiling feel and a finish that lingers. Although the wood takes center stage, it plays its part well.",88,Northwest Cellars 2010 Coyote Canyon Vineyard Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Full, ripe black-fruit aromas open this fine Casablanca Syrah. In the mouth, this is juicy and fresh, with good body weight. Black plum, blackberry, barrel spice and herbal flavors finish long, subtle and lightly herbal. Drink through 2019.",90,Kingston Family 2014 Bayo Oscuro Syrah (Casablanca Valley)
"The second wine of Château Cheval Blanc is packed with wood flavors and spice. A toasty wine, it also has solid tannins plus fragrant fruitiness. Already the fruit is coming through strongly and it is for medium-term aging. Drink from 2017.",91,Château Cheval Blanc 2011 Le Petit Cheval  (Saint-Émilion)
"The pale, pretty salmon-pink color suggests this wine's delicacy of mouthfeel. It's nice and light, with raspberry, strawberry and vanilla flavors, but turns too sugary sweet on the finish for true balance.",85,Black Stallion 2012 Syrah Rosé (Napa Valley)
"This engages the taste buds with bright, ripe fruit flavors and balances them with good crisp acidity and light tannins, plus spicy oak accents that resemble vanilla, allspice and nutmeg. Medium to full bodied, it feels smooth in the mouth but the lip-smacking tannins carry through on the finish.",89,Braveheart 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Moderately complex but thoroughly inviting aromas of cherry, plum and oak lead to a pure, balanced palate with drying tannins. Flavors of cherry, kirsch, pepper and fresh herbs conclude on a still-kicking finish that's tight and elegant. Drink through 2020.",92,Peique 2010 Viñedos Viejos Mencía (Bierzo)
"Underbrush, camphor and new leather aromas unfold in this taut red. The linear palate shows red cherry, pomegranate, espresso and star anise flavors alongside a crushed sage note. Assertive tannins and racy acidity lend grip to the finish. Drink 2022–2032.",90,Adriano Marco & Vittorio 2014 Basarin  (Barbaresco)
"The wine is tight and mineral in character. It is textured, steely with the citrus fruits giving the wine a bite as well as intense acidity. Think of this wine with seafood.",85,Château du Seuil 2015 Domaine du Seuil  (Bordeaux Blanc)
"This has a dark, inky color, with rich aromas of black fruit, spice, leather and soft chocolate. The mouthfeel is smooth and luscious.",90,Francesco Boschis 2010 Pianezzo  (Dolcetto di Dogliani)
"This is a fine wine that performs at the level of a premier cru. It has brambly fruitiness and intense perfume. The structure is already finely integrated, allowing the strawberry fruit and acidity to shine through. Drink from 2019.",92,David Duband 2014  Morey-Saint-Denis
"This wine is a blend of equal parts Grenache Blanc and Marsanne. The aromas are quite restrained, with intriguing notes of pear, almond, citrus, cream and spice. The palate brings a similar sense of restraint, showing no apparent new oak influence. It doesn't quite all come together but it provides a sense of intrigue.",87,Ardor 2016 Boushey Vineyard White (Yakima Valley)
"This is bold for a boxed wine, showing ripe, lightly spicy flavors supported by a firm and moderately tannic texture. It's nearly dry, too.",85,The Naked Grape NV Merlot (California)
"Always an impressive vineyard, it has produced a dense wine in this vintage. It's full of both intense, perfumed red fruits and smoky, dusty tannins that give an elegant structure. Drink from 2020.",92,Chanson Père et Fils 2013 Les Vergelesses Premier Cru  (Pernand-Vergelesses)
"Blackberry, plum, balsamic and leather aromas give this red blend an indigenous, masculine character. On the palate, a heady blend of tobacco, spice and pomegranate flavors are buoyed by balanced acidity. Pair with grilled meats, hearty soups, or charred dishes.",89,Estate Biblia Chora 2009 Biblinos Oenos Red (Pangeon)
"Beautiful, aromatic notes of yellow and red apple peel on the nose acquire the slightest bitterness on the palate. The frothy, airy mousse is soft and the flavors are balanced, fruit-driven and have an almost autumnal, earthy apple tinge.",89,Allimant-Laugner NV Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"Juicy red and blue fruit stars in this straightforward Cab-based blend. It offers a soft, medium-bodied personality and approachable tannins.",87,Beaulieu Vineyard 2012 Tapestry Reserve Red (Napa Valley)
"Structured but elegant, it discloses delicate aromas of Spanish broom and Granny Smith apple. The savory, creamy palate delivers juicy Bartlett pear, citrus, nectarine and melon brightened by crisp acidity.",89,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano 2012 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige)
"Baga has been softened by Merlot to produce a rounded wine, with accents of spice and generous tannins. Berry fruits come strongly through the dry core, giving a rich character to the wine. The finish is full of acidity and ripe red fruits.",89,Dão Sul 2012 Quinta do Encontro Q do E Red (Bairrada)
"Smoothly textured, this wine has light minerality along with a perfumed, ripe character. It is soft and generous in the mouth, poised and attractively fruity. White fruits dominate, followed by hints of almonds. The wine is ready to drink.",88,A. D. Coutelas NV Eloge Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)
"Balanced and fairly light, this is nuanced in apple, pear and quince, with soft tannins and eager acidity that comes off as bright citrus. The texture has some creaminess that isn't overdone and the finish revisits the themes of lemon and lime.",90,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2012 Karia Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Surprisingly mature in both color and flavor development, this mixes a flavor of rhubarb pie with brown sugar accents. Soft and approachable in style this should be consumed soon.",86,Macindoe 2009 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Spicy, peppery and still a bit sharp, this Merlot-dominated blend includes fruit from both estate vineyards—Seven Hills and Pepper Bridge. It shows the seamless polish that marks all of Jean-François Pellet's wines. The finish is focused and long, with delicious highlights of cinnamon and dark chocolate.",90,Pepper Bridge 2009 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This lively white opens with aromas of grapefruit, light oak and crushed rock. On the racy palate, zesty acidity underscores yellow peach, citrus zest, ginger and a hint of vanilla. A hint of mineral marks the finish.",88,Manincor 2014 Tannenberg Sauvignon (Alto Adige Terlano)
"A tropical touch on the nose becomes more subtle on the fresh palate. Fresh spritz enlivens the slender, lemony body. This dry, subtle, fresh and clean white offers nuanced refreshment.",89,Tement 2016 Steirische Klassik Weissburgunder (Südsteiermark)
"Light aromas of apple, pear and petroleum jelly are followed by crisp acid-driven flavors. Put it on the dinner table to see it at its best.",86,Kestrel 2015 Falcon Series Estate Pinot Grigio (Yakima Valley)
"Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot come together to form an herbal, medium-bodied wine that drinks lean. Cedar, black tar and leather meet black pepper and chocolate while the tannins remain tight and firm.",87,Hensteeth 2010 Proprietary Red (Sonoma County)
"Made from traditional Port varieties, this wine is very sweet, and unfortunately there's not a lot going on beyond that. The blackberry and chocolate flavors need a lot more concentration to stand up to the residual sugar.",85,Robert Hall 2008 Vintage Port (Paso Robles)
"Bright and fruity, this is a crisp, herbal wine. From the Bougrier family estate it is perfumed, creamy and offers refreshing acidity, citrus and hints of apricots. The wine is ready to drink.",86,Bougrier 2015 Domaine Guenault Sauvignon Blanc (Touraine)
"This informal but pretty Pinot Nero opens with fragrances of red berry and spice. The bright palate offers fresh acidity and flavors of crushed cherry, strawberry and cinnamon spice.",87,Stemmari 2012 Pinot Nero (Terre Siciliane)
"Monumentally detailed, this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is impressive for its sheer volumetrics. Offers masses of blackberries, black currants, cherries and cassis.  Huge, dramatic, yet impeccably balanced and dry. Feels firm and ultrarefined in tannic structure, with graceful acidity offering a perfect counterpoint to the fruity richness. Just beautiful, and ageable for at least a decade.",97,Redmon 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
"This is almost the anti-Napa Bordeaux blend. It's drier and edgier than your typical North Coast Cab, and much less tannic, with a sweet herb edge to the flavors of cherries, red and black currant, plums, tangerine zest, licorice and cloves. Try this polished wine with anything calling for a medium-bodied red.",89,Newsome-Harlow 2005 Meritage (Calaveras County)
"A pretty rose color, this is invitingly scented with fresh strawberries and floral highlights. Flavors follow, rather light and primary, tailing off quickly into a finish with a lick of mocha.",86,La Chouette 2013 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This small, Sonoma County-focused producer headed south to make a rich, attention-grabbing wine, with aromas of dark raspberries, blackberries, pulverized cloves, black sage and tobacco leaf. The palate shows smoked beef with cherry syrup, lifted by juniper and pine sap on the midpalate and boisterous acidity. It's distinctive yet not showy.",94,MacPhail 2012 Rita's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"This wine offers lively citrus and moderate acidity—a simple dry expression of the variety that refreshes. Stainless-steel fermented, it's been aged in both stainless and neutral Burgundy oak, adding complexity around the seasonings of lemongrass and ginger.",87,Wonderment Wines 2015 Las Trancas Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Oak Knoll District)
"Very soft, creamy in the 1999 vintage style, open and warm. The Chardonnay shows richness, ripeness, with white and yellow fruit flavors, apricots and baked apples, and only the lightest hint of minerality.",90,Pascal Doquet 1999 Le Mesnil sur Oger Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)
"A steal for its price, this wine is refreshingly quaffable, with a sublimely textured palate of preserved lemon and nectarine. It's both lush and surprisingly complex.",90,Cannonball 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County)
"Pungent, feline aromas of green citrus and passion fruit filter into a citric, pulpy palate. Flavors of mixed citrus fruits, green herbs, onion and passion fruit finish heavy, with a lingering note of pickle brine.",84,Marqués de Riscal 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Rueda)
"The nose on this Navarran rosado is briny and strained. The palate is on the heavy side, while flavors of peach pit and citrus peel finish pithy and mildly bitter. This will not age well.",84,Ochoa 2013 Estate Bottled Rosado Garnacha (Navarra)
"The winery does not give us exact new oak statistics, but oak dominates the aroma and flavor of this Cab. Beyond the caramel, smoke and toasty vanilla meringue, the blackberry and currant flavors are a little thin.",85,Pine Ridge 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"Leaving aside the suggestive name and packaging, this is a very soft, almost pillowy-tender 80% Shiraz blend, with a fair bit of complexity. It starts with scents of hickory, cedar and vanilla, adds plum and black cherry fruit, then hints at espresso and black olive on the finish. Drink now.",89,Fetish 2008 Playmates Shiraz-Mourvèdre (Barossa)
"Shows aromas of cherry, raspberry and blueberry and the wine presents a friendly, fruit-forward personality overall. This Riserva Morellino is equally intense and pleasurable in the mouth.",88,Suberli 2006 Riserva  (Morellino di Scansano)
"An aromatic wine with notes of freshly cut red apple, overripe pear and jasmine. The palate drinks closer to dry than the aromas might suggest, with a phenolic feel.",85,Foris 2012 Estate Grown Riesling (Rogue Valley)
"This is a brilliant and well-executed Trebbiano d'Abruzzo with pretty tones of peach, pear and fresh grapefruit. The wine exhibits a smooth, silky texture and ends on a crisp note that adds a touch of spice on the finish.",87,Talamonti 2006 Aternum  (Trebbiano d'Abruzzo)
Pungent tones of almond skin and peanut disturb this Prosecco Brut that otherwise shows bright luminosity and persistent perlage. The sparkler has sour notes on the close and lingering nutty flavors.,81,Le Vigne di Alice 2007 Millesimato Doro Brut  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
"A barrel-fermented white Pinot Noir, this is bursting with broad, creamy flavors of ripe caramel-dipped apples and fresh pear. It might be mistaken for Chardonnay, except for the extra weight that carries through the lengthy finish. Though it's tempting to describe white Pinot Noirs as sparkling wines without the sparkle, this is much more interesting, and one of the rare examples that defines both a style and a standard for the rest.",94,Domaine Serene 2014 Coeur Blanc Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Aromas of apple, fresh hay, pineapple and natural vanilla draw you in, while the palate is lively and fresh, with citrus, pineapple and pithy lemon flavors. Juicy, clean and zesty on the finish, and chiseled in terms of structure and acidity. Very nice Albariño for the price.",89,Viña Almirante 2008 Pionero Maccerato Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Traditional Carmenère aromas of olive, greenish plum and berry are on full display here. It feels a bit acidic, with scratchy and herbal flavors of spiced plum and red berry. The finish is persistent but also abrasive and aggressive.",86,Apaltagua 2010 Envero Gran Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"Inviting aromas of violet and ripe red-skinned berry take center stage in this wine. The lively, full-bodied palate doles out juicy raspberry, red cherry and cinnamon flavors framed by velvety tannins and zesty acidity. Enjoy through 2020.",89,Damilano 2016  Barbera d'Asti
"This is a structured wine, almost tannic in character. It has a rich, textured character that will allow the wine well. Apple and pear flavors are dominant along with the spice from wood aging. Drink from 2020.",93,Albert Bichot 2014 Domaine du Pavillon Les Charmes Premier Cru  (Meursault)
"Forward scents of white raspberry, muddled cherry, pressed pink flowers and white chocolate suggest this is a ripe and rich rosé. The round palate is surprisingly juxtaposed by a sharp astringency that dominates through the finish.",84,Le Cirque 2015 Rosé (Côtes Catalanes)
The nose is rather shy while the round palate offers suggestions of yellow stone fruit and a candied citrus note. It closes on a hint of bitter almond.,86,Terre di Talamo 2015 Vento Teso Viognier (Toscana)
"Produced from the organic vineyards of Les Baux, this wine is pale in color but full of fruity flavor. The blend is Grenache (50%), Cinsault (30%) and Syrah (20%). It has a crisp, mineral texture that's tangy and fragrant with white flowers and red currants, giving it delicious apéritif style.",89,Domaine de la Vallongue 2014 Garrigues Rosé (Les Baux de Provence)
"There's something not right about the way this winery is fermenting its Cavas because both this and Oriol Rossell's regular brut are excessively foamy. As a result, this gran reserva's apple and spice aromas and flavors are rendered moot by the gaseous explosion that occurs when liquid hits palate.",80,Oriol Rossell NV Gran Reserva Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava)
"Flavors of beetroot and juicy fruit are juxtaposed in this structured yet fruity wine. It has some bitterness and a hint of wood, and there is intense acidity on the finish.",83,Herdade dos Templários 2010 Vale das Donas Red (Tejo)
"Aromas of saline, citrus fruit, passion fruit and mustard are pithy and show pyrazines. Following the nose, this is citric in feel, with orange peel and grapefruit flavors. A grassy, slightly bitter finish is snappy and suggests fresh scallion.",86,De Alberto 2014 Verdejo (Rueda)
"You could use this as a teaching tool for classic Sonoma County Zinfandel. It's full-bodied, dry and spicy, with briary flavors of wild berries, mocha, tobacco, leather and exotic spices. More importantly, it's absolutely delicious. The grapes come from Seghesio's best vineyards in the Alexander and Dry Creek valleys. At this price, it's an astonishing value, especially considering that production was nearly 80,000 cases.",93,Seghesio 2010 Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
"Woodland berry, tobacco and cooking spice aromas emerge in the glass. The medium-bodied, already approachable palate doles out juicy black cherry, star anise and white pepper notes, with a frame of ripe, tightly knit tannins. Enjoy 2018–2022.",90,Tenuta Friggiali 2012  Brunello di Montalcino
"This pretty vineyard-designate Barbera d'Alba delivers a fresh bouquet of floral, fruit and spice aromas. The wine is tonic and firm with a bright, crisp close.",87,Fontanabianca 2007 Brunet  (Barbera d'Alba)
"Jammy blackberry and cherry fruit flavors mark this wine, along with some strong tannins. It's not particularly complex, and doesn't have the balance for aging, so drink up.",84,Hooker 2011 Home Pitch Block 1 Syrah (Knights Valley)
"Dark and spicy, this has ripe fruit, prune, currant and blackberry aromas that are followed by clove, cardamom and black pepper notes. The mouthfeel is medium in terms of length and build.",87,Cantina Negrar 2010 Le Roselle  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
"From an estate in Rutherford that can't be named, this delightfully balanced Cab offers succulent plum, black olive, raspberry and cinnamon to great effect, melding the myriad sides of its personality well. Integrated oak and a medium-weight body allow the wine to breathe and expand on the palate, finishing in dust.",90,Cameron Hughes 2012 Lot 555 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A lighter, more elegant style of Cabernet, dry and classy. Likeable for its balance of acids, tannins, alcohol and oak, and rich blackberry, cassis and cedar flavors. Drink now.",87,Simple Math Cellars 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Too soft and sugary sweet for a dry table wine, although the cherry, blackberry and chocolate flavors are decadently delicious. Needs dryness and greater structural integrity.",85,Olson Ogden 2006 Stagecoach Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley)
"Aromas of toasted oak, vanilla and a confectionary note lead the nose while the palate offers mature Golden Delicious apple, butterscotch and walnut skin alongside bracing acidity.",88,Marco Felluga 2012 Mongris Riserva Pinot Grigio (Collio)
"Sweet and easygoing from the start, with candied berry and floral aromas. The palate sits at maximum ripeness, meaning it's sweet and soft but still holds its balance. Flavors of baked berry and brown sugar are generous and smooth, while the finish is mellow and lush.",88,Bodega Renacer 2010 Punto Final Malbec (Mendoza)
"Bright and juicy, this opens with heady aromas of fragrant white flower, citrus and ripe orchard fruit. Mirroring the nose, the fresh palate doles out mature apple, Bartlett pear and nectarine zest alongside a note of Mediterranean scrub.",88,Donnafugata 2016 Anthilia White (Sicilia)
"A blend of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, this structured wine opens with aromas of dried blue flower, leather, game, graphite, mature black fruit and baking spice. On the palate, velvety tannins support ripe blueberry, spicy plum and licorice. Drink through 2023.",92,Campo alla Sughera 2008 Red (Toscana)
"A firm, young, compact, nicely sculpted wine, this shows pinpoint fruit flavors of quince and pear. There are subtle highlights of gin-like botanicals, and the flavors penetrate clean and clear all the way through a lingering finish.",90,Cowhorn 2015 Viognier (Applegate Valley)
"Fresh, floral, citrusy aromas precede a well-balanced palate. Sleek, dry raspberry and plum flavors are fresh and forward, while the finish on this sparkling Mourvèdre is salty, genuine, elegant and stylish.",91,Alta Alella 2014 Privat Reserva Brut Nature Rosé Sparkling (Cava)
"Full-bodied and heavy in the Loring style, an extracted wine filled with exciting fruit and berry flavors, but lacking the delicacy and finesse you expect from Pinot Noir.",85,Loring Wine Company 2007 Keefer Ranch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Green Valley)
"Soos Creek's value-priced Sundance Red really shines in 2010. A Bordeaux-style blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot and 19% Cabernet Franc, it rivals the top-tier efforts from any number of wineries. Plum, cherry, cassis and chocolate flavors are leavened with a dash of herb. Tannins are dusty and detailed, and the wine has the stuffing to age over the next half decade or more.",92,Soos Creek 2010 Sundance Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Powerful tannins dominate this serious wine. It has a complex, dense structure, full of wood and fruit tannins, along with blackberry fruits and a touch of spiced bitter cherry. This is Beaujolais for aging. Give it at least 3–5 years.",92,Georges Duboeuf 2011 Domaine des Rosiers  (Moulin-à-Vent)
"Palazzio is Testarossa's blend of various vineyards. It showcases a regional Central Coast personality, and a fine one at that. The '06 has elements of ripe cherries, raspberries and root beer, enriched with smoky oak, and appeals for its silky, crisp mouthfeel. Best now and for a year or two.",88,Testarossa 2006 Palazzio Pinot Noir (Central Coast)
"Produced from 30-year-old vines, this 55% Cabernet Sauvignon wine is firm with tannins as well as black-currant fruit. It is balanced with the potential to become a fruity wine with a soft texture. The acidity will keep it crisp and on point. Drink from 2018.",90,Château La Branne 2014  Médoc
"Muted berry aromas expand to show some cassis. Flavors of chocolaty oak and pepper blend with blackberry and cassis, while this finishes long and spicy. Nothing about this screams out for individual attention, but the sum of its parts amounts to something very good.",89,Viña Requingua 2013 Toro de Piedra Grand Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"Earthy notes of wild mushrooms, soy sauce and citrus peel make for an unusual nose on this blend of indigenous and rare Austrian varieties Rotgipfler and Zierfandler. Friendly, ripe and rounded yellow and red apples play on the palate of this unusual but very versatile wine.",87,Johanneshof Reinisch 2013 Gumpoldskirchner Tradition White (Thermenregion)
"This combination of tingling grapefruit spice, pure lemon and leafy lemon balm on the nose is utterly disarming. The touch of green apple makes it even more alluring. The palate jumbles all of these fresh, lithe, bright and appetizing flavors together and swirls them across the palate on a joyous, light-footed lemon sweep. Oh for the pleasure of Riesling in a vintage that majors on freshness rather than ripeness. This dances on the tongue with its dryness, purity and aromatic ease. Underneath all that is concentration and a stony, firm core that anchors this in quality. A lovely, promising and utterly charming wine. Drink 2017–2030.",94,Domaine G. Metz 2014 Muenchberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"very tannic wine, with an astringent, dry mouthfeel, but it's so rich in fruit, it's enjoyable now. Floods the mouth with blackberry, cherry, plum, currant and dark chocolate flavors, edged with dusty spices. Should develop over the next six years, but if you can't wait, give it a good long decant.",91,V. Sattui 2008 Vittorio's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"The bouquet seems nutty and salinic, and overall this extra dry (meaning fairly sweet) focuses on soft and sugary mango and melon flavors. It's not as lively as it needs to be to balance the sweetness, so ultimately the wine comes up a touch flat. Imported by Freixenet USA.",84,Segura Viudas NV Aria Estate Extra Dry Sparkling (Cava)
"Celebrating the founding in 1875 of Antonin Rodet, this ripe, perfumed wine has red fruits that are opulent, gloriously drinkable already. It's ripe, softly textured, layered with delicate acidity.",88,Antonin Rodet 2010 Héritage Rodet  (Mercurey)
"Starts off with a slightly funky, struck-match aroma, but then opens to reveal tangerine, nectarine and roasted-nut scents. The flavors are an blend of all that, delivered via a rich silky-textured palate and ending long.",93,Cloudy Bay 2011 Te Koko Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Winter spices like cinnamon, clove and nutmeg waft from this full-bodied and complex wine, joining gentle black-cherry flavors on the palate. The texture is smooth and caressing, and its richness lingers on the finish.",90,Bell 2014 Canterbury Vineyard Syrah (Sierra Foothills)
"This opens with aromas of wild berry, orchard fruit and a whiff of spring blossom. On the refreshing palate, bright acidity frames tangerine zest and wild raspberry. It finishes crisp and clean.",87,Villabella 2016  Bardolino Chiaretto
"The nose of this Russian River Valley, single-vineyard offering shows positive dark berry fruit bearing mild meaty accents.  Made in a lighter style, the flavors follow the aromatic opening and the wine finishes dry with medium tannins, red berry and tea notes.",85,Mayo 1998 Ricci Vyd Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)

"Murky grassy berry aromas and a whiff of cinnamon make for a sketchy nose. This feels choppy, while quick-hitting flavors of forced oak, baking spice and murky berry fruits finish hollow.",83,Mureda 2015 Made With Organic Grapes Cabernet Sauvignon (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"Made from 60% Inzolia and 40% Catarratto, this thoroughly enjoyable wine delivers aromas of Mediterranean brush and citrus.

It's a modern, hedonistic wine with chewy density and a smooth, creamy texture.",92,Castiglion del Bosco 2004 Campo del Drago  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"This is Syrah at its rich and rugged finest, with aromas of grilled game, freshly turned earth, barnyard and even body odor. Once sipped, flavors of a blackberry-crusted roast and clove emerge, with serious tannins that will promise ageability. It's good for drinking now, but can hold until 2017.",92,Epoch Estate Wines 2011 Block B Paderewski Vineyard Syrah (Paso Robles)
"A light lemon-curd component decorates the tangy yogurt and fresh lily aromas on the nose of this bottling from a historic vineyard. It is very grippy on the palate, where the intriguing texture carries flavors of orange rind, tangerine pith, lime zest and a touch of pan-roasted pine nuts.",91,Rideau 2014 Sierra Madre Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"Big and burly, here is power from Pinot Noir. The tannins are firm, spiced with dark black fruits, rolling luxuriously around the mouth. A spike of acidity gives the wine some freshness, but it remains a big, plump wine.",88,Maison Champy 2006 Vieilles Vignes  (Gevrey-Chambertin)

"The first vintage in the firm's just-released trio of elegant sparklers is stunning, made entirely from Pinot Nero, without any added dosage. It delivers layers of aromas and flavors including red berry, ripe apple, aromatic herb, toasted bread crust and energizing mineral alongside surprisingly fresh acidity. It's extremely elegant, with great depth.",92,Ca' del Bosco 2001 Vintage Collection Dosage Zero Noir Riserva Pinot Nero (Franciacorta)
"Earth and wood aromas open to a tart berry palate. The wine has a mildly creamy texture, but the fruit seems clipped with a slight green note. High acidity gives the wine an edgy feel and it closes a bit short, with more tart berry fruit.",84,Warwick 1998 Old Bush Vines Pinotage (Stellenbosch)
This luminous wine exhibits mature notes of apricot and nectarine and has long staying power on both the nose and mouth. Pair it with fried zucchini flowers or pumpkin-filled ravioli.,85,Volpe Pasini 2007 Zuc di Volpe Ribolla Gialla (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"High alcohol and exceptionally ripe fruit are the hallmarks of this mountain vineyard. In this Zinfandel, they express themselves as blackberries, cherries and mocha that have a roasted edge, and a Port-like heat that is by no means unpleasant. But you do want to drink this Zin with dishes rich in beef, cheese and olive oil.",88,Charter Oak 2010 Monte Rosso Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley)

"At the southern end of Nuits Saint-Georges, this vineyard produces a ripe and full style of wine. This wine has those characters along with the tannins and the acidity of the vintage to produced a juicy wine that will age well. The aftertaste keeps that crunchy, crisp character. Drink it from 2019.",91,Domaine Chevillon-Chezeaux 2014 Les Porêts Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges)
"This inaugural release of Brian Carter's “Spanish Style Blend” is 70% Stone Tree vineyard Tempranillo. Carter is a supremely skillful and thoughtful blender, and the result is a luscious, mouthwatering bottle of wine that opens with a perfect mix of berries and light chocolate; scents of spice and mint; and a palate-pleasing streak of bacon fat that lingers happily in the mouth.",93,Brian Carter Cellars 2007 Corrida Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This wine is all herbal fruits, with spice from the wood-aging and lively acidity. It has considerable potential, full of its nervy texture, minerality and tight acidity. Wait at least into 2020. Tristan and Loïc Kressmann now run the family estate.",93,Château Latour-Martillac 2013  Pessac-Léognan

"A blend of Syrah and Grenache from organic vineyards gives a herbal, very southern taste to this ripe wine. It is still young and showing both acidity and a firm structure. As it develops further, it will get a rich, full and plummy character. Drink from 2017.",89,Domaine des Aspras 2013 Les Trois Frères Red (Côtes de Provence)
"A blend of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Petit Verdot, 5% Merlot and 5% Malbec, this is a tight, focused selection, with excellent precision to the black plum, blackberry, dried raspberry and cassis fruit core. Well-integrated accents of leather, cigar box and pine resin add depth and complexity. The medium-weight palate is structured yet elegant, with fine-grain, lingering tannins. Drink now through 2020.",91,Tokara 2009 Director's Reserve Red (Stellenbosch)
"A terrific wine, delicious and classic in structure. Shows the beauty of the blend, which consists of five Bordeaux varieties. Rich in cherries, blackberries, red currants, chocolate, anise and sandalwood, it has a gentle, elegant mouthfeel, and is thoroughly dry.",92,Beaulieu Vineyard 2006 Tapestry Reserve Red (Napa Valley)
"Tight but ripe elderberry aromas mingle with lots of sagebrush, hints of smoke and a crushed slate minerality on the nose of this blend. The palate's tart acidity and aggressive tannins could use a tad more mellowing, but the bright and pretty boysenberry flavors are easy to enjoy right away.",91,Montemar Wines 2013 G-S-M (Santa Barbara County)
"Boasts penetrating grapefruit aromas but also some warm, peachy accents. On the palate, its stony and minerally flavors play against a richly textured mouthfeel. The long, delicate finish shows hints of pepper and grapefruit.",88,Livio Felluga 2002 Tocai (Friuli Venezia Giulia)
"This blend of 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 29% Merlot, 15% Malbec, 10% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot is bitter and astringent.",83,AuburnJames 2013 Artist Series Red (Napa Valley)
"Good price for a crisp white wine that's this polished. Nice on its own for the savory citrus, spearmint and spicy vanilla flavors, and fine with everything from fried chicken to Cantonese.",88,Dancing Bull 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (California)
"A potpourri of floral red-fruit, dried herb and wet cement aromas lead to a racy fresh palate that's mildly complex. Oaky red-berry flavors come with a note of chocolate, while this tastes lightly herbal on a lasting well-formed finish. Drink this Carignan-Garnacha through 2021.",90,Portal del Montsant 2014 Brunus Red (Montsant)
"A steely edge sharpens this perfumed, blossomy Riesling full of ripe white peach and apricot flavors. Dry in style, it's rich and weighty on the palate with a penetrating, powerful finish. Drinks beautifully now, but likely to improve through at least 2021.",93,Prinz Salm 2013 Vom Roten Schiefer Riesling (Nahe)
"A small-production offering from the grower-producer, this is a restrained take on the variety, lightly bodied and ripened, with juicy acidity at its core. Cherry, earth and a tension of dried herb complement each other on the palate, before a lengthy finish of white pepper draped in violets closes things out.",92,Kobler 2014 Kobler Family Vineyards Syrah (Russian River Valley)
"Dry, schisty aromas of cherry and spice are reserved and elevated. This is a bright wine with juicy acidity and complexity. Flavors of baked berry fruits are minerally at the core, while the finish is smooth, mature and steady, with lasting purity. Drink through 2019.",92,Marco Abella 2008 Mas Mallola Red (Priorat)
"This late-harvest dessert wine is sweet and unctuous, with ripe aromas and flavors of peaches and nectarines drizzled with honey and dusted with sweet baking spice. The mouthfeel is thick and full, but lifted with enough acidity to keep it from feeling cloying on the close.",89,Binyamina 2010 Late Harvest Cluster Select Reserve Gewürztraminer (Galilee)
"This structured wine has a great weight of fruit behind its firm tannins. Juicy acidity gives a delicious, fragrant and ripe character. Drink this wine from 2016.",86,Georges Duboeuf 2014 Clos des 4 Vents La Madone  (Fleurie)
"Winemaker Jeff Fink is unleashing a cross-section of clones in 2012, and this take on Pommard offers delicious aromas of berry-laced crème brûlée with bay leaf. There is a bitterness at first on the tannic palate, and it washes out quickly with tart cranberries.",88,Tantara 2012 Pommard Clone Dierberg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"Winemaker: Carl Schultz. Initial scents of burnt popcorn and charred oak give way to seductive notes of black forest cake, raspberry and boysenberry that take center stage on the plush palate. Firm yet dusty tannins lend a solid structure through the close, which offers additional, lingering flavors of toasted spice, vanilla bean and campfire. The depth of fruit, solid structure and harmonious overall balance suggest this will mature well through 2024.",92,Hartenberg 2014 Cape Winemakers Guild CWG Auction Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch)
"With jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries and smoky oak, this easy-drinking Petite Sirah shows the peppery notes and thick tannins of the variety. Drink now.",84,Christine Andrew 2006 Petite Sirah (Lodi)
"This wine from Blaye sister-brother team of Marie-Pierre et Pierre-Charles Dartier is perfumed, ripe with black fruits and with a generous smooth texture. With the hint of tannin from the wood aging and the black-plum fruits, it will be a rich, generous wine. Drink from 2018.",90,Château Cailleteau Bergeron 2014 Fut de Chêne  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"Rather quiet at first, this wine unfurls into a soft but textured palate. This balanced white lives more off structure than aroma; the herbal white pepperiness is to be savored.",89,Josef Jamek 2013 Ried Achleiten Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"Ripe enough grapes, filled with blueberry and black raspberry and pepper flavors, and on the smooth and mellow side. That said, there's a rustic quality, jagged and earthy, and a hint of bitterness in the finish that detracts. —S.H.",83,Château Rodin 1999 Zinfandel (El Dorado)
"Fragrant wine, attractively perfumed, crisply fresh. It is full of ripe apples, layered with intense acidity and balanced with a warmer peach flavor. Ready to drink.",86,Louis Sipp NV Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"An enormous, complex, brooding and extraordinary Pinot Noir, a blend of Bien Nacido and Gainey's Santa Rosa Hills vineyards. Opens with a blast of peppery, cherry fruit, with tobacco and minty overtones. The rich berry flavors in a creamy texture, with sweet oak tannins, feel ripe, plush and terrific in the mouth. Editors' Choice.",93,Gainey 2001 Limited Selection Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
"There's a touch of burnt almond at the start, but this bright effort soon picks up speed thanks to delicate aromas of honey, cantaloupe and white peach. This is smooth and creamy on the finish.",86,Carpenè Malvolti NV Cuvée Brut  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Ripe aromas of blackberry and black currant come with hints of rubber and smoke. In the mouth, this is jammy but a bit flat. Peppery blackberry, dark spice and barbecued flavors finish toasty and blackened, with a note of licorice.",89,Durigutti 2012 Bonarda (Mendoza)
"A full nose of flowers and citrus is followed by quiet flavors of lemon and spice in this friendly Chardonnay from Keuka Spring. Subtle and easy, the wine will pair well with grilled fish or chicken salad.",84,Keuka Spring 2007 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"There's an overall dustiness to this wine, almost like a combination of talcum powder and dried, crushed plums and berries. Lean and slightly tart on the palate, it has a taut structure and a clean but short finish. Drink now.",84,Gilles Louvet 2010 O Made from Organic Grapes Pinot Noir (Pays d'Oc)
"This is a dark, sappy, saturated wine, and the power and grip of the fruit belies its claim of 12.9% alcohol. The Malbec is plenty ripe without being over-ripe, and the fruit retains a certain muscularity, along with a mélange of cherries, plums, rum-soaked raisins and coffee liqueur. Thoroughly delicious and captivating.",89,Tagaris 2006 Alice Vineyard Malbec (Wahluke Slope)
"This shows Merry Edwards' signature of exceptional deliciousness and drinkability, coupled with seemingly neverending depth. Made using fruit sourced from the winery's vineyard in the cooler southwestern part of the valley, near Sebastopol, this is rich in acids and soft tannins, but the flavors set it apart. Notes of raspberry, cherry, cola, tea, licorice, pepper and sandalwood abound and evolve with every sip. Drink now–2018.",95,Merry Edwards 2010 Coopersmith Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This bold wine has a very dark color and fresh, concentrated blackberry aromas. Generous berry and black pepper flavors seem to saturate the taste buds, leading to a lingering fruit and spice finish. The texture is almost viscous, as lots of fine tannins add grip. It's the rare wine with no added sulfites.",90,Frey 2013 Estate Grown Biodynamic Merlot (Mendocino)
"At this early stage of the wine's evolution, it shows some slightly pungent, sweaty notes, but they're balanced by ample ripe passion fruit aromas and flavors. It's medium in weight, with an attractively structured mouthfeel, and a bright, lengthy finish that echoes with grapefruit.",90,Nautilus 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Extra Dry, in this case, really means slightly sweet, in the crazy language of sparkling wine. But don't let that stop you from enjoying this blend of Chenin Blanc, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and French Columbard. It's clean, zesty and delightful to drink, with strawberry, lime, orange zest, sourdough bread and vanilla flavors.",86,Korbel NV Extra Dry Sparkling (California)
"Based in Epernay, this Champagne house specializes in bone-dry Champagnes. Like this bottling, they need some time before the acidity calms down. This has the potential to be delicious, crisp, and full of a bright mineral texture and citrus fruitiness. Drink from 2018.",88,Lombard et Cie NV Extra Brut Premier Cru  (Champagne)
"Lots of new oak brings buttered toast flavors to this Chardonnay. Sur lees aging adds notes of sour cream. The underlying fruit veers toward intensely flavored green apples and limes. Tasted in January, the components haven't come together. Give it until the fall of 2013.",90,Truchard 2011 Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Briny raspberry aromas are a bit murky. This smacks down hard with acidity, while the flavors run toward earthy, generic plum and berry. A salty finish with animal notes is firm but struggles with cleanliness.",82,Casa de Campo 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"An easy wine, with ripe citrus, apricot, apple and honey flavors, brightened by crisp acidity.",83,Forest Glen 2011 Tehachapi Clone Pinot Grigio (California)
"Anchored in fig, plum and berry fruit, this is a substantial effort for both the vintage and the price. It will show best with hearty, cold-weather dishes. Hints of cinnamon and chocolate extend the finish.",87,Silvan Ridge 2013 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Ripe tangerine, peach jam, vanilla and oak flavors are penetrating in this soft, creamy Chardonnay. It's a ripe, rich wine that's widely appealing.",85,Kunde 2012 C.S. Ridge Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley)
"A combination of grapefruit zest, russet-pear peel, ripe apple and fresh lemon creates a nose and palate that are alluring, refreshing and very fruity. A bit of that zestiness is also apparent on the midpalate texture that delivers crunch, finesse and an enlivening purity. The finish is dry and long, full of moreish juiciness.",93,Markus Huber 2016 Engelsberg Riesling (Traisental)
"From the mighty site, this is a mountainous wine, generous and layered with bold big flavor. Plum candy, cinnamon, nutmeg, licorice and raspberry swirl in the glass with tension and grace, finishing in a wrapping of firm oak and tannin.",93,Carlisle 2015 Monte Rosso Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley)
"Good for Fritz for holding this Cab back for a few years to let it mellow. It's still a pretty tannic, primary fruit-laden Cabernet, with briary blackberry, cherry, raspberry and red currant flavors. But judging by the firm tannins, it has an interesting future. Fine now, and should provide good drinking through 2012, at least.",90,Fritz 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley)
"Vanilla, honey, citrus and spice aromas lead this luscious white blend from Bellingham. On the palate, vanilla, lemon and creamy white fruit all mingle in a round, integrated character, but are spun with spice. A pretty, appealing white with something for everyone.",89,Bellingham 2008 Fair Maiden White (Franschhoek)
"Pineapple and lemon rind aromas lead into flavors of full-bodied honey, apple and tropical fruit. Robust and layered with flavor, but the finish is bright. An assertive and fruit-forward wine with ageable potential.",88,Lyrarakis 2015 Armi Vineyard Thrapsathiri (Crete)
"This straightforward wine has notes of fresh apple and pear. The flavors are light in style, seeming a bit dilute.",85,Kamiak 2014 Unoaked Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Hardly run of the mill, this offering is just too much like fruit juice and not enough like white wine. Basic lemon and grapefruit flavors are offset by some herbaceous grassiness, and the finish is tart, almost sour. The balance isn't really there.",83,Grgich Hills 2000 Private Reserve Style Fumé Blanc (Napa Valley)
"A fragrant Falanghina, this opens with a bright flower aroma, followed by honey and peach notes. There are touches of citrus and spice on the finish.",87,Villa Raiano 2011  Falanghina del Beneventano
"Soft and accessible, this pushes pretty cherry fruit forward with pleasant notes of toast and mocha. Fermented with native yeast, it has an extra dollop of texture and detail.",88,Beacon Hill 2014 La Collina Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Firm, pinched aromas of rubbery berry and red fruits feed into a narrow, tomatoey palate with crisp, drawing acidity and tannins. This Carignan-led blend of five grapes is herbal and briny tasting, with tomato, cassis and red-berry flavors. Length, balance and drive push an herbal finish to a good ending.",89,Garcia Schwaderer 2010 Facundo Red (Chile)
"Odd and unfamiliar aromas of citrus peel, soapy cleanser and reedy red-berry fruits elicit contemplation, not sensory pleasure. This feels narrow, with astringent tannins. Flavors of herbal tea, red berries and spice are almost like Pinot Noir, while this finishes raw, rubbery and tannic, with herbal notes.",86,Luis Segundo Correas 2011 Malbec (Mendoza)
"Black pepper, light fennel and pencil shavings give nuance to a nose otherwise consumed by dark blackberries and touches of violets. Tar and espresso kick off the sip, followed by fruity blueberries and purple flowers. The wine is chalky; still-young tannins will help it last a while.",87,Clos LaChance 2013 Meritage (Central Coast)
"Like its big brother Alabaster, this is a superb Tinta de Toro that's powerfully built but also stylish. Aromas of cassis and blackberry are dark, malty and chocolaty. Flavors of burnt toast, dark chocolate, black peppercorn and blackberry end with a tannic yet balanced swirl of licorice and minerally complexity. Drink from 2017–2030.",95,Teso La Monja 2012 Victorino  (Toro)
"Minty, ripe and concentrated, this wine has notes of sweet plum and spice, with soft, forward tannins. This is likely to mature soon.",90,Clos Badon 2008  Saint-Émilion
"The storied Carneros producer dips a toe into Oregon with this new release. It's got ample herbal aromatics and bright, brambly berry fruit, with cinnamon-stick highlights. Quite young and tight, it has a few rough edges to be smoothed out with additional bottle age. This will drink best from 2020–2025.",91,Etude 2013 Yamhill Vista Vineyard Pinot Noir
"This is a dry, full-bodied deal of a wine, offering melon, papaya and zesty acidity around plenty of breadth and depth. Textured and luxurious, it finishes in ginger and Asian pear.",90,RouteStock 2013 Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Rooty and baked-smelling on the nose, this also has milk chocolate and leaf aromas. It feels spunky and fresh. Herbal, leafy flavors of roasted berries and spices set up the rooty, warm, baked-tasting finish that's full in feel but short on complexity.",86,Tres Palacios 2010 Family Vintage Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"A solid everyday Merlot that offers plenty of ripe berry, cherry and smoky oak flavors now. Dry and tannic, it has enough stuffing and class to pair with a nice steak.",85,Simi 2005 Merlot (Sonoma County)
This wine is pale salmon in color with aromas of pear and lees. It drinks dry with savory flavors of smoke and spice that linger. It's a unique offering from the appellation.,86,Siren Song 2013 La Vie Est Belle Estate Grown Pinot Noir Rosé (Lake Chelan)
"Integrated aromas of blackberry, road tar and spice cake set up a palate with pounding tannins and overt tartaric acidity. Earthy blackberry and baking-spice flavors are long and lasting on the finish. This is 40% Malbec, 30% Tempranillo and 30% Syrah.",90,Antigal 2009 Aduentus Mediterráneo Red (Mendoza)
"A Blanc de Noirs from Malbec, this aromatic wine has just a hint of tannins from the grape skins along with attractive acidity. It's a surprisingly fresh and fruity wine in the context of Malbec. Drink now.",86,Château de Gaudou NV Gaudou Exception Brut Malbec (Vin Mousseux)
"This is a bit clipped on the nose, with notes of saline, seashell, metal, leather and earthy blackberry. The palate feels wide and a touch wayward, while leathery berry and plum flavors include a note of mushroom. Lemony oak and herbal notes rise up on the finish.",89,Bodega San Pedro Regalado 2011 Embocadero  (Ribera del Duero)
"Stainless steel fermented, this pure varietal is bursting with a tasty fruit bowl mix of apple, pineapple, and Meyer lemon. A hint of mint sneaks in, and the acidity brings bracing minerality to the finish.",90,Boomtown 2008 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A smooth and ripe wine, packed with black fruits and some firm tannins that lend support. It is structured, juicy and full of strong spice, with dense texture. It should age a while longer, so drink from 2017.",88,Herdade de São Miguel 2013 Herdade da Pimenta Pimenta Preta Red (Alentejano)
"Mainly from Castelão with a little Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a ripe, full-bodied and complex wine. Tannins shoot through the solid black fruits, while acidity laces the texture. Flavors of chocolate, spice and final freshness promising short-term aging. Drink from 2015.",88,Quinta do Casal Branco 2013 Capoeira Tinto Red (Tejo)
"Iris, violet, steeped cherry, camphor and underbrush aromas come together in the glass. The chewy, succulent palate offers red cherry, raspberry, aromatic herb and star anise while firm but refined tannins provide backbone and a velvety mouthfeel. It boasts balance, freshness and body. Drink 2018 through 2025.",94,Nada Giuseppe 2011 Casot Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"Rusty pink in color, this bottling shows somewhat sour aromas of red plum, turned earth, orange rind and tart raspberry. The palate offers dried cherry and more soil, but is missing the texture and acidity of many modern rosés.",86,JCR 2016 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
"A nose of lemon and petrol opens into flavors of lemon, pears, petrol and white flowers, with slightly overpowering toast notes. Tannins are a bit stiff for an otherwise bright white that has a slightly tart finish.",85,Psagot 2012 Chardonnay (Judean Hills)
"Intense aromas that recall tomato vine, hay, stone fruit and dill lead the nose. The vibrant palate shows honeydew melon, grapefruit and mineral alongside zesty acidity that leaves a tangy finish.",89,Zorzon 2014 Sauvignon (Collio)
"Herbal and thin, this is not the fleshy, fruity style typical of Oregon Pinot Gris. Dilute flavors of apple and melon are smothered in herbs.",84,Del Rio 2013 Estate Grown Pinot Gris (Rogue Valley)
"Aromas of nettle, gooseberry, grapefruit and mineral are sharp, distinct and varietally appropriate, while the wet, short palate is hollow but edged by green apple, gooseberry and other green fruit flavors. Zesty on the finish, but a little pithy. Drink right away.",85,Root:1 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"Mocha, caramel and nutmeg lend complexity to a nose driven by blackberry and blueberry notes. The soft and dense palate shows lots of serious flavors, from fennel and asphalt to thick blueberry juice, with solid tannins that are chunky in a good way.",89,Sextant 2013 Wheelhouse Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"Nettle and gritty citrus aromas suggest matchstick. In the mouth, this SB pumps citrus notes and minerality, while flavors of tangerine, lime and lemon are zesty and shearing. An acid-driven finish confirms the wine's one-note, chiseled quality.",88,Concha y Toro 2013 Marques de Casa Concha Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley)
"This hefty Merlot smells of iodine and berry fruits. While the palate is blocky and tannic in feel, that's an appropriate canvas for oaky, spicy herbal black-fruit flavors. On the finish, overt oak and char confirm that this is dark and burly as a whole.",87,Lapostolle 2014 Casa Grand Selection Merlot (Rapel Valley)
"Round and ripe, this opens with aromas of black plum, vanilla, mocha and earthy note of tilled soil. The one-dimensional palate doles out rich blackberry, plum and espresso along with a confectionary note.",87,Cantine Menhir 2012 N Zero Negroamaro (Salento)
"While the nose is on the simple side, with ultraripe—almost confected—cherry, cocoa powder, flowers and medicinal herbs, it's the palate that draws you in. Fresh acidity, particularly for the variety, and a good lick of tannins round out this sleek, well-structured wine. Drink now–2025.",91,Hentley Farm 2015 The Old Legend Grenache (Barossa Valley)
"Fine and dry and crisp in mouthwatering acidity that brightens the lemongrass, gooseberry, vanilla and spice flavors. The tingly, secondary fermentation evident in June 2009 should settle out by Fall.",86,Voss 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Dusty berry and plum aromas register as fresh but simple. This is similar on the palate: fresh and fruity, but not too serious. Flavors of plum and cherry are raw and drawing, while the finish sports supportive juicy acidity.",87,Atalayas de Golbán 2013 Linde  (Ribera del Duero)
"This is a ripe, plump rosé that's highly “smashable,” as young Aussies would say. Mixed red berry fruit is underscored by a dash of lime on the finish. Drink now.",88,Evans & Tate 2015 Breathing Space Rosé (Australia)
"A mixture of coconut, cedar and marzipan scents along with gritty, briary black-fruit aromas precedes a lively palate with weight, power and balance.

Drink through 2018.",91,Septima 2010 Gran Reserva Red (Mendoza)
"Generous notes of ripe, juicy pear lead on nose and palate of this wine. An earthy, slightly bitter edge lends definition and texture but undereath it all lies the purity of fresh-cut Conference pear and lemon. This wine is bone-dry and lip-smackingly refreshing.",91,Domaine Ostertag 2014 Barriques Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"A blend of fruit from Watermill, Funk, Lewis and Anna Marie vineyards, the aromas bring vibrant notes of flowers, ham hock, berry, tapenade, herb and ember.

Open a couple of hours in advance to let this breathe.",92,Il Paradiso di Manfredi 2009  Brunello di Montalcino

"Powerful and entering its mature stage. Aromas on this Cab-Carmenère blend are typically earthy and lightly baked, with leaf, tobacco and nutmeg accents.

"Peppery spice and a nose of violets and roses mark the entry and midpalate of this wine, priced moderately for the appellation.

"This Grenache-dominant rosé, with 10% Carignan and 10% Cinsault, opens with delicate notes of just-ripe peach, white flowers and garrigue herbs.

It's balanced and refreshing, and best enjoyed now.",88,Castelmaure 2016 Vin-Gris Rosé (Corbières)
"Simple but well made, it discloses pretty aromas of yellow flowers. The bright palate delivers zesty citrus, pear and melon alongside crisp acidity. Pair with seafood salad or sip as an apéritif.",85,Cantina di Soave 2012 Re Midas  (Soave)
"A structured and still young wine from the estate owned by the Tari family, formerly of Château Giscours in Margaux.

Drink this from 2019.",93,Domaine de la Bégude 2014 Red (Bandol)
"This Chardonnay is striking in its ability to convey marshmallow roasting over a campfire. It's full-bodied and lush, its rich fruit core of apple and pear seemingly dressed in clarified butter. That richness, however, doesn't weigh down the palate; it finishes with refinement.",90,David Bruce 2014 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Yeasty, bready notes blend with nectarine and baked apple aromas in front of a round, layered palate. This offers a complex set of flavors that include yeasty bread, baked apple and citrus fruits.

The palate is lively and tart with underripe blackberries, sesame oil and a sizzling acidity.",89,Comartin 2013 Tierra Alta Vineyard Syrah (Ballard Canyon)
"Reduced wild-berry aromas are granular but succeed in setting up a firm, tannic palate. Flavors of blackberry, cassis and prune end with cookie-like notes of Graham cracker as well as toast. As a whole, this Syrah-Garnacha-Cabernet Sauvignon blend is muscular, tannic and brawny; drink through 2020.",90,Finca Casa Lo Alto 2010 Reserva Red (Utiel-Requena)
"This brawny wine leads with aromas of blue flower, red berry, spice and a whiff of wet soil. The palate offers succulent wild cherry layered with notes of sweet vanilla, mint, espresso and thyme alongside rather angular tannins and evident alcohol.",89,Uccelliera 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
"This medium-bodied Riesling shows some already-evolving notes of honey, truffle and petrol wrapped around its core of apple and citrus. Seems a little on the sweeter side of the trocken spectrum.",88,Prinz Salm 2009 Wallhausen Johannisberg GG Trocken Riesling (Nahe)
"This is a big, ripe and fruity wine. It is now maturing well into a rich, solid, complex wine. This second wine from the Mouchão estate in Alentejo is gorgeous, opulent and rich.

"Here's a big, inky dessert wine, sporting a dark garnet, almost black color, with masculine aromas of mesquite wood, barbecue sauce, root beer, prune and jammy blackberry.

"Red cherry is the main theme here although there are subtle shadings of white peppercorn and dried flowers within its lean, ruby-colored essence. The wine imparts a sour note on the palate and has a quick, tart finish.",85,Monte del Frá 2005 Corvina (Garda)
"Floral and lightly soapy, this is clean and simple, with bare bones varietal character. Drink it chilled within the first couple of years after release.",86,Château Bianca 2013 Gewurztraminer (Willamette Valley)

"Creamy oak and raisiny notes announce ripeness and richness that turn to complexity as this Syrah airs out. In the mouth, this is full-force, with choppy tannins and tomato-like acidity. Spice, herb and plum flavors finish dry, toasty and well balanced. Drink through 2021.",91,Clunia 2014 Syrah (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)
"This aromatic brooder shows notes of dark cherry, barrel spice, pencil lead, vanilla and herb, along with a light floral note. The palate has nuance and detail with balance that is impressive. Give it some time in the cellar to strut its stuff. Best after 2023.",93,Betz Family 2014 Heart of the Hill Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"Made from certified organic fruit, this impressively dark and tannic bottling is essentially the second wine of Huia. Dark cherries and vanilla finish firm. Drink it now with grilled meats, or hold it until 2018–2019 and see how it develops in the cellar.",86,Hunky Dory 2015 Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
"The aromas explore Cabernet's greener side, with overt notes of bell pepper along with vanilla and other barrel spices. The black-fruit flavors show richness, with grainy tannins backing them up. This wine is best for those who enjoy the variety's savory aspects.",90,Barons 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))

"One of the historic winery's more widely available bottlings, this blend of 50% Grenache, 45% Mourvèdre and 5% Cinsault plays the lighter red fruit side of the spectrum.

The palate conveys spiced raspberry, plum and cranberry, proving tight and light.",88,Zaca Mesa 2012 Z Cuvee Red (Santa Ynez Valley)
"It's hard to find any interpretations of this white Italian grape in California. This one by Brian and Stephanie Terrizzi shows flint, green apples, tangerine blossoms and yellow rose on the nose.

"Juicy cherry fruit flavors with some fine tannins, pepper, spice and dry wood edges. This is a friendly, easy Bordeaux with plenty of fruit.",85,Pezat 2005  Bordeaux Supérieur
"A scent of fresh-squeezed orange juice is likable, while this feels grabby and rubbery but hollow. The finish is all flavors of apple and pickled green fruits.",84,Fuego Blanco 2016 Gewürztraminer (Pedernal Valley)
"This wine's aromas are bright and fruit forward, with generous black pepper, raspberry, fresh flower, smoked meat and barrel spice notes. The full-bodied palate delivers cranberry flavors that are appealing but more ponderous than the aromas might suggest.",89,Kestrel 2013 Falcon Series Estate Syrah (Yakima Valley)
This Chianti has a fragrance of berry with a whiff of violet. The palate is soft and offers plump black cherry and raspberry with a note of nutmeg and clove. Not much complexity but it has savory flavors. Drink soon with cured meats or pecorino cheese.,87,Piazzano 2012 Rio Camerata  (Chianti)

"An absolutely stunning selection, this opens with herbal tones of verbena, lime leaf and fynbos that sit atop a core of honeydew rind, apple and white peach. The medium-weight palate is sleek and smooth, but not flat, enlivened by bright acidity and a stony minerality. The just-ripe flavors of pear, citrus and melon carry through to the long finish. It's delicious now, but should age well through 2022.",93,Mullineux 2014 Granite Chenin Blanc (Swartland)
"Another fine brut from Korbel, dry, yeasty and citrusy, just like a good bubbly should be. It's a little rough and scoury in the bubbles, but at this price, a good deal.",87,Korbel NV Brut Sparkling (California)

Drink after 2016 for additional complexity.",90,Mazzi 2008 Vigneto Punta di Villa  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)

"Heavy oak is a front-row theme throughout this tannic, extracted, black-tinted Garnacha. Hot fudge sundae and sawmill aromas lead to a palate that's as tannic as sandpaper. Its charred, heavily oaked flavors finish chocolaty, with a lasting and overbearing taste of clove, lacking balance and clarity of fruit.",85,Lamin 2010 Viñas Viejas Garnacha (Calatayud)
"A blend of Inzolia and Catarratto, this has a slender mouthfeel, followed by a bright citrus note at the finish. It's an easy wine to enjoy with appetizers or finger foods.",85,Principi di Spadafora 2011 Alhambra White (Sicilia)
"White flower, lychee and apple aromas carry the mellow bouquet. The chunky-feeling palate bears powdery, sweet flavors of peach and melon, mixed with greener notes of grass and lime.

"Based in the Grand Cru village of Cramant, this producer has access to some fine vineyards which go into its nonvintage cuvée. It is textured, tight, fruity and with fine acidity to cut through the apple and lemon fruitiness. Drink now.",90,Voirin-Jumel NV Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)

A four-acre parcel of old vines is the source of this dense and rich wine. It has jammy red berry and cherry fruits that are lifted by the mineral texture and acidity. The wine is balanced although it does need to age. Drink from the end of 2017.,90,Terroirs et Talents 2015 Clos de la Brosse  (Saint-Amour)
"Fresh berry fruits, light tannins and stalky black currants, sustained by tannins. It is juicy, the wood a mist in the bright fruit flavors. There is some aging potential, maybe 4–5 years.",90,Château Phélan-Ségur 2007  Saint-Estèphe
"This makes a nice change from the simply fruity norm. The color is a traditional light garnet with a bronze rim, while the aromas resemble rhubarb and raspberries. Flavors are earthy, savory and meaty rather than straightforward grapy. The texture is rather soft, the tannins muted and the body not too full.",87,Philo Ridge 2010 Marguerite Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"The year 2009 seems to have been a tannic one in Fleurie, producing wines that will benefit from some aging. This fits that bill well, a mineral and austere black fruit flavored wine, with a smoky aftertaste to go with tight acidity.",88,Georges Duboeuf 2009 La Madone  (Fleurie)
"There are some rough edges here, as well as a touch of bitterness. The quince and spiced apple flavors are crisp and fresh with a peppery character. The wine that is very dry and firm on the finish.",85,Domaine Gresser NV Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)

"Grown in what might be the coolest climate Syrah vineyard in the state, this bottling is ferociously peppery on the nose, where tar, elderberry and seedy huckleberry scents add to its dark aromatic profile. Pepper and tar show on the palate as well, alongside purple flower and espresso bean flavors, with a slight caramel touch on the finish.",93,Saint K 2013 Presqu'ile Vineyard Syrah (Santa Maria Valley)
"From the Conca vineyard in La Morra, this Barolo shows the uneven ripening that plagued much of this village in 2009. It shows predominantly wood aromas of chocolate and toast, and the palate is also dominated by oak sensations. The fruit appears to have dried up, leaving only aggressive, astringent tannins.",84,Mauro Molino 2009 Vigna Conca  (Barolo)
"As with tawny Ports, the other Douro fortified wine, Moscatel, is aged in wood for an average of a decade. In this 10-year old, the wine still has its fruit, but it is just starting to show old wood aging flavors that are beginning to concentrate it. There is a strongly perfumed, spicy aftertaste. Drink now.",88,Adega de Favaios NV 10 Anos  (Moscatel do Douro)
"While more mineral than fruity, this briskly structured dry Riesling offers loads of mouthwatering refreshment. Zesty lime and lemon-pith flavors awaken the midpalate, leading to a long, stony finish. Drink now through 2021.",89,Pflüger 2015 Buntsandstein Trocken Riesling (Pfalz)
"This irresistible, lightly frizzante and utterly refreshing wine is a gem. Orange flesh and rind has a slightly candied potency, with outstanding purity, focus and length. In spite of the sweetness, it retains offsetting minerality and acidity, making it a perfect apéritif or brunch wine.",92,LaStella 2013 Moscato d'Osoyoos Moscato (Okanagan Valley)
"Framingham is one of New Zealand's top Riesling producers, so it's good to see this bottling again here in the States. It opens with hints of wet stone and moss, then proves more generous on the palate, adding notes of apple, citrus and honey. For a wine that's described as “off dry,” it tastes pretty dry on the lingering finish.",90,Framingham 2013 Classic Riesling (Marlborough)
"The aromas of this fresh, tangy wine are like parsley, garlic and lemon, and the flavors add in tart grapefruit and green tea notes. Lively, assertive and refreshing, the wine will shake up cocktail hour or a seafood course.",90,Sanglier Cellars 2014 Wild Tusque Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County)
"Hickory, roasted black fruit, vanilla, rubber and plastic aromas set up a big but balanced feeling palate. Flavors of roasted blackberry are rubbery and come with oaky vanilla, while this feels good on the finish with an overriding oak character in the driver's seat.",86,Conde de Siruela 2011 Roble  (Ribera del Duero)
"Rich and complex, this dry, terroir-driven wine completely avoids the sweet butter creaminess and jamminess of so many Chardonnays, showcasing instead notes of tropical fruits and pears. It's framed by minerals and even a fresh herbaceousness that suggests the wild plants growing around this Sonoma Coast vineyard. While the oak influences are strong, they are perfectly in keeping with the underlying volume.",96,Del Dotto 2009 Cinghiale Vineyard Family Reserve Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"From a cool site overlooking the ocean in Occidental, this is a feral, earthy wine, with a nose of garden patch, black tea and orange. Juicy at its core, it's structured in smooth tannin. Hints of new oak provide pleasant accents without overburdening the herbal and fruity core.",90,The Withers Winery 2014 English Hill Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Concentrated aromas of raspberry, black cherry and blackberry set up a palate with moderately structured tannins. Flavors of blackberry, cassis and toast are nuanced. While this wine is dark and grapy on the finish, with a sense of smoothness. rounds it out.",89,Algairen 2015 Garnacha (Cariñena)
"Sporting scents a flavors of root beer, beet root and cola, this lighthearted effort seems built for immediate consumption. The black cherry fruit carries a medicinal streak, the length is modest and the mouthfeel just a bit dilute.",87,Soléna 2013 Willakia Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Brioche and vanilla-cherry are the stars in this full-bodied yet savory, herbal wine sourced mostly from the Oak Knoll District. Complex in flavor, it spikes in clove and cinnamon, finishing with a taste of gunpowder and tobacco.",90,Padis 2011 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Creamy aromas of vanilla and pears also carry some typical Sauvignon Blanc pungency. For a rounder style, which it is, it's quite refreshing. The mix across the palate of banana, grapefruit and almonds is attractive, and so is the round, pretty finish. Drink it very soon.",87,Santa Ines 2001 Legado de Armida Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Maipo Valley)
"A highly perfumed, lime-dominated wine that gets some freshness from apple skins and high acidity. Its flavors do feel awkward, fresh from the candy shop rather than the vineyard.",82,DFJ Vinhos 2007 Monte Alentejano Branco White (Alentejano)
"With attractive wood aging and lemon flavors, this is a delicious, rich wine. It needs a couple of years, while already developing well. Acidity enlivens green plum and red apple flavors.",90,Quinta de Chocapalha 2009 Chocapalha Reserva Branco White (Lisboa)
"Toast with apricot jam comes first to mind in this nicely balanced white that begins in richness and evolves in the glass to offer a freshness of lime zest and grapefruit, the minerality well-defined.",90,Robert Mondavi 2013 Reserve Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Lovely aromatics suggest wet stone, raspberry and pomegranate. This is a sleek, subtle wine. Its winery notes suggest it is a “slow bloomer” in the glass, which proves out if you give it that chance. It's balanced and resonant, with the promise of further improvement with another few years of bottle age.",91,Coeur de Terre 2014 Abby's Block Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Nick Elliott's blend of 53% Grenache, 28% Syrah and 19% Mourvèdre offers crushed black raspberries, boysenberries, rose petals and touches of oak and caramel on the nose. The palate shows shows tar, black pepper and slightly sour blueberry, proving straightforward.",88,Nicora 2013 G-S-M (Central Coast)
"Cranberry and strawberry make for a pretty, fruity wine that's velvety in texture and full bodied in depth and length. Black tea and a backbeat of orange and lemon add to the tartness of this layered, complex red.",91,Saintsbury 2014 Sundawg Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Green Valley)
"A packed wine, its ripe fruits are a warm pleasure. It has all the structure of the year but in fine measure, lending density and richness to the palate. It's a wine for aging; give it at least five years.",89,Château Gauthier 2010  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux
"While there is a youthful stalky element to this wine, it also has plenty of ripe black-cherry fruit. That suggests a warm ripe future as the tannins soften. Drink this potentially rich, spicy wine from 2019.",88,Isabelle et Pierre Clément 2015 Tradition  (Menetou-Salon)
"Aromas of crushed stones and smoke lend a dusty mineral tone to this steely, savory-style Riesling. It's dry on the palate, yet refreshingly lean with a kick of lemon-lime acidity that reverberates through the finish. A surprisingly elegant wine at a bargain price.",89,Villa Wolf 2012 Dry Riesling (Pfalz)
Both the aromas and the palate shout out the wood aging that's been used in this wine. It is still young and the spice and burnt toast character should soften further into the ripe blackberry fruits. The texture is certainly concentrated and firm; a wine with a good future. Drink from 2017.,89,Domaine Chiroulet 2011 Grande Réserve Red (Côtes de Gascogne)
"Combining Cabernet with Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot, in that order percentage-wise, this is a well-made wine. Oaky and dusty with refined tannins, its fruit brightly centers around raspberry and red currant.",90,Conn Creek 2012 Anthology Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Slaty minerality frames bold pineapple and lime aromas and flavors in this medium-bodied, nearly dry Riesling. Fresh and minerally on the finish.",87,Knipser 2006 Laumersheimer Kapellenberg Kabinett Trocken Riesling (Pfalz)
"Softly tannic, sexy and delicious, with waves of berry-cherry pie filling and mocha for richness, and drier, tarter notes of currants, leather, rhubarb and pomegranates, accentuated with smoky wood. A blend of Grenache and Syrah, it's sophisticated and nuanced. Try as an interesting, more food-friendly alternative to Cabernet Sauvignon.",94,Prospect 772 2007 The Brat Red (Sierra Foothills)
"Old vines—in this case with an average age of 50 years—give an extra concentration to this impressively rich wine. It is full of beautifully ripe apple and apricot fruit flavor, with a great zing of acidity. Age for a year. Screwcap.",90,Ebner-Ebenauer 2010 Alte Reben Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
Full body and powerfully fruity flavors make this sweet wine seem extra bold. It smells like toasted almonds and dried meat and tastes like poached peaches. A smooth but lively texture keeps the flavors zinging on the finish.,92,Uvaggio NV Passito Vermentino (Lodi)
"This has spice and dried fruit notes, plus firmly structured tannins. The refreshing acidity partners with the fruit, creating a wine that still needs a few years to age.",87,Château Laulerie 2010 Le Raisin Merlot (Bergerac)
"Lime and floral notes create a light and breezy bouquet that's easygoing. In the mouth, it's juicy and fresh, with lemon-lime, peach, nectarine and lychee flavors. Tangy and fresh on the finish, and more precise and delicate than most Argentinean Torrontés.",88,Trapiche 2010 Broquel Torrontés (Cafayate)
"Only 100 cases of this vintage-designated oloroso were made, and now it smells mature, nutty and oily. A full, elegant palate shows the right weight and acidic cut, while salty flavors of peanut and caramel finish long, nutty and a touch hot due to 22% abv.",92,Bodegas Hidalgo 1986 Oloroso Single Vintage Single Vineyard Sherry (Jerez)
"This is a smoothly crafted, delicate blend of 61% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Franc. Its ethereal nature does not preclude plenty of quiet power, which provides a sturdy foundation for the bright cassis and raspberry flavor. Subtle spice box, cedar and cigar add to its complexity and length.",94,Alpha Omega 2012 Proprietary Red (Napa Valley)
"Absorbingly complex with racy, textural, mineral-driven flavors, this excellent wine features fleshy apple and pear fruit, crisply defined and extended. The low alcohol—just a tad over 13%—keeps the acids front and center; the wine is immaculately fresh, with just a touch (0.7%) of residual sugar.",92,Lujon 2009 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"This is a superrich, smooth wine. The acidity is what keeps the ripe yellow-fruit flavors in order, and it has a lemon-like edge to the tropical mouthfeel. Age this for 3–4 years.",91,Olivier Leflaive 2010 Sous le Dos d'Ane Premier Cru  (Meursault-Blagny)
"Burnt brown sugar, caramel sauce, baked plum, fig and milk chocolate abound on the nose of this rich, decadent selection. Well balanced and incredibly easy to like, lush dark-fruit flavors lead the medium-weight palate, while notes of milk chocolate and baking spice linger on the close.",89,Diví Elegància NV Tuilé Red (Rivesaltes)
"Here's a clean, dry, light-bodied white wine with green-apple and celery aromas and flavors that are very mild. The first sip is crisp and refreshing, and it turns softer and leaner on the finish.",83,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi 2013 Pinot Grigio (California)
"The shade of this Kathy Joseph creation is that of rosé-colored sunglasses. Such comfort is furthered with a cherry cola and maraschino cherry nose. A slight effervescent zing on the palate accompanies pomegranate flavors followed by an impressively long finish. Great with a fresh garden salad, but able to handle more substantial fare too, such as  breaded chicken cutlets or a cheeseburger.",89,Fiddlehead 2013 Rosé Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Ripe aromas of black plum, blueberry and charcoal lead to a palate that's muscular and full-bodied. Dark, peppery, slightly bitter flavors of toasted blackberry and prune end with burnt notes and black pepper along with grabby, rubbery tannins.",89,DiamAndes 2012 de Uco Malbec (Uco Valley)
"A really great mountain Zinfandel that shows luscious power and fruit at a fair price. The flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, oranges, cloves and white pepper flood the palate and are just wonderful to experience. At this price, buy this Zin by the case.",88,Karly 2005 Pokerville Zinfandel (Amador County)
"This 100% Lagrein opens with aromas of black-skinned berries, baking spices and licorice. The medium-bodied concentrated palate delivers black plums, mocha and clove alongside firm tannins and fresh acidity. Drink through 2019.",89,Tiefenbrunner 2014 Linticlarus Riserva Lagrein (Alto Adige)
"Hailing from the Montalcino area of Tuscany, this Sangiovese-based wine offers crisp nuances of white cherry and cassis, backed by touches of savory spice and bitter almond. The palate is clean, polished and silky.",87,La Togata 2008 Azzurreta Sangiovese (Toscana)
"Nice, classic black currant and cedar flavors in this dry young wine, with some firm minerality. The tannin structure is evident in the form of a tough astringency. Give it 6–8 years in the cellar.",90,Buehler 2009 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
"As might be expected from winemaker Roman Bratasiuk, this is a full-bodied, rich Syrah, loaded with dark scents of roast coffee, blueberries and baking spices. Blueberry, menthol and spice flavors dominate the palate, finishing long. Despite the massive richness, there's plenty of elegance, too. Imported by Wine Brokers Unlimited.",93,Clarendon Hills 2005 Hickinbotham Syrah (Clarendon)
"Here's a very attractive and seductive Barolo with chiseled mineral tones that really help the wine stand out in a crowd. Layers of graphite and slate give purity, linearity and clarity to this austere and elegant expression. Earthy tones, as well as forest berry flavors, appear on the long finish.",92,Tenuta Arnulfo 2006 Costa di Bussia  (Barolo)
"Sweet, light and floral, but not fruity. Lemon and orange flavors yield to a zesty finish. Simple and very high in acidity.",82,Mommessin 2002 Nid D'Abeille Chardonnay (Vin de Pays d'Oc)
"This is a sexy wine from one of New Zealand's biodynamic stars. The aroma is a heady blend of cinnamon and earth notes, alongside game, chocolate, ripe red fruits, warm stones, and forrest floor. The palate manages to walk a line between plush and tart, savory and silky, and powerful and elegant. Drink now–2024.",92,Rippon 2011 Rippon Mature Vine Pinot Noir (Central Otago)
"Red rose, mature wild berry, dark cooking spice and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find on this gorgeous wine. The structured, elegant palate delivers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice pipe tobacco and mocha balanced by firm, silky tannins and surprising freshness for the vintage.",94,Paolo Scavino 2009 Rocche dell'Annunziata Riserva  (Barolo)
"This Salice Salentino hits a nice balance between mineral nuances and fruit tones, making for a very food-friendly combination. The wine has a smooth texture with flavors of spice, tea and currant berry.",87,Castello Monaci 2006 Lianta Negroamaro (Salice Salentino)
"Tastes sharp in acidity and frankly sweet, with sugary blackberry and cherry jam flavors that finish in a swirl of baking spices. The blend is Syrah, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah.",86,Cinnabar NV Cruvée Lot III Red (California)
"Fruity and juicy, this has soft tannins and an open, gentle texture. It has red currant fruit that gives acidity, with only a touch of dry tannins on the finish.",85,Château la Valade 2008  Premieres Côtes de Blaye
"A bright ripe fruit aroma like pineapple and ripe, luxurious fig, vanilla and almond flavors combine for an explosion of delicious power on the palate. This full-bodied wine has lots of depth and breadth in texture, plus a long, lingering finish.",92,Skinner 2014 Viognier (El Dorado)
Great juicy black fruits shine through this rich and complex wine that shows considerable style. The aftertaste is full of fresher acidity and juicy berry fruits. Drink from 2017.,92,Château Canon la Gaffelière 2011  Saint-Émilion
"Gorgeous rose petal, spice and stone-fruit aromas waft from this intensely aromatic wine. It's juicy on the palate with sweet lychee flavor but balanced with elegant tea tones. Round and rich in feel with powerful body and alcohol, it finishes with a bristle of astringency.",89,Sheldrake Point 2012 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes)
"Almost a repeat of the ‘05, in which the oak dominated everything else. Those waves of caramel and buttered toast taste good, and together with the pineapples and pears, give the wine an exotic taste of some creamy, spicy, honey-rich mashed fruit pudding.",87,Chateau St. Jean 2006 Robert Young Vineyard Chardonnay (Alexander Valley)
"This elegant Barolo shows tight astringency and firm layers of red fruit, spice, crushed stone and tobacco. It needs a few more years to find harmony. Drink after 2018.",91,Poderi Luigi Einaudi 2008 Nei Cannubi  (Barolo)
"Grass, citrus fruits, feline and canned green-vegetable aromas lead into a plump, round palate. Green bean, passion fruit, lemon-lime and bell pepper flavors end with strong influences of arugula and asparagus. This is coastal-driven and green, but good.",86,Santa Luz 2014 Gran Reserva Corte Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley)
"Hard and tannic at first, this young wine grudgingly reveals a core of very tart cherry fruit, encased in flavors of stem and wood. A coffee-infused finish does not conceal the chewy, tough tannins.",86,Gamache 2008 Estate Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Dark as a moonless midnight, dry as dust, with hard-edged tannins, this Cabernet is almost undrinkable now in its extreme youth. It shows a massive core of blackberries, currants, dark baker's chocolate and smoky oak, and the balance of acidity makes it clean and bright. All indications are of a cellarworthy wine. Drink 2014 and beyond.",92,Arrowood 2007 Reserve Speciale Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley)
"From the Ferrington and Monument Tree Vineyards, the latter now owned by Twomey, this delicate Pinot has an aura of baked bread on the nose followed by just-ripe Bing cherry. With firm tannins and a subtle texture, it is a delight to drink and to pair. You couldn't go wrong with a pork roast swaddled in mushrooms.",92,Twomey 2011 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Moist soil, menthol, new leather, violet and cellar floor aromas come together in this Rosso. The fresh, straightforward palate offers tart cherry and clove flavors, with both lithe tannins and brisk acidity.",87,Le Casalte 2014  Rosso di Montepulciano
"From the estate's Alfio Moriconi Selection range, this 90-10 blend of Sangiovese and Canaiolo opens with strange aromas of tar, resin and molten asphalt that appear behind the cherry fruit.",83,La Castellina 2007  Chianti Classico
"Andis's 100% Barbera tempts with ripe, dried black-cherry and mint flavors, and toasty layers of coffee and toffee that linger until the finish.",88,Andis 2010 Barbera (Amador County)
"Produced from old vines in the Côte du Py on the slopes of an extinct volcano, this cru wine is structured with generous black fruits and a series of ripe tannins and balanced acidity. It has the structure and density to age while also having a light touch of black cherry fruit. Drink from 2019.",93,Stéphane Aviron 2015 Côte du Py Vieilles Vignes  (Morgon)
"Despite good persistence and appealing earth and leather flavors, this Barbaresco fails to hit the mark. Aromas of paint thinner undermine the cherry fruit and flatten out the flavors in the mouth.",83,Pier 2001 Vila Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"A textured and minerally wine, this is wine has plenty of citrus flavor. It is fruity and crisp, and it offers a touch of vanilla and lively acidity on the finish.",87,Maison Champy 2010  Saint-Romain
"Here's a lovely Grenache to drink now. It's dry and silky, with the light weight of Pinot Noir, and ripely succulent in cherries. Bright acidity adds the final note. The very high alcohol is hardly noticeable, but it will affect you physically.",88,Peloton 2011 Jespersen Ranch Grenache (Edna Valley)
"Ripe and fruity, this wine offers crisp apples and pear-juice flavors. It has a strongly tangy element that is refreshing and delicious now.",86,Louis Max 2014 Vieilles Vignes  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
"This sweet Viognier tastes like a pineapple, orange, apricot and peach fruit juice blend. The acidity is balancing, but feels added.",84,Robert Hall 2009 Viognier (Paso Robles)
"Tan in color and bland as a whole, with vanilla and pear aromas that do little to allure or entice. Strained and pickled tasting, with a heavy, overdone overall style. Pushes the definition of “acceptable.”",81,Ventisquero 2009 Queulat Gran Reserva Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)
"Very pale in color, this is a fruity, fragrant wine. It has acidity, red fruits and a leathery texture. There is something of the undergrowth here, an earthy character that needs time to broaden out. Give the wine 4–5 years.",87,Anton Bauer 2010 Reserve Pinot Noir (Wagram-Donauland)
"While this is immensely oaky on the nose, that wood and char works because it comes with ripe cassis, blackberry and raisin scents. Chewy, ultraripe and tannic on the palate, this tastes of sweet black fruits, chocolaty oak and wood. An oaky reprise is front and center on a grabby stacked finish. Drink through 2023.",93,Aguijón De Abeja 2015 Reserva Malbec (Argentina)
"One needs to lean into the glass to find the notes of vanilla, peach, and tropical fruit here. It's oily and broad in feel with the alcohol adding a bitter note to the finish.",86,Silvan Ridge 2011 Viognier (Rogue Valley)
"From the least-known of the Beaujolais cru villages, this wine is soft and supple in character with ripe, firm tannins to support the fruitiness. Red berries and acidity give the wine its bright aspect while still retaining a good sense of structure. Drink now, although the wine will be better from 2016.",88,Château de Pizay 2014  Régnié
"Rusty in color and lacking fruit aromas on the nose, this is just good enough for a gran reserva. Leathery, roasted-plum flavors taste more like black olive than bright fruit. It's tannic and a bit dull on the finish.",87,Castillo Clavijo 2008 Gran Reserva  (Rioja)
"Very fruity, ripe-tasting and rounded, this medium-bodied wine is easy to swallow due to its low acidity and soft texture. Hints of butter and nutmeg add to the fresh apple flavors.",86,Craftsman 2015 Chardonnay (California)
"The year's bottle aging has rounded this wine out and has softened the fresh red fruits into a more generous, full-bodied texture. The acidity, always present shows as a counterpoint to the ripe fruits. Drink now.",86,Domaine Dupeuble Père et Fils 2012  Beaujolais
"Tea leaf, cherry and sweet vermouth aromas precede lightly tart cherry, rhubarb and herb flavors in this lean, moderately tannic and un-oaky wine. It's appealing and appetizing in an austere way, giving just enough satisfaction.",88,Lichen Estate 2015 Moonglow Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"91–93. Barrel sample. This is a solid wine showing chunky richness that chimes with the black fruit of the vintage. It's full and ripe, but still shines with fresh fruit character.",92,Château Nenin 2012 Barrel Sample  (Pomerol)
"Firm with dark tannins, this is a structured wine. It is still reticent, likely to take several more years to show its fruit. It is dense with the black-plum fruit behind the firm tannins. With all this concentration, expect this wine to need at least until 2024 before drinking.",92,Château Grand-Puy-Lacoste 2014  Pauillac
"A surprisingly fresh wine for an Alvarinho from the hot Alentejo. It shows crisp acidity, with lime and apricot flavors and a bright, crisp aftertaste.",87,Terras de Alter 2014 Terra d'Alter Alvarinho (Alentejano)
"Racy and revitalizing, this delicate off-dry Riesling balances a core of fresh white peach and citrus flavors with savory smoke and nut tones. Fresh and easy going in style, it's a likely to please a wide audience.",88,Heinz Eifel 2013 Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"This is a fully mature wine showcasing toast, ripe fruit and citrus acidity at their best. It is not a dry wine, with signs of a relatively high dosage, but that gives the wine softness as well as richness. Ready to drink now, but it will also keep until 2020.",89,Chanoine 2008 Tsarine Millésime Brut  (Champagne)
"Despite the fancy name, this is a pretty standard wine. It's dry and acidic, with the big tannins that mark Petite Sirah. The blackberry flavors are rich, but cloaked in bitter astringency. Doesn't seem worthwhile to age it, so drink up.",85,Clayhouse 2009 Red Cedar Vineyard Block 87 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)
"The fact it comes from a great vintage has allowed this wine its continued place in the sun. It does taste mature, not old, with leather, mushroom along with the firm structure and acidity. But don't age for any longer.",83,Château de Piote 2005 Cuvée Prestige  (Bordeaux Supérieur)
"Surprisingly soft and seemingly sweet for this vineyard, which comes from the cooler Freestone area of the western Russian River Valley. It's delicious in cherry, cola, mocha and spice flavors, but it feels heavy.",87,J Vineyards & Winery 2010 Freestone Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"An impressively mature 20-year old tawny, showing great layers of wood acidity, dark figs and well-integrated spirit. In the house style, it is not a big wine, more perfumed and delicate, and elegant.",91,Poças NV 20 Years Old Tawny  (Port)
"Fresh and minerally, melon and peach aromas introduce the medium-bodied palate. Flavors of peach, melon and passion fruit finish clean and modest.",88,Castillo de Monjardin 2015 El Cerezo Unoaked Chardonnay (Navarra)
"Crisp lemon, fennel and Bosc pear come into play in this medium-bodied Chardonnay, accented by a taste of fig. Taking on depth and breadth as it develops in the glass and on the palate, the wine finishes long and lean.",87,Taft Street 2013 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Rich with strawberry fruitiness, the wine also has a good fresh touch. It's a blend of Touriga Nacional and Syrah, giving a warm, ripe and fruity aftertaste.",85,Herdade de Medeiros 2013 Rosé (Alentejano)
"Concentrated, jammy fruit flavors meet full body and sturdy tannins in this well-made wine. It has a large presence due to alcoholic strength and the ripe spectrum of its fruit flavors, which includes raisin, black cherry and dried fig. Yet, tannins and acidity provide a firm texture that keeps it feeling balanced.",90,Dante Robere 2014 Estate Syrah (Livermore Valley)
"Grassy, herbal aromas rest on top of basic red-fruit notes. This feels choppy and hollow, with flavors of buttery oak, chemical and red currant. The raw hot finish doesn't have a lot of body or padding.",84,Luis Segundo Correas 2011 Valle Las Acequias Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"A beautifully dense, ripe wine, its intense acidity balanced by an opulent structure and gorgeous fruits. The texture is smooth and velvety, while never losing sight of the powerful structure. This elegant and powerful wine will age for many years.",97,Château La Mission Haut-Brion 2010  Pessac-Léognan
"Barolo Il Lauro is a soft, plush wine with chocolate and creamy vanilla overtones from the La Morra area of the Langhe. There's plenty of fruit here as well, mostly wild cherry and forest berry, with tight tannins and a sour note on the close. Drink after 2015.",90,Rambaldi Vladimiro 2007 Il Lauro  (Barolo)
"This wine is 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Malbec, 21% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot. Aromas of blue fruit, plum and green herb lead to dry, slightly astringent fruit flavors, with lemon twist notes on the finish.",87,TruthTeller 2014 Pun Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is the finest of the winery's three new rosés, and kudos to them for specializing in blush. The vineyard is in the Green Valley, and the wine shows long hangtime raspberry and cherry fruit, brightened with crisp acidity. It all leads to a dry, spicy finish, and the alcohol is a refreshingly low 13.2% by volume.",90,Ousterhout 2012 Dellinger Vineyard Rosé of Pinot Noir Rosé (Russian River Valley)
"This wine is coming into balance with wood, acidity and fruit all present. It has a dusty tannic character that's attractive and acts as a good base for the blackberry flavors. The wine will develop quickly, so drink from 2018. Laurent and Sophie Cisneros bought Rouillac with a focus: eliminate chemical pesticides and herbicides. They built a barrel cellar to environmental European standards. The vineyard is 60 acres Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with five acres of white grapes. Eric Boissenot consults.",90,Château de Rouillac 2013  Pessac-Léognan
"This wine delivers pretty stone fruit and grapefruit notes, with a hint of honey and blossoms. The palate is light to medium bodied and offers plenty of acidity to balance. A slightly spicy, white pepper note marks the finish.",87,Echo Bay 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)

"Aromas of ripe dark berry, blue flower and a hint of baking spice waft from the glass. On the palate, notes of graphite, licorice and touch of smoke add depth to the ripe black cherry flavors. Firm tannins provide support.",88,Casa di Grazia 2011 Gradiva Collectio Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"A delicate firmness opens the bouquet of this elegant Barolo, with delicate aromas of wild berry, cola and licorice that come together as one. The palate delivers intensity and staying power. Drink after 2018.",92,Beni di Batasiolo 2007 Vigneto Cerequio  (Barolo)
"Made from the local grapes Bogazkere and Öküzgözü, this wine features aromas of black cherry, white chocolate and orange peel. A bright cherry flavor with notes of orange zest is set against a more complex backdrop of cooked cherries with touches of mocha and eucalyptus. Smooth, long-lasting tannins linger on the palate, joined by a final burst of pomegranate.",89,Yazgan 2014 Mahra Bogazkere Öküzgözü Red (Turkey)
"Alluring honeysuckle notes accent aromas of fresh apples and pears in this unusually blossomy Pinot Blanc. Floral notes penetrate through the palate as well, adding exuberance to flavors of white peaches and yellow cherries. Dry in style, with a bold, expansive mouthfeel, it's elegant and superbly satisfying.",91,Franz Keller 2012 Schwarzer Adler Pinot Blanc (Baden)

"Here's a plush and straightforward wine that would pair well with braised brisket or lamb. Flavors of berry compote and all-fruit preserves are upfront, while a milk-chocolate accent unfolds on the medium-length finish. Soft tannins and a silky texture make this a wine that's easy to enjoy now.",84,Gamla 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Galilee)
"From the oldest part of the estate, this subtle wine rewards your patience and full attention. Hints of rose petals adorn the floral accents, while the midpalate emphasizes flavors of raspberries and orange peel. At first a bit shy, this opens slowly and reveals hidden complexities and enduring length. Drink now through 2025.",92,WillaKenzie Estate 2013 Aliette Pinot Noir
"Winderlea is the most limited and most expensive of the winery's single vineyard series. This vintage remains tight and compact—a youthful purple in color, with fruit flavors of plum and sour cherry. Subtle layers unfold as it breathes, adding citrus peel, minerality and a touch of malt as well.",93,Adelsheim 2014 Winderlea Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"This wine is equal parts Syrah and Merlot (43% each), with the balance a smattering of other varieties. The coffee and berry aromas seem faint while the palate delivers all of the plush fruit flavors this vintage has to offer.",88,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2012 Indian Wells Red (Columbia Valley (WA))

"There's something overripe and flat about this wine, which conveys a mix of Dr Pepper, chocolate and vanilla that doesn't impress.",83,Carol Shelton 2013 King Ridge Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Coast)
"From the oldest vines owned by the producer, this wine is intense and concentrated. Packed with citrus and still-bright herbal flavors it has layers of minerality and perfumed acidity. It still has its freshness which is in the process of changing into a rich maturity. Drink now and until 2024.",93,Henri Bourgeois 2014 La Bourgeoise  (Sancerre)
"Hugely perfumed, this is a ripe, very rich wine with stacks of flavor piled upon each other. It's a naturally opulent wine, that's sweet with tropical fruits and honey in equal measure. It is very ready to drink, but will also age well, so drink until 2021.",93,Rieflé 2011 Zinnkoepflé Grand Cru Vendanges Tardives Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Brambly red-fruit aromas mix with notes of sweet milk chocolate and dust. It feels crisp, tight and fresh, with raspberry and lightly herbal plum flavors. This finishes taut and fruity. A blend of 75% Garnacha and 25% Tempranillo.",86,Bodegas Aragonesas 2008 Mósen Cleto Crianza Red (Campo de Borja)
"A young tannic wine with jammy, fresh red-cherry fruits and red plum skins. The acidity is palpable, shooting through the structure, giving the wine a fresh, fruity aftertaste.",87,Domaine Guillot-Broux 2010 Beaumont  (Mâcon-Cruzille)
"This is the second wine of Mouchão estate, a power in its own right. It is beautifully perfumed with violets and spice while its tannins and dark chocolate flavors are well integrated with the generous black fruits and acidity. The wine, even at four-years-old, is still young and will need much further aging. Drink from 2020.",93,Mouchão 2015 Ponte das Canas Red (Alentejo)
"This is a new brand and a very good introductory Pinot Noir. In its light, silky mouthfeel and deep, complex flavors, it showcases its Russian River origins in a classic way. Offers up brilliantly ripe flavors of red currants, licorice, cola, gingerbread, mocha and spices, wrapped into a dry, balanced structure. Best now for its youthful charm.",93,Suacci Carciere Wines 2006 Suacci Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This is a caramel-scented wine, with a wild strawberry flavor and light acidity. It is crisp, fruity and fragrant.",84,Herdade da Comporta 2011 Rosé (Setubal)
"Aromas of Mediterranean herb, balsam, eucalyptus and dark berry lead the nose. The firm, elegant palate delivers juicy black cherry, dried blackberry, black pepper, clove, thyme, orange peel and anisette alongside youthfully austere but fine-grained tannins. Let this wine develop. Drink 2017–2022.",92,Castello La Leccia 2010 Bruciagna Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico)
"With some oak aging, this is a naturally rich wine that has a rounded, full character. It's generous, opulent and full of yellow fruits, ripe red apples and the subtlest touch of toast. Drink now, or keep until 2015.",89,Terras de Alter 2012 Fado Branco Reserva White (Alentejano)
"The initial nosing reveals a char-broiled character along with maple. That nose turns even darker with airing, indicating that no barrel was spared in the making of this wine. The flavor profile is all dark berries and cream, with yet more wood at the heart. On the tail end, it's dry, broad and full of tannins and extract that coat the mouth. Best Buy.",87,Errazuriz 2001 Cabernet Sauvignon (Aconcagua Valley)
"Notes of pineapple and verbena tisane hint at some maturity. While the nose suggests richness, the palate reveals a concentrated lightness that is nonetheless dense with aroma: said pineapples as well as notes of hayflowers and dried moss and dried citrus peel. The long finish celebrates this multilayered scope beautifully.",92,Domäne Wachau 2013 Smaragd Terrassen Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"Mauro Sebaste has produced a creamy, elegant Moscato d'Asti with lovely notes of white flower and soapy foam. Sweet flavors of peach and honey are followed by a touch of zesty lemon.",87,Mauro Sebaste 2010  Moscato d'Asti
"Aromas of mature black fruit, spearmint and espresso come with the barest whiff of earthy farmyard. The palate offers up black cherry, raspberry and black pepper accented with toast and espresso, all alongside assertive but drying tannins. It's forward and evolved with ideal drinking time 2015–2019.",87,Pinino 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
"Known more for Zinfandel and Rhône blends, Bill Easton has quietly been making Cabernet as well for many years. This vintage is earthy and leathery, reminiscent of his Syrah-based wines, yet rich in savory black cherry, cedar and black olive. Built to age, put it away until 2019–2024 and the savory, herbal elements are sure to develop further.",90,Easton 2011 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Shenandoah Valley (CA))
"This is the second wine of Château Pibran, whose vineyard is situated close to those of the the first growths of Mouton and Lafite. Structured and dense, this is a solid, powerful wine, packed with juicy black currant fruits and generous tannins. Give this wine until 2018 before drinking.",91,Château Pibran 2012 Château Tour Pibran  (Pauillac)
"Dramatic all around. Deeply aromatic, offering waves of grilled blackberries, currants, violets, sweet buttered cinnamon toast and sandalwood. The tannin structure is superb. Feels classically dense and full-bodied in the mouth, very dry, yet opulent and complex. Grows more concentrated as it airs in the glass. A tremendous wine that needs time. 2012–2020.",96,Atalon 2006 Corestone Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This is really a spectacular wine. It's hard to say why it's so superior to Krutz's 2005 bottling, but it's richer and more elegant in every respect. Combines immense power with great finesse. The refined essence of blackberries, black currants and spices thrills the palate, accented with the most beautiful coating of smoky oak. A great achievement that should develop in the bottle through 2018.",97,Krutz 2006 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This winning blend of 75% Nero d'Avola and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon is firm and structured, but coddles that structure in a layer of lushness. Briary, raspberry fruit is balanced by darker notes of cassis and chocolate. Drink now-2010.",90,Tasca d'Almerita 1999 Cygnus Red (Sicilia)
"Fresh lime and lemon acidity abounds in this cool, steely wine. Delicately sweet, it offers sweet and tart tangerine flavors, augmented by edges of steel and crushed minerality.",88,Leonard Kreusch 2016 Riesling (Rheinhessen)
"With some barrel-aging at the back, this Pinot Nero-based sparkler shows a sassy and sophisticated side with apricot, honey, cinnamon and a touch of white pepper. Warm tones of baked bread and spice fill in the rear.",88,Dorigo NV Blanc de Noir Dosage Zero Pinot Nero (Friuli)
"A definitive, whitepepper spice note runs through many, if not most Oregon Pinot Blancs. It's a positive marker, and this wine is a fine example. Winemaker Thibaud Mandet unhesitatingly calls this his favorite wine. There are lovely aromatics, a mouth-teasing mix of citrus and green apple fruit, and a wash of minerality on the finish.",91,WillaKenzie Estate 2011 Estate Grown Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley)
"This sour, beery wine is for those who like a high acid flush with their meal. The very tart flavors focus on lemon and green apple.",83,Redgate 2013 Estate Grown Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"This delivers soft aromas of leather, blackberry preserves, tobacco and dark chocolate. The grape is Negroamaro, and the wine's mouthfeel is rich, velvety and smooth.",88,Schola Sarmenti di Terrulenta 2008 Roccamora Negroamaro (Nardò)
"This is and properly dry, with smooth tannins and high acidity that lends some sting to the palate. The berry and earth flavors lack some intensity. Drink now.",85,Vina Robles 2009 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"A light and soft wine, this is fruity, with gentle acidity. Apples and lemon juice flavors complement each other to give a bright and fresh aftertaste. Screwcap.",84,DFJ Vinhos 2012 Casa do Lago Branco White (Lisboa)
"Loaded with finesse, this opens with aromas of pressed violet, perfumed berry, orange zest and whiff of forest floor. The vibrant palate delivers wild red cherry, tangy cranberry, baking spice, grilled herb and anise alongside firm, polished tannins and bright acidity. It's already tempting but give it time to develop fully. Drink 2018–2028.",94,Le Potazzine 2010  Brunello di Montalcino
"Subdued earth notes precede the ripe freshness of red apple and mirabelle. A touch of residual sweetness boosts ripe fruit flavors of pear and orange, red apple and mirabelle plum. Lemon freshness brightens the palate and makes for an appetizing, zingy and refreshing finish.",91,Domaine Gresser 2015 Duttenberg Riesling (Alsace)
"Aromas of sweet red berries, dried fruits and herbs open this light, accessible wine from Israel. The tone of the fruit seems to shift between a tart rhubarb and a slightly candied quality. Cherry notes show on the lean and dry back end.",84,Carmel 1998 Private Collection Merlot (Judean Hills)
"Smoky, charred aromas are rugged and center around black fruits. This is a blend of Mazuelo (Carignan), Garnacha and Syrah, and it's decidedly ripe. Loamy flavors of blackberry and plum are earthy, while the finish is toasty and ends with a bitter espresso note.",89,Bula 2012 Red (Montsant)
"Dense and extracted, this displays sensations of espresso, roasted coffee bean, sugary vanilla, chocolate and sweet oak. It's already evolved so drink soon.",85,Loacker Corte Pavone 2012  Rosso di Montalcino
"This wine is bold and brawny, defined by big, oaky tannin and concentrated weight. Fresh black cherry develops a candied quality in the glass, while an earthy undercurrent of minty forest adds complexity.",88,Acacia 2013 Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"Structured and firm, this wine has more in the way of dry tannins than of fruit. It presents a fine skeleton without much flesh, leaving a wine that is tight and extracted. It needs plenty of time, so drink from late 2016.",85,Georges Duboeuf 2014  Chiroubles
"Intense lemon and lime-skin aromas add sheen to ripe, juicy citrus, peach and honey flavors in this off-dry Riesling. Racy and crisp on the palate, it finishes vibrant and dry with lingering crushed-slate minerality. A fantastic bargain for such a solid wine.",89,Loosen Bros. 2011 Dr. L Riesling (Mosel)
"This rich, layered red wine is a bit jammy and assertive now, and will benefit from a couple years of cellaring to settle down. It's forward and ripe with cherry and raspberry jam, mocha, roasted almond and cinnamon flavors. A little heavy and heady, yet strangely compelling, and certainly scores high on the deliciousness factor.",90,Sean Thackrey 2010 Rossi Vineyard Orion Red (St. Helena)
"Now entitled to use the expanded Willamette Valley AVA, this estate-grown wine is broad, full-flavored and loaded with fruit. Fresh sliced peaches, papaya and melon flavors abound, and a nice touch of citrus lifts the finish.",91,King Estate 2015 Domaine Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"Evidence of a warm vintage is sketched on the bouquet. Aromas of raisin, black licorice and mocha are quite sweet. The palate is wide and mildly tannic, with earthy, oaky black cherry and raspberry flavors. For a ripe wine with significant extraction, it's well balanced. But all along there's a hint of prune that tells you it's ripe and ready.",88,Luis Alegre 2003 Gran Vino Pontac  (Rioja)
"Dark and bold, this has blackberry and ripe forest-berry flavors that are followed by spice, leather and Spanish cedar notes. It's edgy and perky, with good personality and length.",88,La Dama 2009 Ca' Besi  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore)
"There's nice restraint on the nose of this judiciously priced bottling by the Delicato group, with lemon-lime citrus and slightly green apple flesh on the nose. The wine is strongly textural once sipped, with sour apple, lime peel and riper stone fruit in the background, finishing grippy and clean.",90,Noble Vines 2014 242 Sauvignon Blanc (San Bernabe)
"From vines planted in the Tour Bourdon plot in 1940, this concentrated wine is ripe and rich while still shot through with red-currant acidity. Its tannins come from the low-yielding vines, giving a firm edge. The aftertaste is all about fresher red fruits. Jean-Michel Dupré is a member of Terroirs Originels—17 producers on the hills of Beaujolais and Burgundy's Mâcon.",90,Domaine Dupré 2014 Vignes de 1940  (Beaujolais-Villages)
"While red apple, raspberry and bramble aromas on this rosé are restrained, ruddy, slightly overripe cherry and strawberry flavors build on the palate. Dry and full-bodied in style, it finishes with a touch of exotic spice.",86,Brooklyn Oenology 2014 As If Courage Rosé (New York)
"Soft, easy acids set up the lissome mouthfeel, which is dominated by a note of cinnamon-spiced prune. The prune quality is also apparent on the nose, joined by a smoky liquid-oak tone and minor inflections of tobacco and turmeric.",83,Shenandoah Vineyards 2010 Rhapsody in Red Red (Shenandoah Valley)
"Made from 100% Touriga Nacional, this is a dark-pink-colored rosé. The fruit is full while also crisp. Extra Brut suggests a dry wine, although in fact the ripeness of the fruit means it is soft and full. This sparkling wine is ready to drink.",87,Coteaux da Murta NV Murta Extra Brut Rosé Touriga Nacional (Lisboa)
"Vibrant and expressive, this offers initial aromas of blackberry, cassis and boysenberry that are matched with spicy hints of licorice root, black pepepr and cigar-box spice. The palate is round and slightly creamy, but framed by medium tannins and a long, toasty finish.",89,Riebeek Cellars 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Swartland)
"A big, balanced, bombastic Montsant made from one-third each of Mazuelo, Garnacha and Syrah. On the bouquet it's the fruit that endears but mocha and vanilla stick out. The flavor profile sees lemony oak, blackberry, blueberry and minerality. Spicy and long late with size and grip. Drink now through 2015.",93,Can Blau 2007 Mas de Can Blau Red (Montsant)
"Blackberry and cola aromas are cool and collected. The palate has weight and texture to accompany berry, mint, herb and peppery flavors. Turns more herbal and roasted as it unwinds. Pepper and spice lead the finish.",88,Montes 2009 Alpha Syrah (Colchagua Valley)
"With the structured influence of Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a wine that brings out the freshness of 2008, along with its firm tannins. It is still a young wine with acidity and tannins dominating the fruit.",87,Château Tour Saint-Joseph 2008  Haut-Médoc
"Made with 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc, 15% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot, this opens with aromas of black currant and baking spice. The evolved palate provides mature plum, oak and toast alongside gripping, rather drying tannins.",87,Fattoria Montellori 2011 Salamartano Red (Toscana)
"A blend of 73% Petite Sirah with 17% Zinfandel, this is a black, inky wine, as to be expected, from Spring Mountain's longstanding York Creek Vineyard. Dusty, earthy and mouthfilling, it is out and out savory. Tastes of black pepper and gamy oak lead to a lingering finish marked by more peppery spice.",88,Elyse 2010 York Creek Vineyard Petite Sirah (Napa Valley)
"Hot pink in color, this Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant rosé brings aromas of cherry and bubble gum. It drinks dry with fat-feeling fruit flavors that need a bit more acid to perk them up.",86,Swiftwater Cellars 2015 No. 9 Rosé (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Here's a dry, somewhat brawny wine that has some charm. It's filled with briary, peppery flavors, with fruits suggesting blackberries and cassis. Good value in an inexpensive steak and chops wine.",84,Clos du Lac 2004 Syrah (Amador County)
"This is attractive and mature, with a light touch and flavors of currants mingling with almonds. Soft yet tangy, this is very ready to drink.",86,F. Mallo et Fils 2008 Réserve Spéciale Riesling (Alsace)
"This is all about rounded, crunchy, primary cherry fruit. This light- to medium-bodied red celebrates fresh fruit, offering verve and energy on its soft, pliable palate. Drink soon while the fruit is as bright as possible.",87,Nastl 2013 Klassic Cuvée Red (Niederösterreich)
"This is a rustic Pinot Noir, harsh in the mouth, with some green, mint-like flavors. It offers enough raspberry and cherry notes to satisfy at a party.",82,Donovan-Parke 2011 Pinot Noir (California)
"Forward and lightly spicy, this is a good, all-purpose white wine, with bright flavors of apple and pear. It's not a big wine in any way, but perfectly quaffable and right for a wide variety of noodle dishes.",87,Maryhill 2013 Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Fresh mint and menthol notes lend a herbaceous tone to this dry, slightly grassy Riesling. Lemon and lime flavors are brisk and clean on the palate.",85,Casa Larga 2010 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Light strawberry, earth and rose-petal aromas add to the blackberry flavors in this medium-bodied wine. It feels tight and tastes lean now, so it's best to drink after 2019.",87,Rock Wall 2014 Abba Vineyard Grenache (Lodi)
"The blend of Colombard, Gros Manseng and Sauvignon Blanc gives a light mineral character. The wine is very fresh, very crisp and finely layered, with a depth of herbaceous and green fruit flavors. Screwcap.",88,Haut Marin 2010 Cuvée Marine White (Côtes de Gascogne)
"Restrained and soft on the nose, this light-bodied white offers subtle lemon zestiness and a phenolic seam that provide structure and food-friendliness with a savory, almost herbal edge.",89,Domäne Wachau 2013 Terrassen Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"Still young and showing fresh fruitiness, this wine needs time to calm down and broaden out. Made of four classic varieties in the Esporão vineyard, it's dense, stalky and still full of tannins. Give this wine until 2016.",90,Herdade do Esporão 2013 Quatro Castas Red (Alentejano)
"This opens with aromas of Spanish broom and wild berry. On the fresh easygoing palate, zesty acidity supports juicy red cherry and black raspberry. A nectarine note gives it a tangy close.",86,Tommasi 2016 Masseria Surani Helios Negroamaro Rosato (Puglia)
"A screaming deal, this wine shows a nice blend of pencil lead, strawberries, peppercorn, oregano and chaparral scrub on the nose. The palate offers plenty of mocha and herbs including oregano and thyme, alongside elderberry and boysenberry fruit. It has enough tannic structure to notice but not enough to get in the way.",89,Cupcake 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast)
"This wine's inviting aromas of tar, menthol and rose take shape in the glass. The elegant palate doles out red cherry, cranberry and dried herb flavors set against a backdrop of refined tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2021–2028.",92,Bric Cenciurio 2013 Coste di Rose  (Barolo)
"This Cabernet blend shows the future of the new Coombsville region, which was officially approved as an appellation in 2011. It's a powerful wine with penetrating blackberry, currant and mocha flavors, while the structure is especially fine and firm.",92,Sodaro 2009 Felicity Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Cherry and black olive aromas are common for standard Chilean Cabernet, which this is. A fleshy, flush mouthfeel is raw due to prodding acidity and tannins. Herbal berry flavors are spicy and a touch green, while this tastes minty on the finish.",86,Viña Maipo 2015 Vitral Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Chile)
"This wine has rich flavors and aromas but an overall refined style. In the nose, savory pepper, coffee and a touch of cedar. On the palate, luscious flavors of cedar, coffee and pepper. An elegant wine with depth.",87,Ormonde 2006 Vernon Basson Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc (Darling)
"Smoky aromas and a bold apricot flavor give this dry and seemingly light-bodied wine a distinct personality. Fermented in small concrete egg-shaped vats, it's far from simple and fruity, and instead offers great acidity and a tangy, tempting, appetizing personality.",89,Prospect 772 2014 Stepping Stones Grenache Blanc (Santa Barbara County)
"A rich, concentrated Livermore Valley Bordeaux blend, comprised of 79% Cabernet Sauvignon and lesser percentages of Petit Verdot, Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. This vintage of Supremacy has a big presence, smelling of earth and cinnamon, a layering of blackberry and chocolate lingering in the background. A wine with great texture and mellowing tannins ready to drink now or in 5–7 years.",89,Nottingham Cellars 2009 Supremacy Red (Livermore Valley)
"Aromatic, flowery and fruity are all delicious attributes of this forward, fresh and ready-to-drink wine. It's simple and open, finishing with spice and a touch of pepper.",85,Baumann 2013 ClassiQ Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"This pretty Rosso di Montalcino opens with a concentrated appearance and aromas of ripe fruit, spice, toasted nut and dried rosemary. A bit thin on the finish, the wine concludes with silky tannins and a fresh touch.",89,Poggio Nardone 2009  Rosso di Montalcino
"This tastes a little too high in acidity, but it does show the spiciness of Santa Maria Valley Pinot Noir. Flavors of ripe black cherry, peppercorn and licorice are all found, and it shows a nice silkiness. Drink now.",86,Three Saints 2009 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"Originally planted by monks in the 12th century, this vineyard has produced an intensely herbaceous wine. Steely and crisp with grapefruit and gooseberry flavors, the wine's texture brings out the chalky soil. Still young, it will be better from 2018.",92,Domaine Chatelain 2015 Les Vignes de Saint-Laurent l'Abbaye  (Pouilly-Fumé)
"Made in a complex style rather than simply fruity, this smells like toasted almonds and vanilla bean. Tastes suggest not-quite-sweet Bosc pears, butter and walnuts. While the texture is luxurious the body is actually light, and the wine is not at all cloying.",90,Naggiar 2014 Estate Viognier (Sierra Foothills)
"Alluring aromas of violet, rose, dark berry and a hint of cured meat emerge on this firmly structured wine. The palate is rather extracted, offering rich black cherry, chocolate, tobacco and sweet spice alongside grippy tannins.",90,Marziano Abbona 2011 Pressenda  (Barolo)
"This is a ripe, spicy and pepper-flavored wine. It has pear and green plum notes that give a crisp edge to the rich texture. There is a mineral touch that brings out the acidity to balance the opulence. Age for 2–3 years. Screwcap.",89,Domäne Wachau 2011 Terrassen  Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"This red starts with black fruits and pepper aromas, followed by waves of black cherry, cocoa, pepper and red berry. Rich and mellow, it's a classy sip that will pair well with duck, roasted meats.",88,Gaia Wines 2005 Gaia Estate Agiorgitiko (Nemea)
"Spicy oak aromas accent foxy red berry scents in this pinchy, wayward wine. Its chocolatey black fruit and peppery spice flavors finish jammy, with a lot of unresolved oak.",88,Damalisco 2014 Roble  (Toro)
"A little bit of green pear, a little bit of pepper and quite a bit of juiciness add up to a whole lot of easy-drinking fun on this light, dry and zippy Grüner. There's some spice and yeastiness around the edges, too. Drink soon.",90,Loimer 2015 Lois Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"Smells grassy and sweaty, kind of like Sauvignon Blanc. The palate is chunky and awkward feeling, with pink grapefruit and passion fruit flavors. Fades fast and easy on the finish. Contains 20% Verdejo in addition to Tempranillo, which explains the citrusy aromas and flavors. Imported by USA Wine West.",84,Val de Los Frailes 2010 Rosado (Cigales)
"Hugh Hamilton's top-of-the-line wine is the Jekyll & Hyde Shiraz-Viognier. In 2007, it's a full-bodied, richly textured wine filled with raspberry, cherry and chocolate aromas and flavors. Based on its somewhat chewy finish, it should last and evolve through at least 2020.",92,Hugh Hamilton 2007 Jekyll & Hyde Shiraz-Viognier (McLaren Vale)
"Basic aromas of white fruits and pumpkin precede a sharp palate with a high malic acid content. Tart apple, gooseberry and salty flavors run long due to blazing acidity.",87,Altos de Cristimil 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Properly structured, this is a solid wine. Great swathes of plum fruits are partnered with firm tannins. It is dark and firm, with a dense character. Touches of chocolate and roasted coffee go with the rich plums. Drink from 2015.",90,Henry Fessy 2012  Morgon
"This is tart and also overripe, with a sharp, raisin taste that leads to a bitter finish. A blend of Merlot, Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon.",81,3 Spells 2007 Blend GHK Red (Napa Valley)
"A tiny percentage of Chardonnay is added to this Prosecco Superiore, giving it a small boost in terms of structure and creaminess. That addition adds a scent of fresh fruit, with subtle hints of apricot and exotic spice.",88,Bortolotti NV Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Dark and austere, this has aromas of spice, toasted hazelnut and wild berry. The mouthfeel is tight and astringent and the finish is elegantly streamlined. Definitely give this wine 5–10 more years in the cellar.",92,Gianni Gagliardo 2008 Serre  (Barolo)
"The Côtes d'Auxerre, west of Chablis, is the last outpost of Chardonnay in Burgundy. That results in this cool style of wine, light and fruity with apple and green-plum fruitiness. There is a zest to the wine, a lightly mineral texture and attractive final acidity. Drink now.",86,Bailly-Lapierre 2015  Bourgogne Côtes d’Auxerre
"Hang onto your hat; here's a very great Syrah. The aromas are hiding, now suggesting plum and blackberry, now black pepper, now freshly baked rhubarb pie. In the mouth, it knocks out with grace and power. It's soft as silk, but complex and layered, and the richly tannic finish suggests aging potential. Not too long, though.",94,"Terre Rouge 1999 Sentinel Oak Vineyard, Pyramid Block Syrah (Shenandoah Valley (CA))"
"Ripe, earthy black-fruit aromas are spicy and a bit lactic from oak, hence, the palate is full and creamy, but with a good acidic cut. Blackberry, herbal spice and cool toasty oak flavors finish warm and plump.",91,Kingston Family 2014 Lucero Syrah (Casablanca Valley)
"A rare treat from a 120-year-old vineyard, this wine has a dark color, generous aromas and concentrated but dry fruit flavors. It will make a great pairing for robust, rich foods due to its medium body, lean mouthfeel and sturdy support from fine-grained tannins.",89,Neyers 2014 Evangelho Vineyard Carignan (Contra Costa County)
"Made with 90% Chardonnay and 10% Pinot Nero, Rotari's Brut sparkling wine can be relied upon for consistency and value. The wine is festive and bright with citrus zest, mineral tones and a pristine mouthfeel that ends with clean freshness.",88,Rotari NV Brut Talento Sparkling (Trento)
"The bouquet is like sticking your nose in a bag of pencil shavings and shiitake mushrooms. The palate gets more expansive, offering cranberry as well as a hint of softer fruit like strawberry, with some crushed rock as well. This is a very affordable expression of Pinot Noir in what was a tough vintage, showing that the new energy BV is placing on this series of wines may just pay off.",87,Beaulieu Vineyard 2011 Coastal Estates Pinot Noir (Central Coast)
"This is a simple but well made Bardolino that offers dark cherry and raspberry flavors with notes of black pepper. Fresh and enjoyable, it's perfect to accompany everyday fare, from light pastas to burgers.",86,Allegrini 2012 Corte Giara  (Bardolino)
"It's hard to ripen Bordeaux red varietals in Monterey, but this was a good vintage and Mirassou has some good vineyards. The fruit is scented with blackberries and plums and even deeper notes of chocolate, espresso, and smoked meat. There's also a generous dose of oak. It drinks fine and dry, and captures that magical quality of finesse and elegance despite its size, which is considerable. A plush, opulent wine.",90,Mirassou 1997 Harvest Reserve Merlot (California)
"Given the lauded conditions of 2010 in Rioja, this wine's herbal minty grassy nose and raw tart pulling palate are surprising. Savory herbal tomatoey red-plum flavors finish minty, with lasting fresh acidity.",86,Finca Valpiedra 2010 Reserva  (Rioja)
"Earth, tree bark, dry spice and finally some plum and berry aromas appear on the nose. The palate is astringent but also bright and structured, with plum, raspberry and herbal flavors. Warming and tannic all the way to the very end. A very nice and forceful Toro.",88,Finca Sobreño 2008  Toro
"Gavi is a wonderful white wine to pair with elegant seafood or light vegetable dishes. This expression shows a drying mineral note backed by fresh citrus, white peach and honeydew melon. The mouthfeel is silky and clean.",88,La Battistina 2011 Nuovo Quadro  (Gavi)
"An austere, stalky wine, showing its dry tannins and woody black currant flavors. It has a bitter edge to it, with its lean, dry tannins.",84,Mähler-Besse 2008 Château Biré  (Bordeaux Supérieur)
"A fresh, citrus-flavored wine that is all about fruitiness. It is light, bright and tangy with orange and lemon zest. It is floral, crisp and ready to drink.",85,Quinta da Foz 2014 Vinha da Foz Branco White (Douro)
"The fruit is half Sheridan and half Dineen vineyard. Although stylistically a brother to the Stevens Merlot, this has the varietal earmarks of Cabernet Franc – some green, leafy streaks, more spice and sharpness to the tannins, and a definite herbal component. The fruit is an equal but not dominant partner – blackberry, cassis, and black olive, finished with a whiff of very dark chocolate.",91,Stevens 2008 Franc Cabernet Franc (Yakima Valley)
"This full-bodied and assertive wine from hillside vineyards has earthy aromas, ripe but dry fruit flavors, and a dense texture due to mouth-coating tannins. It will need time in the bottle to round off, but should be delicious after 2018.",89,Cedarville Vineyard 2012 Estate Syrah (El Dorado)
"This murky fortified wine pushes some blackberry fruit forward. The liquorous brandy flavors come up strongly, and the wine finishes with flavors of dried leaves.",84,Harry & David 2013 Beeson Dessert Wine Tempranillo (Southern Oregon)
Strong aromas of charred oak and equally boisterous smoked meat flavors give this wine a rowdy personality. It has medium body but full-throttle aromas like rubber tires and flavors like Concord grapes.,85,Cupcake 2014 Red Velvet Red (California)
A rich style of rosé that has some wood aging and a full-bodied texture. Strawberry fruit flavors dominate. Drink now.,87,Château Brown 2012 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
"This 100% Carignan is a great expression of what the grape can do all by itself without any blending buddies. Red cherry and plum mingle with garrigue herbs and a touch of vanilla on the nose. Soft tannins and vibrant acidity lay out the approachable structure, with a lingering finish accented by sweet spice.",89,Château Cabezac 2007 Cariñu Carignan (Vin de Pays du Val de Cesse)
"The wine has good acidity, crisp green and white fruits, and a bright citrus element. Fresh and fruity, it's ready to drink, with a light mineral texture already well integrated.",87,La Soufrandière 2012 Climat Les Quarts  (Pouilly-Vinzelles)
"Cultivated from a single vine many years ago that the then-vineyard manager believed was special, Husch's Vine One Chard is a soft, exotic wine. It combines smoky-sweet oak notes with baked apple, pear and quince flavors that finish dry and spicy.",86,Husch 2006 Vine One Chardonnay (Anderson Valley)
"A nice, easy to like bubbly that shows why Korbel dominates the market at this price. It's dry and rich in citrus, vanilla, yeasty dough and charred, smoky flavors. Easy to find, with 20,000 cases produced.",87,Korbel 2008 Natural Sparkling (Russian River Valley)
"This blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Sagrantino offers rustic, almost funky but not unpleasant aromas of tilled soil, toast, meat juice and truffle. The palate opens with delicious black cherry, raspberry and clove flavors, along with notes of well-integrated oak and evident alcohol.",87,Dionigi 2010  Montefalco Rosso
"Pinot Blanc gives this wine a classic, yet soft and creamy character. There is just a touch of smokiness adding interest to the ripe red-apple flavors. It's a luscious wine that's ready to drink now. Screwcap.",87,Tinhof 2011 Weissburgunder (Burgenland)
"Earthy overtones of wild mushroom and moist soil add pretty dimension to this classy Brunello. At the core of I Poggiarelli, however, are black fruit, sweet spice, toasted nut and long-lasting black cherry flavors.",94,La Mannella 2006 I Poggiarelli  (Brunello di Montalcino)
The reserve version of this wine has extra richness and concentration. Solid tannins are filled out with ripe juicy blackberry fruits and perfumed acidity. The wine is concentrated and could age for a few more months. Drink from 2017.,89,Aveleda 2013 Charamba Reserva Red (Douro)
"Pretty and deep, this has notes of juicy boysenberry, blueberry and cherry. The balanced acidity and racy tannins give it substance and style.",90,àMaurice 2009 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A soft style, indicating a higher dosage, that produces simple fruits but also a level of bitterness. The wine is a disappointment from such a famous name.",85,Taittinger NV Prestige Rosé Brut  (Champagne)
"This uncommon Italian grape gets a good showing, with aromas of red apples, lychee and wet stone. The flavors are evenly presented with citrus and stone fruit, a straight-forward sipper perfect for sunny days.",88,Burbank Ranch 2013 Little Rascal Estate Grown Arneis (Paso Robles)
"Barrel-fermented and aged on the lees, this Burgundian-style Chard is creamy and rich in ripe tropical fruit flavors and new oak. It's a big wine, forward in pineapple and mango flavors that are honey-ripe and crisp.",88,J. Lohr 2005 Arroyo Seco Vineyard Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco)
"Vines in the Douro Superior, the remote area in the eastern edges of the Douro wine region, go into this firm wine. With its dry tannins and firm structure, the wine is always going to be powerful. It has spice and rich blackberry and damson fruits. The aftertaste brings in acidity. Drink this wine now, but don't forget to let it breathe for a couple of hours.",92,Rui Roboredo Madeira 2010 Vinha da Urze Grande Reserva Tinto Red (Douro)
"It opens up to reveal layers of scents including tilled earth, underbrush, black berries, balsamic notes and baking spices. Juicy red cherry, black cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper and cocoa flavors flow along the vibrant palate supported by a backbone of lively acidity and solid tannins. Drink after 2020.",94,Sordo 2010 Rocche di Castiglione  (Barolo)
"Pressed apples meld with notes of hay and cheese rind on the nose. The mellow palate brings similar elements, brightened by a squirt of citrus on the finish.",82,Ingleside 2013 Reserve Chardonnay (Virginia)
"Pencil shavings and leather aromas mark the entry of this robustly full-bodied wine. It has a pronounced forest floor character, while blackberry and black cherry flavors combine with licorice and dark chocolate, filling out the richer notes that interweave throughout the palate, leading into a long finish.",92,Priest Ranch 2013 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Rubiolo offers a unique palette of aromas, including ripe berry, spice, blackberry preserves and milk chocolate. Chewy and dense in the mouth, it would pair with lamb shanks or pork chops marinated in olive oil and rosemary.",87,Gagliole 2007 Rubiolo  (Chianti Classico)
"Ripe wine with light acidity and flavors of red currants, caramel and spice. There is a full-bodied feel to the finish.",85,Domaine du Jas d'Esclans 2010 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"The balance between wood aging and fruit is at its best in this wine. It shows plenty of red fruits filled out with raisins and nutmeg. As a contrast the wood aging has brought out a spicy, almond character. It is fresh, on the dry side for an aged tawny and, of course, ready to drink.",88,Quinta dos Murças NV 10 Anos Old Tawny  (Port)
"Bone dry and hinting at a sweet herb flavor, this wine backs away from the fruitiness found in most domestic Chenin Blanc. It offers complex details of yellow fruit, lemon verbena and beeswax.",90,Merriman 2011 Old Vine The Brasher Block Chenin Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Oaky and buttery all the way, this unabashedly old-fashioned Chardonnay will certainly appeal to those who love that style. It's a big chunky blocky wine, with simple, generic fruit awash in oak.",87,Firesteed 2014 Citation Chardonnay (Oregon)
"Here is yet another Roero Riserva from the successful 2007 vintage that shows a good use of oak set against tighter sour berry nuances. The wine is approachable and ready to drink, with a clean, upfront personality.",89,Matteo Correggia 2007 Roche d'Ampsej Riserva  (Roero)
"Dry, tannic and rough in the mouth, this offers pleasant blackberry, red currant, spice and cedar flavors.",83,Vivo Vino 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Straightforward and bright, this easygoing Nero d'Avola offers notes of forest fruit, cherry, dried rosemary and toasted almond. The palate is lean, fresh and streamlined.",88,Zisola 2010 Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"This is an extremely ripe super Tuscan blend with jammy notes of blackberry and strawberry backed by clove and white peppercorn. The wine has a thorny, raw side and ends with sweet, chewy tannins and a smoky aftertaste.",85,Giordano 2007 Red (Toscana)
"Super dense and hard as a rock, with bacon and black fruit aromas that lead straight to a saturated, chewy, tannic palate that pounds away as it delivers blackberry, coffee, licorice and other huge flavors. As big, baked and heavy as they come, with gargantuan tannins. Includes 15% Syrah in addition to Monastrell.",85,Bodegas Murtia 2008 Cármine Monastrell (Jumilla)
"The label reads “The Original coffee/chocolate Pinotage” and boy are they right! This is pure decadent bliss with intense aromas of crème de cacao, raspberry chocolate sauce and coffee granules along with hints of hickory bacon and tobacco. The mouth is huge, ripe and full, with a balanced structure and gorgeous flavors of juicy mashed black raspberries, plum flesh, sweet smoked meat and mocha that leads strongly throughout the lengthy finish. With 500 cases imported, this is a Pinotage worth searching out and trying.",91,Diemersfontein 2008 Pinotage (Wellington)
"Abundant layers of char and smoke threaten to overtake the bright black-cherry and green herb flavors on this premium wine. Aeration brings the fruit to the forefront, but hints of toasted wood and dill linger on the finish.",86,Huber 2009 Bombacher Sommerhalde R GG Trocken Spätburgunder (Baden)
"Full-bodied and richly textured, this isn't a prototypically delicate Côte Rôtie, but it's still very enjoyable. Clove and black olive notes are backed by plummy fruit, capped off by a long, dusty finish. Drink now–2025.",90,Jean-Luc Colombo 2012 La Divine  (Côte Rôtie)
"A blend of Nero d'Avola and Frappato, this opens with heady aromas of cut rose, red berry and dark spice. The round, simple palate doles out juicy Maresca cherry, crushed raspberry and a note of white pepper alongside silky, smooth tannins. There's no complexity but it is easy drinking and delicious.",88,Corvo 2014 Irmana Red (Terre Siciliane)
"Earthy gritty berry aromas come with a hint of animal. This is juicy and in good shape across the palate, while bright plum and berry flavors are dusted with spice and chocolate notes. A wiry finish with lightly medicinal berry flavors shows kick.",86,Grandes Vinos y Viñedos 2015 El Circo Volatinero Tempranillo (Cariñena)
"This 100% varietal wine is awash in chocolate and earthy truffle, richly layered and yet firm in structured tannin. With sizable, full-bodied weight, it begs for more time in bottle, a chance for the crisp red fruit lurking underneath the texture to focus further. Drink now through 2023.",93,Jean Edwards 2013 Seventy Four-Forty One Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Muscadelle and Sémillon is round, full and softly textured. White fruits, spice and fresh acidity are already well integrated. The end is tangy with lemon zest flavors. Drink now. The estate has been in the Forcato family since 1950.",86,Château Lary 2014  Bordeaux Blanc
"This wine's nose bears an uncanny similarity to animal crackers, and along the way there's peach and melon aromas. The palate is sweet and slightly punchy, with mango and white raisin flavors. Overall, bank on sweetness and liquidy ripeness from this drink-now Albariño.",88,Fulget 2006 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Covila produces mostly good-quality affordable Rioja wines, but with this bottling the winery has stepped it up a notch. Aromas of raisin, graphite, prune, vanilla and coconut are ripe and oaky. A chunky, blocky, ripe palate holds blackberry and cassis flavors that come with notes of dried herbs. Chewy tannins and peppery spice push a bold finish. Drink through 2022.",92,Covila 2010 Pagos de Labarca  (Rioja)
"Purely delicious, this has stunning and distinctive aromas and flavors that recall pomegranate juice and blueberries, plus a velvety-smooth texture. While very full bodied, this wine does not win with power but with grace. It has excellent balance and harmony, and stands above the crowd.",93,Boeger 2013 Walker Vineyard Zinfandel (El Dorado)
"Previously lableled Quatre Journaux, this is now vineyard-designated, but otherwise everything remains unchanged. It's a pretty wine, with rhubarb and red-plum fruit. Further details of orange peel and chocolate emerge as it opens. The perfectly balanced acids and tannins suggest it will thrive in the cellar. Drink now–2006.",91,Scott Paul 2013 Azana Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"Massara is a gorgeous, seriously beautiful expression of Barolo with dark concentration that follows straight up to the wine's rim. Opulent aromas are of forest fruit, cherry cola, licorice, mesquite shavings and root beer. The wine has all the qualities for a long aging future including acidity, tannins and pulpy fruit tones.",93,Castello di Verduno 2007 Massara  (Barolo)
"Acidic and rustic, but rich in fruit, this Cab shows lots of cherries, blackberries and briary wild berries. It's an easy wine to drink, and the price is pretty good.",85,Cable Car 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"This wine really opens a fascinating window on the aging potential of Barbera. From the 2004 vintage, it still exhibits elegant mineral notes with polished granite and slate. There's plenty of fruit there too, mostly cherry, and the wine ends with vanilla and spice.",88,Cascina Roera 2004 Cardin  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore)
"Here's a basic Malbec with ripe plum aromas topped off by milk chocolate and vanilla notes. It's hard but bold in the mouth, with decent acidity and a forced set of oaky, chocolaty, berry flavors.",84,Bodega Cuarto Dominio 2012 Lote 44 Malbec (Mendoza)
"Scorched soil, toasted oak, dried sage and roasted coffee bean aromas lead the nose. The approachable full-bodied palate offers dried cherry, espresso and a hint of clove alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit.",88,Mocali 2011  Brunello di Montalcino
"Raisiny aromas are rich and gritty. Pounding tannins and a beam of acidity drive the palate, which brings flavors of oaky baked fruits and black licorice. A jammy finish with baked berry and raisiny flavors confirms that this is extremely ripe and ready to drink now.",86,Cellers Unió 2011 Señorio de Convey Red (Priorat)
"Site speaks loudly in this beautifully made wine that is allowed to show its naturally inclined power within a constraint of cool-climate terroir. Juicy and explosive on the palate in cherry, raspberry, forest floor and jolts of cardamom, it's both lush and toasty, with a firmness to the tannin structure that suggests plenty of aging potential. It should get pretty interesting between 2024 and 2034, if one can possibly wait.",95,Three Sticks 2014 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Juicy, fresh and lively, this is a light-bodied effort with a big presence on the palate in terms of rich mouthfeel and velvety tannin. Blueberry, cherry and a pronouncement of forest floor play well together to offer both savory and fruit-tinged sweet.",93,Buena Vista 2014 Bela's Selection Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This is a subtle red wine whose tannins gingerly coat the midpalate and linger. Full of red fruit flavors and balanced by an herb note, this is softly textured and round.",87,Paul Dolan 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino County)
"Dry and medium-bodied, this Pinot has nice raspberry, cherry and persimmon flavors, as well as brisk acidity. Toasted oak shows up as smoky, brown butter sauce. The earthiness suggests pairing with a rich risotto of butternut squash or wild mushrooms.",88,Poseidon 2012 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"This rich blend gets its ripe texture and warm pear and citrus flavors from 50% Sémillon. It has an attractive perfumed edge, with kiwi-like acidity and a peppery aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",88,Château Tour des Gendres 2016 Cuvée des Conti White (Bergerac Sec)
"Lovely, fruity wine, with ripe apples and peaches dominating. But there's also plenty of toasty new oak and roasted hazelnuts. Soft and approachable, with a bright, hot finish.",90,Woodward Canyon 1999 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Sangiovese (70%), Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc are blended here to produce a rich, velvety wine with defined aromas of blackberry, chocolate, espresso and pipe tobacco. The wine finishes with a soft, chewy texture.",89,Le Buche 2007 Le Buche Olivi Cantine Red (Toscana)
"The Escarpment style is always one of ample ripeness, weight and structure, and the 2009 measures up to the winery's previous successes. Plummy fruit is tinged with a dark chocolate note, while the palate is richly textured, and the finish is long and velvety. Drink now–2018.",90,Escarpment 2009 Pinot Noir (Martinborough)
"This nervy, refreshing and substantive wine practically bursts with apple peel and apricot flavors. The texture is tangy but also full enough to feel rounded, and lively enough with acid and fruit to have a virtual electric charge.",90,Turkovich 2015 Albariño (Yolo County)
"In perfect proportion, this estate-grown, biodynamically farmed wine brings a sweet-tart fruit intensity to bear. Citrusy flavors of pith and skin are skillfully wedded to ripe, substantial apricot and melon fruit, with none of the bitterness this grape can sometimes display. The purity is impressive.",91,Cowhorn 2014 Viognier (Applegate Valley)
"Starts out sulfury, a smell that's very slow to blow off. Beneath that eggy scent, this Petite Sirah, Barbera, Zin and Carignane blend isn't bad. Dry and tannic, it shows a robust earthiness reminiscent of certain Spanish reds. But the sulfur kills it.",82,Ten Mile 2005 Proprietary Red Wine Red (California)
"Juicy with blackberry and cola notes on the nose, but not overly dense thanks to a black-slate minerality, this wine offers somewhat simple grape-candy flavors on the palate along with lilacs and other purple flower elements. Those make for a fairly tasty and easy-to-quaff bottle.",87,Vinum 2013 The Insider Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Aromas of white rose, sage, citrus and grapefruit carry over to the palate along with ripe peach and orange zest. It's semisweet and lightly sparkling, with a slightly sweet finish and a frothy mousse.",87,Stella Rosa NV Imperiale Fior d'Arancio Orange Moscato (Colli Euganei)
"This is a standout, showing Napa Valley's true potential for the variety. Steely and light bodied in approach, it offers a lively complement of apricot and juicy green-apple flavors, finishing on a fresh fig note and feeling balanced and complete.",93,Joseph Phelps 2015 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (St. Helena)
"Sweet orange and ripe melon notes fill the nose and plump mouth, while additional accents of apple skin and soft toast carry through to the clean finish. Drink now.",85,Indaba 2010 Chardonnay (Western Cape)
"Herbs, spices and green fruit aromas show the freshness of this wine. On the palate, tropical fruits, apricots and lychees also appear, fleshing out a superb Sauvignon Blanc. With its edges of apple skin tannins, it could age for 2–3 years, but it already has huge concentration and elegance. Glass stopper.",91,Sattlerhof 2006 Kranachberg Sauvignon Blanc (Südsteiermark)
"Ripe blackberry, black cherry, red currant, clove, tobacco, licorice and cedar all unfold in this sleek, polished blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Silky tannins provide the elegant framework, while a mineral note closes the finish. Drink through 2021.",92,Tenuta degli Dei 2011 Cavalli Red (Toscana)
"Classic varietal aromas of tomato leaf, exotic fruit and citrus practically jump out of the glass. The bright palate doles out juicy peach, nectarine, grapefruit, celery and sage while a mineral vein lends energy.",91,Vie di Romans 2015 Piere Sauvignon (Friuli Isonzo)
"With some attractive perfume, this is a crisp sparkling wine that's brightly fruity and touched with spice and lemon acidity. It has a pepper edge and a tangy mouthfeel, and finishes on a bold, citrusy note.",86,Steininger 2011 Sekt Riesling (Österreichischer Sekt)
"On the dry side, with caramel and strawberry flavors, this is an attractive, bright rosé, as fresh as they come.",83,Adega Cooperativa Ponte de Barca 2010 Escolha Rosé (Vinho Verde)
"A complete wine in every way, this limited (three barrel) reserve opens with solid bass notes of thick wood and dark fruit. That platform of black cherry and cassis is adorned with light touches of pepper, vanilla, mocha and the streak of iron that seems to characterize many McMinnville wines. Drink 2015 through 2030.",93,Hyland 2012 Founders' Selection Pinot Noir (McMinnville)
"Made from a bunch of different varieties, including Viognier and Pinot Grigio, this white blend is off-dry, with a sweet edge to the orange and peach fruit.",84,Lost Angel 2009 Ruckus White (California)
"Owned by the Thomas family, this wine has an unusual blend of 50% Merlot and 35% Petit Verdot (with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon). It shows how Petit Verdot can now ripen easily in warm years. The dark color and dense tannins are a counterpoint to the juicy blackberry fruit. They will allow this wine to age well. Drink from 2021.",91,Château Reverdi 2014  Listrac-Médoc
"Negroamaro Maru is characterized by simple, sweet-tasting fruit aromas of blackberry jelly and raspberry. Those pretty fruit flavors are backed by soft tannins and a chewy texture.",87,Castello Monaci 2010 Maru Negroamaro (Salento)
"Signorio is a surprisingly polished and elegant Nero d'Avola with a silky, fine texture and bright flavors of dried fruit, cassis, espresso and dark chocolate. Pair this pretty wine with saffron and shrimp risotto.",90,Tenuta Barone Nicolò La Lumia 2007 Signorio Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"Enticing perfumed berry, violet, new leather and a truffle scents emerge in this textbook Brunello. On the savory, full-bodied palate, licorice, clove and chopped herb flavors accent a juicy core of ripe black cherry fruit. Firm, refined tannins provide structure. It's already tempting but hold for even more complexity. Drink 2020–2032.",96,Baricci 2012  Brunello di Montalcino
"Hailing from Slide Mountain and Dineen vineyards, this wine charms with aromas of flowers, toast, clove, cardamom and anise. The pillowy-feeling flavors show richness, depth and detail.",91,Soos Creek 2012 Stampede Pass Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Here's a Chianti Classico with a sweet-smelling nose that recalls red roses, almond blossom and Christmas spice. It has good intensity and rich notes of cherry and spice that liven up its smooth texture.",87,Terrabianca 2006 Scassino  (Chianti Classico)
"Olive, blackberry and toasty oak all give hope, but when this wine crosses the palate the acidity is so intense that it causes you to take count of your cheeks, tongue and teeth. On one hand, there's blackberry and cassis flavors to enjoy; on the other, the mouthfeel leaves you roughed up. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",84,Graffigna 2004 Grand Reserve Malbec (San Juan)
"Chocolate-covered cherry and plum surround a shock of stark acidity on this wine that has a round and soft palate. On the finish, a touch of astringency flirts with cedar.",86,Foundry 2012 Broken Rock Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Very pungent in gooseberry aromas, this ultra-dry wine is crisp in mouthwatering acidity. The flavors are of grapefruits, orange rind, vanilla and spice.",85,Bogle 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (California)
"This is the second wine of Château de Mercuès, and it has some of the same concentration and tannins as the first wine, without the huge and powerful structure. It will develop its black cherry and spice flavors relatively quickly, to yield a ready-to-drink wine in 2–3 years.",88,Georges Vigouroux 2010 Château de Mercuès Le Vassal de Mercuès Malbec (Cahors)
"This rich wine has peach and quince flavors along with spice and hints of toast. It's full in the mouth, very fruity and fresh, a warm wine that does manage to keep a fresh burst of lemon acidity at the end. Drink now, but better at the end of 2014.",88,Quinta do Sagrado 2012 Sagrado White (Douro)
"This does a good job of balancing lively pear and apple flavors with dashes of toast and butter. It's medium to full-bodied, dry and has enough crispness to help the flavors linger.",86,Leaping Horse 2013 Chardonnay (California)
"This wine is the top of the line for Black Kite, and it certainly does not disappoint. Tea leaves, raspberry and cherry make a great blend of aromas, while the fruit flavors are bright like red cherries, the texture lively and fresh, and the overall impression very elegant. Best now through 2020.",93,Black Kite 2013 Angel Hawk Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"This is a fresh, juicy wine with acidity and bright red fruits. Yes, there are tannins but they support the lively, crisp strawberries and the spice that comes from the wood aging. The wine is developing fast and will be ready to drink from 2018.",88,Domaine Bart 2014 Les Echezots  (Marsannay)
"The Kögl is one of the great Krems vineyards, and this full-bodied Riesling has considerable power as well as intensely crisp acidity. There is just a touch of spice to go with the pineapple juice and green apples. Keep this wine for 4–5 years.",92,Stadt Krems 2009 Kögl Reserve Riesling (Kremstal)
"This firmly tannic wine is a selection made for aging. It has structure and a dry core. Set against this are the blackberry fruits, the acidity and the juicy aftertaste. It will be ready from 2018.",88,Rui Roboredo Madeira 2015 Castello d'Alba Reserva Red (Douro)
"This variety is an extreme rarity in the state but shows plenty of promise in this nascent growing region. Aromas of cherry, herb and spice lead to broad tart full cherry flavors that show a sense of purity, finesse and length.",90,Wilridge 2015 Estate Zweigelt (Naches Heights)
"This wine nicely displays the fleshy pear, melon and citrus notes of unoaked Chard. It's plump and medium-bodied, with a clean, refreshing finish. What it isn't is particularly complex, but it will still go well with any number of seafood or chicken dishes this summer.",87,Nepenthe 2006 Unoaked Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)
"Smoky, meaty aromas, with bacon flavors, bitter coffee and spice. It is rustic, its texture ragged around the edge. A wine that demands spicy barbecue food.",84,Paxá Wines 2009 Tinto Red (Algarve)
"The Cabernet Sauvignon comes from Howell Mountain. The Sangiovese is from Sonoma Valley, and the Cab Franc comes from Santa Ynez Valley. The resulting blend is rewarding. Although it's a light-bodied wine, the power of the cherry, raspberry, chocolate, anise, vanilla, clove and pepper flavors is considerable.",88,Sunstone 2005 Founder's Reserve Red (California)
"It seems that there has been a dramatic increase in the production of this wine. Gassy and thin, it shows a veneer of slightly sweet apple and finishes with a dusting of powdered sugar.",85,Coeur de Terre 2014 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"Mossy, herbal, baked-berry aromas are accented by shades of green tones. On the palate, this is lively but a touch raw, with bold acidity. Blackberry, spiced plum, oak and herbal, grassy flavors finish snappy.",88,Viña Maipo 2012 Gran Devoción Carmenère (Maule Valley)
"The Auxerrois is a sadly neglected grape. It produces delicious wine with a touch of pepper and lively acidity. This is a good example, refreshing and ready to drink.",88,Léon Manbach 2011 Auxerrois (Alsace)
"You'll find wild red berry, coconut, leather, dark spice and balsamic notes on the nose of this wine. They infuse the palate, accenting its espresso-like flavor. It's full-bodied, with a backbone of close-grained tannins that give the finish grip. Drink 2019–2027.",90,Podere San Giacomo 2012  Brunello di Montalcino
"Grenache makes up nearly three-quarters of this blend, with the rest Syrah and Mourvèdre. Bright raspberry, cranberry, rose hip and white pepper aromas lead to elegant yet high octane fruit flavors that taper toward the warm finish.",88,:Nota Bene 2012 Una Notte Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Ripe, smooth and toasty, this has the feel and texture of Chardonnay. It is full and rounded, yet its acidity and red fruit character lend elegance.",89,Château d'Esclans 2010 Les Clans Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"With advice from consultant and Bordeaux University professor Denis Dubourdieu, Batailley has improved immensely in the past few years. This 2010 reinforces that trend, revealing a wine that is structured with Cabernet Sauvignon and is attractive with black currant fruitiness. Age for the medium-term.",94,Château Batailley 2010  Pauillac
"This is a big Pinot Noir, dark and full bodied and juicy in pomegranates, cherries, red plums and sautéed wild mushrooms, and the interplay of oak with fruit even yields richer notes of milk chocolate. It's devastatingly good, but also too young and fresh now to show its best. With its fine tannins and exquisite balance, this articulate young wine should be best after 2013.",96,Goldeneye 2007 The Narrows Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Dark gold in color with a waft of cologne, this aromatic white pushes on tartness despite its medium-bodied, okay underside. Wet stone and dried flowers provide additional complexity.",88,Belden Barns 2014 Estate Grown Grüner Veltliner (Sonoma Mountain)
"A fifty-fifty blend of native grapes Cesanese di Affile and Cesanese Comune, this savory, medium-bodied charmer offers juicy black currant, blackberry, white pepper and intriguing charred notes. It's well balanced with fresh acidty and lithe tannis that offer easy-drinking pleasure.",88,Corte dei Papi 2013 Colle Ticchio  (Cesanese del Piglio)
"The vineyard is, of course, in Oakville, which makes you wonder why they put the generic Napa Valley on the label. The wine itself, which is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, is very dry and tannic. Flamboyant, too, with deep black currant flavors bathed in 100% new French oak. Feels lavish and important, but young. Better left untouched for 6–8 years.",94,Knights Bridge 2007 Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This wine offers a delicate fragrance of pressed white flower, apricot and peach. The palate delivers citrus and toasted almond notes, creamy texture and small, persistent bubbles.",88,Castello Bonomi NV Satèn Brut Chardonnay (Franciacorta)
"Aged in 60% new French oak and made with a good dose of malolactic fermentation, this Chardonnay is dominated buttered toast and popcorn flavors. It's an opulent style of Chardonnay, but obscures pleasant flavors of tropical fruit, pear and apricot.",88,Three Sticks 2011 Durell Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley)
"A wood-aged white, spicy and ripe. It has just the right balance of acidity to go with the ripe green plum and melon fruits. With a great bite of acidity to finish, this is a wine that will age for 3–4 years.",90,Quinta do Vallado 2010 Reserva Branco White (Douro)
"Made from a blend of Gamay and Grolleau, this is a bright and fresh wine. There's no wood aging here, just fruit that is full of red-berry flavors and only a touch of tannin. The wine is ready to drink.",85,Domaine du Clos de l'Elu 2013 Indigène Red (Val de Loire)
"The aroma is very ripe, almost like a Port wine. Flavors are deep and ripe, with a twinge of dried fruit, and the texture is appropriately firm and tannic. It's a bold, hearty and full-bodied Bordeaux-style blend.",86,Naggiar 2012 La Boheme Estate Reserve Red (Sierra Foothills)
"Made entirely from Central Itay's native Passerina grape, this has apple and pineapple flavors accented by hints of dried herbs and delicate mineral. Crisp acidity leaves the palate refreshed.",86,Le Caniette 2012 Lucrezia Passerina (Marche)
"Light aromas of ripe pear and jasmine precede medium-sweet, somewhat oily-feeling flavors. It doesn't all come together but still provides enjoyment.",85,San Juan Vineyards 2014 Riesling (Yakima Valley)
"Overripe jammy plum and berry aromas dominate the nose. The palate is almost cloying, and heavy with candied berry flavors on the finish.",84,Veramonte 2013 Red (Central Valley)
"Full-fruited, expressive notes of ripe pear shine on nose and palate. This wine has lively, attractive fruit notes and bags of freshness and flavor. The palate is clean but has a soft, fresh richness at its core that makes it very moreish. Lemon notes linger beautifully.",89,Kuentz-Bas 2013 Trois Chateaux Auxerrois (Alsace)
"Made from 50% Grenache, 30% Cinsault and 20% Syrah, this is a vibrant, floral rosé, offering upfront aromas of iris, lavender and laurel that complement the raspberry and strawberry-hull core. The fruity palate is bright and refreshing, with ample acidity and just a hint of orange blossom on the finish.",89,Côté Mas 2012 Rosé Aurore Rosé (Pays d'Oc)
"The nose on this white appeals from the get-go. Elegant waves of lemon, orange blossom and peach aromas are followed by a balanced but luxurious blend of pear, peach and white flowers on the palate. Big but pretty.",88,Elios 2009 Mediterranean White White (Peloponnese)
"The name of this wine comes from the landscape of the vineyard with its ancient rocks and fossilized remains. It is soft, smooth and spicy, with bold, ripe flavors and a touch of vanilla from the wood aging. This is generous, full of fruit and ready to drink.",89,Casa Santos Lima 2015 Stones & Bones Red (Lisboa)
"Dark colored wine, with ripe black plum flavors that lie over solidly textured tannins. Structured to bring out the fruit, the wine also has a core of wood, spice, dark cocoa and black currant acidity to finish. An attractive wine that is worth aging for another two years.",89,Château Franc-Cardinal 2005  Bordeaux Côtes de Francs 
"Cabernet-philes who want to experiment with Petite Sirah will find this a rewarding entry wine. It shows the variety's firm, punchy tannins, full-bodied muscularity, and deeply extracted black currant, plum, carob, coffee, pepper and cedar flavors that are powerful and long-lasting. Yet beyond the brawn is elegance and finesse. Drink now through 2010.",90,Toogood 2005 Petite Sirah (El Dorado)
"A brooding, textured Pinot Noir with some weight to it, deep in dark cherry and blackberry aromas and flavors, with a finish of roses and spice. This wine is aching to be paired with savory mushrooms.",92,Couloir 2011 Londer Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"When caught fresh, this is one of the Txakoli region's best wines. It comes on hard, clacky and tight as a box of nails, with citrus and minerally aromas. The palate is crisp and tight, with apple, lime, kiwi and spritz. Long, clean and refreshing.",89,Txomín Etxaníz 2010 Getaria White (Getariako Txakolina)
"This Cab is soft and lush with cherry, red currant and anise flavors that linger long into a spicy finish. It gains extra points for the tannin-acid structure, which is so easy to like.",90,Venteux 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"The results of a partnership between Golan Heights Winery's Chief Winemaker Victor Schoenfeld and world-renowned winemaker and consultant Zelma Long, Rom (meaning “summit” in Hebrew) is a reference and tribute to the culmination of their relationship. The inaugural effort is a gorgeous wine composed of 37% Syrah, 34% Cabernet Sauvignon and 29% Merlot aged in French oak for 21 months. The result is a powerful, lush and concentrated wine loaded with black raspberry, blueberry, thin mint cookies and savory spice. Full weight with forward tannins and medium acidity, this is an Old World wine with a New World attitude.",91,Golan Heights Winery 2006 Yarden Rom Red (Galilee)
"From a small vineyard in St. Helena comes this ripe young wine, a Cab Franc-based Bordeaux blend. It's soft and forward, with cherry, red currant, licorice, chocolate and cedar flavors that show Napa tannins at their smooth, ripe best. It's a little tight now, so give it a few years.",91,Trespass 2005 Rendezvous Red (Napa Valley)
"With deep color and generous, ripe fruit aromas, this gives a first impression of being a big wine—which it is. Flavors are deep and rich, like black currant jam and black cherry juice with hints of mint and nutmeg. The body is full, the tannins firm enough to back up that gorgeous flavor, and the texture stays velvety through the finish.",91,Maldonado 2012 Los Olivos Vineyard Pinot Noir (Napa Valley)
"This is a gorgeous Sauvignon from northern Italy that demonstrates true varietal characteristics of exotic fruit, citrus and tomato leaf. The mouthfeel is sharply etched and crisp with a very tonic and steely feel.",88,Erste Neue 2011 Sauvignon (Alto Adige)
"This is richly powerful, packed with dark plum fruits and solid, concentrated tannins. At this stage, it is closed, a potential powerhouse of firm fruits and structure. It has weight, the fruit and the firm texture all promising long-term aging. Drink from 2020.",95,Domaine Rossignol-Trapet 2011  Chapelle-Chambertin
"Dark colored, this offers considerable wood aromas. It tastes dry and extracted, layering bitter coffee flavors on burnt toast. Mere hints of fruitiness seep through the big tannic structure.",84,Château du Parc 2012  Saint-Émilion
"Impressively crafted from 20-plus-year-old vines, thus the Heritage tag, this blend of mostly Zin with 20% Petite Sirah and 1% Primitivo is like Sunday brunch. It offers a study in bacon and strawberries laced in syrup, a thick, leathery wine that finishes balanced and just shy of over-decadent.",90,Dry Creek Vineyard 2014 Heritage Vines Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"This is a basic Chablis, soft and fruity. Apples and pear skin flavors have a burst of acidity, a light mineral texture and a juicy aftertaste. It is ready to drink.",84,Louis Jadot 2013  Chablis
"For under $10, this wine delivers an admirable blend of cherry fruit and savory underpinnings. Hints of asphalt and black olive finish on a mouthwatering note, joined by the suggestion of caramelized fruit. Drink now.",86,De Bortoli 2013 DB Family Selection Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)
"This is a superrich, dense wine. It has firm tannins and a steely, mineral edge that permeates the texture. A ripe black-plum flavor is generous while still young and full of fresh acidity. The wine needs to age, so drink from 2017.",92,Wines & Winemakers 2012 Lua Cheia em Vinhas Velhas Reserva Especial Red (Douro)
"Sharp acidity and intense oak meet in this deeply concentrated, tropically-influenced white. Peach, apple pie, and faint pineapple flavors all figure in.",87,Thomas George 2014 Cresta Ridge Vineyard Estate Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This Cabernet has rich blackberry-jam and black licorice flavors, and it also has a funky bacon note. The oak provides a pleasant backdrop of sweet toast. This shows how well Cabernet can perform on the far Sonoma Coast, which is now  more oriented to Pinot Noir.",90,Wellington 2002 Mohrhardt Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Coast)
"Aromas of wisteria, jasmine, orchard fruit and a whiff of mountain herbs lead the nose. The creamy palate offers yellow apple, white peach, sage and a note of candied lemon drop alongside a soft mousse and bright acidity.",88,Foss Marai 2014 Nadin Millesimato Dry  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"This is both powerful and elegant, giving great ripe fruit, black berries and dark tannins. It is a solid wine, its fruit packed into a firm structure. It has a delicious juicy character that balances the acidity and tannins. Age for several years.",91,Quinta do Passadouro 2008 Passadouro Red (Douro)
"Ripe and soft, this is a smooth wine. With its attractive black fruits and the lightest touch of tannin, it is fruity with a hint of toast. Drink this wine now.",86,Fiuza 2015 Merlot (Tejo)
"This low-sizzle Chardonnay opens with little to nothing in the way of fruit aromas. The palate is chunky, with squash and bready flavors. A lightly vegetal, bitter finish is plump but low on intensity.",85,De Martino 2014 Legado Reserva Chardonnay (Limarí Valley)
"This blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon offers excellent fruit and shapely oak tones of spice, chocolate and sweet tobacco.",90,Rocca di Frassinello 2010 Le Sughere di Frassinello  (Maremma Toscana)
"Napa-based Elyse is better known for their Cabernet Sauvignon, but they have reached into Nevada County, in the Sierra Foothills, for this lovely Rhône-style blend. It's soft in acidity and the tannins are melted, as you might expect from a warm-to-hot region. But the flavors are plush in jammy cherries, black raspberries, chocolate and crushed black pepper.",89,Elyse 2005 Naggiar Vineyard C'est si Bon Red (Sierra Foothills)
"This smells like citrus and rhubarb more than Malbec, with a tart, herbal palate that's high in acid and short on enjoyability.",80,Black Box 2011 Malbec (Mendoza)
"Toasted bramble berry aromas come with hints of tree bark and mixed spices. This feels chewy, dense and round, while flavors of roasted plum and berry are well spiced. The chewy, round, tannic finish is rooty and spicy.",89,Santa Alba 2012 Grand Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Curicó Valley)
"A simple Pinot Noir, dry and light-bodied, with thinned-down cherry, cola and raspberry jam flavors.",82,Pinot Patch 2012 Pinot Noir (California)
"With 20 acres—the smallest of the Margaux classified growths—Ferrière has produced a 2010 of considerable weight and structure. It's dark and serious, with a solid flavor of black plum skin and dense acidity on the finish. Keep this wine for at least seven years for it to start softening.",91,Château Ferrière 2010  Margaux
"Jammy blueberry aromas are grapy, with ample char and grit coming from background oak. This feels firm, wiry, grabby and drying. Jammy, herbal flavors of cassis and blueberry finish with big, rubbery, elastic tannins.",88,Vinos de Arganza 2012 Legado de Farro Roble Mencía (Bierzo)
"A gorgeous and decadent Syrah with aromas and flavors of black raspberry, black cherry, fudge brownie and coffee ice cream. The lush and creamy mouth is full but not overdone, with a fantastic evolution on the palate from fresh dark fruit to sweet chocolaty flavors and finally pepper-flecked spice on the long finish. Balanced and read to drink now, though you could hold for another couple of years to mellow.",90,Laurent Miquel 2007 Nord Sud Syrah (Vin de Pays d'Oc)
"From a limestone-laden vineyard 25 miles east of the cool Monterey Bay comes a solid wine redolent with notes of black cherry, toasted sage, cedar and cinnamon.

Harlan)
"The nose on this strange Cabernet is mostly about cinnamon and funky smelling fruit. This feels flat, with gum drop flavors that end in a grabby, cloying finish.",81,YaYa 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Maule Valley)
This estate-grown 100% Syrah is sour and inelegant on its own but would have worked nicely in a blend where it could have provided meaty structure.,82,Fallbrook 2009 33 Degrees North Gracie Hill Vineyard Syrah (South Coast)
"Light, bright and citrusy, this lovely wine is integrated in terms of oak and ripeness, letting its crispness of lemon and tangerine speak loudest. A complex, structured wine, it becomes more interesting as it opens, allowing room for specks of stone and nutmeg to peek through.",93,Small Vines 2014 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"Veteran chef Puck lends his name here to a quaffable wine. It's a blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and several other varieties. The mouthfeel is soft with luscious flavors veering toward cherry pie. A portion of the profits goes to Alzheimer's research.",84,Wolfgang Puck 2010 Master Lot Reserve Red (California)
"The wine has a jammy character that gives it concentration. It is sweet although with enough acidity. The blackberry jelly flavors are firmed out with some fine tannins, certainly plenty to promise good aging. Drink from 2025.",90,Quinta do Crasto 2015 Vintage  (Port)
"This is opulent and rich, with a thick, velvety texture and pretty aromas of blackberry, chocolate, leather and freshly milled white pepper. Cortona is the wine area of Italy that's most closely associated with this grape.",92,La Braccesca 2008 Bramasole Syrah (Cortona)
"Dried-fruit flavors of prune and raisin lend a very ripe, dense richness to this high-powered full-bodied wine. It has good supportive acidity and tannins to balance out the extreme ripeness.",88,Church & State 2014 Lost Inhibitions I Don't Care Who's Watching Red (California)
"Coffee, cigarbox and mocha aromas and flavors characterize this Rietvallei red. Complex and assertive, the wine unfolds with a chewy but poised intensity.

"A touch of honey brings a sense of sweetness to the flavors of lemon candy, pineapple juice, green melon and vanilla. Tart acidity provides fine vitality and balance. This shows real Napa Valley finesse.",88,Black Stallion 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Red berry white pepper and saline aromas carry through to the simple light-bodied palate along with a hint of almond. It's fresh and easy drinking, with bright acidity. Enjoy soon.",85,Sartori 2016  Bardolino Chiaretto
"Blue flower, ripe plum, vanilla, underbrush and leather aromas waft out of the glass. The palate delivers black cherry, coffee, toast, black pepper and clove alongside tightly-knit tannins. Drink 2015–2020.",90,Vignavecchia 2010 Riserva Odoardo Beccari  (Chianti Classico)
"Sharp lime skins, rich petrol and yellow grapefruit juice combine for that familiarly fresh Riesling aroma, yet this one is a tad richer, with a lemon pastry note. Dried lemons and apples show on the palate, where a zesty, tangy yuzu acidity meets with ginger and lemongrass notes. A complex bottling.",90,Brooklyn West 2012 Riesling (Santa Ynez Valley)
"One of just a handful of varietal bottlings made in the state, this wine offers aromas of white pepper, fresh vegetables and flowers. It drinks dry with elegantly styled fruit flavors.",87,Pacific Rim 2015 Spring Creek Vineyard Grüner Veltliner (Yakima Valley)
"A virtual fruit salad with bubbles, this wine gushes cherry, apple and banana aromas. It has equally ripe flavors and a broad, almost soft texture punctuated by lively effervescence.",88,Mirabelle NV Brut Sparkling (California)
"There is an unfortunately strong scent of burnt match to this wine, so much so that it can be tasted as well. Oversulfured though it may be, it's a delicious bottle, with ripe, round fruit, made in a big, balanced style and enhanced with generous new oak. Air it out!",88,Woodward Canyon 2000 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"An awkward wine, high in acid, with grapefruit, green tea and dried thyme aromas and flavors. Okay in its own way, but doesn't seem quite ripe.",83,Pacific Oasis 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Barbara County)
"Light amber in color, this five year old Sauvignon Blanc has aromas of caramelized pear and grilled pineapple. This style of wine pairs perfectly with strong, earthy cheeses.",88,Batič 2009 Sauvignon (Vipavska Dolina)
"This wine has a firm structure, solid with tannins and a dense, complex balance between acidity and perfumed red berry flavors. It is juicy, full of freshness as well as considerable tannins. It needs to be aged for several years; drink from 2019.",92,Louis Latour 2012 Les Cazetiers Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin)
"This new producer starts with estate-grown, mountaintop fruit from the Bennett Valley side of Sonoma Mountain to craft an inky, leathery wine that's full bodied and dense. Juicy in blackberry and smoked meat, it shows promise in the glass, evolving into a soft, peppery finish.",91,Belden Barns 2012 Estate Grown Syrah (Sonoma Mountain)
"Serpico is a bold, larger-than-life wine, with beautiful aromatic intensity and notes of black fruit, espresso and crushed granite. Some 18 months of oak aging adds elements of dark spice and smoke; and the wine shows firm tannins and a long, polished mouthfeel. It's very elegant and should withstand many more years of cellar aging.",93,Feudi di San Gregorio 2008 Serpico Aglianico (Irpinia)
"This Tempranillo-based rosé is clean up front, with hints of citrus and chewing gum to the nose. A solid mouthfeel makes for a good palate, while this offers a quick pop of zesty citrus fruit that's backed by duller yeast and wheat notes on the finish.",87,Urbina 2015 Rosé (Rioja)
"This is certainly dramatic in structure, akin to a young Pauillac from Bordeaux, with concentrated currant, cherry, pencil lead and cedar flavors wrapped into youthfully hard tannins. It needs time, and should soften with increased complexity by 2009. Could reward with even longer cellaring, but '04 was not a great vintage.",93,Vine Cliff 2004 Pickett Road Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Still young and nervous, this opens with aromas of resin, pressed rose petal, dark berry and a whiff of coffee. The tightly packed palate offers a ripe black cherry core backed up by notes of sage and anise. It's still tense, with youthfully assertive tannins that need to loosen up. Drink 2018–2025.",90,Livio Voghera 2012  Barbaresco
"This blend of 57% Marsanne, 40% Roussanne and 3% Grenache Blanc manages to be very light and crisp on the nose, with aromas of underripe nectarine and apricot as well as lemon peels and crushed white rocks. There is a defined grip to the sip, with lemon and nectarine flavors.",88,Kitá 2015 T'aya Camp 4 Vineyard White (Santa Ynez Valley)
"As always, a stylish and well-proportioned effort from winemaker Joy Anderson. Blackberry and smoke wrap into a mid-palate with good focus and grip. Despite its modest price, this wine can go one-on-one with a thick, juicy steak. Tannins are just rough enough to give it some welcome muscle.",89,Snoqualmie 2008 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a perfumed wine, with aromatic notes of raspberries, kirsch, flowers, smoked meat, orange peel and blue fruit, with the Viognier blended in (4%) showing itself. The raspberry and cranberry flavors are lush and focused, showing a dazzling sense of purity that carries through the finish. It only lengthens its stride on the second day open.",92,Eight Bells 2013 8 Clones Red Willow Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"Shaped like a butterfly (papillon), this vineyard is one of the best known in Savennières. It is very rich and ripe, from a warm vintage. With its apricot and pear flavors and opulent texture, it brings out the potential of Chenin Blanc. So age this wine for 5–6 years more. Screwcap.",93,Domaine des Baumard 2009 Clos du Papillon  (Savennières)
"This is textbook Pinot Grigio Delle Venezie—meaning that fruit is sourced from anywhere within the region—with characteristic aromas of Golden Delicious apple, pear, natural rubber, yellow fruit, honey and a playful touch of citrus zest. Broad dimension and a spicy finish call for a dish like sweet and sour pork.",86,Tommasi 2006 Le Rosse Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie)
"Tart red currant and red apple mingle with tangy citrus on nose and palate. Very frothy lively mousse fizzes across the palate, making it refreshing and appetizing. The citrus and tart red-fruit notes appear again on the clean dry finish, making it moreish and long.",89,Cave de Turckheim NV Mayerling Brut Rosé Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"Heavy wood masks the fruit in this wine, leaving a dense and dry toasty character. Only underneath are there signs of fresher acidity and black-currant fruits. Wait until 2019. Denis Dubourdieu and Christophe Ollivier consult with manager Philippe Lacoste for the Beraud-Sudreau family.",86,Château Ferran 2013  Pessac-Léognan
"Marked by oak and thick, dark blue fruit, this wine also conveys a buoyant softness and prettiness. The study in yin and yang characteristics starts with a bang and develops complexity in the glass.",90,Tuck Beckstoffer 2010 Semper Silver Eagle Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Raspberry and blackberry jam aromas are accented by white pepper and mint. The flavors are plump and fleshy in feel, providing plenty of easy-drinking enjoyment.",86,Two Vines 2012 Shiraz (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A short stay (just eight months) in wood has produced a fine, rich and ripe wine. With its toast and butter flavors, touch of honey and opulent character, the wine is rounded and complex. Acidity plays just the right part to make the wine complete. Drink from 2018.",91,Herdade Grande 2015 Reserva Branco White (Alentejano)
"A playful hint of porcino mushroom and earth peeks though aromas of spice, bramble and green spinach leaf. This is a distinctive wine (in gorgeous packaging) that represents a traditional style of Aglianico del Vulture. It tastes raw, gritty and firm in the mouth.",88,Terre degli Svevi 2003 Re Manfredi Serpara  (Aglianico del Vulture)
"A delicious expression of Sagrantino, this delivers soft tones of chocolate, exotic spice and toasted nut, lavished over a core of bright cherry and blackberry. The wine shows density and power with characteristic tannic firmness on the close.",92,Arnaldo Caprai 2006 Collepiano  (Sagrantino di Montefalco)
"Rich and heavy, like a chocolate pastry dessert with blueberry, raspberry and cherry fruit. You could even describe it as decadent, but it lacks elegance and lively complexity. Drink now, after a good decant.",88,Patz & Hall 2009 Chenoweth Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Lemony freshness prevails on the nose of this wine. The palate is light bodied with lots of easy spritz and clean freshness. Drink now, while the aromas are at their peak.",89,Artner 2016 Klassik Grüner Veltliner (Carnuntum)
"All varietal, the aromas come off as a bit green, with notes of leafy fresh herbs, green tea, cedar and spice that haven't yet fully blossomed. The dark fruit flavors are generous while showing restraint and balance.",90,Seven Hills 2013 Seven Hills Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Prunotto's straight Barolo shows juicy, ripe cherry, white pepper and balsamic sensations, and just a hint of espresso. It's nicely balanced, although there's not a ton of complexity. Enjoy it now and over the next few years.",90,Prunotto 2009  Barolo
"This blend of Aglianico and Montelpulciano opens with slightly funky aromas that include nail polish remover, stewed prune and oak. The palate offers toasted oak, vanilla, sweetened coffee and sugar plum alongside astringent wood tannins.",87,Tommasone 2009 Pignanera Red (Epomeo)

"Dusty apple and citrus aromas come with a slightly oily note of almond. Round and chunky on the palate, this Merseguera-Sauvignon Blanc blend is a touch soft. Leesy, wheaty white-fruit flavors are reticent on a simple finish.",85,Pluvium 2015 Premium Selection Merseguera-Sauvignon Blanc (Valencia)
"Big, rich while also smooth, this is going to be a impressive wine. It has power and firm tannins as well as plenty of ripe black fruits and acidity. This wine, from one of the range of grand crus in Vosne-Romanée, will age well. Drink from 2026.",95,Henri de Villamont 2015  Grands-Echezeaux
"White peach and papaya aromas are sweet and tropical, while saline notes play second fiddle. Feels tangy, juicy and lean, with dilute lemon and green banana flavors. Wet and watery on the finish.",84,Salentein 2011 Portillo Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Uco Valley)
"Aged in wood from Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, this rich wine has sweetness, just enough tannins and wood to give structure, and a deep red cherry fruitiness.",88,Domaine de Gry-Sablon 2006 Cuvée Tradition  (Juliénas)

Drink this wine on its own or with slices of sweet ham from Italy or Spain.",88,Lantieri de Paratico NV Extra Brut Sparkling (Franciacorta)
"This 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Merlot is one of the best red wines produced in Umbria.

It has a chewy, plush feel in the mouth with bright freshness on the close.",93,Lamborghini 2005 Campoleone Red (Umbria)

"This is a ripe, tropical take on Alvarinho. The effects of partial malolactic fermentation in wood are there in the round, creamy character of the wine and the lights touch of oak. It is all ready to drink although it will be even better from late 2016.",91,Quinta da Soalheiro 2014 Terramatter Alvarinho (Minho)
"An equal blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this is a crisper than other Champagnes in the Coutelas range. It is also still young with its bright green and citrus fruits and tense texture. Lively and fresh, it should be aged and not drunk before 2017.",91,A. D. Coutelas 2006 Vintage Brut  (Champagne)
"Plump and somewhat jammy flavors of vanilla and baked cherry meet with soft clove dust on the nose of this bottling by the Foley family.

Drink this fruity, tightly woven wine from 2016.",88,Domaine de la Foliette 2013 Clos de la Fontaine Vieilles Vignes Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"Hazelnut and lemon can be sensed briefly on the nose.

The acidity and the crisp texture give the wine both its intensity and its potential. Drink from 2025.",93,Château Bellevue 2014  Saint-Émilion
"Deep purple fruit aromas of dried blackberries and pressed plums benefit from a fresh dill edge as well as a umami element on the nose of this wine from the Rice family, which started making wine in 1990. The acidity and alcohol combine for a tongue-tantalizing sip, with flavors of black cherries and dark herbs.",89,Sunstone 2012 Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Incò is a blend of Friulano (80%) and Pinot Bianco that opens with a solid, but neutral, bouquet and a creamy feel in the mouth. Pair this structured white with spicy chicken Tandoori.",86,La Viarte 2010 Incò White (Delle Venezie)
"Lovely scents of orchard fruit, citrus, almond blossom and a whiff of light baking spice emerge on this radiant wine. The lively, balanced palate delivers yellow apple, bitter almond, ginger and a note of tangerine zest. A salty note closes the finish.",91,Raccaro 2014 Friulano (Collio)
"A little too sweet and syrupy, with canned peach and apricot flavors that finish soft and simple.",81,Kenwood 2006 White Table Wine White (California)
"Concentrated and earthy up front, with aromas of blackberry, boysenberry, graham cracker, leather and a whack of robust oak just for good measure. Feels big and chewy, with broad, oaky flavors of black fruit, herb, tea and exotic spice. Finishes heavy but gentle in feel. Drink now through 2014.",90,Koyle 2010 Reserva Syrah (Colchagua Valley)
"There's a chalky baking soda touch to the nose of this bottling, with touches of key lime, ripe tangerine and orange blossom. The palate is tangy and grippy in chalky texture, with citrus peel flavors. Very fresh and almost entirely dry.",89,Jekel 2015 Riesling (Monterey)
"Aromas of hawthorn and a spring orchard in bloom lead the nose while the bright, straightforward palate offers green apple, bitter almond and a mineral note. Crisp acidity gives it a clean finish.",86,Cantina Valle Isarco 2014 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige)
"Wisps of smoke and earth lend a dark, mysterious tone to flavors of fresh apple, melon and pineapple on this delicate off-dry Riesling. Lemon-lime acidity pierces the palate, driving a long, honey-kissed finish.",87,Fox Run 2012 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"87-89 Smooth, poiished new wood along with sweet, soft tannins. A velvet textured, smoky wine.",88,Château la Tour de By 2010 Barrel sample  (Médoc)
"Produced from vines on the plain of Saint-Émilion near the Dordogne river, this is a Merlot-dominated wine. It has big tannins, bold ripe fruit and a dark core of dryness. As with so many wines in this vintage, the fruitiness makes it work so well, ripe and bold black fruits that are finished off with acidity. Drink from 2018.",88,Château Haut-Pezat 2012  Saint-Émilion
"Good blackberry, black currant, cocoa and cedar flavors in this Cab, and it's nicely dry, with firm, finely ground tannins. Turns rather sharp on the finish, and that tartness may never go away.",85,Beaver Creek 2007 Horne Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Lake County)
This is a good bargain for a varietal that's very difficult to make inexpensively. Whiffs of wood smoke meet ripe concentrated black-cherry flavors in this full-bodied smooth-textured wine. It has moderate fine-grained tannins for grip and a lingering spice and smoke finish.,87,Belle Ambiance 2015 Pinot Noir (California)
"From a cool, inland section of Mendocino County, this Viognier opens with gorgeous aromatics—heavenly honeysuckle and grapefruit—and offers up crisp, dry, borderline bracing acidity that pulls back just at the right moment. Nicely textured, the finish lingers.",91,Claudia Springs 2010 Lolonis Vineyard Viognier (Redwood Valley)
"This intense wine opens with classic Nebbiolo aromas of black fruit, underbrush and a whiff of balsamic herbs. The vibrant palate doles out succulent black cherry and red berry accented with white pepper, leather, licorice, sage and thyme. It's well balanced but still young, displaying assertive tannins and nervous acidity. Drink after 2020.",92,Cantina Massara Burlotto 2010  Barolo
"Smells sulfury on opening, and these fumes blow off only with difficulty. Afterward, the wine reveals black cherry aromas veering into chocolate, and drinks rich. There's a blast of fabulously ripe wild berry fruit, and it's dry. But loses points for the opening odor. Tasted twice, with consistent results. —S.H.",86,Sebastiani 1999 Domenici Vineyards Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley)
"Cherry, blackberry and baking-spice aromas are classic for this winery and the Rioja region. Bright, elegant and just plush enough on the palate, this tastes of plum, spiced berry fruits and mocha. A composed, dry, loamy feeling finish isn't pushy or demanding. Drink this easygoer through 2021.",91,Marqués de Murrieta 2011 Finca Ygay Reserva  (Rioja)
"Ripe, jammy fruit aromas and flavors of black berry, cherry and plum abound in this attractive wine, with a secondary hint of fudgy brownie adding additional decadence. The palate is smooth and medium bodied, with approachable tannins and ample acidity providing just enough structure. Drink now.",89,Gérard Bertrand 2013 Syrah-Carignan (Minervois)
"Undoubtedly the greatest Chardonnay the winery has ever produced, this is as rich as any Chardonnay on the market. Notes of tropical fruit, green apple and crème brûlée mesh with vibrant minerality that's steely, chalky and tangy. Although it tastes of honey, the finish is completely dry. This might even develop earthy, nutty complexities as it ages.",96,Joseph Phelps 2010 Pastorale Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"This has some light deposits at the bottom of the bottle, with a slightly cloudy appearance. Aromas of stone fruit, melon and citrus create a broad and thick aromatic front.",86,Ca' dei Zago 2010 Col Fondo  (Prosecco)
"Swirls of penetrating peach and honey flavors pack a mighty punch in this dazzling, sunny sip. Off dry in style, it's an easy going yet elegant wine accented by saffron, blossoms and reverberating tangerine acidity. Drink now through 2017.",90,Dr. Hermann 2014 H Riesling (Mosel)
"Composed and not the least bit pushy or punishing on the bouquet, this has gorgeous berry and spice aromas. It feels a bit racy and high in acidity, but that will only serve the wine well in the long run. Plum and boysenberry flavors lead to a racy, high-acid finish. Drink now–2020.",91,Bodegas Gutiérrez de la Vega 2007 Casta Diva Recóndita Armonía Sweet Monastrell (Alicante)
"Wet stone and lime blossoms kick off the pretty nose on this bottling, bolstered by nectarine, white peach and a mango tropicality. There are lemon and sea-salt touches once sipped, with baked-apple fruit on a tightly wound palate.",91,Mercy 2014 Zabala Vineyard Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco)
"A good, everyday Zinfandel, robust in blackberry, raisin and chocolate flavors, wrapped into firm tannins. With its sweet finish, it will be a good companion to tomato-based barbecue.",85,Quackenbush 2009 Estate Zinfandel (Lake County)
"Brown sugar and dark treacle flavors dominate this rich, sweet wine. With its opulent texture, this is for sipping. Screwcap.",86,Johanneshof Reinisch 2011 Auslese Rotgipfler (Thermenregion)
"This is a smooth, subdued style of Rioja that's perfect for tapas or casual consumption. The nose offers the right kind of entry: cherry and raspberry with dusty spice. And the flavors are friendly and suggest black fruits and smoke. A little more oaky and charred than some, but a nice crianza nonetheless.",88,Ramón Bilbao 2006 Crianza  (Rioja)
"Red apple aromas form the core with pear and yellow melon on the fringes of this stainless steel Chardonnay from Lompoc's Kenneth “Joey” Gummere. The tart green apple and pear skin acidity is expected, but it retains a full body—a prime example of a stainless Chard that's sleek but not overly austere.",90,Transcendence 2012 Zotovich Vineyard Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Blueberries, plums, and especially cherries, with a lovely, soft, beguiling bouquet of rose blossoms and chocolate. Crisply structured, with tight fruit, soft tannins, and a medium-weight, extended finish.",89,Seven Hills 1997 Seven Hills Vineyard Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Faint lemon freshness is all that emanates from the earthy nose and palate. This wine is fresh and clean, with notions of lemon and ripe, juicy pear that make an occasional appearance. Drink as soon as possible as a light apéritif.",87,Joseph Cattin 2015 Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
"Oak brings strong buttered toast and vanilla flavors to this Chardonnay. But it's also a powerhouse from the vineyard, with massive orange, pineapple and apricot flavors. May even have some botrytis, to judge from the honeyed sweetness. Yet for all the opulence, the finish is dry.",92,Mer Soleil 2009 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"This is a doughy, dusty wine, the tannins provocative in length and grip. Blackberry, chocolate and graphite swirl around a ripe center, the texture smooth and firm. On the finish is a steady back beat of oak.",88,Raymond 2013 District Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"A good, rich red wine, dry, soft and fruity. Shows ripe cherry, red licorice and bacon flavors, with a coating of sweet oak. Pretty and polished, a Merlot to drink now.",90,Bennett Lane 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Aromas of underbrush, tobacco, sunbaked earth and mature black-skinned fruit lead the nose on this fantastic, firmly structured red. On the concentrated palate, notes of licorice, graphite and clove add depth to the core of mature black cherry. Drink 2019–2024.",94,Giacomo Fenocchio 2012 Bussia  (Barolo)
"This bright, ruby-colored rosé opens with lively tones of cranberry, raspberry and white almond. It's soft and creamy with a touch of sweet berry or ripe cherry on the close.",86,Cantina Santadi 2009 Tre Torri  (Carignano del Sulcis)
"This weaves spicy melon and pear flavors into a soft, smooth, fleshy and fruity core. Forward and accessible, it's best served chilled.",87,Grandmaster 2011 Pinot Gris (Oregon)
"Sweet, soft and simple, with medicinal flavors of cherries and oak.",81,Hahn 2006 Merlot (Monterey)
"Named after its winemaker, Domingos Soares Franco, this is a powerful, concentrated wine. Still very young, it is full of blackberry fruits that need time to fully integrate into the dry tannins and layered wood notes. It's a dense wine with great potential. Drink from 2016.",90,José Maria da Fonseca 2011 Domingos Touriga Nacional & Syrah Red (Península de Setúbal)
This diluted wine opens with aromas suggesting old cut flowers and wet soil. The thin watery palate has just a hint of unripe sour cherry.,80,Tenimenti Montagnana 2014 Rubentino  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo)
"Beautifully rich for such a lowly appellation in the Burgundy hierarchy. It is soft, open, dense, with ripeness and balancing acidity as well as flavors of pineapple and citrus pointing up the richness, just touched by wood.",89,Domaine Leflaive 2006  Bourgogne
"Silky and evolved, this has touches of sour fruit and wild berry on the finish. It also offers layers of licorice, cola, cedar and crushed white pepper that peel back slowly.",90,Negro Angelo e Figli 2007 Basarin Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"Rich and ripe with cherry, pomegranate, persimmon and spice flavors, with a nice, silky texture and fine tannins. The acidity is sharp, the alcohol refreshingly moderate. Could benefit from some time in the cellar.",87,Ghostwriter 2011 Amaya Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"A hint of black, intense elderberry steals away almost as soon as it appears. Intriguing blueberry and plum remain on a slender, supple and lissom palate that is dense and toned. There is focus, concentration and purity, framed by stony notes, smoky oak and great freshness. This will take time to relax, so drink 2018–2025.",93,Jalits 2013 Szapary Reserve Blaufränkisch (Eisenberg)
"Harsh and dry, this Merlot has bitter cherry flavors with an edge of green unripeness. As a result the acidity is sharp.",81,Sebastiani 2005 Merlot (Sonoma County)
"Meaty, smoky flavors mark this dark and full-bodied wine, adding a layer of interest to the ripe blackberry and black-pepper notes underneath. The color is extremely dense and the tannic texture stops just short of extreme.",86,Rosenblum 2011 Heritage Clones Petite Sirah (Contra Costa County)
"Fromm has nailed the texture of this Pinot, hitting just the right silky note. The aromas show an earthy, humus-like edge to the berry fruit and the touches of vanilla and maple syrup are maybe a touch too obvious. Cola and earth flavors mark the midpalate, while ripe berries come throughon the lingering finish, suggesting that this may even improve with 3–4 years in the cellar.",89,Fromm Winery 2006 Clayvin Vineyard Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
"Petite Verdot is a difficult wine to make interesting in its own right, but Reverie has pulled it off. It's very much like a Diamond Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon, dry, tannic and filled with blackberry, cherry and cassis flavors. Not exactly clear why you'd want a Petite Verdot instead of a Cabernet, except for the interest value, but it's certainly an achievement.",92,Reverie 2008 Estate Petit Verdot (Diamond Mountain District)
"Strong, earthy and herbal, this dances in wild strawberry and dark cherry that's concentrated in texturally pleasing layers leading up to a potent, spicy finish.",93,Fog Crest 2012 Laguna West Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"For unknown reasons, Chuck Reininger holds back his Merlots; but Reininger makes real Merlot—96% pure—and it works. It's silky and smooth, chocolaty and showing pleasing nuances of herb and grass. The fruit is light, pretty and perfectly ripe, tasting of strawberry, cherry and pomegranate.",90,Reininger 2003 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Every kind of pepper, from green to red to jalapeño, is present on the nose, along with red plum and spice aromas. Feels tight and zesty, with Italian-leaning flavors of tomato, oregano and basil along with cassis and strawberry. Crisp and agile on the finish, but tastes green.",84,Graffigna 2008 Grand Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (San Juan)
"A spice driven wine, full of ripe flavors, wild flower honey and intense acidity. This is a beautiful wine, its richness totally balanced by a fresher side. Age this wine for a long time. Drink from 2018.",94,Angerhof Tschida 2010 Trockenbeerenaulese Sämling (Burgenland)
"A wine with some structure, firm tannins and attractive black cherry and spice flavors. The wine has good weight and a dense texture that promises medium-term aging.",88,Georges Duboeuf 2011 Domaine de Lafayette  (Brouilly)
"Made from native grape Monica, this offers a fruit and spice fragrance. The palate delivers ripe cherry and black pepper with subtle notes of well-integrated  oak. With its smooth texture, fine tannins and fresh acidity, it's a perfect red for grilled fish.",88,Argiolas 2011 Perdera  (Monica di Sardegna)
"Rounded strawberry, orange peel, tart black raspberry and a touch of juniper pop on the nose of this appellation blend by members of the pioneering Bargetto family. Black plum skins, crushed slate, raspberry juice and fresh-picked thyme show on the palate.",91,Soquel Vineyards 2013 Library Selection Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"A plump, charming white intended for early consumption, this blend of 60% Grenache Blanc and 40% Roussanne exhibits straightforward orchard and citrus fruit flavors. Cheery aromas of pineapple, white peach and almond lead the way in this bold, flavorful quaffer.",87,Château de Nages 2013 Buti Nages White (Costières de Nîmes)
"The grape candy and cherry kirsch aromas that emerge pick up more serious notes of freshly tanned leather and smoldering tobacco. The palate recalls charred meats in a sautéed cherry sauce, with a touch of pepper to keep it spicy.",89,Brecon Estate 2012 Cabernet Franc (Paso Robles)
"Here's a luscious and full Valpolicella that sees both barrique and oak casks for a full, round and modern feel. The wine imparts long lasting notes of cherry, ripe raspberry and spice.",86,Valentina Cubi 2006 Il Tabarro  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore)
"Château de Mercuès has had its own vineyard since the 13th century. This latest vintage is a powerful wine, pure tannic and rich Malbec, structured and with huge black fruits. The wine has weight, solid tannins and an excellent potential. Drink from 2017–2018.",92,Georges Vigouroux 2010 Château de Mercuès Malbec (Cahors)
"A big-hearted wine, displaying ripe red berries lifted by a lively acid undercurrent. It has gentle tannins and a full, juicy aftertaste. Drink now and enjoy with barbecue.",85,DFJ Vinhos 2013 Brigando Red (Lisboa)
"This is a bright, fruity wine, full of acidity and generous red fruit flavors with a soft texture. This will be ready to drink in a year.",85,Herdade da Comporta 2012 Chão das Rolas Red (Península de Setúbal)
"Aromatic overtones of tiny black elderberries give an edge to the smoky red fruit encountered here. A well-judged, sonorous tone of warm oak runs along the seams, lending structure and framing some floral, peppery notions and plump red cherry of this classy and still very refreshing and bright red. With a little time, its aromatics will develop even further... if you can wait.",93,Steindorfer 2012 Apleton Rouge Red (Burgenland)
"A wonderful wine that has preserved its freshness while welcoming elements of toasty maturity. It is crisp, definitely on the dry side, with red currants, bright wild strawberries over the purest acidity. It's sure to age over many years, but, if you must, can be drunk now.",95,Laurent-Perrier 1998 Grand Siècle Alexandra Brut Rosé  (Champagne)
"Smooth, satiny, seductive and deep, this exciting debut from a new winery shows first-class fruit sourcing and winemaking. The berry and cassis fruit flavors are ripe and polished, balanced with firm acids and hints of black olive and black tea in the tannins. Beautifully defined and balanced throughout, this is crafted for aging, but delicious already.",92,Southard 2007 Lawrence Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Rubbery cherry and plum aromas come with a side note of inner tube. This is a bit wiry and spiky on the palate, with an oaky cushion. Stewed berry, plum and tomato flavors are bold and finish with oak spice and mint flavors.",87,Bodega Classica 2009 Hacienda Lopez de Haro Reserva  (Rioja)
"A very pretty expression of Sean Thackrey's Cassiopeia's clonal experimentation, gorgeously floral and well rounded, with bright, concentrated, lush flavors of cherry with a light layering of spice. Well integrated, it's a standout among standouts.",95,Sean Thackrey 2010 Cassiopeia Wentzel Vineyard Clone 667 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Spicy and substantial, this authoritative Riesling snaps into tight focus around apple and melon flavors. Hints of clove and ginger add complexity.",90,Sawtooth 2011 Riesling
"The Powers family are partners in the justly famed Champoux vineyard, and this is their 15th vintage making this wine. For some it will seem a bit too ripe, for others just right. Port-like aromas introduce flavors of fig, prune and kirsch. The wine seems to be drying out a bit; this is one to drink, not to cellar.",89,Powers 2006 Champoux Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Summus (a blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet and Syrah) is a brawny, powerful wine with meaty extraction and layered aromas of plum, blackberry and cherry. These fruity notes are framed by elegant mineral tones.",92,Castello Banfi 2004 Summus Red (Sant'Antimo)
"This is a dry wine although the fruit does show potential. It is concentrated and firm, tannins foremost. Drink from 2019.",85,Maison Hebrard 2014 Premium  (Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux)
"Dark, chewy fruit flavors of black cherry come with a generous amount of espresso and dark, smoky toast. Highlights of anise and coffee grounds continue into a finish with slightly grainy tannins.",88,Columbia Crest 2012 Grand Estates Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Coming from the cool 2011 vintage, this vineyard-designated wine doesn't seem entirely ripe, displaying notes of herbs, cranberry and red fruit. It's screamingly tart with moderate fruit flavors and abundant oak accents that lead to a warm finish.",85,Maryhill 2011 Northridge Primitivo (Wahluke Slope)
"This is rather fresh in style for a 2009 from the Southern Rhône, with bold cherry and chocolate notes, reasonably crisp acids and softly dusty tannins. That said, it's a mouth-filling wine, but one that's harmonious and easy to drink.",89,J.V. Fleury 2009 Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape)
"Citrus and white blossom come first but there is a deeper, richer floral aspect of yarrow and daisy. The palate is light, dry and wonderfully fresh. Once you've started it's hard to stop with this quintessential summer sipper.",89,Strauss 2015 Classic Gelber Muskateller (Südsteiermark)
"Stefano Accordini's vineyard-designate Amarone opens with big oak and Spanish cedar tones that will undoubtedly come into focus with more aging time in the cellar. The wine shows excellent concentration and long flavors of spice, black fruit and tobacco. Pair it with sharp pecorino cheese.",94,Stefano Accordini 2004 Vigneto il Fornetto  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"A perennial best-of-show winner, this lush take on rosé bursts with pretty cherry fruit, light touches of brioche and fresh-baked rolls. It finishes with a kiss of spice.",90,Barnard Griffin 2012 Rosé of Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Wine doesn't get much more specific than this single block, single clone 100% Cabernet Franc from Weinbau Vineyard. Unfortunately the wood (100% new French) gets in the way of the herb, cherry, and floral aromas and flavors.",87,Revelry 2010 Weinbau Vineyard Block 13 Clone 2 Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope)
"Hot and rubbery on the nose, and while it doesn't smell bad it doesn't persuade you to go further. The palate has size, but it's not smooth as the acids dominate. And the flavors of berry and cherry are generic and almost impossible to identify as Syrah. Forgettable wine with tartness.",83,Lagarde 2008 Syrah (Mendoza)
"A juicy nose of red cherries and sweet-leaning cranberries is leveled by a strong sagebrush element. More chaparral scrub shows on the palate, along with black pepper and other dark spices, laid across ripe raspberry and dried cherry fruits.",91,Loring Wine Company 2013 Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County)
"The inviting notion of gently sun-ripened yellow plums on the nose draws you in. The palate follows this with gentle, juicy but balanced ripeness, featuring mirabelle plum and pear. There is a welcome grapefruit zestiness to the body and finish that makes this refreshing and moreish.",90,Türk 2015 Kremser Sandgrube Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"Bright and fruity, this wine has all the richness of whites in this vintage. It has yellow fruits, citrus and a warm, rounded texture. There is just a touch of herbal acidity at the end to keep it fresh.",86,Château de Cranne 2015  Bordeaux Blanc
"Quite light in the glass, this 50-50 blend from La Encanta and La Rinconada vineyards is done in a refreshingly crisp style, with lime pith and nectarine flesh aromas. It's fresh and vibrant on the palate, where tons of chalky grip frame a sizzling lime zest acidity and flavors of river stone and chalk. It's a laser-focused, very tense and nervy wine.",93,Jamie Slone Wines 2014 Aloysius Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"A murky appearance, earthy aromas and mineral-like flavors add up to an eccentric wine. The balance is soft rather than crisp and the body light. Since the winemaker leaves a good portion of lees in the bottle, it's best to stand it up for a few hours before pouring slowly.",82,La Clarine Farm 2014 Rosé (Sierra Foothills)
"Sold through the wine club. Excellent concentration in this ripe, full-bodied Riesling. It delivers a boat-load of fruit flavors, explosive aromatics and marvelous length. Citrus, peach and pear fruit is underscored with delicate minerality. Juicy, sappy and long.",92,Figgins 2012 Estate Riesling (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Right now, the wine is tart in acidity and tannic, although the ripe cherry and red currant flavors are obvious and delicious. The oak influence is strong. The wine doesn't seem to be a longterm ager, but it should benefit from cellaring until 2017.",87,Kessler-Haak 2011 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"There's a warm peach ripeness on the nose of this wine from a tiny appellation north of Santa Cruz near Bonny Doon, along with aromas of kumquat, vanilla bean and sea salt. The palate shows more peach, caramelized apples and saffron, cut with a lime-juice acidity and finishing with a dollop of vanilla-butter.",93,Beauregard 2013 Beaureagard Ranch Chardonnay (Ben Lomond Mountain)
"Toasty, oaky aromas of popcorn and modest fruits set up an elegant feeling palate with a mild but present bubble bead. Apple, nectarine and citrus flavors finish long and pure, with a dry, citrusy feel.",89,Raventós I Blanc 2011 L'Hereu Reserva Brut Sparkling (Spain)
"While crisp and bracing due to tart apricot and green apple flavors, this wine deepens on the palate as compelling white raspberry, white peach and subtle floral, spicy notes unfold. Markus Niggli added 5% North Carolina-grown Traminette, making it an interesting and seriously delicious bottle to enjoy over a seafood lunch or as an apéritif.",92,Markus Wine Co 2016 Insieme Torrontés (Lodi)
"Chunky, ripe black-fruit aromas come with violet accents. The mouthfeel is good but gritty, with hard tannins and a lot of oak that creates a buttery topping to plum, cassis and molasses flavors. This ripe wine finishes stable but quick, with some chocolate flavor but not much else.",87,Portia 2009 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"Ripe and oaky, this offers the sweet fruit and buttered toast flavors Chardonnay lovers crave. It tastes like a candy bar, with pineapple, mango, roasted almond and honeyed granola flavors, all brightened with crisp acidity.",87,Dierberg 2009 Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"The two grapes here are more commonly found in the Douro. Here in the south of Portugal, they give a softer character—less mineral more ripe apple and pear fruitiness. The aftertaste does keep the delicious wine bright and lively.",88,Herdade do Esporão 2016 Duas Castas Roupeiro-Viosinho White (Alentejano)
"There's more than a little residual sugar in this soft, sensual Zin, but the wine handles its sweetness well. It's terrifically ripe in blackberry, mulberry, boysenberry and other rustic berry flavors, with lots of spices and vanilla. Drink now.",87,Ledson 2004 Baldoochi Old Vine Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"A nice Chardonnay, clean and crisp, with modulated flavors of peaches, lemon meringue pie and buttered toast. Easy to drink this well-made wine.",87,Black Stallion 2010 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"The unoaked style is readily apparent on this bottling. Fresh and bright green aromas outdo the more savory ones, conveying Anjou pear, jasmine and light apple cider on the nose. Green apple and more pear show on the palate, with a pithy apple-skin flavor providing tang to the slight acidity.",86,Carmel Road 2014 Unoaked Chardonnay (Monterey)
"Simple and tasting of vanilla toffee, this Chardonnay, value-priced for sure, has a finish that's puckeringly sweet.",82,"Truett Hurst 2011 Eden Ridge, Barrel Select Chardonnay (Mendocino County)"
"There's a definitely alkalinity emerging from the Rhône whites on this vineyard west of Gilroy, this one showing chalk along with dried honey. Waxy apple-skin flavors dominate the palate.",84,Sarah's Vineyard 2011 Estate Marsanne (Santa Clara Valley)
"The wine reveals savory depth that is almost soy-sauce-like, along with hints of nutmeg, white pepper and some arugula. They harmonize with ripe green pear fruit in this typically spicy white that finishes with lip-smacking and clean zest.",93,Eder 2012 Süssenberg Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"A rich wine, with tropical fruit flavors. Initially it seems soft, but then smooth acidity jumps in, giving depth of flavor, with green plums, creamy apples and intense ripeness. A real food wine.",90,Winkler-Hermaden 2006 Kirchleiten Sauvignon Blanc (Südoststeiermark)
"Wonderfully pure apple freshness creates a totally fruity and appetizing nose. The palate is fruity and really fresh. This is full of life and primary aromas, backed by a lovely apple-peel texture. The finish is dry, whistle-clean and perfectly fresh. Drink soon.",89,Dopff & Irion 2015 Crustacés White (Alsace)
"Showing some of the richness and structure of Vosne-Romanée, this is a concentrated wine, spiked with wood aging while also full of dark plum fruits. It is still integrating, bringing the spice from the wood more into balance. Drink from 2015.",89,Domaines Devillard 2011 Domaine des Perdrix  (Vosne-Romanée)
"Densely packed rose, black cherries, sandalwood and a flash of pepper show in this bottling—a new project featuring a risqué label by Peachy Canyon. Pepper, smoke and roasted pork are evident on the dry palate, alongside a hint of lilac.",91,Ms. Behave 2014 Petit Verdot (Paso Robles)
"Nicely textured strawberry fruit is featured here. It drinks almost like an especially rich rosé, fresh and simple, in a good way. There's a dash of bitter green in the finishing tannins.",88,Willful 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This attractively perfumed wine holds ripe red fruits and a juicy texture. The structure is still developing, with firm tannins that need to soften. However the freshness of the wine promises a good future. Drink from 2018.",87,Tollot Beaut et Fils 2014  Chorey-lès-Beaune
"Fresh, easy and bright, this opens with layers of citrus, stone fruit, green melon and pear. The mouthfeel is sharp and informal with a touch of zesty acidity.",87,Pieve Vecchia 2010 Campo del Noce Vermentino (Montecucco)
"Flush, jammy, spicy, peppery aromas are good and fruity. This is full and tight on the palate, with hard tannins. Flavors of plum, berry, vanilla and wood resin finish with a pinched, rubbery feel. This needs food in order to soften the texture.",89,Pagos Familia Langa 2011 Real de Aragón Centenaria Garnacha (Calatayud)
"Lovely aromatics introduce this single vineyard Syrah with a snootfull of raspberry, pomegranate, cherry and rock. There's an elusive whiff of diesel also, lifting the palate of this very young, very compact wine. This could easily go 8–10 years in the cellar.",93,Burnt Bridge 2011 Les Collines Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Juicy and polished, this opens with aromas that recall ripe plum, dark berry, mocha, Asian spice and a hint of menthol. The full-bodied palate doles out ripe black cherry, chopped mint, anise and a hint of tobacco alongside velvety tannins that lend finesse and structure. Drink through 2021.",92,Marchesi Antinori 2011 Badia a Passignano Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico)
"Here's a simple, luminous sparkling Prosecco with firm, steady perlage and bright aromas of field flower, stone fruit, honeycomb and crushed white stone. The mouthfeel is dominated by fleshy, peachy sweetness.",86,Pitars NV Extra Dry  (Prosecco)
"Initial brambly berry aromas are partnered with hints of smoky bacon and caramel sauce. The flavors are solid and ripe but not overdone, with attractive notes of blackberry and wild cherry. The medium tannins and ample acidity lend good balance and texture to the wine, while a pleasant astringency lingers on the finish.",88,Fairview 2010 Primo Pinotage (Paarl)
"A fabulous, relatively affordable way to break into this cult winery, this blend of 30% Syrah, 26% Carignane, 22% Grenache, 19% Mourvèdre and 3% Cabernet Sauvignon offers teriyaki, char, fresh fennel, scarlet-red roses, anise, pencil lead and black raspberry on the nose. The sip is lively and action-packed with energetic peppercorn and lavender as well as richer tar, soy, blueberry and blackberry elements.",91,Big Basin 2013 Homestead Red (California)
"A light-colored, lemon-zesty, cool-vintage Chardonnay that's fruit forward but has great balance and finish, light on the tongue and easygoing all around. With stone fruit and a hint of vanilla, this affordable white should also be fairly easy to find (almost 4,000 cases made) and a successful pairing with a range of lighter salads and seafood dishes.",89,Guenoc 2009 Chardonnay (Lake County)
"From another of the grower's impressive, coveted sites, this wine imparts soft, dusty cherry, cassis and pomegranate notes, with a luxurious tease of vanilla and coconut macaroon. Full-bodied and robustly built, it's 100% varietal and barrel-fermented and finishes on a compelling streak of cedar, herb and graphite.",98,Alpha Omega 2012 Beckstoffer Missouri Hopper Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"This is made from partially dried fruit (the grapes undergo the appassimento process for 30 days) for extra intensity and extraction. In fact, the bouquet is dark and brooding, with black cherry, licorice, spice and clove-like aromas.",88,Novaia 2009 I Cantoni  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore)
"The nose on this red is soft and full of rounded spice and red berry fruit. Rich, balanced flavors of plum, black fruit and pepper are poised and backed by a good acidity. A classy Shiraz that will pair well with meat dishes and aged cheeses.",90,Robertson Winery 2006 Wolfkloof Limited Release Shiraz (Robertson)
"Nice acidity and clean varietal flavors of citrus and tropical fruit, apricot and peach mark this slightly oaky wine. There's a white sugar note throughout, however, that turns cloying after a sip or two.",84,Grey Stack 2012 Dry Stack Vineyard Rosemary's Block Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County)
"Bacchus and Boushey vineyards provide the majority of the fruit for this wine, which includes a generous amount of Cabernet (8%). Aromas of vanilla, spice and red and blackberries lead to rich, full, palate-coating dark fruit flavors. Smoke and savory notes persist on the finish. It's the density of flavors that most impresses.",92,Sequel 2013 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Brilliant, fresh wine, very bright and crisp with an attractive touch of toast to go with the fragrant berry fruits. Elegant and light, it is a fine, refreshing Crémant.",87,Cave de Ribeauvillé NV Giersberger Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"A delicious Grenache sourced from Mendocino's Eaglepoint Vineyards, a high-elevation, cool-climate site with a peppery opening note that extends itself through dense chewy tannins and the bright fruitiness and inviting aromatics we all love about Grenache. A very nice bottle of wine with great backbone and depth that should age another 5–10 years.",90,Stonehedge 2007 Terroir Select Grenache (Mendocino County)
"Rounded and soft, this is an attractive, warm wine. Pears and green plums pair with the acidity. A final burst of citrus marks the finish. Ready to drink as a friendly apéritif.",87,Domaines Schlumberger 2010 Les Princes Abbés Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
"Here's a polished, sophisticated Cabernet for drinking now. It's dry and full-bodied and tannic, with rich blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors that finish long and spicy.",89,Work 2008 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Fruit is harvested from the celebrated Rabajá cru, a short distance away from the town center of Barbaresco, and presented in a tight, more traditional expression. There's a nervous or sharp quality to the wine that is backed by immediate aromas of chopped herbs, soya sauce and spice.",88,Giuseppe Cortese 2005 Rabajá  (Barbaresco)
"This wine is soft, full in the mouth while not having much focus.",83,Château de Sours 2014 La Source  (Bordeaux Supérieur)
"Touches of spice highlight ripe yellow-plum and pear notes on the nose of this delicately framed Chardonnay. The palate is surprisingly mineral in character, with shades of wet stone against a backbone of tart peach. Finishes moderately long.",87,Standing Stone 2013 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"Exotic hints of passion fruit play among fresh flavors of citrus as well as riper, juicier stone fruit for a balanced, easy wine. The finish is off dry, but totally moreish. Enjoy soon while the fruit notes are in their prime.",89,Domaines Schlumberger 2014 Les Princes Abbés Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Smooth and subtle, this luscious wine emphasizes a rich mouthfeel over modest fruit and spicy components. Mild and complex vanilla, coconut and pear-tart flavors are there, coming out with time as the gorgeous texture coats the palate and extends the finish for a long time.",90,Mia Bea 2015 Barra Family Vineyards Chardonnay (Mendocino)
"This concentrated and lush wine opens with notes of black cherry and berry, with supporting accents of baking spice, toast and cigar tobacco. It's velvety and filling, but with good grip and a solid structure to keep the palate focused and centered. An herbal accent lingers through the finish; drink now-2018.",92,Agly Brothers 2008 Red (Côtes du Roussillon)
"The wine is round, soft and ripe with attractive lightweight tannins. Plum fruit flavors are right up front. It's rich while remaining easy and drinkable now.",86,Henry Fessy 2012  Brouilly
"Aromas of yellow apple and pear lead to dry, well-balanced fruit flavors. It pulls up a bit on the finish but still provides easy-drinking appeal.",87,Charles Smith 2015 Eve Chardonnay (Washington)
"There's a subtlety to the bouquet of this wine, showing dainty scents of yellow apple, just-dried hay and orange peel. The palate offers more intensity and verve, with notes of citrus pith, melon rind and saline that linger softly on the refreshing finish. Enjoy now.",86,Domaine Delsol 2015  Picpoul de Pinet
"Aromas of black berries, dark spices and tobacco take the lead in this blend of 55% Merlot, 35% Syrah and 10% Sangiovese. The dense palate delivers juicy but restrained black cherry accented with notes of black pepper, licorice and mocha alongside firm, dusty tannins. A warm note of alcohol on the close makes the wine seem even more structured than it is.",90,Ca' Marcanda 2011 Promis Red (Toscana)
"Oliverhill seems to have hit the mark in 2008 with their Jimmy Section Shiraz, a seamless blend of blueberries and cream dressed up with savory notes of dark earth and dark coffee. Full-bodied and creamy textured, this densely concentrated wine should be at its best now-2020.",91,Oliverhill 2008 Jimmy Section Shiraz (McLaren Vale)
"Shows some vegetal unripeness throughout, along with cherry and currant flavors enhanced with the usual smoky oak. A disappointment.",84,Clos Pegase 2005 Merlot (Napa Valley)
This powerful and rich wine wants to be sweet but is bone dry. Hints of honey accompany opulent ripe peach and spiced pear flavors. The balance of the acidity is crisp and refreshing. Drink from 2017.,92,Domaine Cauhapé 2013 Sève d'Automne  (Jurançon Sec)
"Made with 65% Chardonnay, 15% Sauvignon, 10% Pinot Grigio and 10% Pinot Bianco, this elegant white offers aromas of white flower, tropical fruit, mint and whiffs of toasted oak. The structured palate delivers Golden Delicious apple, vanilla, oak and lemon zest. A mineral note closes the lingering finish.",90,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano 2012 Appius White (Alto Adige)
"Aromas of mature berry, allspice, underbrush and sage lead the nose. The easy-drinking palate delivers black cherry, raspberry and freshly ground black pepper alongside firm, fine-grained tannins.",87,Botromagno 2013 Uva di Troia (Puglia)
"Alluring scents of fragrant blue flower, rose, chopped mint, sunbaked earth and red berry mingle in the glass. The aromas carry over to the medium-bodied palate, along with mature black cherry and a hint of brown spice. Close-grained tannins leave a firm finish.",89,Vecchie Terre di Montefili 2011 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"Subtle scents of white spring blossom, white stone fruit, aromatic herb and a whiff of beeswax float out of the glass. The round, concentrated palate offers a wonderful depth of flavors that include juicy Anjou pear, lemon pastry, anise, honey and a hint of marzipan. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors. Hold for more complexity.",94,Bucci 2012 Villa Bucci Riserva  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore)
"Ripe, jammy and forward, Prima could become the blueprint for affordable but well-made Toro wines. It's a modern bruiser from a modern, spotless facility, and it offers a clash of wild berry flavors, big-time tannins and powerful acidity. Like most Toro wines, it'll take your cheeks to the cleaners if you don't have meaty foods, cheese or lots of water to go with it. Drink now through 2012.",90,Maurodos 2005 Prima  (Toro)
"Pretty aromas recall Golden Delicious apples and white peach. The bright palate delivers apricot, pear and lemon zest accented with a ginger note, while crisp acidity leaves the mouth feeling clean and refreshed.",87,Scambia 2012 Freschetto  (Orvieto)
"Here's a textbook Greco di Tufo that opens with delicate but alluring scents of ripe orchard fruit, orange blossom and a whiff of toasted almond. The crisp yet creamy palate doles out ripe pear, peach and citrus while bright acidity lifts the finish. It closes on a mineral note.",90,Torricino 2015  Greco di Tufo
"A Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon blend with crisp acidity, a smooth, clean finish and citrus and fig flavors.",84,Beringer 2001 Alluvium Blanc Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Knights Valley)
"This is a blend of premier and grand cru Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. Vintages from the difficult 2010 harvest are rare, so this wine with its soft texture and smooth fruit is an exception. Already mature, it offers hints of almonds as well as ripe fruits. Ready to drink, it's rich in the middle and crisp at the end.",86,Jacquart 2010 Cuvée Alpha Brut  (Champagne)
"This balanced wine is full of dusty, dry tannins as well as ripe red fruits. A smokiness gives a dense, toasty character to the wine. With good acidity, typical of the vintage, the wine is well placed to develop. Drink from 2020.",92,Domaine Jean Fournier 2014 Les Longeroies  (Marsannay)
"A blend of organically cultivated Groppello, Marzemino, Barbera and Sangiovese, this fun rosato offers aromas of red berry and an earthy note. Mirroring the fruity nose, the tangy palate offers Marasca cherry, crushed strawberry and raspberry. It closes crisp and clean.",87,Pratello 2016 San'Emiliano Chiaretto Rosato (Valtènesi)
"Light black raspberry and purple-flower aromas show on the somewhat shy nose of this bottling from the Jackson Family's longtime Santa Maria Valley winery. Well-woven flavors of black raspberry, dark cranberry, thyme and bay leaf appear on the sip, which is light and easy albeit not very complex.",87,Cambria 2014 Benchbreak Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"88-90 Great acidity runs through what is also a richly concentrated wine. It has weight, density, always with this bright acidity.",89,Château Picque Caillou 2010 Barrel sample  (Pessac-Léognan)
"This bold, earthy Malbec delivers aromas of cured meat and stewed notes, with some medicinal and floral smells. It's concentrated and chewy but not syrupy, with roasted plum and berry flavors running side by side with savory spice, pepper and brown sugar. A toasty finish has mild heat to it.",90,Yacochuya 2011 Apreciado Malbec (Cafayate)
"A dry wine with firm tannins over the juicy red-cherry fruits. It is structured, while likely to develop well over the next few years. The wood and fruit are both attractive at this stage.",89,L. Tramier & Fils 2007 Collection Premier Cru  (Beaune)
"This is a blend of the best barrels from the five Mercurey Premier Crus owned by the Devillard family. First produced in the 2010 vintage, the wine is now made in most vintages. It is a rich wine, bringing out the pure red fruitiness of a Mercurey and its beautifully integrated structure. It is concentrated and very dense, packed with vanilla, mint and dark coffee flavors as well as the fruit. Age this wine, at least until 2020.",94,Domaines Devillard 2014 Château de Chamirey Les Cinq  (Mercurey)
"This Sangiovese-Canaiolo blend has loads of sweet spice on the nose. There's so much spice, in fact, it's not easy to locate its natural core of red fruit. The mouthfeel is great with lingering tones of white mineral and toasted wood.",87,Il Colombaio di Santachiara 2005 Il Priore Red (Toscana)
"Raspberries, cherries, cola, tea, rhubarb pie, licorice, vanilla and sweet leather flavors flood the mouth, wrapped in a delicately silky, complex texture, and the finish goes on and on in oak-inspired fruit and Asian spices. Compellingly delicious; drinks now and through 2009.",93,W.H. Smith 2006 Marimar Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This unique blend of Aglianico, Tintore and Piedirosso, three native grapes of Southern Italy, offers deep layers of spice, resin, tar and tobacco. The wine has a fresh, fruity feel and a rustic personality overall.",87,Tenuta San Francesco 2006 Tramonti Red (Costa d'Amalfi)
"Aged in French oak for more than a year (20% new), this is a full-bodied and layered wine. Strong aromas of French butter and baguette dominate the nose. The midpalate offers more brightness, revealing high-toned accents of apple blossom, lemon and mango wrapped in tart acidity before returning to the richness of crème brûlée on the close.",90,WindRacer 2014 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Tropical aromas are friendly but basic. A melony feeling palate is low on acidity, thus flavors of honeydew and mango seem mushy. A soft, mealy finish with a papaya-like flavor is the last act. Year after year this unoaked Chardonnay barely gets by.",83,Castillo de Monjardin 2012 El Cerezo Unoaked Chardonnay (Navarra)
"Distinctive citrus and wild sage aromas and a dazzlingly crisp balance characterize this wine. Clean, bracing fruit flavors linger on the lively finish. Grown in a small organic vineyard, this brings authenticity at a very reasonable price.",90,McFadden 2013 Estate Grown Made With Organically Grown Grapes Pinot Gris (Potter Valley)
"Bright and refreshing acidity is the star of this lovely, windswept wine, powerful yet integrated in tannin and oak. The racy, feral notes of anise, apple blossom and nutmeg are complemented by a teasingly voluptuous spirit that never overwhelms.",94,Blue Farm 2014 Gap's Crown Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"A very distinctive Sauvignon Blanc with leesy notes of biscuit, spice and custard at the fore along with herbs and a spine of lemony acidity that runs from head to tail.",86,Vin du Lac 2010 LEHM Sauvignon Blanc (Lake Chelan)
"A field blend of Grenache Blanc, Marsanne, Roussanne and Viognier, this delightfully floral wine exudes spring flowers and fresh, just-ripe peach. The wine is dry, although the finish has a subtle suggestion of honey. A delicious wine for spring and summer sipping.",90,Midsummer Cellars 2013 GMRV Field Blend White (Yolo County)
"Tastes briary and brambly and peppery, almost like a Zinfandel, with flavors of black currants and cola and a hint of oak. This dry, well-structured and rustic wine will pair well with smoky tri-tip.",86,Harmony Cellars 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"It's no exaggeration to say that the 2014 releases from Shea are the best (as an entire group) in the winery's history. Could be maturing of the vines, along with a textbook perfect vintage, but whatever the reasons, these wines are not to be missed. Floral highlights, potent ripe cherry fruit, a dusting of cocoa powder and myriad layers come together in this irresistible, impeccably balanced block selection.",95,Shea 2014 Shea Vineyard Block 7 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Soft, sweet in jammy raspberry and cherry fruit and caramelized oak, this Syrah is somewhat simple. It's good, but would benefit from greater structure.",85,Baldassari Family Wines 2007 Nolan Vineyards Syrah (Bennett Valley)
"A soft, lightly floral wine, with an oily texture, the ripe pear and apricot fruits edged with citrus. A hint of walnuts goes with the final acidity.",86,Casca Wines 2009 Monte Cascas Colheita Branco White (Douro)
"Here's a grassy, green expression of Cabernet Franc from northern Italy with aromas of black fruit, caper and green olive. It shows a compact finish with medium body.",84,Bonotto delle Tezze 2008 Cabernet Franc (Veneto)
"Despite its alcohol and potential richness, this has as much green, herbal character as fruitiness. It's structured and juicy, and shows considerable acidity.",84,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal 2009 Má Partilha Merlot (Península de Setúbal)
"Similar in style and aging potential to the winery's 2009, and blended with amounts of Malbec and Petit Verdot, this Cabernet Sauvignon from mighty Howell Mountain is rich in spicy blackberry and clove, the tannins soft and juicy.",91,Prim Family 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain)
"Tech sheets hint at Stagecoach Vineyard being involved somehow in this Syrah, a chewy expression of coconut, smoke and game around a dense, concentrated body and well-integrated tannins. The finish is all about mocha.",87,Cameron Hughes 2011 Lot 423 Syrah (Napa Valley)
"Chunky and fruit forward, this opens with scents of roses and cherries, and cherry fruit is the most striking impression on the palate. There's a light suggestion of leather also, and sharp, finishing acidity.",86,Melrose 2012 Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley)
"A blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, this opens with drying mineral tones of granite and campfire, and it has austere, dusty tannins. The fruit is bold, pulled together by notes of cherry, cassis, leather and spice.",91,Caccia al Piano 1868 2010 Ruit Hora  (Bolgheri)
"Made by the Château Giscours winemaking team, this wine benefits from their expertise. Skill shows in the velvet textures, the ripe berry fruits and the hidden strength of the tannins and wood flavors. It's going to be a serious, elegant wine. Drink from 2018.",90,Château Duthil 2012  Haut-Médoc
"This is a juicy, full-bodied and robust red wine, 100% varietal, that presents likable characteristics of blackberry, plum and charred meat. The tannins play well with the fruit and oak, asking for a bit of time to relax in the glass. It shows the heat of the vintage and appellation with underlying grace.",91,Sleeping Giant 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
"This amber-colored wine has a perfumed nose of apricot marmalade and marzipan. It is bright on entry, followed by a sophisticated sense of chalkiness with intense flavors of peach, nectarine, brioche, guava and honeysuckle. Flashes of brightness on the finish dissipate the firm tannins on the palate.",90,Kindzmarauli Marani 2013 Kakhetian Royal White (Kakheti)
"Fresh strawberry flavors fizz lightly and easily on a fruit-driven, dry and light-bodied palate. This is a fruity haze of fizzy, pale-pink fun, ideal for parties and light-hearted gatherings.",87,Pierre Sparr NV Rosé Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"This full-bodied and complex wine has loads of personality. An exotic, slightly earthy aroma leads to fruity richness and good viscosity on the palate, with a creamy texture and wonderful sense of layering.",90,Criss Cross 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Clarksburg)
"Delicate hints of crushed mineral and white flower linger in this dry appley Riesling. Soft acidity lends a slightly broad, flat feel to the palate but the finish is clean and crisp.",86,Buttonwood Grove 2015 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Peachy overtones hover around the rose-petal scent of this fruity offering. This aromatic combo re-appears on the palate where it is rounded off with a little residual sweetness that suits the plush palate rather well. Here and there are wondrous glimpses of clear honey, dried peach and honeysuckle. Citrus freshness provides a lovely counterpoint and carries the long finish.",93,Domaine Ostertag 2014 Vignoble d'E Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
You'll find aromas of black locust flower and a whiff of beeswax on this. The beeswax note carries over to the straightforward palate together with pear and a hint of bitter nut alongside soft acidity.,86,Giacomo Vico 2015 Donna Anita  (Roero)
"The flavors of this medium-bodied wine are hearty, with bell pepper, black pepper and green olive notes, and in this vein it's tasty and fairly concentrated. The balance is good, the palate sensation is nicely dry and the finish lingers a bit.",87,Peltier 2013 Hybrid Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi)
"This is made from a majority of Sangiovese, with smaller amounts of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah. Juicy, it's soft in cinnamon, plum and dark cherry, with an oaky finish.",87,Ferrari-Carano 2014 Siena Red (Sonoma County)
"This world-class blend of 52% Cabernet Franc, 20% Malbec, 13% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Merlot and 6% Petit Verdot is concentrated, structured and powerful, with the promise of a long life ahead. Earthy, herbal streaks of cigar box, licorice root, char and minty fynbos frame the lush fruit core of muddled boysenberry, black raspberry, plum and currant. The palate is bold and assertively flavored, with good evolution from jammy black fruit to earthy spice and finally leather and toast on the finish. Drink 2018–2024.",94,Mvemve Raats 2011 MR de Compostella Red (Stellenbosch)
"Very pure lemon and toast flavors dominate this wine. It has crispness, intense freshness and lively acidity. There is also a sense of richness that is slowly developing and that will broaden the wine over the next several months.",91,Bouchard Père & Fils 2007 Gouttes d'Or Premier Cru  (Meursault)
"Hints of spice lend an exotic feel to aromas of freshly pressed apples on this Riesling. It's off dry in style with ripe, juicy white-grapefruit flavor accented with piercingly high acidity. Finishes briskly on a slightly bitter note.",85,Atwater 2011 Estate Vineyards Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Sweet and candied, with lemon, lime, pineapple, fig and vanilla flavors. Crisp coastal acidity helps provide a savory, cleansing quality.",84,Concannon 2007 Selected Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc (Central Coast)
Some flint hovers above the glass and leads to a simple but pepper-spicy body that is light and very crisp. Drink this simple wine soon.,85,Domaine Pfister 2014 Pinot Noir (Alsace)
"Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz are blended together in this rich yet structured and fruity wine. It has fresh acidity and a hint of the ocean in its crisp red-currant fruits. The structure is softening and filling out, so drink from 2016.",88,Herdade do Rocim 2011 Vale da Mata Reserva Red (Lisboa)
"This outstanding wine should earn the somewhat difficult grape many new fans. It opens up beautifully with ample aeration and is true to variety without giving the impression of cheap perfume, emphasizing spice over powdery scents and showing plenty of ripe fruit, from Asian pear, to pineapple to jicama.",91,Foris 2016 Dry Gewürztraminer (Rogue Valley)
"This firm, structured wine is lean and austere. Spice and toast notes dominate, leaving little room for fruit. It's a tough wine to like.",85,Château de Cranne 2015 Château Jeandebout  (Côtes de Bordeaux)
"Available at an attractively low price, this oak-aged Aglianico opens with dark, brooding tones of cassis, dark spice, resin, tar and black licorice. The mouthfeel is firm and tight, making this wine suitable for a fatty meat dish such as a juicy cheeseburger.",86,Ocone 2006  Aglianico del Taburno
"This wine comes from grapes grown in Green Valley's Mill Station, Sullivan, Walker Hill and Rued vineyards. High-toned to the last drop, it shows Gravenstein apple and Meyer lemon flourishes, with a subtle backbone of oak.",90,Dutton-Goldfield 2015 Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This medium-bodied wine has a surprisingly firm texture from crisp acidity and a relative abundance of tannin. It shows tasty, tart cherry and cranberry flavors, and an astringent finish. A little age should smooth it out by late 2015 and beyond.",87,Bonterra 2013 Pinot Noir (Mendocino County)
"Honeycomb, fig and herb aromas are followed by textured flavors that show intensity and persistence.",89,Amavi 2014 Semillon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This rounded, creamy wine is attractive, with rich apricots and balanced zesty acidity. It is ready to drink.",84,Domaine des Verchères 2016  Mâcon-Villages
"Wente remains remarkably adept at making very good wines in big volumes at fair prices. This is a textbook example—a crisp, layered and complex SB that's as floral as spring, generous in acidity and lemony on the finish. Pair with shellfish, chicken or goat cheese on crackers.",90,Wente 2011 Louis Mel Sauvignon Blanc (Livermore Valley)
Cherry and wild strawberry flavors dominate this fruity wine. It is very fresh with intense acidity and a crisp aftertaste. A few months more in bottle would help it soften.,85,Hubert Meyer NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Crémant d'Alsace)
"Tasty and toasty, young and compact, this is a wine to cellar for a few more years at least. The bright fruit flavors run from berry to Bing cherry, not as dark as in some years, but vibrant and crisp. The new oak is not yet fully integrated, so give it some extra bottle age for optimal enjoyment.",92,Dunham 2008 Lewis Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Candied red cherries mix with eucalyptus oil on the nose of this bottling that also offers an intriguingly feral aroma of pine needles smashed into wet earth. There is great depth on the sip, with stewed cranberries and strawberries, graphite minerality and then more eucalyptus, pine needles and sharp forest herbs.",92,Hensteeth 2012 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
"A darker shade of yellow, this wine shows poached apple, orange peel and slight roasted-nut aromas on the clean nose. The palate is medium bodied, touching on flavors of almond oil, preserved lemons, chamomile tea and coconut.",87,EOS 2013 Reserve Chardonnay (Santa Ynez Valley)
"An extremely lively mousse gives this wine an instant festive character. It also brightens the already fresh, crisp red berry fruits and acidity. It's totally ready to drink.",86,Pierre Sparr NV Brut Rosé Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"Dried hayflowers and dried orange peel send a lifted scent. The palate is richer and rounder than the nose suggests, full of ample apple and pear fruit, but guided and held by fresh, clean acidity. A certain earthiness shimmers with almost tropical hints of mango. The finish is dry, briskly clean but very lingering.",94,Domaine Marcel Deiss 2013 Engelgarten White (Alsace)
"Very rich and ripe, marked by pure, intense flavors of cherries, blueberries and spicy cloves. It displays the balanced elegance and thoughtful winemaking of this winery. Young and juicy now, it should develop in the bottle for a year or two, but some sharpness in the finish will ultimately limit ageability.",90,Dutton-Goldfield 2010 Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Tight, rooty, spicy aromas of cherry and cassis include notes of raw minerals and crushed rocks. This is a bit gritty and tannic, but it's not fierce or unyielding. Reedy, spicy plum, berry, coffee and cocoa flavors finish dry, with lasting notes of chocolate and baking spices. Drink through 2021.",92,Riglos 2013 Gran Cabernet Sauvignon (Tupungato)
"Notes of perfume, white peach and honeydew scent this vivacious off-dry Riesling. It's concentrated, with deep, penetrating flavors of lime and pink grapefruit that flood the palate and linger on the finish.",91,Bischöfliche Weingüter Trier 2013 Ayler Kupp Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"Bright aromas of wild cherry, iris, rose and a hint of balsamic herb come together on this. The full-bodied palate delivers tart red cherry, orange peel and a green note of sage accompanied by astringent tannins that grip the finish.",88,Réva 2012 Ravera  (Barolo)
"This wine has structure and concentration, but is less generous in terms of its aromas. There are evident notes of ripe cherry, leather, vanilla and some tobacco, but they never come into full bloom. The tannins are gritty and still a bit raw and the wine offers sour cherry flavors in the mouth.",86,Bindella 2005  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano
"Hot, raspingly dry and pretty tannic to boot, this Grenache, from a high mountain vineyard, also is a little funky and barnyardy. There are some concentrated cherry, currant, Tabasco and pepper-spice flavors, but those strong tannins really get in the way.",83,Core Winery 2005 Alta Mesa Vineyard Grenache (Santa Barbara County)
"A pale, almost water-like color in the glass, this is a light and nuanced rosé. Scents of white cherry, melon rind, orange peel and sweet grass unfold in the bouquet and carry through to the light-bodied palate. A tart red-currant flavor and citric vibrancy linger on the close. Drink now.",86,Gérard Bertrand 2015 Gris Blanc Rosé (Pays d'Oc)
"This single-vineyard wine is made from biodynamically grown grapes. It's rich while still stylish and fresh. Ripe apple fruit flavors are lifted by acidity and given a twist with spice, pepper and hints of tropical fruits. Drink from 2016.",91,Jean-Baptiste Adam 2013 Letzenberg Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Shy aromas suggesting ripe black-skinned fruit, espresso and a whiff of dark spice emerge in the glass. The medium-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, mocha and grilled sage alongside fresh acidity and taut tightly knit tannins. Drink after 2019.",89,Banfi 2012  Brunello di Montalcino
"This Maipo estate is now aligned with Chateau Ste. Michelle of Washington, which doesn't exactly impact this nice everyday Cabernet. Bramble and fresh berry aromas offer an entry, then there's chewy raspberry on the palate along with a grace of vanilla and some warmth. A bone-warming wine for fall and winter.",87,Haras de Pirque 2004 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"A handful of Willamette Valley wineries grow Syrah, pushing the grape to an earthy, herbal style, amplified here by the cool 2011 vintage. Tart berry, leaf and herb combine in a tight, tannic midpalate. There are interesting highlights of orange peel as well, and a lingering, subtle finish.",89,Amalie Robert 2011 Satisfaction Syrah (Willamette Valley)
"A full six years old, this wine is in a sweet spot, with aromas of fresh and dried blue and red fruit. It's rich in style with plump, luscious fruit flavors. It still has time but it's hard to imagine it could get much better. Drink now.",91,McCrea 2009 Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"More restrained—and therefore more versatile with food—than many other Marlborough Sauvignon Blancs, this wine combines hints of cut grass with citrus on the nose. Grapefruit and nectarine take over on the palate, while a hint of bitter greens emerges on the finish. Drink now.",89,Hunter's 2015 Jane Hunter Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"This wears its 16.5% alcohol well, like a heavy but graceful dancer. It's softly sweet in glycerine, with flavors of milk chocolate and blackberry jam, sprinkled with black pepper and anisette liqueur.",86,Bluenose 2008 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"This is a beautiful wine, full of ripe yellow fruits, steely acidity and a juicy character that comes from the apple and apricot fruit flavors. While there is a firm layer of toast from the wood aging, the wine is rich, tight and full of acidity. This structured wine needs many years, so drink from 2020.",95,Louis Latour 2013  Bâtard-Montrachet
"Aromas of ripe black fruits, graphite, dry herbs and licorice root are solid and encouraging. This Tempranillo blend from La Mancha feels choppy and tight, while screechy red-plum and cherry flavors finish a bit raw and hollow.",88,Finca La Estacada 2012 Reserva Varietales Red (Uclés)
"A whiff of peach or apricot gives this Vinho Verde a little extra interest beyond its green apple and citrus flavors. Crisp and refreshing, with a tart, chalky finish.",86,Quinta da Aveleda 2001 Trajadura (Vinho Verde)
"There is way too much acidity here, and it's exagerrated by the wine's soft, unfocused texture. Notes of bitter toast and dark tannins are rather unbalanced.",83,Château Ballan-Larquette 2011  Bordeaux
"This is rich and spicy, with the briary, brambly tastes of ripe blackberry and blueberry. It's high in alcohol, which gives it a slight burn. Enjoy it with robust Italian pasta and pizza dishes.",88,Ravenswood 2009 Old Hill Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley)
"Here is a lovely expression of Merlot from the up-and-coming Montescudaio zone, which is located on the Tuscan coast just north of Bolgheri. The wine shows immense softness, and it has a huge cherry flavor that has been shaped by spice and chocolate accents from 18 months in barrel.",91,Marchesi Ginori Lisci 2008 Castello Ginori Merlot (Montescudaio)
"One of the best inexpensive Pinot Noirs on the market, which is quite an achievement considering that most at this price are awful. The wine is dry and silky, with pleasant flavors of cola, cherries and spice.",85,Cycles Gladiator 2008 Pinot Noir (California)
"The tomato and plum aromas in this Garnacha blend are a bit soupy. Its chunky palate is heavy with generic berry fruit and a touch of oxidation. A solid, middle-of-the-road pour.",85,Clos de Nit 2015 Red (Montsant)
"Although this is a nonvintage wine, it is a blend around 2012, hence the number in the name. Dominated by Pinot Noir, this ripe, full-bodied wine has a tangy texture boosted by acidity that contrasts with rich red apple and crisp pear flavors that give richness. Drink now.",91,Lallier NV R.012 Brut  (Champagne)
"Aromas of tilled soil, leather, spiced berry and menthol lead the nose. The palate offers blackberry, Marasca cherry, cedar, mint and white pepper alongside fresh acidity and assertive but fine-grained tannins that leave a somewhat drying finish. Drink 2016–2020.",89,Tenuta del Nanfro 2012 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"An indifferent wine, hot and baked, with jammy sweet berry flavors.",82,Cameron Hughes 2009 Lot 250 Meritage (Napa County)
"Brickish in color, with mature aromas of cedar, pine, tobacco, olive and dried fruits. There's still some racy acidity that's keeping the rooty flavors of tobacco, dried berry, coffee and spice moving forward. Finishes dry and a little bit classic; drink now for an affordable taste of Navarra.",88,Castillo de Monjardin 2005 Crianza Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Navarra)
"This wine is produced from old-vine Pinot Noir planted on flint soil. The wood from the wine's aging does show, giving a spicy, smoky character that is still dominating the red-cherry fruits. This will balance out over the next few months to give a wine with concentration. The aftertaste brings out acidity. Drink from 2017.",89,Domaine Gérard Fiou 2014 Terroir Silex  (Sancerre)
"While the nose gives little away apart from a yeasty roundness, the palate shines with crisp, pure Conference pear fruit and a herbal tinge of watercress and arugula with the merest notes of salty soy. Slender, poised and very enjoyable.",92,Jurtschitsch 2015 Stein Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"There aren't many Rieslaner bottlings out there, so this may be one of the few chances people have of trying this interesting variety. It starts off smoky and herbal, developing strange leafy flavors that take some getting used to, although there's an undercurrent of lime-like fruit as well. Sweet without being too sweet; try with the cheese course.",89,Darting 2007 Durkheimer Nonnengarten Auslese Rieslaner (Pfalz)
"Delicious and complex. Shows a superb tannic structure, soft and complicated and refined, housing dry but rich flavors of black currants, cherries, chocolate, anise, cedar and pepper. Elegant and distinguished, and should develop through 2011, at least.",93,Peter Franus 2005 Red (Napa Valley)
"Pretty aromatics include balsam wood, blackberry and blueberry. The palate is lush but well structured, with bullish berry, chocolate and creamy oak flavors. Minty and super spicy and long on the finish, with a lasting dark toastiness.",90,Luca 2010 Laborde Double Select Syrah (Uco Valley)
"This is a light, bright, nearly clear bringing together of 51% Pinot Noir and 49% Chardonnay, just barely pink in color. It accentuates the beauty of both varieties, from Pinot's mix of cherry and watermelon to the Chardonnay's ability to bring out notions of crisp green apple.",90,Brick & Mortar 2015 Vin Clair Pinot-Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Tasting of white grapes, this is fruity, lightly spicy and fragrant. It's a rare grape in Alsace which is a shame because its delicate, attractive fruitiness makes it a great apéritif wine.",88,Domaine Moltès 2012 Réserve Muscat (Alsace)
"Burned tire rubber, oak, espresso and roasted coffee bean lead the nose on this extracted wine. The dense, monolithic palate offers sweet vanilla, toasted oak, chocolate, stewed prunes marinated in spirits, and overripe, sugary plum. It's already evolved and lacks energy.",86,I Sodi 2010 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"Tastes strong and distinctive, with well-etched white pepper, black raspberry, tobacco and herb flavors. This earthy wine feels silky smooth on the palate, with crisp acids, but is a little one-dimensional for the price.",85,Wedell Cellars 2000 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)
"Hints of cut grass and passion fruit on the nose are followed by attractive tropical fruit and fresh herbs on the palate. This medium-bodied wine boasts a soft, rounded feel that turns slightly chalky on the finish.",88,Forrest 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"In the explosion of unoaked Chards lately, the Central Coast has proved itself as the go-to region. Domaine Alfred's bottling is just super, a rich, zesty wine whose acidity makes your palate dance to the music of tangerines, limes, kiwis and pineapples.",87,Domaine Alfred 2007 Stainless Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"The second wine of Château le Prieuré, made from 100% pure juicy Merlot, is ripe and concentrated. It still has plenty of firm tannins although the rich fruits will balance out shortly. It is then going to be a generous wine with great final fruitiness. Drink from 2018.",88,Château le Prieuré 2014 Délice du Prieuré  (Saint-Émilion)
"Tobacco aromas are followed by a palate that is classic smoky, cool Cabernet Franc. With tannins, juicy acidity and light red berry flavors, it's a fruity wine with a bright aftertaste.",85,Cave de Saumur 2013 Les Pouches  (Saumur)
"Yeasty and powdery smelling, this is melony on the nose and just convincing enough as Verdejo goes. A reasonably upright palate delivers a shot of acidity, while this tastes of melon, generic white fruits and yeast.",86,Arrumaco 2015 Verdejo (Spain)
"Bottle age has served this wine well, a blend of mostly Cabernet with smaller amounts of Merlot, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec, sourced from the family's three ranches within the appellation. Inviting in cassis and clove, it reveals lithe, soft and juicy layers of blueberry and blackberry before finishing in a plume of acidity.",91,Trione 2010 Red (Alexander Valley)
"This tastes like a fruit juice blend of pineapples, oranges, mangoes and apricots. The acidity makes it taste bright and crisp.",87,Donati 2011 Sorelle Per Sempre Sisters Forever Un-Oaked Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"Aromas of black cherries marinated in spirits, menthol, leather and chopped herbs lead the nose on this brawny wine. The hefty palate shows the heat of the vintage, offering dried berries, licorice, tobacco and mocha alongside the warmth of evident alcohol and jarring tannins. Give it a few years to let the tannins soften up a bit but then drink before the fruit dries up.",88,Sordo 2011 Monvigliero  (Barolo)
"This is a beautiful, crisp Sauvignon Blanc, one of the best out there at this price. It shows clean, crisp acidity and a wonderful, mouth-scouring minerality, with rich flavors of Meyer lemon pie, Key lime yogurt and vanilla. Compelling and so food-friendly.",91,Greenwood Ridge 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Anderson Valley)
"This offers subtle black-skinned berry and cooking spice aromas. The straightforward palate evokes ripe blackberry, tobacco and licorice and is blanketed with velvety tannins. Drink through 2019.",87,Bersano 2015 Costalunga  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore)
"You'll find aromas of dried orchard fruit, beeswax, Spanish broom, acacia and an earthy note on this spry nine-year-old. On the mature, waxy palate, fruit flavors have given way to tertiary sensations of honey, toasted nut, candied citrus zest and flinty mineral that carry through the to lingering finish. A saline note signals the close.",89,Di Meo 2007 Colle dei Cerri  (Fiano di Avellino)
"A thin, sharp attack pushes subdued flavors of stem, cherry and chocolate into a quick, tight finish. In some ways, this wine recalls the Eyrie releases of decades ago, and may prove to age well, as many of those wines did. For now, it's a hard stemmy wine with a bit of burn.",87,White Rose 2014 The Neo-Classical Objective Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Lightweight wine that seems somewhat dilute with flavors of green plums, bright acidity and a very soft texture.",84,Simonnet-Febvre 2008  Petit Chablis
"Apple and peach aromas are dusty and lightly tropical. With no oak, fruit is all you get in this Chardonnay; flavors of apple, nectarine and melon run clean, sweet and ripe, while the finish is mellow and lands smack in the middle of the fairway.",86,Echeverria 2013 Classic Collection Unwooded Chardonnay (Curicó Valley)
"A structured, relatively cool Volnay, dominated more by ripe tannins than by fruit. The fruit that is there is fresh, layered with acidity, juicy in texture, with cranberry and black plum skin flavors. The finish suggests red berries with its firmness. The wine demands at least five years' aging.",93,Bouchard Père & Fils 2006 Clos des Chênes Premier Cru  (Volnay)
"This is a beautiful botrytised wine, made from a field blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling and Gewürztraminer. Light on its feet and reined-in in terms of sweetness, it's golden hay-colored and has a touch of reduction, allowing the Riesling nose to dominate. Decadent yet restrained, it's also lengthy and complex, with highlights of orange and pear.",91,Grgich Hills 2013 Violetta Estate Late Harvest White (Napa Valley)
"Freshly cut Conference pear peel notes abound. The palate has a slightly phenolic, pleasantly bitter edge that will come into its own with food. The beautiful pear and aloe vera notes last long after the last sip. This deserves a whole evening of your attention—the flavors here unfold slowly.",91,Wieninger 2015 Herrenholz Grüner Veltliner (Vienna)
"Anchored in fig, plum and berry fruit, this is a substantial effort for both the vintage and the price. It will show best with hearty, cold-weather dishes. Hints of cinnamon and chocolate extend the finish.",87,Silvan Ridge 2013 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Tart cherry, ripe plum and black cherry flavors and barely a trace of detectable oak character make this a lively, fruit-driven wine. The aroma has touches of clove and black pepper, the texture is not too rich but braced with firm acidity and tannins that keep the fruit flavors zooming along through the finish.",91,Amador Foothill Winery 2012 Clockspring Vineyard Zinfandel (Shenandoah Valley (CA))
"Hints of wisteria and lemon blossom give this dilute Chardonnay a respectable bouquet, while the palate is mild and tastes like bites of lemon, apple and orange. There's not much weight or stuffing to it, but it's generally clean and inoffensive.",83,Antonio Cesar Cavalli 2008 White Pearl Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"Aromas of baked plum, crushed blue flower, allspice, leather and chopped herb come together on this on young, powerfully built wine. The taut palate delivers black cherry, cinnamon, tobacco, licorice and toast alongside bracing, fine-grained tannins that need to time to come around. Drink 2021–2031.",93,Germano Ettore 2011 Cerretta  (Barolo)
"Blackberry, cassis, grilled herb and toasted aromas come together in the glass. On the palate, espresso, mint and black pepper add depth to the core of black cherry and blackberry flavors. It finishes on a licorice note.",90,Cusumano 2012 Sàgana Tenuta San Giacomo Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"Strong, dark aromas of blackberry and cassis are tight and dense. This concentrated, voluminous wine has tangy acidity and flavors of savory spice, chocolate and baked berries. An herbal finish with olive and leathery flavors comes with a racy, tangy feel. Drink through 2018.",90,Viña Maipo 2010 Limited Edition Syrah (Maipo Valley)
"This appealing, southern Rhône blend is a Châteauneuf-du-Pape style, with lush, forward red fruits and pleasing traces of the estate vineyard's characteristic dusty tannins.",89,Alexandria Nicole 2007 Member's Only Red Red (Horse Heaven Hills)
"This shows a bright vein of acidity that's backed by fragrant aromas of lemon zest, kiwi, green sage and grapefruit.",86,Rocca delle Macìe 2010  Vernaccia di San Gimignano
"Rubbery aromas of plum and wild berry turn toward earthy with airing. This blend from one of Uruguay's better wineries is full, hefty and tight, with grabby tannins. Blackberry, pepper and burnt flavors finish blackened and slightly bitter. Drink through 2018.",88,Bouza 2011 Reserva Tempranillo-Tannat (Montevideo)
"Fragrant, aromatic, grassy aromas give way to fresh, crisp, green fruit and gooseberry flavors. Finishes lively and vibrant.",88,Elena Walch 2002 Castel Ringberg Sauvignon Blanc (Alto Adige)
"Herb, cherry, wood spice and vanilla aromas are followed by cherry and blackberry flavors backed by a squeeze of dry tannins. There are good things going on but the oak gets a bit up front.",89,North by Northwest 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This is yet another very good but not quite excellent Malbec from this winery. Solid berry aromas are edged by whiffs of green and horsehide. The palate is fresh, tight and a touch gritty in feel, with leathery red-berry flavors accented by earth and spice notes. This is solid and should be drunk now through 2015.",89,Finca La Anita 2009 Gran Malbec (Mendoza)
"Flat and mildly spicy, this is a light-bodied, fleshy red that offers moderately ripe layers of cherry, raspberry and vanilla.",87,Elkhorn Peak 2012 Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Napa Valley)
"This wine is flawed, with rustic leathery undertones that veer into Band-Aid, and an intensely sour note. Multiple bottles tried over several months.",80,Peter Cellars 2011 Carneros Estate Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"A fabulous Pinot Noir that's rich and deeply flavored, with the most wonderful structure. After a fruity, spicy entry, the wine sinks down dramatically on the midpalate, offering masses of cherries, raspberries, red currants, cured meats, sautéed mushrooms, spices and sweetly toasted sandalwood. Bone dry, and capable of aging eight years in the cellar, it surpasses even the 2007 West Slope, arguably making it one of the greatest Carneros Pinot Noirs ever made.",97,Donum 2009 West Slope Estate Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"Here's a luminous blend of Pinot Grigio, Chardonnay and Garganega with mature aromas of pine nut, mature fruit, apricot and yellow rose. The wine is very creamy and smooth in the mouth and has the natural consistency to stand up to fish or pasta. The finish is crisp and slightly sweet.",85,Tommasi 2008 Giulietta White (Delle Venezie)
"This BSH is 77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Merlot, and includes 15% Cabernet Franc. It's among the best of the recent releases from O•S, with the two Cabs dominating with berry and cassis, earth and cacao. The tannins are lightly grainy and well-balanced.",88,O•S Winery 2009 BSH Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Aromas of blackberry, balsam wood, lemony oak and forest floor lead into a fully stocked, hefty palate. Flavors of black fruits, licorice, herbs and oak finish bright but level. What this lacks in complexity is made up for in ripe berry flavors and overall balance.",90,Sur de los Andes 2012 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza)
"Heavy oak and marginal white-fruit scents make for a compromised nose. This feels chunky and resiny, with heavy flavors of clove and raw wood. Additional clove notes on the finish render this Chardonnay an underachiever.",83,Indomita 2015 Gran Reserva Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)
"This blend of Touriga Nacional and Syrah brings together two perfumed grapes in an harmonious whole. The wine is structured and also richly fruity. It has a great swathe of spiciness from the wood, giving an almost-sweet character while still sustaining the tannins. Drink from 2017.",89,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2012 Red (Tejo)
"Harvested the year a princess became Queen Elizabeth II, this wine aged in oak until now. Bottled in 2016, this is a deep old-gold colored wine. On the palate, it is rich and sweet, with flavors of wood contrasting with the beautiful raisin and prune flavors. It is still impressively fresh and vibrant. It is, of course, ready to drink now.",95,Messias 1952 Porto Envelhecido em Casco Colheita  (Port)
"A dry style, this classic nonvintage from Philipponnat is showing well, with greater depth than in the past. The wine has maturity, with toast, almonds and cookies, but retaining the acidity to give a wine that is mouthfilling and also refreshing.",92,Philipponnat NV Royale Réserve Brut  (Champagne)
"Aromas of grilled herb, mature orchard fruit and citrus lead the nose while the palate offers Bartlett pear and nectarine zest. Notes of white almond and a hint of mineral signal the close.",88,Collis 2015 Scaligeri Decanto  (Soave)
"The wine is rich, accenting tropical-fruit flavors as well as concentrated acidity. Its spice and tangy character are part of the wine's intensity. This superripe wine is still on the young side and will be better from 2018.",88,Isabelle et Pierre Clément 2015 La Dame de Châtenoy  (Menetou-Salon)
"Smelling of coconut on the nose, this Malbec is good, like a big mouthful of cherry pie.",84,Chacewater 2009 Malbec (Red Hills Lake County)
"A dark, brooding aspect of tar and cocoa is wrapped around the ripe but crunchy black cherry that is the hallmark of this wine on nose and palate. The purity of fruit on the palate is astonishing and beautiful and every now and then a flash of black tar and high-grade dark chocolate breaks through. The palate is rich but toned and thrown into shapely poise by fresh acidity.",92,Steindorfer 2013 Reserve St. Laurent (Burgenland)
"By far this is the best Traslanzas I've come across. It is pure, with aromas of cola, mineral, black cherry and the mildest note of raisin. On the palate, it feels concentrated, with big tannins pushing sweet, dark flavors of blackberry, fig, chocolate and licorice. Tastes lightly toasted and feels big on the finish. Drink now through 2018.",92,Traslanzas 2006 Tinto del Pais (Cigales)
"Caramel apple meets high-toned acidity in this balanced, medium-bodied white that's brightened with salty lemon accents. It finishes long, with nuanced nutmeg and vanilla notes.",90,Matanzas Creek 2015 Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"Made in a powerful and thick Paso Robles style, this unique bottling offers cherry syrup, nutmeg, rhubarb and crushed graphite aromas. Baked blueberry pie flavors show on the palate, loaded with mace and spice cake notes. Its tannic texture builds over time, adding to the depth.",93,Seven Oxen 2014 Grenache (Paso Robles)
"Soft, ripe and round, this has a slightly liquorous bite to the aromatics. Pear and nectarine fruit is accented with a dash of cinnamon. The wine was 20% barrel fermented.",88,Spindrift Cellars 2014 Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley)
"A Bordeaux-style blend that's based mainly on Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, this is all about sweet fruit. It has flavors of cherry, red licorice, red currant jam and sweet oak, wrapped into a softly tannic mouthfeel. Drink now.",88,Stephanie 2008 Proprietary Red Wine Red (Napa Valley)
"Just lightly touched by wood this is a bright and fruity wine that is ready to drink. Spice and red-berry fruits dominate, lifted by balanced tannins. Drink now.",87,Real Companhia Velha 2014 Evel Tinto Red (Douro)
"Beautiful in peach color, this blends 73% Chardonnay and 27% Pinot Noir. Dry and crisp, it tangles together vibrant flavors of grapefruit, tangerine and cherry, as aromas of rose petal whisper by. A stony mineral component adds complexity and invitation to the texture.",95,Schramsberg 2013 Querencia Brut Rosé Sparkling (Napa Valley)
"A light-pink color is backed by a simple nose that's nondescript but fresh and clean. A slightly foamy but firm palate isn't all that deep or rich, while mild grapefruit and blood orange flavors finish steady.",88,Pinord NV La Dama Reserva Familiar Brut Rosé Sparkling (Cava)
"This salmon-colored rosé opens with aromas of chewing gum and something candied but nonspecific. A juicy palate suggests citrus, while the flavor profile is tangy but generic in this simple wine that blends fresh and sweet qualities.",85,Bodegas Muriel 2013 Vendimia Seleccionada Rosado (Rioja)
"This is your quintessential simple quaff among brut cavas. It's clean, lime-tinged and soda-like on the nose, with a correct, no-issues palate that pushes zesty apple along with sweet papaya, mango and banana flavors. It's slightly sweet and tropical, but still it holds onto its crisp qualities and dryness. No complaints for the money.",87,Freixenet NV Cordon Negro Brut Sparkling (Cava)
"Nomes est omen: the easy joy of crunchy red, ripe cherries is embodied by this easy-drinking, peppery and fruit-driven red. Fruit abounds on the slender, spicy, fresh but generous and balanced body. What's not to like?",89,The Dot 2015 Austrian Cherry Zweigelt (Niederösterreich)
"Lavish heaps of blackberries and cherries are accented by nuances of nuts, dried herb and black tea leaves in this composed red wine. Full bodied but balanced in acidity and fruit, it's substantial without overpowering. The finish lingers on velvety tannins.",88,Suhru 2012 Ember Red (North Fork of Long Island)
"Lemon meringue and graham cracker show first in this rewarding wine that's made in a lush, full-bodied, barrel-fermented style. Golden apple stands out amid the toasted oak, while crisp acidity shines on the finish.",90,Silverpoint Cellars 2014 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"A huge, smooth wine, full of superripe fruit that is intensely mouth-filling. The structure is submerged by all this black fruit. It's supremely rich, kept in balance by the acidity.",89,Quinta do Portal 2004 Reserva Red (Douro)
"This Ripasso presents an interesting nose with clove, fresh curry leaf, cherry liqueur and bitter chocolate. It's smooth and balanced with a simple but genuine delivery overall.",88,Arduini 2009  Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso
"Has a sweaty aroma that's that's hard to get past. In the mouth, the wine is simple, sweet and sharp, with raspberry-mint jelly flavors.",80,Brutocao 2005 Feliz Vineyard Barbera (Mendocino)
"Christophe Perrot-Minot makes this wine from a parcel of the vineyard that is declassified grand cru. It's opulent and generous, yet it's also minerally and fresh. The sumptuous Chambolle feel is still to come as the wine rounds out and loses its youthful tannins. Age for at least seven years.",94,Domaine Perrot-Minot 2010 La Combe d'Orveau Cuvée Ultra Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny)
"Nice and dry, with good currant, cherry, olive and oak flavors, but the tannins are quite tough, giving the wine great astringency. Doesn't seem to have the stuffing for the cellar, so drink up.",85,Sawyer 2005 Estate Merlot (Rutherford)
"Intensely concentrated in black currants, cassis liqueur and oak aromas and flavors, this Cabernet is so strong, it's practically undrinkable now. It's not just the potent tannins and bright acidity, it's the raw, jammy quality of the fruit. All these elements could begin to come together after 2017.",88,Foyt Family 2009 No. 77 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder)
"You'll taste the 40% new French oak right away, followed by crisp, botanical flavors of lime rind and green apple. It's not a fleshy Chardonnay, instead it's the mineral and botanical flavors that stand out.",87,Gresser 2013 Vineyard Select Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
"This is a minty, aromatic Syrah, with tannins that are laced with violet and blackberry flavors. It's finely structured, and shows a spice charcter from the fruit that combines easily with the wood toast. Age for 4 years.",91,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2008 Grande Escolha Syrah (Tejo)
"A savory, tannic and slightly earthy Cabernet Sauvignon made by winemakers Denis and May-Britt Malbec, who consult on many Napa Valley-based projects. The 2007 and 2009 are more indicative of how silky smooth and refined their Cabernets can be, with this one exhibiting just slightly too much tobacco and smoke on the finish, overpowering the berry fruit.",87,Xurus 2008 Sonatina Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Lake County)
"Black olive dominates on the nose in this blend of 75% Syrah, 12.5% Grenache and 12.5% Mourvèdre, all from Kick Ranch. Lively red fruit is amplified by soft, medium-bodied tannins and a well-composed finish, with just enough earth and spice to go around.",90,Carica 2010 Kick Ranch Siren Red (Sonoma County)
"This dessert wine is such a deep amber color, it is reminiscent of a gleaming copper pot. Aromas of resin, pine nut, roasted almond, maple syrup and butterscotch denote a Vin Santo that shows its years without seeming old. It's thick and syrupy in the mouth with loads of honey-roasted nut flavors.",88,Le Caniette 2000 Sibilla Appeninica Vin Santo Passerina (Marche)
"Crafted from a range of vineyards, including Gap's Crown and some new sites in this vintage, this lovely, well-made and balanced wine is made in larger quantities than the producer's vineyard-designates and is enjoyable young. Creamy and full bodied at first, it evolves into cohesive flavors of baked pear, toasted almond and lemon-lime.",91,Patz & Hall 2014 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"This full-bodied wine opens with earthy aromas of game, leather, ripe black fruit, clove and a balsamic note. Bracing tannins that still need to unwind support the concentrated blackberry, raspberry, tobacco and licorice flavors. The warmth of alcohol shows on the close. Drink 2017–2023.",90,Terenzi 2011 Marchesa Riserva  (Morellino di Scansano)
"Delicious. A drinkably juicy, brambly version of Amador County Zin, consistently one of Joel Gott's best, with appetizing texture and mouthfeel and dry, dusty tannins, ready to go now with a range of meaty foods but also able to age.",90,Joel Gott 2008 Dillian Ranch Zinfandel (Amador County)
"Leathery berry aromas are comported and spicy. This feels grabby, tannic and tight, but good. Blackberry, toasty oak and integrated spice and herbal notes conclude with a compact tannic grip and a lasting note of oak.",88,La Legua 2013 Crianza Tempranillo (Cigales)
"What a heady nose. Tangerine peel, hay flowers and ripe apples all dance and swirl across the senses. The palate takes the swirling fruit and fragrance up a notch, heightened with the intensity of tangy lemon freshness. This has utter precision and concentration, there almost seems to be a life force of stone and power behind it. It's a textbook Riesling with a clean, dry and totally tangy moreish finish. Lovely now but with great potential. Drink 2017–2035.",95,Cave de Turckheim 2015 Brand Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"Spunky aromas of red plum and red-berry fruits are fresh. This wine feels dry, chalky and tannic. Berry and plum flavors come with a hint of chocolate and spice on a choppy finish.",87,Tinedo 2014 Cala N.1 Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"A decent introduction to Aussie Chardonnay, this new line from Penfolds boasts plenty of sweet vanilla and peach flavors in a full and somewhat syrupy package.",83,Penfolds 2001 Rawson's Retreat Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia)
"Overtly sweet, with a white sugar edge to the citrus fruits, this is basically a dessert wine. Earns extra credit for cleanness and crisp acidity.",83,Robert Mondavi 2010 Pinot Grigio (California)
"This opens with aromas of raisin, tobacco leaf, underbrush, grilled porcini mushroom and leather. The extracted palate delivers black pepper, clove, dried sage, prune and licorice supported by teeth-coating tannins. The heat of searing alcohol on the finish throws the wine off balance.",88,Buglioni 2007 Riserva  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"This wine is totally fresh, with crisp red currant and riper banana flavors—a bright wine that's all fruit and refreshing acidity. The family has been in the wine business since 1811 and today works with some 50 small-production growers.",84,Loron et Fils 2014 Beau!  (Beaujolais)
"Aromas of yellow flower, citrus and dried herb float out of the glass. The palate is a bit on the lean side, offering lime, grilled sage and bitter almond alongside zesty acidity.",86,Principe di Corleone 2015 Bianca di Corte Grillo (Sicilia)
"Light in body and tart in acids, this bone-dry Pinot Noir shows modest flavors of cherry skins, red apple peelings and cola.",84,Cameron Hughes 2010 Lot 326 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Aromas recall ripe, black-skinned fruit, clove, thyme and a whiff of barnyard. The palate offers mature black currant, black pepper and savory herb alongside firm tannins.",87,Rivera 2012 Triusco Primitivo (Puglia)
"Shows Viognier's exotic tropical fruit, citrus, white flower and honey notes in a rich way, but what lifts it above the ordinary is the purity of mouthfeel. Like cold mountain stream water, it's limpid and alive, and brightened with fine acidity. Great restaurant wine.",90,Bon Niche 2011 Par La Mer By The Sea Viognier (Monterey)
"As fabulous as ever, this brilliant compendium of nutty-toasty-buttery scents and flavors is never tiring. It's vivid, fruit-loaded and bracing. Well-ripened citrus and stone fruits come into focus, along with streaks of vanilla and lemongrass.",95,Shea 2014 Shea Vineyard Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
"Pure and striking from the start, with menthol aromas that come with blackberry and cassis. Feels dense and concentrated, with blackberry, prune and dark spice flavors. Layered, mellow and slight jammy on the multitiered finish. Drink now.",90,Gouguenheim Winery 2006 Blue Melosa Malbec (Mendoza)
"If you don't mind a bit of herbal character, this is a nice, easy drinking Syrah with raspberry and cherry aromas and timidity as opposed to a forceful attack. Zesty berry fruit rules the palate, which finishes in round, roasted form. Nice but sort of generic.",87,Rayun 2008 Syrah (Rapel Valley)
"The family vineyards of consultant Anselmo Mendes are in the north of the Vinho Verde region the home of Alvarinho, so it's no surprise that this wine is a great interpetation of the grape. It is almost luscious in its intensity and richness. Orange, ripe apple and intense citrus flavors are encased in a generous, full-bodied wine. Drink now, although this wine will be even better from 2017.",91,Anselmo Mendes 2015 Muros Antigos Alvarinho (Vinho Verde)
"Sharply-defined with a lemony edge, this mixes fruit flavors of tart red berry and citrus. As it breathes it seems to develop some high-toned aromatics bordering on nail polish. Drink up.",87,Eisold-Smith 2014 Lewman Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Muted and diluted, this wine is missing structure and fruit, leaving dullness to the palate. Black currant and blackberry do their best to shine, amid toasty oak.",84,Summers 2012 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Calistoga)
"From the last remaining block of a vineyard planted in 1968 by Oregon pioneer Dick Erath that's yielding less than 1.5 tons per acre, this is loaded with rose petal and cherry blossom aromas. Delicate and graceful, it offers subtle raspberry, blackberry and cherry fruit. The finish is exceptional, long and complex, with hints of coffee and caramel. Give this wine your full attention and enjoy how long it lingers.",93,Aberrant Cellars 2014 Chehalem Mountain Vineyard Block B3 Old Vines Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"A big and friendly wine, with plenty of forward fruit mingling flavors of citrus, apples and pears. There is a nice blast of vanilla too, the only obvious sign of new oak aging, but the impression overall is of crisp, clean elegance. Best Buy.",89,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2000 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This soft, fruity and fleshy wine has bright red fruits and a strong pepper character. The wine comes from vineyards between 900 and 1,500 feet on limestone soil, giving it a mineral edge at the end.",85,Ravoire et Fils 2015 Florette Rosé (Coteaux Varois en Provence)
"Produced from organically grown grapes, this structured wine is complex and still very closed up, with dense tannins and dark fruit. Powerful with dark plum flavors, it is firmly textured and needs plenty of time for aging. Drink from 2020",95,Alex Gambal 2013  Charmes-Chambertin
"Falcone wisely reins in the fruity richness and oak on this wine, allowing acidity and citrus flavors to star. That is a nod to Santa Barbara's cool-climate terroir, not winemaker interference. The wine is dry, crisp and minerally, with subtle lime, Meyer lemon and Asian pear flavors, with a hint of oak. A lovely restaurant wine at a fair price.",90,Falcone 2009 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County)
"The oak is prominent on this wine, giving a high-glass sheen of toasted coconut and vanilla to the otherwise modest fruit. There's enough weight and richness to stand up to the wood, but just barely, while the texture is creamy and lush throughout. Drink now.",89,Tardieu-Laurent 2008 Rasteau Vieilles Vignes Red (Côtes du Rhône Villages)
"The 2008 vintage in California was the last really hot one before the recent series of cooler years, and this Cabernet tastes like it developed raisin and prune juice flavors in the heat. It's tasty in its own way, like a chocolate and roasted almond granola bar, but it isn't ageable.",84,Neal Family 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This bistro-style red is dry and lusty in cherry, tobacco and spice flavors. The winery has not revealed what varieties are in it, but it tastes like a juicy, old-fashioned field blend, and will go well with a range of fare.",87,Vixen NV The Villain Red (Santa Barbara County)
"This is a good, classic-style blend of Bordeaux grape varieties with just enough tannin to support the ripe blackberry and black-pepper flavors. It's dry, has medium body and a mouth-filling texture.",89,Boeger 2014 Meritage Red (El Dorado)
"Here's a great deal for a soft, plush and easy-drinking Italian red that would pair with lasagna or fettuccine with meat ragù. You will detect fresh notes of blackberry and blueberry as well as dried aromas of cassis and candied raspberry.",86,Orion Wine 2011 È 100 Per Cento  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo)
"Dry in character, not a heavyweight. The wine has some fresh fruit through the dry tannins and spice. There's good balance, even if the wine is on the light side.",86,Quinta Seara d'Ordens 2008 Vintage  (Port)
"While the wine is toasty, burnt almost, the freshness of the fruit is very present, giving a light, lively touch to the weight. Give it six months to finally integrate.",89,Pierre Vessigaud 2008 Vers Agnières  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
"Such a tiny amount produced, yet the quality makes you wish for much, much more. The pale coppery rosé is wonderfully rich and toasty, with lovely raspberry and cherry fruit, a fine bead plus excellent concentration and finesse.",91,Sokol Blosser NV Sparkling Rosé of Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Heady, beguiling aromatics dominate and invite in this well-made, robustly full-bodied wine, which is spicy and tart in baked plum, cherry, cranberry and a twist of orange. Zesty acidity gives it a kick on the palate, buoyed by a moderate tannin structure.",92,Lucie 2015 Dutton Ranch Widdoes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"From a vineyard sited near the winery, this is the most supple, balanced and evenly detailed of the 2007 red wines from Fidélitas. The lightly muscled, compact fruit flavors bring black cherry, cassis, and plum together, with a strong minerality providing subtext. A suggestion of smoke suffuses the finish.",91,Fidelitas 2007 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"This wine is full bodied and rich on the palate, with a woody reminder of oak. Spicy apple notes are lifted by spritzy acidity.",87,Broadway Vineyards 2014 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Dry, sizable tannins embrace a core of dusty black plum and blackberry. Straightforward and not overly ambitions, it finishes with a pronounced taste of oak.",85,Field Stone 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"This is a gorgeous Italian white (made with Pinot Bianco grapes) that shows promising food pairing potential thanks to its silky, creamy mouthfeel and non-intrusive aromas. The wine offers a steady flow of stone fruit, melon and honey-like flavors.",90,Nals Margreid 2010 Penon Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
"Dark in the glass, this bottling shows strawberry, black plum and gingerbread aromas on the inviting nose. The mouthfeel is airy and relatively light, with a strong tannic tension that frames flavors of dark purple fruit and baking spice.",91,Sextant 2015 Holystone Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"New Zealand's best known winery does a consistently good job with the Burgundian varieties, not just Sauvignon Blanc. The chunky, medium-bodied 2010 Pinot Noir displays ample intensity, length and complexity. Its savory style shows dark cherry fruit, with hints of mocha and grilled meat. Drink now–2020.",89,Cloudy Bay 2010 Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
"This is a pure Grenache, tart and spicy, with powerful herb components. It is not fruity or sappy-sweet by any measure, but it delivers moderately concentrated flavors highlighted by herb and earth notes, with good length and balance.",87,Cowhorn 2010 Grenache 58 Grenache (Applegate Valley)
"Made in large-enough quantities to be widely available, as well as at a rare price point for the appellation, this is a bit of a find. Juicy in red-fruit tones yet supported by drying tannins, this is pleasurably perplexing, with a hint of mint on the nose. Full bodied, it finishes with tobacco and fig. Cellar through 2020.",92,Mount Veeder 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Refreshing and zesty, with peach, grass, juniper berry and grapefruit flavors that drink a little sweet, although crisp acidity cleanses and soothes the palate. This nice cocktail wine is fun and easy to drink.",84,Saracina 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino County)
"The nose is very shy and almost neutral. The palate does not brim with aroma, either: here is slender clean freshness on a light dry body. Drink soon.",86,André Kientzler 2014 Sylvaner (Alsace)
"This pomegranate-pink Cerasuolo from central Italy opens with spicy aromas of chopped herb, cassis and raspberry and ends with cooling acidity on the close. The mouthfeel shows balanced density and smoothness.",87,Talamonti 2010  Cerasuolo d'Abruzzo
"This medium-bodied wine has lightly spicy aromas, good, mouthfilling fruit flavors and a smooth texture. Words like suave and velvety come to mind. It's a very nice effort for the winery's first Barbera.",89,Sierra Starr 2013 Cooper Vineyard Barbera (Amador County)
"Produced from 25-year-old vines, the wine was aged in oak for 24 months. It is a concentrated wine that is ripely spicy, full of black fruits and tannins that are still very present. It is a dense wine that will develop well, impressively rich and still balanced. Drink this wine from 2019.",91,Clos Troteligotte 2012 K-Lys Malbec (Cahors)
"Big, fresh, grapy aromas are the greeting on this nice but generic Malbec. The palate is plump and chunky yet bright and fruit-forward, with creamy flavors of dark plum and berry. A clean, focused, short finish functions as a good close.",87,Pascual Toso 2012 Estate Bottled Malbec (Mendoza)
"Delicately perfumed with notes of lemon, tart stone fruit and white florals, this off-dry Riesling builds in intensity and ripeness on the palate. It's lushly textured, with flavors of fleshy peach and apricot that are brightened by lemon-lime acidity.",90,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt 2012 Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Kabinett GL Riesling (Mosel)
"Lifted green pear and passion fruit come in a clean but slender package that offers easy, zingy refreshment.",89,Stift Göttweig 2013 Goettweiger Berg Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"Rose-petal aromas and green-apple flavors bring a distinct personality to this light-bodied, snappy-tasting wine. While the first impression is floral and openly fruity, an underlying crisp acidity comes through on the finish and keeps it refreshing.",87,Monte Volpe 2013 Vesuvius White (Potter Valley)
"A bit broad on the palate, this wine offers ample melon and fig flavors but lacks that vibrant zesty character that so often sets Marlborough Sauvignon apart from the pack. Drink now.",84,Seresin 2009 Momo Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"A beautifully ripe wine with great black fruits that burst through the classic tannins. In its richness and in its structure, it combines the best of the vintage. Dark, complex, fruity and very rich, a magnificent wine for long-term aging.",96,Château Smith Haut Lafitte 2010  Pessac-Léognan
"Perfumed with floral, citric freshness this evokes jasmine blossom and cut grapefruit peel. The palate is of an exquisite lightness and a slight spritz adds extra zip to the already electric little number. Just one sip of this ultrapure, racy wine and you are thoroughly refreshed. This is a Riesling that spells summer.",93,Bründlmayer 2014 Zöbinger Heiligenstein Riesling (Kamptal)
"For those who like their non-vintage with some bottle age, this is a fine wine. While it has lost its early freshness, it certainly has gained in complexity, offering ripe, soft, toasty flavors to add to the green plum fruits and acidity.",89,Vranken NV Diamant Brut  (Champagne)
"This is a classic, bold, fruity Nouveau, with firm tannins that add weight to the palate. Pair this with food.",86,Georges Duboeuf 2012 Nouveau  (Beaujolais-Villages)
"Some unripe notes of vegetables mar this otherwise likeable wine. It's very dry and soft, with firm tannins and cherry, cocoa and cedar flavors.",84,Artezin 2007 Charbono (Napa Valley)
"Waxy, weird aromas of lemon and ham are all over the map. This feels heavy, with a sense of sugary weight. Chunky flavors of cured pork and creamy melon finish plump but amorphous.",84,Enate 2014 234 Chardonnay (Somontano)
"Toast, spice, lees and baked-apple aromas are followed by medium-bodied flavors that show restraint.",87,Three Rivers 2014 Reserve Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Canned lychee and lemongrass feels a bit thick and heavy on the nose. The palate follows suit and is medium in weight, yet lags a little in acidic verve.",84,Los Pinos Ranch 2014 Blanco Grande Estate Grown Blanc du Bois (Texas)
"Anderson Valley is better known for Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, but the cool climate is also good for Sauvignon Blanc. Foursight's 2010 is a delightful wine, vibrant in citrus, tropical fruit and peach flavors, and there's no oak to interfere with its purity. With a finish that seems just a little sweet, it's a fine companion for Asian fare.",90,Foursight 2010 Charles Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Anderson Valley)
"Ripe yellow-peach and apricot notes shine on the nose and palate of this elegantly structured Pinot Gris. Zesty acidity offers a pleasant counterpoint to a softly clingy texture that lingers luxuriously on the palate. It's dry in style, with a deeply mineral, smoky finish.",90,Franz Keller 2015 Pinot Gris (Baden)
"Citrusy and full on the nose, with a fleshy palate that sports fresh white grapefruit and passion fruit flavors. This is a textbook Verdejo from Rueda with modest sweaty notes, grapefruit galore, citrus pith and minerality. Drink now.",88,Martinsancho 2009 Verdejo (Rueda)
"This wine delivers good value for its quality, a medium-bodied expression of ripe, exuberant honeycomb, baked pear and anise that is supported but never distracted by mellowed oak. Refreshing and balanced, it has moderate acidity and a luxurious mouthfeel.",89,Balletto 2014 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"The Daou brothers' heady blend of 62% Merlot and 38% Cabernet Sauvignon is very dark in the glass, offering blueberry, espresso, cream and dark chocolate ganache on the lush nose. Blackberry jam, tobacco, pencil lead and oregano show on the palate, where firm structure and juicy acidity leaves the mouth uplifted.",93,Daou 2013 Micho Red (Adelaida District)
"Rich and round, this offers plenty of concentrated blackberry notes enveloped in warm spices and supple oak. There's a hint of green tomato leaves throughout, but the lush fruit combined with sturdy grape tannins and high acidity would pair well with fatty short ribs or braised pork.",87,Veramar 2008 Estate Club Merlot (Virginia)
"Maestro opens with fruit and balsamic aromas of red currant, grilled pepper and Mediterranean herbs. The palate is still quite tight and closed, but reveals soft flavors of plum, black cherry, espresso and nutmeg. This needs a little more time to open up, so give it a few more years in the cellar.",90,Palazzo Vecchio 2010 Maestro  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano)
"This round and easy-drinking wine, 95% Aglianico and 5% Sangiovese, is loaded with a juicy black-cherry flavor that's accented by hints of black pepper and mineral. It's soft, fresh and incredibly food friendly. Pair it with everything from hearty pasta dishes to barbecue.",87,I Capitani 2012 Guaglione Red (Irpinia)
"A solid value in the world of Pinot Noir, this is pleasantly complex on the nose, offering up hints of cola, root beer and green herbs layered over dark fruit aromas. On the palate, it's reasonably full bodied and supple, delivering savory, earthy notes without being inaccessible. Mocha and silk soften the finish.",91,Rockburn 2011 Pinot Noir (Central Otago)
"Pleasant but light on the nose, with strawberry and cough syrup notes. A bit monotone in the mouth with slight sweetness and a short cherry-flavored finish.",81,Glenora 2007 Rosé Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes)
"Fresh and fruity, this easy-drinking red delivers aromas and flavors of black cherry, blackberry, black pepper and a hint of anise. Thanks to bright acidity, it can be paired with almost any dish.",87,Castello del Poggio 2013  Barbera d'Asti
"This greets the taster with a heady aromas of yellow spring flowers, as well as whiffs of tropical fruit. The palate delivers intense peach, apricot and citrus flavors accented by notes of mineral and brine.",91,Muròla 2012  Verdicchio di Matelica
"This value wine opens with a fresh, citrusy bouquet and features a compact, streamlined mouthfeel.",86,Duca di Salaparuta 2010 Calanìca Insolia-Chardonnay White (Sicilia)
"Grown on two parcels of 60- and 80-year-old vines, this is a dense, impressively concentrated wine. It has rich white fruits cut with citrus, as well as a firmer, more mineral character that sets the wine on the road to aging. This structured wine will be best from 2019.",94,Michel Vattan 2014 Les L-O  (Sancerre)
"Flinty reduction still dominates the nose but this is only a sign of youth in this nuanced wine. It discloses tentative pear blossom and fruit, plus notions of wet earth and candied lime. Above all, a zesty spine of acidity and freshness directs all the attention to a profound, stony core. There is life force here and you know this will continue to evolve.",92,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Calcaire Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"This is an absolutely lovely Pinot Noir that's softly refined and balanced, yet so complex. It's silky and dry, with waves of raspberries and cherries, red currants, mocha, red licorice and sautéed wild mushrooms. Drink now–2015 for fresh appeal.",92,De Loach 2010 OFS Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"The freshness of ripe lemon and crunchy, green apple pervades everything: the nose and palate sing with light-footed, unfettered freshness. This is crisp, light and spritzy and just the thing for a sunny, summery mood where refreshment is supposed to come on tiptoe but have a lasting effect. Full points for joy and ease. Drink soon.",89,Winzerkeller Andau 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Burgenland)
"This is rich, full of spicy fruit, apricot juice and white peaches. The fruits are topped by an unctuous honey character that pushes the wine towards sweetness while keeping a fresh flavor in the background. Drink from 2017.",93,Rieflé 2012 Steinert Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Made from vines planted in 1965, David Hill's estate Riesling is aromatic and textural, with an interesting, nuanced character that brings apples, peaches, pears and passion fruit flavors in profusion. Despite 1.8% residual sugar, it has plenty of acid and alcohol, finishing with a creamy, lemony fade.",90,David Hill 2007 Estate Riesling (Willamette Valley)
"Soft and stewy up front, without a whole lot of vigor. It feels wide and hard, with abrasive tannins and strained flavors of herbal berry and leather. On the finish it's earthy, tannic and warm, with a weedy note along with barrel spice.",83,Taurus 2007 Roble  (Toro)
"Lighter in the glass, this bottling shows garrigue, rose petals and buds and bright pomegranate aromas on the nose. It's lighter bodied on the sip, and would be nice on a summer day with a slight chill, offering flavors of cranberry, raspberry, thyme and marjoram.",88,Mesa Del Sol 2013 Grenache (Monterey County)
"Aromas of tomato leaf and blackberry unfold into flavors of pepper and cherry cola. Vanilla aromas dominate the long, crisp finish, which shows nicely refined tannins.",87,Red Newt Cellars 2007 Syrah-Cabernet Franc Red (Finger Lakes)
"Borderline translucent in color, and equally light in the nose. The aromas are of cranberry and chlorine. The palate is all strawberry and some bitter oak, and while it picks up steam and fills out with time, the initial impression is hard to overcome.",82,Henry Estate 2001 Umpqua Cuvee Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley)
"This blend of 56% Grenache Blanc, 23% Viognier, 12% Roussanne and 9% Marsanne from nine vineyards offers a pretty nose that mixes Key lime, honeydew, just-ripe nectarine and lily florality. It's bright and fresh on the tightly wound and texturally intriguing sip, with lime pith and lemongrass flavors.",91,Tablas Creek 2015 Patelin de Tablas Blanc White (Paso Robles)
"This is a very simple, friendly, fresh and lively white—easy to drink and enjoy with its lemony freshness. It's ideal for a party.",86,Famille Hauller 2015 Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
"Elderberry and black currant fruit mesh with cedar, smoked beef and pencil lead on the nose of this impressive bottling of a rarely solo grape. A pointed graphite minerality shows on the palate, where blueberry and black-plum fruit are enhanced by tobacco and dark-chocolate nuance.",89,Broken Earth 2012 Petit Verdot (Paso Robles)
"This wine has an unusually dark color, plus potent and spicy charred-oak aromas. A very aggressive sweet-oak flavor coats over the grape flavors. It stays somewhat sweet on the palate and finish.",85,Carnivor 2015 Zinfandel (California)
"Austin Hope's latest releases are all about power and ripeness, and this blend of 35% Grenache, 35% Mourvèdre and 30% Syrah achieves balance and elegance amidst that strength. Cuban coffee, fig jam, dried blueberry and chocolate aromas lead into a pillowy-soft palate that's layered with espresso, cocoa, roasted fig and plum jam flavors. Steady acidity and finely chiseled tannins frame it all.",95,Austin Hope 2014 Avery #3 The Magic Sun G-S-M (Templeton Gap District)
"From a 3.5-acre block planted in 1978, which makes it Santa Barbara County's first Syrah, this bottling shows an intriguing density of flowers on the nose along with a funky compost note, elderberry fruit, pine needles and fresh mint. Cracked peppercorn, dried thyme and rosemary combine for strong herbal intrigue on the palate, spicing up the black plum and blackberry fruit.",93,Zaca Mesa 2012 Black Bear Block Estate Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)
"This is lighter in style, but nicely dry, balanced, appetizing and complete. It smells like red cherries and cranberries and tastes fresh, nicely tart and lively. At the same time it feels firmly tannic and palate-cleansing. This will be a super-versatile wine with food.",88,Peirano 2013 The Heritage Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi)
"Fruity and tangy, this is a light and fresh wine. It has crisp green apples patterned with citrus fruits and a tight, bright texture. Ready to drink.",85,Remy-Pannier 2012 Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"The Nuages cuvée delicately includes lightly peppery herbal notes in the fruit-filled wine that leans toward blueberries and cherries. There is a streak of brown sugar, and the overall balance is exacting. Despite the relative youth, nothing seems awkward or out of place. Drink now through 2022.",91,J. Christopher 2013 Nuages Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"Made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine also contains a hearty amount of Syrah, along with smaller additions of Merlot, Malbec, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Sangiovese. Medium bodied, it's smoky, shy in tannins that build on the palate, with a lengthy, licorice-like finish.",90,Kuleto Estate 2012 India Ink Red (Napa Valley)
"A nose of pear, honeydew melon and freshly-starched linens sets the stage for soft pear and melon flavors that are overpowered by intense minty notes. There is a burst of fresh citrus on the finish, but there is a lingering sense of cotton on the palate throughout each sip.",86,Golan Heights Winery 2013 Hermon White (Galilee)
"Cracked pepper, dried blueberries, dried violets and strong bay-leaf aromas show prominently on the nose of this bottling from the southern stretches of the Bay Area. There is solid depth to the flavors, with dill, fennel and a savory, peppery teriyaki element spicing up the blackberry and olallieberry fruit.",90,Martin Ranch 2013 Thérèse Vineyards Dos Niñas Vineyard Malbec (Santa Clara Valley)
"With an aroma like prosciutto and melon, a soft texture, and attractive floral and ripe peach flavors, this is a fun and affordable wine to drink at lunch or before dinner.",88,McManis 2015 Viognier (River Junction)
"A rich wine, full of peach and pineapple flavors, with an herbal, spicy edge. It's full in the mouth, the texture oily and unctuous. At the end, the pepper character thrusts out of the glass.",90,Forstreiter 2009 Schiefer Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"This rich wine is dense and concentrated, with beautiful apple and spice flavors lifted by acidity. The fruit and the minerality typical of the appellation give this wine both its fine texture and its tangy fruitiness. Drink from 2018.",92,Domaine Pascal et Mireille Renaud 2016 Cuvée Vieilles Vignes  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
"With some earthy aromas, this is a rich wine. It has weight, layers of wood and attractive strawberry flavor. The fruitiness is contained within a firm tannin shell that suggests the wine could age.",89,Domaine Albert Mann 2009 Clos de la Faille Pinot Noir (Alsace)
"From a relatively young vineyard (planted in 2000), this is a nicely complex effort, showing hints of rose pollen, cherries and herbal tea. It's round in the mouth, yet virtually weightless, showing off a wonderfully silky texture that persists through the finish. Without any real track record, opt for drinking this one on the young side (now–2012).",91,Felton Road 2007 Cornish Point Pinot Noir (Central Otago)
"Made in a méthode Champenoise style, this is crafted from estate-grown fruit, the color crimson pink, the flavors high-toned strawberry and fresh citrus. Light on its feet and dry, it features bubbles that form a rich mousse counterpointed by crisp natural acidity. On the finish is the suggestion of fennel.",92,Inman Family 2012 OGV Estate Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Extended time in the bottle, as well as 18 months in French oak, lend gravitas and elegance to this Cabernet Sauvignon. Hints of maturity—whiffs of truffle and wet soil—lend delightful complexity to sweet-tart black currant and cherry flavors. The finish is bristling and bright, lingering long on a puckering cranberry tone.",90,Raphael 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (North Fork of Long Island)
"This elegant Chardonnay offers aromas of pear, citrus fruits and toast on the nose, with flavors of tropical fruit and lemon rind following. Its oak treatment is balanced by minerality and focus. A refined white with exotic character.",90,Gerovassiliou 2015 Chardonnay (Epanomi)
"Bordeaux wine should not have high alcohol; it detracts from the play between fruit and tannins, as in this wine. It is powered by its extracted structure, with flavors of bitter chocolate that leave the fruit behind.",85,Château des Landes 2009 Cuvée Prestige  (Lussac Saint-Émilion)
"Aromas of black cherry, ground cooking spice and a whiff of grilled herb drive the nose on this structured red. The enveloping palate doles out ripe black cherry, licorice, almond and black pepper accompanied by firm, velvety tannins.",91,Poderi Luigi Einaudi 2012 Vigna Tecc  (Dogliani Superiore)
"A well-made wine, showing lots of terroir in the mineral-infused blackberry, black currant, chocolate and anise flavors. The tannins are structurally superb, while the finish is dry and complex. A very fine wine that should gather momentum for at least a decade.",95,Terra Valentine 2007 Wurtele Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District)
"Slight in aroma at first, this wine slowly reveals a waft of lemon. It's light in flavor, and it delivers crispness, with a hint of oak on the finish.",84,Insatiable 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino County)
"This tiny winery makes just a few hundred cases per year. The Merlot is grapey and rustic, with Grenache-like fruit flavors and some rough, chocolatey oak. —P.G.",85,Patrick M. Paul 2000 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The winery's characteristic dense style is immediately apparent in this blend of 54% Syrah, 21% Mourvèdre, 16% Grenache and 9% Petite Sirah. It offers black licorice, smoked meat, baked black cherry and graphite aromas, needing time to breathe before unleashing black coffee, elderberry jam, asphalt and charcoal flavors through tarry tannins. Drink 2018–2028.",94,Epoch Estate Wines 2013 Ingenuity Red (Paso Robles)
"Full, with lots of structure, this offers concentrated grape and blackberry aromas that open to black-currant and cedar-spice flavors. A fine fruit-acid balance on the full, even palate keeps it lively, even in its fairly youthful and closed state. Dusty tannins and sweet-and-sour black fruits on the long but tight finish close this appealing package.",92,Robert Craig 1997 Affinity Red (Napa Valley)
"This affordable wine is a testament to skilled sourcing and blending, using choice grapes from up and down the coast. Spicy cherry, forest and black tea aromas provide plenty varietal character, while medium-bodied weight and juiciness are lifted by bright acidity.",91,Contour 2014 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County-Monterey County-Napa County)
"Dense aromas of black plum syrup, star anise and purple flowers show on the nose of this top-end bottling by a pioneering Edna Valley producer. Tart boysenberry shows on the sip, but the prominent flavors are more forest floor-driven, with woody bay leaf and juniper spices.",92,Chamisal Vineyards 2014 Morrito Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)
"From Vine Hill Vineyard, this wine is juicy in raspberry and vanilla, made in a fuller-bodied style with pronounced tannins on the finish. Let it open to express itself fully.",88,Sonoma-Cutrer 2012 VH Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"A very rich wine, showing all the opulence of 2009. Black plums, damsons and wood flavors are already combined and integrated. The acidity in all this richness and power seems low, leaving the tannins to support aging.",95,Domaine Dujac 2009 Clos de Saint-Denis  (Clos Saint-Denis)
"The nose on this wine is fairly shy with pencil shavings, danker herbs and a plum-fruit backbone, which predicts a very dry palate. However, the flavors are extremely ripe and sweet, with strawberry, black plum, mission fig and vanilla flavors.",85,Minassian-Young 2013 Estate Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"This has an elegant, fruity, lightly spicy profile. Red cherry and nutmeg aromas meld with fresh and pure fruit flavors like red cherry and raspberry shaded by cinnamon and clove. It also offers a silky-smooth texture and medium body.",90,Murphy-Goode 2013 Pinot Noir (California)
"The Il Tralcetto line of wines is packaged with a real grape vine clipping looped over the neck of the bottle. Inside is a fresh and easy expression of Merlot that is redolent of cherry, raspberry and spice.",85,Cescon Italo Storia e Vini 2008 Il Tralcetto Merlot (Piave)
"There is an opulence of ripe, black fruit in this Pinot, a selection from various vineyard sources throughout the appellation. Floral in violet and rose, it offers rich cardamom-cinnamon spice and a balanced taste of cola and jam.",90,J Vineyards & Winery 2012 Barrel 16 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This is a delicious wine with fresh fruits that are crisply embedded in balanced acidity, melon and orange zest flavors. The wine has structure, minerality and a tight texture that contrasts with all this fruitiness. The finish is intense with acidity. Although the wine could be drunk now, it will be better from 2018.",93,Louis Latour 2013 La Garenne Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet)
"Here is all the right Volnay richness. The tannins give the wine a firm edge, a support for the soft, opulent center. Black berry and damson flavors are dominant, offering acidity to go with the ripe texture. Age for 5–6 years.",92,Domaine Jessiaume 2008 Brouillards Premier Cru  (Volnay)
"Stalky and light, this is a blend of Tannat, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. It has an herbaceous character that is balanced by berry fruits. It is the red berry fruitiness that dominates at the end.",85,Producteurs Plaimont 2013 Colombelle L'Originel Red (Côtes de Gascogne)
"A blend of 64% Merlot and 36% Cabernet Sauvignon, the resulting wine is complex, round and complete. Aromas and flavors of plum, leather, cured meat and spice are carried by plenty of weight, yet without seeming heavy. There's a lush, slightly creamy mouthfeel and a long, spicy finish. Delicious now, but should hold at least through 2015.",91,Henschke 2005 Abbotts Prayer Vineyard Red (Lenswood)
"Nervy and textured, this is a wine under tension. It is crisp with acidity, with lots of bright green-fruit and citrus flavors. This is complex and age worthy, bringing out the intense texture from the vineyard.",93,Domaine Vincent Girardin 2010 Perrières Premier Cru  (Meursault)
"Strong wood smoke and grilled meat aromas lead to equally assertive oak and dried herb flavors, giving this wine extreme personality. It has medium body and rather soft tannins and texture to balance.",86,Ironstone 2015 Cabernet Franc (Lodi)
"The 2008 Phoenix Cabernet displays amply concentrated notes of cherry, cassis and tobacco. There's plenty of stuffing here, with a long finish that fades slowly away to notes of dried tea leaves.",89,Penley Estate 2008 Phoenix Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra)
"Full-bodied and elegant, this opens with aromas of mature orchard fruit, crushed stone and nut. The linear, structured palate boasts more complexity than most Pinot Grigios, offering ripe pear, toasted almond, mineral and dollop of acacia honey. Drink through 2020.",91,St. Pauls 2015 Passion Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige)
"Aromas of butter, vanilla, corn silk and tropical fruit lead to barrel-forward, oak-laden pineapple flavors that intertwine through the finish. For the style, it's well done but the oak is pretty intense.",90,Columbia Crest 2015 Reserve Chardonnay (Horse Heaven Hills)
"A great mix of solid tannins and juicy fruit, this is a rich and structured wine, with the firm character of the year and deep blackberry flavor. It has weight and an edge of spice, finishing with acidity.",90,Château Vieux Robin 2010  Médoc
"Charred earth, toast, underbrush and roasted nut aromas come together on this. The palate shows the heat of the vintage, offering raisin and clove alongside close-grained tannins. Drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit.",87,Tedeschi 2015 Capitel Nicalò  (Valpolicella Superiore)
"This dessert wine offers rich aromas of spice, flowers and burnt orange/citrus, followed by opulent waves of honey, flowers and butterscotch. Pretty and a good pairing with cakes, fruit and cheeses.",86,Limnos Wines 2007 Muscat de Limnos Muscat of Alexandria (Limnos)
"Crisp and drier than this Champagne used to be, this is a fruity wine. Apples, citrus and zesty orange mingle along with the minerality that comes from the 40% Chardonnay in the blend. This is a fine apéritif style to drink now.",88,Henri Abelé NV Brut  (Champagne)
"A blend of 61% Cabernet Franc and 39% Merlot, this has scents of black fruit and green bell pepper that are characteristic of many Bordeaux-style blends, with underpinnings of savory spice and char. The full-bodied palate has a soft, chocolaty core, boasting medium-grained tannins and easy acids that lend enough lift.",86,Boxwood 2010 Topiary Red (Virginia)
"Aged in oak, this blend of Chardonnay and Insolia offers bold aromas of white rose, honey and stone fruit, with a soft, round palate. The creamy finish would pair well with a crab cake or a spicy Thai mango salad.",88,Valle dell'Acate 2010 Bidis White (Sicilia)
"This Malbec from the Vista Flores zone of the Uco Valley falls outside the box. An exotic bouquet comprised of blueberry, graham cracker, citrus peel and cardamom aromas stirs interest, while a jammy palate deals blueberry, baking spice, Middle Eastern spice and blackened flavors. This is extracted but juicy on the finish. Drink through 2018.",91,Altos Las Hormigas 2012 Appellation Malbec (Vista Flores)
"Light and steely, this wine offers mild flavors that lean tropical, like pineapple and guava. Those succulently ripe layers meet stone fruit and a medium-sized body, making for an enjoyable, food-friendly experience on the palate.",88,Clif Family 2016 Rte Blanc Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"A blend of five diverse red grapes, this lightly fruity quaffer is almost invisible as far as flavor is concerned. It hits the tongue and vanishes.",80,Agate Ridge 2007 Cascade Terrace Red Red (Rogue Valley)
"Mature peach and stone fruit, honeysuckle and pine nut come to mind as do dried Mediterranean herbs. These aromas are forthcoming and generous, but also a bit muddy on first impact, which is why this wine hasn't scored higher.",85,Ronco delle Betulle 2005 Tocai Friulano (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"This outstanding value is sharp and precise, its black-cherry fruit holding down a compact core, annotated with streaks of coffee, truffle and chocolate. It punches well above its price, and should drink nicely into the early 2020s.",91,de Lancellotti 2014 La Sorella Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Ripe, round, soft and juicy, this is already attractive and drinkable. It has firm tannins, yet these are cushioned by the sweet black fruits and the lift from the acids. Drink now, or hold this for another year.",87,Abbaye de Saint-Ferme 2009 Vieilles Vignes  (Bordeaux Supérieur)
"Herbal and slightly bitter, this does bring some dark fruit flavors of black cherry and cassis into play. The finish has a slightly burnt character and a hint of rubber.",84,Kana 2009 Tempranillo (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The fruit is the star here, ripe and round. Flavors are a nice mix of orange, apple and pear, with a light dusting of baking spices. This is drinking at its freshest peak.",88,Mahonia 2013 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
"From the home of Touriga Nacional, this is a seriously structured wine. Packed with tannins as well as initially austere fruit, it is still young. It will develop its perfumed black fruits and acidity as it ages to fill out the dense texture. Drink from 2018.",90,Magnum Vinhos 2012 Ribeiro Santo Touriga Nacional (Dão)
"Made with native grape Insolia, this savory wine has floral aromas of jasmine and orange blossom as well as a distinct nutty sensation. The palate offers lemon-lime and restrained tropical fruit alongside fresh acidity.",87,Terre di Giurfo 2013 Suliccenti Insolia (Vittoria)
"Clos Apalta continues to push the envelope for Chilean icon wines. It's always been a blend of four or five Bordeaux grapes, and the 2005 is every bit as structured, tight and ripe as any predecessor. There is an intense blanket of new oak that tastes of mint, cinnamon, sawdust and black licorice. When that subsides (maybe in another 12 months), expect racy and complex berry flavors, pinpoint tannins and preserving acidity. Hold for another two years; then drink through 2014.",94,Lapostolle 2005 Clos Apalta Red (Colchagua Valley)
"The Rolle grape (known as Vermentino in nearby Corsica) has the ability to produce rich wine, as it did here. The acidity is still there balanced with the ripe yellow fruits, generous texture and spicy southern warmth. This is a wine for food, ready to drink now.",88,Hecht & Bannier 2015 Rolle (Côtes de Provence)
"Made with equal parts Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this opens with aromas of red berry, mint and a whiff of kitchen spice. The forward palate delivers black currant, graphite, licorice and tobacco alongside firm, polished tannins. Best 2016–2019.",90,Poggio Scalette 2012 Capogatto Red (Alta Valle della Greve)
"A well-balanced off-dry Vouvray. It has almond as well as ripe pear and apple flavors, laced with the acidity of 2010, although never losing its delicate sweetness. This should age for 3–4 years. Screwcap.",88,Château Moncontour 2010 Demi-Sec  (Vouvray)
"Stoan is a bright white blend from northeast Italy that shows balance, freshness and intensity. Long aromas of stone fruit, melon, tangerine skin and white almond set the tone. The wine performs beautifully in the mouth thanks to its soft texture.",90,Tramin 2011 Stoan White (Alto Adige)
"This opens with blue flower, herb and dark-skinned berry aromas. The palate is lean, offering sour cherry fruit and a hint of star anise, set against tightly wound, austere tannins that leave a drying finish.",86,Vecchia Cantina di Montepulciano 2013  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano
"Big and sultry as always, with bacon, smoke, black fruit and a full rack of spices making for a wonderful bouquet. Concentrated and ripped for a 2007, with blackberry, clove, pepper, cinnamon and vanilla flavors. And then comes tobacco and more spice on the finish, which is grabby but understandable because it's so young. Best from 2012 through 2019.",93,Emilio Moro 2007 Malleolus de Valderramiro  (Ribera del Duero)
"Extremely thick, soft and extracted, this delivers flavors of ripe fruit, cinnamon stick, honey, barbecue sauce, cured meat and dried apple skin. Savory tones of leather and button mushroom show up later.",88,Giuseppe Lonardi 2008  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"Soft, floral and fruity, this is a rounded wine with a gentle texture, yellow fruits and light acidity. There is a good touch of spice to fill the wine out right at the end.",84,Vieil Armand 2013 Tradition Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
"Made with Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon in equal parts, this opens with aromas of red berry, leather and tobacco. The juicy approachable palate doles out black cherry, vanilla, toast and graphite alongside fine-grained tannins.",90,Altesino 2013 Alte d'Altesi Red (Toscana)
"Strawberry and raspberry aromas are mild. This simple blend of Garnacha and Tempranillo feels grabby and rubbery, while salty baked-plum flavors finish with notes of herbs and mint.",85,Bodegas Paniza 2015 Garnacha-Tempranillo (Cariñena)
"Opens with oily, hard aromas of peanut brittle and resin. After it airs out, it's lively in the mouth and grabby, with resiny, bitter notes mixing with core citrus flavors. Zesty but pithy on the finish.",84,Tilia 2010 Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"89-91 A balanced and structured wine that shows fine acidity, berry fruits and dashing acidity. With the balance already there, it is developing well in barrel, promising a stylish wine down the road.",90,Château Franc Mayne 2010 Barrel sample  (Saint-Émilion)
"A typically huge Colomé wine with initial damp, murky, funky aromas that give way to earth, roasted fruit and compost. Fortunately it's fresher in the mouth, and the wine definitely improves with airing. Still, the palate is big and oily, with roasted berry, herb and wild, exotic flavors. A unique style of Malbec from old Calchaquí vines.",89,Colomé 2008 Estate Malbec (Calchaquí Valley)
"Crisp, apple-flavored and touched by citrus, this is light and toasty. The finish is dry, fruity and fresh. Ready to drink.",84,Le Grand Courtage NV Grande Cuvée Blanc de Blancs Brut Sparkling (Vin Mousseux)
"From an extremely coastal 13-acre vineyard in Bonny Doon that was replanted in 2005, this wine shows black-cherry jelly candies on the nose alongside wild mint, white sage and black olive. The palate is more asphalt and tar-laden, but with blueberry, violet and uncrushed peppercorn flavors that make it quite tasty.",90,Beauregard 2012 Beauregard Ranch Zinfandel (Ben Lomond Mountain)
"Aromas of lemon curd and citrus blossom come with a hint of pine. This feels lemony and narrow, with a tight body that's showing little to no give. Nectarine, citrus and green-melon flavors are fresh prior to a dry citrusy finish.",88,Rosa Nautica 2016 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"This special vineyard selection offers depth and personality in the form of black stone, granite, balsam, cola, mature blackberry and background renderings of spice and toast. It's among the most flavor-rich Brunellos of the vintage with pretty tones of cherry fruit and chewy density.",90,PianCornello 2003 Piancornello  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"White blossoms and peaches perfume this unusually zesty Viognier. Dry and delicately framed, it's balances crisp, cutting acidity against sunny citrus flavors. It's an easy, refreshing wine with a moderately long finish.",87,Bedell 2013 Viognier (North Fork of Long Island)
"Marrying cranberry fruit to a stiff, herbal spine, this offers sensory highlights of hemp, thyme and oregano. Though reticent aromatically, this wine earns your interest with its nicely-threaded herbal elements and substantial, albeit stiff, finish.",91,Bergström 2013 Croft Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Dusty minerals, pollen and spice notes lend complexity to this honey-toned auslese. The palate is decadently sweet, glazed in caramelized sugar and heaving with ripe cantaloupe and peach flavors. A bite of lemon-lime acidity offsets all the opulence, lending edge to a long, lingering finish.",92,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler 2015 Bernkasteler Badstube Auslese Riesling (Mosel)
"This comes from a popular vineyard in the Los Alamos Valley, and offers nose-tingling aromas of black pepper, tar and a slightly sour take on purple fruit. It's not as exciting as some of the winery's other wines, but still serves as a solid take on the grape, mixing ripe fruit, crushed herbs and brown spice.",88,Jaffurs 2012 Thompson Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara)
"Sweet cherry and vanilla aromas are most noticeable in this soft, juicy Cab, with streaks of cassis playfully integrated throughout. Dry tannins and diesel oak build up steam on the finish, which is medium in length.",86,Hanna 2012 Red Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Tropical vanilla and pineapple notes provide this full-bodied wine with voluptuous fruit and texture. That ripeness finds its equilibrium on the midpalate, settling down into lemon peel and quince highlights that finish bright.",90,Sleeping Giant 2014 Las Amigas Partners Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Orange and mandarin flavors mark this warm, full-bodied wine. It's forward and fruity, showing a sweeter character, with vanilla and spice tones. Drink soon.",86,Domaine Rieflé 2008 Steinert Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"here too many Pinot Grigios are sweet and sugary, this one's dry, and it has a crisp acidity that makes the mouth water. The flavors are of ripe Meyer lemons, limes, minerals, honeysuckle flowers and vanilla. Great with Asian-fusion fare.",86,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi 2007 Pinot Grigio (California)
"You'll find tons of blackberry, cherry, raspberry, orange zest, chocolate and spice flavors in this dry wine, but it's no mere fruit store. With polished tannins and fine Carneros acidity, it achieves an elegant balance. Drink now.",90,Schug 2005 Heritage Reserve Merlot (Carneros)
"A powerful wine that has integrated its dense tannins with its equally impressive fruit. Blackberry jelly and spice mingle around a firm, dry core mingle in this concentrated, ageworthy wine. Drink now or keep for 4–5 years.",91,Château Saint-Didier-Parnac 2009 Prieuré de Cénac Mission Malbec-Merlot (Cahors)
"Made with organically farmed grapes, this opens with subtle aromas of red berry, clove and blue flower. The easy drinking palate offers black cherry, mint and a hint of anise alongside polished tannins and racy acidity.",88,Feudo di Santa Tresa 2013  Cerasuolo di Vittoria Classico
"Velvety and rich aromas of chocolate and dried plums are cut with a citrus tartness on the nose of this single-vineyard expression from a historic site near the Gilroy Golf Course. The refreshing if slightly reductive palate offers flavors of espresso and blueberry-crusted beef, enlivening the tongue before washing away.",88,Sarah's Vineyard 2010 Besson Vineyard Syrah (Santa Clara Valley)
"This is a solid, fruity Merlot, appealing with cherry jam and red currant flavors, housed in firm mountain tannins. There's a good cut of acidity for tackling rich beef dishes. Drink now.",87,Kenwood 2010 Jack London Vineyard Merlot (Sonoma Mountain)
"Made in the Pride style, this is a big, powerful wine that should age well. It's enormously ripe, with flamboyant cassis, cherry pie filling, milk chocolate, licorice and smoky oak flavors that are wrapped into thoroughly modern, softly refined tannins. Just beautiful, and should develop through 2012.",93,Pride Mountain 2006 Merlot (Sonoma-Napa)
"Innovative and luminous, this 50-50 blend of Vermentino and Verdicchio shows heady aromas of tropical fruit and white flower. Vibrant acidity balances juicy pear, peach and a citrusy note before the crisp, clean finish.",87,Falesco 2014 Vitiano White (Umbria)
"This volatile, sharp-toned wine barely makes the cut. Those who are particularly sensitive to scents of nail-polish remover may wish to steer clear. Despite relatively low alcohol and high sugar, it burns a bit in the finish.",81,San Juan Vineyards 2012 Chardonnay (Yakima Valley)
"Yellow in color and waxy on the nose, this Viura is on the heavy amorphous side, with some burn to the palate. Bland flavors of green fruits are vacuous on the finish.",84,Urbina 2015 Viura (Rioja)
"Here's a Conero Riserva from the estate's San Lorenzo vineyard that holds back nicely in terms of its aromatic intensity and delivers a drinkable, elegant experience instead. The mouthfeel is clean and polished with sweet cherry flavors backed by Asian spice.",89,Umani Ronchi 2004 Cúmaro Riserva  (Conero)
Moderate alcohol brings a streamlined elegance to a variety that can be blowsy. The acidity and minerality firmly ground the tropical fruit flavors.,90,Zotovich Cellars 2012 Estate Grown Viognier (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Too oaky, with buttered toast and vanilla swamping the underlying pineapple fruit. The malolactic fermentation has added buttered popcorn notes. An over-manipulated wine made to appeal to the popular style.",84,Rutherford Hill 2009 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"The nose is very quiet but the body emanates a generosity despite its lightness. There is red-cherry fruit and a certain ampleness on a slender, fresh body. Tannins are like barely-there linens. The finish is wonderfully clean.",89,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2014 Réserve Pinot Noir (Alsace)
"Everything about this Chardonnay speaks of class. It's dry and superbly structured in acids and tannins, and shows a chalky minerality that lends substance to the tropical fruit and honeysuckle flavors. Two Sisters is assembling a great track record with this bottling.",92,Two Sisters 2010 Courtney's Vineyard Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Dusty mineral and bramble notes contrast sunny, sweet yellow peach and melon flavors in this brisk semidry Riesling. It's forward and fruity, finishing with a lingering, lacy sweetness. Not likely to improve, so drink now.",86,Johann Falkenburg 2014 Riesling (Rheinhessen)
"Brisk acidity, dried herbs, green olives, white pepper and minerals add complexity and earthiness to the raspberry, cherry and cola flavors of this Zin. It's dry on the finish, and stylish enough to accompany fine steaks and rich cheeses, with of course plenty of crusty bread.",89,Quivira 2011 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"Green pear and Granny Smith apple notes signal lightness and easy refreshment. The frothy mousse swirls the almost weightless body and brings out all the freshness. This is easy and uncomplicated, but superclean and invigorating.",90,Hubert Meyer NV Pinot Blanc (Crémant d'Alsace)
"Rusty in color, this wine features aromas of compost, juniper and a touch of floral red fruit. It comes on strong in the mouth, with a leafy, rustic dried-cherry flavor, before feeling hard and tannic.",81,Region 1 2010 Malbec (Mendoza)
"Spicy, dry aromas of earth, red currant and black olive offer some complexity and style. This is full bodied, racy and loaded with black cherry, cassis and peppery spice flavors. A touch of heat and menthol adds jolt to the finish.",88,Sottano 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Pink-orange in color, this is a tangy, high-acid wine that's not for everyone, given its bracing mix of tangerine and grapefruit. Light-bodied, yet textured, it's a good quaffer and food-friendly companion.",88,Merriam 2015 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This sums up what Marlborough can do well when it comes to Pinot Noir. Bright cherry fruit is a bit simple, but crisp and appealing, lined with toasty oak elements and finishing long and fruity.",88,Tohu 2013 Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
"From the former Ashley's Vineyard, which the Parker family sold a few years ago, comes this tough, acidic young wine. It shows a maritime influence in the dry tartness and bitter cherryskin flavors. Could be a sleeper.",88,Fess Parker 2006 Clone 115 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Toasted oak and vanilla are noticeably present on the palate and nose of this wine, which evolves in the glass to take on a more tropical feel and tastes of ripe pineapple and guava. Medium to light in texture, it finishes smoothly and flat.",86,Sonoma-Cutrer 2013 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"In cooler vintages like 2007, this white blend from Bodegas Naia excels. It gets going with pear, apple and light, leesy aromas in front of a citrusy palate that is a knock-off for varietal Sauvignon Blanc. Flavors of grapefruit, lime and gooseberry should be familiar, and the crisp fresh-lettuce finish is a winner. Good stuff for the money.",88,Naia 2007 Las Brisas White (Rueda)
Rich perfumes reach the nose: quince and baked apple give a seductive tone. The palate strikes with the same richness but is dry. There is concentration and earthy power against a backdrop of freshness and fruity charm.,90,Domaine Gresser 2014 Wiebelsberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"There's a serious side to this impressive wine, with its toast and biscuit flavors layered on top of apple acidity. It has richness as well as crispness, and a depth of flavor which promises some bottle aging potential. One of the best sparkling Vouvrays.",90,Château Moncontour 2004 Cuvée Prédilection  (Vouvray)
"Potent and intense, this has a dark red color that goes to the rim and exotic huckleberry and dark cherry aromas. Thick layers of fruit, dark chocolate and spice on the palate combine with firm, framing tannins and acidity for a lip-smacking finish. It will get better with age through at least 2018.",88,Alder Springs 2012 Row Five Red Cuvée Red (Mendocino)
"This most appealing Chardonnay offers a deluxe display of Meyer lemon, baked pear and toasted marshmallow flavors in a ripe and creamy style. That lush core is focused and framed with ample acidity, and suggests a decade (at least) of life ahead. Drink now through 2026.",94,Domaine Serene 2013 Etoile Vineyard Chardonnay (Dundee Hills)
"This vibrant Chianti Classico has ripe strawberry and raspberry aromas with hints of violet. The palate shows delicious red cherry layered with white pepper and a hint of chocolate, all in a fresh and supple style.",92,Castello di Verrazzano 2010  Chianti Classico
"This is a full, ripe wine. The rich red berry fruits contrast well with the crisp acidity and bright aftertaste. The wine is packed with fruit and ready to drink.",86,Quinta do Sagrado 2015 Sagrado Rosé (Douro)
"This is a wine that packs a lot of substance, although it has deliciously upfront flavors of cherries and berries. There's a meatiness to the palate that adds depth and interest, while crisp acidity defines the flavors on the palate. Textbook Santa Lucia Highlands Pinot Noir, fruity, complex and silky.",88,Testarossa 2001 Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"This Harlequin has a faint scent of lemon liqueur that's offset by a white pepper note. The medium-weight palate offers a lemon blossom hint, and it finishes on the short side.",84,Veritas 2011 Harlequin Reserve Chardonnay (Monticello)
"Enticing and smoky hints of lime zest mixed with green pear hit the nose immediately. On the palate, even more fruit follows: A mix of green and yellow pear, with some apricot coming through as well. The rounded, rich mouthfeel is prevented from any undue plumpness by vivid acidity and a tingling, peppery finish. Drink 2014–2020.",91,Pratsch 2012 Steinberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"Kathleen Inman has gained such a following with her Rosé that she's given it a special designation, a nod to her happy marriage. Made in a direct-press style, the dry, refreshing wine is light salmon in color and marked by aromatic grapefruit and strawberry, mouthfilling and juicy as a slice of watermelon in summer.",92,Inman Family 2013 Endless Crush Rosé of Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This is a GSM blend from a single vineyard, Lonesome Springs. Tobacco and vanilla scents merge into a midpalate with light red fruits. The acidity and smooth tannins keep it clean and tasty through the finish.",89,DaMa 2009 DaMaNation G-S-M (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This appellation remains a standout for the variety, as evidenced by this 100% varietal wine that's mouthwatering in stone fruit and cantaloupe flavors. The aromatics center around pretty jasmine and lime zest aromas, while the palate is structured, crisp and fruity, all in good measure.",90,Matanzas Creek 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Bennett Valley)
"A thin peach nose is the initial impression, followed by good balance on the palate and a decent mouthfeel. Then comes the finish, however, where we detect signs of early oxidation",81,Belmondo 1999 Pinot Grigio (Oltrepò Pavese)
"This wine is aromatically expressive, with notes of apple juice and lees, seeming to show some oxygen exposure. It's full in feel, with sweet apple flavors on the finish.",82,Original House Wine NV Chardonnay (America)
"Rustic leather and balsamic notes juxtapose vanilla, chocolate and spice in this complex, powerful Cabernet Franc. The palate is anchored in rich, ripe black plum and cherry flavors, bolstered by dense, mouth dampening tannins. It's a brooding but nuanced wine that should improve through 2020 and likely beyond.",90,Ventosa 2012 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes)
"). Very good wine from a winery increasingly known for its red varieties, and one of the best Cabernets ever to hail from this appellation. It shows a dry, distinguished tannin structure and the concentration of flavors typical of this warm, low-yielding region, with black currant intensity. Give it a decant and drink over the next six years.",92,Mauritson 2009 Rockpile Ridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rockpile)
"Always a joy to drink, the latest vintage of DDO's Arthur combines richness and elegance in a seamless and fascinating whole. Cucumber and melon, apple and pear fruit is the base, which expands into wet stone and mineral, then butter cookie. It's a one-wine seminar in how to make great Chardonnay, expressing the acid-driven elegance of Burgundy with some of the lushness of New World grapes. Tasted even better on the second day.",91,Domaine Drouhin Oregon 2007 Arthur Chardonnay (Dundee Hills)
"75% Syrah and 25% Cinsault from the oldest continually cultivated vinifera vineyard in the Walla Walla Valley. The spicy, intensely aromatic nose mixes black cherry, concentrated cassis, coffee, bacon, leather and roasted nuts. It unfolds in layer upon layer of rich fruit, tannin, leather and smoke. Dense, deep and Rhône-like, it finishes with a montage of meaty, peppery, bacon-smoke flavors.",93,Glen Fiona 1997 Basket Press Reserve Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Light copper-pink in color, this vineyard-designate shows a wealth of peach and orange flavors that combine to refreshing effect. Lightly made in a bright accessible style, the wine offers a moderate body weight and texture that's pleasing on the palate.",90,Parmeson 2016 Wildcat Mountain Vineyard Rosé of Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Aromas recall stewed dark fruit, coffee, clove and toasted oak. The palate delivers plum, woodland berry, mocha, vanilla and a confectionary note alongside bracing tannins. It's still tight and tannic so give it time to unwind. Drink 2017–2022.",89,Tenute Silvio Nardi 2010  Brunello di Montalcino
"An attractively light-textured wine, this has a red currant flavor backed by juicy acidity. It is forward and fruity; with its gentle tannins, this is ready to drink.",86,Vignoble des 2 Lunes 2009 Périgée Pinot Noir (Alsace)
"Big, rich and painted in broad brush strokes, San Martino is a meaty, fleshy wine you can sink your teeth into. It offers clean notes of cherry candy, licorice and resin and follows through with gritty texture and crisp notes of bright fruit on the close.",90,Villa Cafaggio 2001 San Martino Sangiovese (Toscana)
"Dark berry, blue flower and French oak are some of the aromas you'll find on this. The bright, easygoing palate offers Morello cherry, vanilla and coffee alongside firm acidity and limber tannins.",87,Agostina Pieri 2014  Rosso di Montalcino
"While often ignored in favor of its more famous countryman (Riesling), Silvaner offers a freshness and purity of green fruit and herb that's delightful. This dry, yet lusciously full-bodied bottling is particularly rich in texture, glimmering with ripe green plums and yellow cherries. Fresh lime acidity brightens the midpalate leading a long, slightly chalky finish.",93,Schmitt's Kinder 2014 Randersackerer Pfülben GG Trocken Silvaner (Franken)
"This is quite a value for the quality, a stellar, medium-bodied, restrained wine that's high-toned and elusive at first aromatically. But it opens in the glass, delighting in blackberry, cherry and a burst of clove, showing skill in winemaking from a blend of vineyards, some valley floor and others mountain.",94,Davies 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This boasts tiny portions of Teroldego, Merlot and Croatina that give the wine a soft, lush disposition. Some 42 months of oak aging also add to the palate's overall silkiness. Flavors of chocolate, cherry, plum, tar, resin and licorice are all recognizable.",91,Eleva 2005 Piovesole  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"Herbal aromas of cut grass, bell pepper and tomato vine mingle with suggestions of ripe pineapple and stone fruit. A 50-50 blend of Chardonnay and Sauvignon, the rich palate delivers baked Golden Delicious apple, mature apricot, tangerine zest and candied lemon drop. A mineral note closes the lingering finish.",92,Vie di Romans 2012 Dut'Un White (Venezia Giulia)
"Young, tight and sharp, showing lots of black currant, along with pepper and spice. Maybe just a notch below the excellent 2004 L'Etalon Red. Tasted twice over a six month period, the wine remains stubbornly tough and chewy, despite appealing chocolaty spice and penetrating raspberry/currant fruit.",89,Brian Carter Cellars 2005 L'Etalon Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Fleshy black plum and cherry flavors are offset by leafy, green layers of herb and stem in this luscious but balanced red blend. Its intense fruitiness makes it approachable and juicy but crisp acidity and fine penetrating tannins keep things in check. Drink now through 2021.",88,Kontokosta 2012 Anemometer Red (North Fork of Long Island)
"This wine brings spicy cranberry and strawberry, underscored with a whiff of leather. Flavors punch down and finish strong, with a leathery note that does not preclude the solid fruit.",90,Quintet 2013 Ribbon Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge)
Three years aging have softened the tight acidity of this wine and given it a rounded and creamy character. It still has great freshness and a light touch of apple and crisp grapefruit. Drink this attractive wine now.,85,Domaine de Beauregard 2012 Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"Cherry and cassis aromas come across as generic, not spicy, complex or particular. This Cab Franc is aggressive and tannic as it spreads out, with ripe berry, caramel and burnt brown-sugar flavors. Additional caramel sweetness joins chocolaty heat on a ripe finish.",88,Maquis 2012 Cabernet Franc (Colchagua Valley)
"Smoky berry aromas come with notes of rubber band and earth. A chunky, full-bodied, rubbery-feeling palate comes next, followed by herbal flavors of blackberry and blueberry. Prune, blueberry and hard spice flavors finish in Bordeaux style.",86,Bodega NQN 2011 Picada 15 Malbec (Patagonia)
"At almost half Cabernet Franc (49%), this is slightly leafier than what most producers are pulling out of the Gimblett Gravels. The balance is Cabernet Sauvignon (39%), with small amounts of Merlot (9%) and Malbec (3%). The tobacco, chocolate and cassis notes are carried by medium body and a firm, dry texture. Drink 2019–2030.",92,Trinity Hill 2014 The Gimblett Gimblett Gravels Red (Hawke's Bay)
"Smells a lot like fresh celery and/or asparagus, with vibrant green fruit aromas and lettuce thrown in for good measure. Juicy in the mouth, with apple, citrus and green veggie flavors. Turns more vegetal the longer it goes, but freshness and acidity keep it on a solid plane.",84,Carlos Basso 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Mendoza)
"Cherry, strawberry and baking spices combine in this medium-bodied wine that offers texture and soft, supple layers of refreshing acidity.",88,Pacific Heights Wines 2015 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"The namesake comedy may have its fans, but this selection leaves a bit more to be desired. It's a lean, aggressively green wine that even includes hints of pickled jalapeño.",82,Twelfth Night 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Made by Angelo Gaja at his estate in coastal Tuscany, this blend of 50% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc leads with aromas of plum, spice and warm toasted notes. The structured, elegant palate delivers restrained black currant and black cherry accented with notes of black pepper and coffee alongside polished tannins. It's still young and a bit nervous, so give it time to develop its potential. Drink 2015–2030.",93,Ca' Marcanda 2010 Camarcanda  (Bolgheri)
"Ripe blackberry and spice aromas are a touch meaty and earthy but mostly straightforward. A grabby, fleshy palate is obtuse but still balanced, while this tastes of berry and cassis, which are textbook flavors for Cabernet Sauvignon. A dry, woody finish with a chocolate note renders this better than most for $20.",92,Lucatoni 2013 Grand Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"The fig, licorice and spice aromas seem somewhat dried out and tired. The cherry and cranberry flavors are smooth, with the tannins showing some grit. Drink now.",86,Chateau Rollat 2011 Rollat Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Expansive on the palate, with lively acidity, this is robust, ripe and complex. Its powerful core of strawberry-rhubarb fruit is layered with forest pine, rose, and crushed rock notes, the texture velvety thick but balanced.",94,Siduri 2015 Betty Ann Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This semi-sweet wine is dark in color, full bodied, peppery in aroma, and full of berry flavors on the palate. A thick texture coats the mouth with jammy sensations that slowly recede on the finish.",87,Gnarly Head 2015 1924 Limited Edition Double Black Red (California)
"The producer's proprietary red Bordeaux-inspired blend is austere in this vintage, offering herbal thyme and cedar along with a sharp element of pencil lead. Medium bodied, the texture is velvety and lingering on the palate.",87,V. Sattui 2011 Paradiso Red (Napa Valley)
"Inviting aromas of dark-skinned fruit, blue flower, leather and a whiff of baking spice waft out of the glass. The firm juicy palate offers ripe wild cherry, licorice and hint of charcuterie while assertive, seasoned tannins provide support. Drink through 2021.",90,Cerbaia 2011  Brunello di Montalcino
"There's a wheaty, stalky quality to the nose, then citrus flavors, zesty acidity and finally another wave of stalky character to the palate. Orange and tangerine flavors drive the finish, which has more than enough acidity to not break down.",87,Fulget 2012 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"A wine with light tannins and juicy red fruits. Though the acidity is prominent, it has a soft texture and attractive strawberry fruit flavors. Not for aging.",85,De Mour 2009 Duc de Rochebois  (Bordeaux)
"Candied cherry, cola, wild mint and anise swirl into a layered nose on this wine by a duo of relatively new winemakers, Ian Sergy and Zach Jarosz. Light coffee, clove-spiced berry juice and cinnamon-cherry flavors are on the heavily brown-spiced palate.",91,Archium 2012 Haven Grenache (Santa Ynez Valley)
"This is a full-bodied and extroverted wine. It smells like melted butter and baking spices and tastes like nougat and caramel with just a touch of sweetness. Oaky in a moderate way, it offers great citrus and pineapple on the midpalate and a lingering finish.",91,Bogle 2014 Reserve Chardonnay (Clarksburg)
"This limited release is big and flavorful upfront, with assertive aromas of sweet spice, clementine, tropical fruit and blanched almonds. A fleshy pear flavor leads the round, mouth-filling palate, followed by a lengthy finish laced with notes of hazelnut toast and sweet spice. Ready to drink now.",88,Leopard Frog NV Spellbinding Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch)
"Totally fresh, this is crisp and packed with citrus. A complex, tight texture brings out nervy acidity, a strongly mineral character and a firm structure. Age this youthful wine and drink from 2018.",91,Pascal Bouchard 2013 Montmains Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"This is a textbook Deep Purple special: huge berry, menthol and violet aromas create a hefty, lusty bouquet. In the mouth, it is more narrow than you might hope for, with staunch tartaric acidity. Jammy berry flavors are big but standard, as is the finish. Drink through 2018.",89,VinEcol 2009 Los Medanos Reserva Malbec (Mendoza)
"This blend of 48% Roussanne, 35% Marsanne and 17% Viognier is delightfully drinkable, viscous and fresh in steely acidity. With beautifully potent floral aromas, it shines in focused pear and apricot flavors.",93,Davis Family 2015 Cuvée Luke Saralee's Vineyard White (Russian River Valley)
"A simple, fruit-forward rosé ideal for summer sipping, this blend of Syrah and Grenache boasts attractive mixed berry, melon and citrus aromas, with flavors that finish clean and dry.",87,Marrenon 2014 Grande Toque Rosé (Luberon)
"With its pure, clean scents and flavors of green apple, lime and mineral, slightly creamy texture and long, mouthwatering finish, this nearly dry Riesling offers a lot to like. No, it's not that complex, but it is admirably concentrated and eminently satisfying. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",87,Köster-Wolf 2006 Trocken Riesling (Rheinhessen)
"This is two thirds Chardonnay and the rest a Viognier/Roussanne blend. There is something a little off-putting in the aromas, a hint of volatility and sweatiness. In the mouth it is a simple, generic dry white.",83,Kontos 2009 LeeVeLooLee Gossamer White (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This gutsy blend of two-thirds Zinfandel plus Syrah and Tempranillo has a deep color, fresh spicy oak aromas, vivid fruit flavors and a lip-smacking layer of fine tannin. It should be just the thing with a grilled steak or pulled pork.",89,Lake and Vine Cellars 2012 Red (Lake County)
"Enticing aromas of blue flower, ripe berry, leather and a hint of baking spice meld together. The juicy, delicious palate offers ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, clove and ground pepper. Firm, velvety tannins support the succulent fruit.",94,Azelia 2012 San Rocco  (Barolo)
"This wine's elevated—for a fruchtig German Riesling—alcohol level (11.5%) and botrytis-influenced flavors of dried apricots and orange marmalade suggest early consumption, although some may want to see if it settles down in another five years. It's fat, oily and rich right now, and a bit warming on the finish.",90,Schloss Johannisberger 2006 Spätlese Grünlack Riesling (Rheingau)
"Great nutty aromas come from the glass and follow into the palate of this sweeter style of white Port. It is rich, packed with almonds and a tangy orange zest edge.",86,Ramos-Pinto NV White Reserva  (Port)
"With a soft, silky mouthfeel and a great big burst of black pepper, this is a classic Sonoma Zin. It's ripe in blackberries and currants, with a briary taste of anise and wild chamomile. Good now with barbecue.",87,Four Vines 2009 The Sophisticate Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
"There is good density here. The wine has spice and dark tannins, the wood integrated with the maturing black fruits. The tannins are still firm, so decant before drinking.",86,Château Cabredon 2004  Premieres Côtes de Bordeaux
"Aromas of bath soap and apple come in front of a creamy, round, oily palate. Honeydew, date and vanilla flavors make for a ripe set of flavors, while toast and caramel notes come up on the finish.",85,Santa Carolina 2014 Reserva Chardonnay (Leyda Valley)
"Pink in color, this fruity, spicy wine conveys a juicy red currant fruit character. Clean and fresh, it's packed with fruitiness and topped by intense acidity.",84,Château Laulerie 2014  Bergerac Rosé
Light aromas of fig and spice lead to well-balanced fruit flavors that draw out on the finish. Some additional time in the bottle should serve it well. Give it until late 2018.,90,L'Ecole No. 41 2016 Estate Grown Luminesce Seven Hills Vineyard Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"An elegant wine, its acidity showing through balanced black berry fruits. The wine has good spice along with a dry core of light tannins.",87,C. da Silva 2004 Presidential Late Bottled Vintage  (Port)
"This high-toned, lovely wine is a best-of blend from several vineyards—primarily Ritchie and Banfield. Sugar pie apple and fig flavors form a robustly concentrated fruitiness that's ribbed with vibrant minerality. A clarified butter-like creaminess comes through on the finish.",96,Arista 2014 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Blended with 6% Marsanne, the aromas are light (considering the appellation and producer), bringing notes of herb, smoked meat, white pepper, mineral and earth. The flavors are tart and bright, creating a real sense of freshness and vibrancy.",92,Reynvaan Family Vineyards 2014 Estate The Contender In the Rocks Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This is 58% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Malbec and 8% Syrah. The influence of 18 months in oak is showing strongly, though some very pretty raspberry candy flavors come through also. Give it extra breathing time to help balance it out.",89,Ryan Patrick 2010 Rock Island Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Savory saffron and pollen notes juxtapose pure, luscious apricot and tangerine in this laser-edged spätlese. Its juicy, sweet-tart flavors are piercing but the texture is dancingly delicate. While delightfully youthful now, it's structured enough to deepen its mineral complexities through at least 2025.",93,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch) 2014 Berncasteler Doctor Spätlese Gold Cap Riesling (Mosel)
"This blend of Chardonnay (70%) and Sauvignon opens with a touch of bitter almond followed by peach, apricot and pineapple. Warm climate characteristics of smooth, creamy fruit are definitely evident in this white wine from coastal Tuscany.",86,Jacopo Biondi-Santi 2011 Braccale White (Toscana)
"Vibrant and structured, it has aromas of flint, brimstone, lemon zest and grapefruit, all of which carry over to the palate alongside racy acidity. The bright, juicy palate is accented with energizing mineral that add depth.",90,Cantine di Marzo 2011 Scipio  (Greco di Tufo)
"Hovering easily between red-fruit flavors and a more mature wood-aged taste, this is a smooth Port. It is dominated by a rich texture, both juicy and spicy with a smoky hint.",90,Niepoort 2001 Colheita  (Port)
"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of blue flower, mature black fruit and subtle oak. The ripe, one-dimensional palate offers fleshy black cherry, coffee, espresso and oak. It closes on an astringent, tannic note.",88,Vèscine 2009 Lodolaio Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"Made with organically grown grapes, this juicy Rosso boasts sensations of tilled earth, violet, crushed black cherry, red currants and graphite. It's savory, fresh and unpretentious.",88,Salcheto 2013  Rosso di Montepulciano
"Rich enough to drink now, this is dryish, crisply acidic and creamy, with pineapple sour candy and butterscotch flavors.",87,Olabisi 2010 Chappell Vineyard Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"One of the rare vineyards which can produce Grand Cru Sylvaner, Zotzenberg's chalk soil gives a mineral while juicy and fresh wine. The lightest hint of spice gives the wine some weight, and the ripe, fruity apples and creamed pear are already delicious. Not for aging.",90,Boeckel 2012 Zotzenberg Grand Cru Sylvaner (Alsace)
"A perfectly fine, full-bodied red wine. Dry and tannic, it has ripe cherry and some overripe raisin and prune notes, wrapped into fancy tannins. Drink now.",86,Monticello Vineyards 2006 Estate Grown Merlot (Oak Knoll District)
"You may or may not fancy the blue bottle, but the juice inside is a good example of Yakima Valley Riesling. Tea, honey and lemon flavors are co-mingled; and the 5% residual sugar adds sweetness without becoming grainy or cloying.",87,Hyatt 2007 Riesling (Rattlesnake Hills)
"A crowd-pleasing Chardonnay aromatically suggestive of candied fruit and dried apricot, it offers a healthy dose of minerality amidst a well-composed structure. Striking the right balance between fleshy and firm, it'll go well with just about anything.",89,Concannon 2012 Reserve Chardonnay (Livermore Valley)
"This wine is based on Sangiovese, with a tiny splash of Cabernet Sauvignon, and it's aged for 12 months in old and new oak barrels. It shows a savory side, with notes of candied fruit, prune, raisin and smoked meat. Drink now.",88,Viticcio 2008 Lucius Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"Pungent and grassy on the nose, with a strong nettle and green herb character. The palate is soft and playful, with pithy white fruit flavors and then a soda-like dry finish. Plump, wayward and a bit green overall.",84,Reina de Castilla 2009 Sauvignon (Rueda)
"Notes of earth mix with notes of leafy apple on the nose, the dry, fresh palate continues in that earthy vein and finishes dry with a bruised apple flavor.",88,Dopff Au Moulin 2013 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"This wine makes a big impression with wild, earthy aromas and dense, fruit-laden flavors. It blends ripe plum, smoke, tart blackberry and rich black cherry notes on a base of firm tannins and fresh acidity. These are rich, complex and carry through to the lingering finish. It's made from 85% Mourvèdre, plus Syrah, Grenache and Counoise.",90,Holly's Hill 2013 Patriarche Red (El Dorado)
"A fresh and lively style of Rioja, with red-fruit aromas leading straight to a no-issues palate full of ripe plum and cherry flavors. The wine is uncomplicated, smooth and even a little chocolaty.",89,Lar de Paula 2003 Crianza  (Rioja)
"Very rich and classically structured, a wine that shows real Merlot personality. The red cherry, cola, red licorice, sandalwood and peppery spice flavors are almost Pinot Noir-like, except for the tannins, which have the weight of Bordeaux. Should develop through 2012.",91,Coho 2006 Michael Black Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Kuwal is a Tempranillo-led blend that's ripe and structured. Cassis, plum and toasty aromas are heady and introduce a big, ripe palate with round tannins, harmony and flavors of coffee, chocolate, spice and blackberry. To no surprise, it finishes jammy and rich. Drink through 2017.",89,Tres Valles 2010 Kuwal Red (Valle de Guadalupe)
"Thick and sour, this wine has a waxy fruit component to it that is off-putting and out of sync with the crisp fruit that is trying to compete on the palate.",83,Cambridge California 2013 Cold Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Shows lovely balance between intense sweetness and crisp acidity, so that the wine's honeyed citrus notes really sing. Hints of marmalade, clove and a perfumed, slightly minty note all add complexity. Delicious now, and probably for a good many years to come.",93,Maximin Grünhäuser 2008 Herrenberg Eiswein 375 ml Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer)
"Here's an easy, straightforward dessert wine from Montalcino, Tuscany that shows bright aromas of stone fruit, honey and white almond. The wine is silky smooth and nicely sweet on the close without being too heavy or cloying.",88,Villa Poggio Salvi 2003 Aurico 375 ml  (Moscadello di Montalcino)
"Simple and direct, this tastes like blend of apricots, pears and mangos, with a gentle oak touch. It has pleasant acidity and nice warmth from the alcohol. Drink now.",85,Huntington 2011 Costello Vineyard Chardonnay (Alexander Valley)
"A note of wet wool threads the aromas of chalky apple and pear on this Chardonnay. The medium-bodied palate feels slick and limber, and it picks up a light hazelnut edge with time.",84,The Williamsburg Winery 2011 Matthew's Chardonnay (Virginia)
"There's a dark, savory quality to this richly concentrated wine that is reminiscent of aromas of air-dried beef or spicy bresaola. You'll also get ripe fruit and blackberry jam and there's a textured, gritty quality to the firm but ripe tannins.",90,Masciarelli 2006 Marina Cvetic'  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo)
"Here's a less formal expression of Garganega that would pair with eggplant curry and fragrant basmati rice. Aromatically speaking, the wine is extremely floral with layers of lemon blossom and jasmine.",86,Monte Tondo 2010 Corte del Sole  (Soave)
"There's no mistaking the variety, with the hallmark aromas of jalapeño pepper, cayenne and herbs. The ample cherry flavors are sweet, with the tannins bringing some graininess.",89,Tertulia 2012 Phinny Hill Vineyard Carmenère (Horse Heaven Hills)
"It's hard to exaggerate the purity of this wine, which is 100% Cabernet. It startles for the intensity of mountain blackberries and raspberries, and then a firm minerality kicks in, along with the tannins, providing grounding structure. The finish lasts for a full minute. Winemaker Luc Morlet has really hit the jackpot with this dry, spectacularly complex young wine, which will develop for at least a decade.",96,Vineyard 7&8 2008 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District)
"This is an appealing, dry, and well-balanced wine, with everything in good proportions. It has lots of fresh cherry aromas, good and deep fruit flavors and a light but tasty layer of toasted, smoky oak.",88,Fetzer 2014 Eagle Peak Merlot (California)
"Fine tannins and attractive acidity set the scene for a wine that is structured and rich in perfumed berry fruits, with a dry, dark core. It is an impressive, ripe wine, still developing and filling out. Drink from 2018.",91,Barão de Vilar 2011 Palmer  (Port)
"Crisp, minerally cherry aromas come with a complex note of desert herbs. This feels totally fresh and full, basically just right. Nicely oaked, ripe flavors of plum and berry fruits are chocolaty, dry and spicy on the finish.",90,Mascota 2015 La Mascota Malbec (Mendoza)
"This is a simple wine with a touch of menthol and astringency, a mix of dried herb and grapes picked at an early stage of ripeness.",85,Camp 2015 Merlot (Sonoma County)
"Light, with some sour cherry fruit on the nose and palate that's outweighed throughout by a dry, woodiness that enters early and persists.",83,Coli 1998  Chianti Classico
"Light, lean wine, its juicy fruit giving an attractive surface with a soft structure below. The wine is pleasant, fruity, not for aging.",84,Château du Pin Franc 2011  Bordeaux
"An unusual blend of 59% Sauvignon Blanc and 41% Chardonnay, this wine opens with a creamy mousse and flavors of ripe apple. Crisp, soft and medium bodied, it's textured and good at hiding the larger amount of SB, resembling more closely a traditional blanc de blancs.",88,Rack & Riddle NV Blanc de Blancs Sparkling (North Coast)
"Good price for a zesty, sweet dessert wine. It's a nice way to finish dinner over something with white and yellow fruit, vanilla and custard ingredients. Shows rich, honeyed orange, apricot and honey flavors, with tingly acidity.",88,Bonterra 2009 Bartolucci Vineyard Muscat (Lake County)
"Creamy bubbles rise through hay color in the glass, showing the slightest touch of salmon pink on the edges, with a lean and tight nose that shows tortilla dough, pink grapefruit rind and a sleek, steely gunmetal note. Crisp apple and sliced Meyer lemon flavors show on the palate, where the bubbles are foamy, the yeast is present but restrained and the style is very approachable.",92,Goat Bubbles 2013 Blanc de Noirs Clos Pepe Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Features an admirably lean, elegantly fine line of acids from start to finish, off of which hang notes of crushed stone, green apple and lime, with just the merest hints of riper fruit, like nectarine. Crisp and long, this should develop well over the next 5–10 years.",91,Penfolds 2010 Bin 51 Riesling (Eden Valley)
"A holdover from 1999, this varietal single-vineyard Cabernet offers tree bark, molasses and prune on the nose, while the palate has raspberry flavors sitting front and center, with drying tannins in support. It's a woody and grabby wine, with vanilla notes toward the end. And at eight years old, it doesn't appear as though it will improve beyond where it's at now. So drink soon.",86,Pago Jean Leon 1999 Vinya La Scala Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Penedès)
"The aromas of this jazzy wine disclose lime leaf, white peach and slate. The off-dry flavors of flowers, pear and stone fruit are typical of Washington in their intensity and detail.",88,Seven Hills 2013 Old Vines Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A good followup to last year's vintage. It's a dry, silky Pinot Noir, with deep, earthy flavors of cherries, raspberries, liqueur, sweet oak and cinnamon spices. An upscale wine to drink now.",90,Rancho Sisquoc 2009 Flood Family Vineyards Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
"Beautiful oak accents help light up this rich, nicely complex wine. Cinnamon, nutmeg and clove dress up the aromas, while ripe, jammy black-cherry flavors spread nicely on the palate and linger on the finish. It's light on tannins and pretty light in texture for such a flavorful wine.",90,Klinker Brick 2014 Carignane (Lodi)
"From the owners of another marquee vineyard nearby, Sun Chase, this wine is expressive and expansive on the palate, dark red-purple in color, thick and dense on the palate. Blackberry, black plum and black pepper rise to the fore, built along a continuum of earthy forest floor. Tannin and oak are interwoven well, before a soft finish.",91,Guarachi Family 2013 Gap's Crown Vineyard Petaluma Gap Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"While the nose is quite bold, boasting concentrated notes of strawberry leather and caramel, the palate on this delicately framed rosé is demure. It's a bit light in concentration with soft acidity, but an easygoing quaffer for early consumption.",86,McGregor 2015 Pinot Noir Rosé (Finger Lakes)
"A real crowd-pleaser, the 2005 Shingleback may not have quite the complexity of the 2004, but it's still a fun, approachable wine. Cola and coffee notes accent plum and blackberry flavors, while the broad texture coats the mouth with soft tannins. Drink now–2012.",88,Shingleback 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)
"There's a rich character to this blend of 50% Grenache, 40% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre. It offers heady aromas of black cherry, boysenberry and raspberry that are laced with hints of vanilla, pepper and pencil shavings. It's well balanced and approachable, with a pleasant licorice kick to the finish.",87,Maison de la Villette 2014 Grenache-Syrah-Mourvèdre Red (Vin de France)
"A solid, structured wine, showing the fine tannins of the vintage along with ripe berry fruits. It has weight, acidity, without pushing the alcohol forward, remaining in balance. Age this wine for 3–4 years.",89,Château Bel-Air 2010  Lussac Saint-Émilion
"The new vintage of Ambiance is again a blend of Viognier, Roussanne, Marsanne and Grenache Blanc, from a trio of excellent vineyards. At first firm and phenolic, it opens up gracefully, with vivid flavors of candied orange peel, honeydew melon and apricot jam. Aging in neutral French oak helps to round out the animated flavors. Drink now and over the next two years.",91,Forgeron 2012 Ambiance White (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Wood aging has given this wine a decidedly spicy character. The balance comes from the ripe berry fruit, acidity and general brightness. The wine is ready to drink.",88,Quinta do Conde 2015 Pernalta Reserva Red (Lisboa)
"A soft wine without real definition, it has an attractive fruity character, but it's missing the firm structure of the appellation. With its vanilla and apricot flavors, this ripe Chardonnay is ready to drink.",86,Jaffelin 2010  Chassagne-Montrachet
"Whiffs of bamboo leaf, lime zest and green herb invite and invigorate on this light-bodied, off-dry Riesling. The palate is juicy and concentrated, an easy going yet tangy mix of tangerine, lemon and salty minerality that lingers long through the finish. Proceeds benefit Nashville's homeless people and pets.",90,Von Schleinitz 2015 Rockin Riesling The FOH Nashville Project Riesling (Mosel)
"This Pinot comes from a small block in the estate vineyard, on the Napa side of Carneros. Right out of the bottle, it's very dry and acidic, marked by fresh, jammy raspberry and cherry flavors. All indications point to the cellar, except for a funkiness that may become more pronounced with age. It's risky, but try holding through 2016.",87,Domaine Carneros 2010 Clonal Series Block 405 Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"90–92. Barrel sample. This concentrated wine brings out all the qualities of 2012 vintage—fruitiness, juicy black fruit and great swathes of fresh acidity. It's a finely balanced wine.",91,Château Malescot Saint-Exupery 2012 Barrel Sample  (Margaux)
"Septette is supple and sexy, using all seven Pinot Noir clones grown in the estate vineyard. The fruit flavors run toward blueberry and blackberry, with supporting acidity and drying tannins. Aging in 40% new French oak adds suggestions of mocha and dark chocolate to the finish.",92,DanCin 2012 Septette Pinot Noir (Southern Oregon)
"Very dark in the glass, this inky wine shows aromas of iodine, distilled violets and wound-up black-currant fruit, making the Syrah appear in charge. It's very dense but not especially ripe on the sip, where layered tannins reluctantly reveal elderberry and lilac flavors. Though five years old, it still needs time to unwind.",92,Nielson by Byron 2012 Nielson Vineyard G-S-M (Santa Maria Valley)
"This wine initially presents itself as lighter in body than it actually is, a tease from the cool-climate aromas of cucumber, dill and cranberry tea. The oak is toasty with a whiff of smoke, the acidity somewhat subdued. An appealing funk of earth gives it varietal distinction.",89,MacPhail 2013 Sangiacomo Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"A spray of violet perfumes ripe blueberries and blackberries on this deep, rich Cabernet Franc. Lusciously full in body, the palate is a concentrated crush of black fruit flavor accented with brisk acidity and soft, velveteen tannins on the finish.",88,Atwater 2012 North Block Six Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes)
"A very fine effort at a most affordable price, this off-dry Gewürztraminer nicely captures the powdery floral scents and peachy, lychee fruit notes of the grape. The bright acidity keeps it fresh and bracing.",88,Columbia Crest 2012 Two Vines Gewurztraminer (Washington)
"Earthy, enticing violet, pressed rose, new leather crushed mint and game aromas follow through to succulent, savory palate, along with Marasca cherry and cranberry notes. Star anise, white pepper and clove accents add depth while youthfully assertive, refined tannins and vibrant acidity provide an ageworthy framework. Drink 2022–2034.",96,Albino Rocca 2014 Angelo  (Barbaresco)
"Still knitting itself together, this entry-level cuvée from Bergström brings fresh raspberry fruit flavors front and center. There are toasty highlights as well, nicely framing the finish, promising further development in bottle after 2018.",90,Bergström 2015 Cumberland Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"For an Alentejo wine, this is surprisingly light, fresh and poised. Yes, there is rich raisiny fruit. but it is easily balanced by a thread of acidity that winds through. The tannins are soft, the fruit juicy.",88,Casca Wines 2008 Monte Cascas Reserva Red (Alentejano)
"Aromas of meat juice, scorched earth, grilled herb and dried plum lead the nose. On the rich palate, notes of licorice, dried sage, mocha and orange peel accent the primary flavors of raspberry jam and crushed black cherry. It's balanced with firm tannins.",90,Luiano 2011 Ottantuno Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico)
"Whiffs of ripe black cherries, vanilla and spice, along with delicate hints of soil and barnyard, mark this unusual blend of Saperavi and Sereksiya grapes. Tart black-fruit flavors accented with swathes of fresh herbs are a bit lean on the palate, but the acidity is gentle. It's dry and easy drinking in style with smooth, gentle tannins.",87,McGregor 2010 Black Russian Red (Finger Lakes)
"The “83” refers to the department number of the Var, the winery's home county in Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur. This open, gentle wine dances with attractive bright, fresh fruitiness. It is crisply textured, with a strong citrus element along with raspberry sweetness. It is an apéritif style.",87,Château de Brigue 2015 Rosé 83 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This vineyard-designate opens in inviting, perfumed aromatics of apple blossom and honeysuckle. On the palate it reveals substantial depth and breadth, the oak characteristic quite caramelized. Meaty in lemon zest and meringue, it provides a weight of body that's nicely balanced against stony minerality and traces of nutmeg.",93,Walt 2014 Sangiacomo Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"Made from 50% Syrah, 40% Grenache and 10% Cinsault, this opens with ripe peach and red-berry aromas that are framed by mentholated herbal tones. The medium-weight palate offers a round mouthfeel and soft acidity, followed by a lightly pithy finish.",87,Château de Lancyre 2016 Le Rosé (Coteaux du Languedoc Pic Saint Loup)
"Bill Easton's Mourvèdre features a combination of bright, ripe strawberry and savory herbal tea. It is medium bodied, with a distinctly peppery finish.",88,Terre Rouge 2009 Mourvèdre (Sierra Foothills)
"This dark and dense wine is closed, with its tannins very dominant. It's a solid, dark wine intense with juicy acidity, firm dry structure and a rich core. This is a magnificent wine for serious aging, with all the elements coming strongly into play. Drink from 2022.",94,Château Smith Haut Lafitte 2012  Pessac-Léognan
"Minty, camphor-like aromas arise off of this bottling, alongside milk chocolate, tart berries and raw beef aromas. The mouthfeel is comparatively thin, showing peppery cherry juice, dried dill and other herbal flavors.",87,Kitá 2013 Camp 4 Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley)
"There is a great depth of flavor to this wine. It is rich, but has a strong mineral edge that cuts through the ripe white and citrus fruits. Balanced between dryness and fruit, this structured wine is ready to drink.",90,Autréau de Champillon NV Réserve Grand Cru Brut  (Champagne)
"Light and fruity, this is a fresh, rounded wine with attractive berry fruits. It is already smooth, although the tannins are in the background. It's fragrant with a medium-term potential. Drink from 2015.",85,Château d'Arcins 2011  Haut-Médoc
"A best-of blend from several of the producer's vineyard sites, this wine explodes in flavor and complexity as though celebrating each site's individual beauty and potential. Black pepper and crisp orange and pomegranate flavors show through its layered and focused texture—a savory package with a seemingly endless finish.",96,Arista 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon with 6% Cabernet Franc and 4% Petit Verdot from several appellations within the Napa Valley is soft and smoothly textured, offering brawny black cherry and toasted wood flavors.",87,Martin Ray 2014 Synthesis Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Dry and tart in acidity, this Rhône-style white blend is pretty good for everyday purposes, but has insufficient richness. There's a vegetal streak that drags down the apricot and peach fruit flavors.",84,Morse 2007 Ensemble Blanc Viognier-Roussanne (Sierra Foothills)
"Pretty rough and tough for a Stags Leap Cab. Shows hard tannins and some overripe flavors, with a funky, sweaty note. Lots of ripe, crushed blackberries and cassis, but it doesn't seem like an ager, so drink up.",86,Roney 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District)
"The attack on this light-bodied sipper is unabashedly fruity, with loads of ripe peach and nectarine flavors. It balances out quite nicely with zippy acidity and a dry, steely finish. This is a noteworthy addition to the growing line up of Finger Lakes Grüner Veltliner.",87,Stony Lonesome 2011 Estate Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Finger Lakes)
"A reductive note of rubber tire threads through the mélange of cherry cola, iron ore and red licorice flavors in this wine. The components have not yet integrated, leading to a finish marked by bitter skin and tannins. Give it another couple of years of bottle age before pulling the cork.",86,Dauntless 2015 No Man's Land Wädenswil Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"Hailing from 11 different vineyards located across the Columbia Valley, this appealing, 100% varietal wine provides aromas of toasty spices, dried herbs, cocoa and jammy dark fruit. The cranberry, coffee and blackberry flavors are sweet and focused, backed by chewy, lightly dry tannins that need time to soften.",89,L'Ecole No. 41 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Enticing scents of white wild flower, yellow stone fruit and a whiff of honeydew melon lead to a vibrant palate loaded with ripe apricot, cantaloupe and citrus. Baking spice and ginger notes add depth to the lingering finish while fresh acidity lends balance. This will continue to age well and evolve for several years or longer.",93,Jermann 2013 Vintage Tunina White (Venezia Giulia)
"Proving that not only single vineyards can make great wine, this outstanding offering entices with forest floor, black tea, herb and cherry compote flavors. It's full-bodied, laced with fine-grained tannins, expansive in mouthfeel and long-lasting on the finish.",92,Expression 39 2014 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"This wine comes from Woodinville Wine Cellars. It displays aromas of lemongrass, custard and tropical fruit. The flavors are ripe and full bodied, lingering on the finish.",88,Ded.Reckoning 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"While nose and palate shine with beautifully precise pear, there is a core of wonderfully pure mandarin. There are hints of zesty grapefruit spice but the concentrated purity of fruit makes this stand out. Tangy citrus means the ripeness is harnessed into a linear streamlined direction that gives this drive and lively energy. This is moreish and impressive.",93,Eder 2015 Raubern Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"Il Musmeci is quickly reaching cult status in Italy as one of the best wines to emerge from Etna. Made from Nerello Mascalese and a small component of Nerello Cappuccio, it shows fine and elegant aromatic nuances of smell berry, cola and volcanic stone. The wine's real power comes in the mouth thanks to its tannic structure and length.",91,Tenuta di Fessina 2007 Il Musmeci  (Etna)
"A very well-made Merlot, with sweet fruit and attractive scents of vanilla and cracker. Though still showing a lot of youthful acidity, it wraps the fruit in a big blast of new oak and finishes with a hint of heat.",89,Tamarack Cellars 2000 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Faint lemon zest and a touch of green pear hardly give anything away on the nose, while the palate is balanced and light. Variety speaks louder than origin here, but with poise and honesty.",90,Strauss 2013 Classic Chardonnay (Steiermark)
"Dense and almost black in color, this is concentrated, with intense tannins and black plum fruit. It bursts with the rich fruit and acidity, finishing on a smoky, juicy note.",91,Mas del Périé 2010 La Roque Malbec (Cahors)
"While initially the fruit seems tight and stalky, there is also a rich layer of spice, black currant and balanced wood flavors. Acidity is prominent, but it fits well into the fruit. For medium-term aging.",90,Château Malartic-Lagravière 2007  Pessac-Léognan
"Spicy earthy briary aromas include a note of cola along with requisite berry and cassis scents. A slightly choppy mouthfeel and flavors of blueberry, cardamom, herbs and oak define the palate, while this finishes fruity and open. Drink through 2024.",92,Valenciso 2009 Reserva  (Rioja)
"This wine is both incredibly pretty and wild, a tenacious quality of feral forest and ocean at its core. Honeysuckle and rose provide the beauty first, followed by a depth of gorgeous cherry, strawberry and rhubarb, the fruit alive and fresh atop a gravelly texture of complexity.",94,La Follette 2014 Hawk's Roost Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Demi-Sec is essentially an off-dry Champagne. This wine is soft, hinting at some sweetness while preserving crisp citrus and apple flavors. It has some richness as well, and its soft character makes it a good partner with cold meats or pâtés.",87,Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin NV Demi-Sec  (Champagne)
"Toasted notes of roasted almond, popcorn, dark coffee and vanilla extract set the stage. Doppiozeta is a new wine from Zisola that offers soft, sweet flavors and bright fruit succulence. Pair this wine with lamb, beef or pork.",91,Zisola 2006 Doppiozeta Red (Sicilia)
"Deep and lavish aromas of baked black currant, caramel, condensed violets and fudge get a licorice lift on the nose of this blend of 41% Syrah, 41% Grenache and 18% Mourvèdre. It's fairly nimble on the palate given the bombastic nose, with balanced flavors of blackberry, vanilla and orange zest proving quite the crowd-pleaser.",92,ONX 2015 Crux Red (Templeton Gap District)
"Sugary sweet and simple, with dessert pastry flavors of pineapples, lemons and baked pie crust.",84,Rock Wall 2009 Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Lemon zest on nose and palate signal a very zippy, citrus-scented white with a rather neutral aromatic expression—as befits unoaked Chardonnay from a cool year. It is light bodied and cannot be beaten for freshness.",87,Netzl 2014 Chardonnay (Carnuntum)
"This is a wood-aged wine that's smooth with rounded and great fruit flavors. The wood is subtle, a hint of spice and no more, allowing the ripe apricot and citrus flavors to show strongly. It is a very fine wine, ready to drink now.",91,Quinta do Perdigão 2015 Encruzado (Dão)
"A little green and minty, with sweet cherry, vanilla cream and smoke flavors brightened with crisp acidity. Drink now.",85,Brander 2007 Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley)
"A bright streak of freshness comes forth thanks to the aromas of forest berry, cherry, red currant and spice. It shows intensity and power on the finish, with enough heat to cut through creamy foods or cheeses.",87,Cavalchina 2009 Torre d'Orti Morari  (Valpolicella Superiore)
"A very easy-drinking white from Newsome Harlow that's mostly Muscat Blanc à Petit Grains (75%) with 15% Viognier and 10% Sauvignon Blanc, whole-cluster pressed and fermented in stainless steel. Fermented dry, though the finish definitely veers a tad sweet, the wine is full of aromatic apricot and peach with spice notes throughout, a full body and plenty of acidity.",88,Newsome-Harlow 2009 Muscat Blanc (Calaveras County)
"Dry, spicy, leathery aromas are herbal but solid. This feels full and balanced but rudimentary, with cherry, cassis, chocolate and herbal flavors. A finish of dark-fruit flavors comes with overt oak notes, peppery spice and heat.",86,Bodega Volcanes de Chile 2011 Summit 2900 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Rapel Valley)
"Herbal, spicy berry aromas are varietally correct. This has a chunky mouthfeel and also some flatness to the palate. Flavors of herbal berry, spice and lactic oak finish a bit green, with herbal, olive notes.",86,Santa Carolina 2012 Reserva Carmenère (Cachapoal Valley)
"The nose is rather shy but reveals ripe black fruit, plum cake and baking spice. The densely concentrated palate doles out mature blackberry, crushed raspberry, allspice and licorice alongside smooth, velvety tannins. There's also the heat of alcohol.",90,Futura 14 2012 Raccontami  (Primitivo di Manduria)
"Sourced from grapes grown in the Happy Canyon area, this is a lush, ripe blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. It's not hugely complex, but pleasurable and jammy with flavors of black cherries, dried red currants and sweet milk chocolate.",88,Westerly 2009 Fletcher's Red (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Rich and smooth, this wine shows weight with superripe fruit that offers a mellow take on Grüner. With its spice, pineapple and dried apricot flavors, this is both fruity and structured.",90,Stift Göttweig 2010 Gottschelle Erste Lage Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"Powerfully structured and concentrated, this is a rich, tarry and tannic wine. The dense texture doesn't lose sight of the jammy black currant and berry fruits that are just underneath. For the moment, even after four years, the wine is very young, firm and dry. Drink from 2018.",91,Casa da Passarella 2011 Abanico Reserva Red (Dão)
"100% varietal, this wine exhibits aromas of dried herb, cigar box, and cherry. The flavors are tart, light and elegant, harmonizing on the finish.",89,Basel Cellars 2011 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"In the range of what Clos Troteligotte calls micro-parcels, this is in the middle. It's full of generous black fruits and attendant acidity. At the same time, it is young and still coming together. The future promises great concentration and depth of flavor. Drink from 2017.",93,Clos Troteligotte 2012 K Malbec (Cahors)
"This popular mutt red is supple and smooth. What began as “an accident” in 2001 has become a complete blend, with structure and nuance and a mix of fruit, black olive, herb and earth.",88,Bergevin Lane 2006 Calico Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This classy young Pinot is the second release from the winery's only Petaluma Gap vineyard. It's bone dry, mouthwateringly tart in acidity and delicate in structure, with complex cherry, cranberry, persimmon and cola flavors, nicely augmented by smoky oak. You can drink it now, after decanting for an hour or two, and it will soften a bit, or hold until 2020.",92,Williams Selyem 2012 Terra de Promissio Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Latex, leather and asphalt aromas compete with berry aromas on what amounts to a hard, tough nose. Narrow in the mouth, with tomato-like acidity, this tastes woody and salty, with modest berry flavors.",85,Ruca Malen 2011 Yauquen Bonarda (Mendoza)
"Ripe dark berry, sweet cake spice and pipe tobacco are just some of the aromas you'll find on this stunning wine. The palate shows structure and finesse, doling out black cherry, raspberry, black pepper, clove and anise alongside firm, velvety tannins and bright acidity.",93,Rivetti Massimo 2012 Serraboella  (Barbaresco)
There's a spicy element of clove or cinnamon (25% of the wine is aged in oak) that is followed by stone fruit and bitter almond. Tonic effervescence and crisp acidity would help pair this wine with quiche.,87,Cà del Vént NV Brut Chardonnay (Franciacorta)
"This wine opens with red apple peel and citrus aromas that also play on the fresh, light and zippy palate, made livelier by slight spritz. It's dry, refreshing and light, with lots of red apple fruit.",89,Pratsch 2016 Rosé (Niederösterreich)
"There's a distinctly floral grapiness to this Malbec—evocative of Argentinian archetypes—yet rustic touches of bramble wood and a delicate, dancing mouthfeel make it quite uniquely a New Yorker. Blackberry and cherry flavors are rich and ripe, yet maintain vivacious freshness through the finish.",89,Anthony Nappa 2014 La Strega Malbec (North Fork of Long Island)
"This wine, a blend from many Mâcon vineyards, is crisp and full of acidity, making it bright and tangy. Its freshness is up front with apple and citrus fruits. The mineral texture gives an attractive tautness, and the wine is drinkable now.",88,Bret Brothers 2014 Terroir du Mâconnais  (Mâcon-Villages)
"Big and densely tannic, this wine's fruit is still firmly buried in the structure. It has wood, spice and ripe plum notes. With its concentrated texture, it is still capable of aging.",88,Château Tourans 2006 Cuvée Terre Blanche  (Saint-Émilion)
"Sweetly aromatic of jasmine, this Chardonnay has a core of honey, apple and caramel, and is pleasantly crisp and balanced. Accessible and well-priced, it's a solid and friendly go-to white for just about any occasion.",85,McManis 2012 Chardonnay (River Junction)
"Tastes like orange juice with an extra hit of white sugar, sprinkled with cinnamon, vanilla and an oaky sweetness.",82,Shiloh Road 2010 Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"Leathery, herbal aromas of black fruits, horsehide and murky earth lead to a medium-bodied palate with wiry acidity. Saucy, herbal tomato and plum flavors are typical of the variety, while the finish maintains the wine's true-to-form flavors.",88,Viña Tarapacá 2014 Gran Reserva Carmenère (Maipo Valley)
"This is the winery's superstar Bordeaux-style blend, and one of the defining red wines of the Okanagan. In its youth it is peppery, tannic and tough, with strong herbal flavors, along with pomegranate, cranberry and white raspberry fruit. It's firmly acidic, lightly toasty, complex and finished with flavors of coffee grounds, cacao, baking spices and smoke. Drink now through 2025.",92,Black Hills 2012 Nota Bene Red (Okanagan Valley)
"Overall, this elegant wine is dry with just a touch of stonefruit sweetness. Lemon yellow in color, there's brightness throughout with ripe apricots, honey and yellow freesia on the nose. A polished minerality and orange pith bitterness help keep things in balance.",86,Rooster Hill 2008 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"This wine is near-equal parts Marsanne and Picpoul. It brings zesty aromas of spice, lees, almond and citrus followed by a medium-bodied palate with a zing of acidity and good balance.",89,Ardor 2014 Los Odios White (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Oak, espresso and toast aromas jump out of the glass. The tightly wound palate delivers plum cake, roasted coffee bean, oak extract, licorice, a confectionary note and licorice but not much fruit richness. Raspy wood tannins provide the framework.",88,Poggio Antico 2010 Altero  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"This medium-bodied Pinot Noir is a pleasant enough drink, offering modest strawberry and cherry aromas and flavors before a touch of mocha creeps in on the finish.",85,Rapaura Springs 2009 Vineyard Reserve Pinot Noir (Central Otago)
"Initially a very soft wine, it slowly shows its ripe fruits, intense texture and blend of buttery toast and acidity. Yellow fruits dominate, bursting through the acidity to give a ripe, opulent finish. Age for 3–4 years.",91,Garnier et Fils 2009 Vaudésir Grand Cru  (Chablis)
"Shows good varietal character in a somewhat sweet format. It starts off slightly musky and gingery on the nose, then adds lychee fruit flavors. For its sweetness, it's not particularly richly textured or weighty, making it a possibility as an apéritif.",88,Grafen Neipperg 2006 Neipperger Schlossberg Auslese Traminer (Württemberg)
"Cornas is Colombo's home turf, and the 2005 Terres Brulees shows his mastery, offering up beefy, cedary notes but also cracked pepper and cassis alongside iron-like mineral notes. This is full-bodied and intense, with plenty of structure; drink 2015-2025.",93,Jean-Luc Colombo 2005 Terres Brulées  (Cornas)
"Dusty tannins make for a soft texture in this wine that's subtle in dried fruit, Christmas spice, chocolate and clove. It delivers flavor and complexity without attitude, a savory expression of the grape from a relatively cool climate.",90,Ca' Momi 2013 Reserve Merlot (Carneros)
"This is a super-fresh, fruity wine meant to dazzle in sheer deliciousness now, not something to age. It's almost candied, with raspberry, cherry, blackberry and mocha flavors that are exuberant and easy to understand.",86,Cimarone 2008 3CV Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Red plum flavors are spiced with wood aging and enlivened by zesty acidity. It is a fruity, lightly structured wine showing rich fruit tones. Drink now.",86,Fiuza 2014 Merlot (Tejo)
"Sweet, nutty aromas are akin to banana bread and candle wax, while the palate is creamy and resiny, with oily flavors of baked apple and vanilla. Full-bodied, thick, creamy and sticky; your typical tropical-leaning Chilean Chardonnay.",86,Gracia de Chile 2007 Reserva lo Mejor Illusión Chardonnay (Bío Bío Valley)
The aromas are light and elusive with notes of mineral and pear. It drinks dry with a wash of alcoholic bitterness that runs throughout.,81,Schmidt 2012 Schmidt Family Vineyards Estate Riesling (Southern Oregon)
"Grilled herb, underbrush toasted hazelnut and stewed prune aromas meld together along with a floral note. The juicy, structured palate presents fleshy Morello cherry, raspberry, star anise, clove and a hint of orange zest alongside firm, polished tannins that give this a smooth mouthfeel.",92,Rivetto 2012 Cè Vanin  (Barbaresco)
"Sophisticated in every way, this engaging, complex effort begins with fresh apple fruit, then layers in lemon curd and sliced orange components. There's a touch of beeswax, and a creamy mouthfeel that stretches out the finish.",92,Tendril 2014 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
"Shows green fruit and slightly herbal nuances on the nose, then delivers crystalline structure and purity of lime fruit and liquid minerals in the mouth. Although only light to medium in body, this is a powerhouse, with a long finish.",89,Müller-Catoir 2007 Haardt Trocken Riesling (Pfalz)
"Wonderfully floral, this wine is rich while also having great fruits, a fresher edge and tannins that caress. From the Croft home vineyard, it shows fullness and structure. The aftertaste is so fruity and fragrant, it's almost drinkable now. Wait, though, until 2020.",93,Croft 2012 Quinta de Roêda Vintage  (Port)
"Vanilla, baking spice, dark-fruit and herb aromas are followed by elegant cranberry and raspberry flavors. Spice flavors linger on the finish. It's a pretty expression of the variety, showing impeccable balance.",90,Bunnell 2011 Grenache (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Björnson's Pinots are difficult to differentiate. This one is labeled Estate, but is also a barrel selection; the other is also estate but not labeled as such. Both offer medium-ripe berry and cherry fruit and a pleasant touch of new oak and both were aged in barrel for 11 months prior to bottling. This may have had a few more new barrels: at the moment it seems a bit toastier.",88,Björnson 2014 Estate Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Stony aromas of minerally citrus and nectarine are clean and upright. This Garnacha rosé is simple but good in feel, with generic but clean flavors of stone fruits. Bitter, pithy flavors rise up to dominate the finish.",86,Las Rocas de San Alejandro 2013 Rosé (Calatayud)
"This is the inaugural release of this wine, which is composed of fruit from Pepper Bridge and Seven Hills vineyards. It's aromatically generous, with appealing notes of sage, dried herb, cassis, dark chocolate, spice, pencil lead and dark fruit. The palate delivers a mouthful of dark-fruit flavors and tannins that are combined to a fine sheen. It shows a beautiful sense of balance capped off by a persistent finish. It drinks well now but is made with the future in mind.",92,Passing Time 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
Marrenon's luxury cuvée aged in oak is 90% Grenache and 10% Syrah and is full-bodied without being tough or overly muscular. Cherry preserves are wrapped in a coat of coffee- and chocolate-tinged oak. Drink now and over the next couple of years.,87,Marrenon 2008 Orca Red (Ventoux)
"A good, everyday sipper, soft and gentle, with appealing flavors of pineapples, oranges, pears, cream and buttered toast. Could show greater structure and acidity.",85,Somerston 2009 Highflyer Grenache Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Fresh and crisp with sliced apple fruits, this is a light lively wine. It is dry although there is a touch of sweetness from the ripe pear flavor. Ready to drink, it is fruity and refreshing.",86,Ackerman NV Brut Sparkling (Crémant de Loire)
"Bought in 2006 by François Pinault, also owner of Bordeaux Château Latour, Domaine d'Eugenie (the former Domaine René Engel) is just starting out. Already the style, as in this wine, exhibits power, concentration and structure. But here, also, there is great, vibrant fruit, the red berry flavors rolling around the mouth.",93,Domaine d'Eugenie 2006  Clos de Vougeot
"This is a very rich Chardonnay, bursting with Key lime pie, ripe golden kiwi, pineapple, buttered toast and crème brûlée flavors. That fine, crisp coastal acidity makes it brisk and clean. Drink now.",87,Estancia 2006 Reserve Chardonnay (Monterey)
Brooding aromas of moist soil and dark cherry are followed by big bold cherry flavors that coat the palate. The variety's often burly tannins are kept well in check.,91,Palencia 2013 El Viñador Petit Verdot (Wahluke Slope)
"This is a tough wine, marked by hard acids and tannins, and an absence of the fruit to stand up to it. It's bone dry and severe, with thin cherry-skin and cola flavors.",82,River Road 2011 Hopkins Vineyard Pinot Meunier (Russian River Valley)
"Pretty in pink and orange hues, this stainless-steel-fermented charmer has a candied orange flavor that's delicious, followed by fresh, crisp strawberry and tangerine-laced acidity. Medium bodied, it ends with a burst of peach.",88,Rodney Strong 2014 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Sonoma County)
"Produced from Alvarinho grown in the southern Minho region, near the Douro Valley, this is a particularly crisp and fruity wine. Great streaks of acidity give it a fresh character. It needs to age a few months to round it out; drink from 2015.",88,Aveleda 2013 Alvarinho (Minho)
"This oak-dominated wine recalls the ubiquitous wood-driven Tuscan offerings from the late 1990s and early 2000s. A blend of Cabernet, Petit Verdot, Merlot and Syrah, it delivers hardcore oak, wood chips, vanilla, chocolate and espresso sensations, with black currant and blackberry lying low in the foreground.",87,Argiano 2010 Solengo Red (Toscana)
"A fresh wine with red cherry fruits giving a bright character, the tannins soft and with attractive acidity. It is lightly textured and should be ready to drink in 1–2 years.",86,Domaine Moillard 2009  Côte de Nuits-Villages
"This hearty red opens with aromas of toast, coffee bean, ripe plum, leather and a dash of menthol. The warm, robust palate offers dried black cherry marinated in spirits, raisin, licorice and espresso alongside dusty tannins that dry out the finish. Showing the heat of the vintage, it's already evolved, with evident alcohol that throws it off-balance.",88,Villa Le Prata 2010 Massimo Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Mulberry, wet rock and sagebrush show on the nose of this single vineyard bottling from a site owned by the Hahn family. The palate is tangy at first, revealing dark red fruit with a smoky kick as it opens, backed by hints of juniper and dust.",91,Testarossa 2015 Doctor's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"The winery makes a line of Cabernet Sauvignon from various AVAs of the Napa Valley, highlighting each on the label. From warmer Calistoga, this mouthCab is brambly black fruit-forward with layers of coffee and mocha.",88,Hunnicutt 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Calistoga)
"Grape candy and black cherry aromas are edged by cedar. Chewy tannins dominate the palate, with dark chocolate and purple fruit flavors present as well.",87,Harmony Cellars 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
This light Chablis is fresh and packed with attractive young fruitiness. It comes from the plateau above the Serein valley and shows its provenance in the cool-climate crispness. Drink now.,86,Domaine Louis Moreau 2014  Petit Chablis
"Dry styles of Riesling often feel dense and expansive, but this beautifully rose-scented wine is elegant and light on its feet, with a bristling minerality. Lean apple and white peach flavors are peppered with delicate spice notes that  linger on the finish.",92,Fritz Haag 2012 Brauneberger Juffer Feinherb Riesling (Mosel)
"Briny, pickled aromas come with hints of citrus and flower blossom. This fast-aging Albariño is melony in feel, but it lacks the variety's patented kick and acidity. As a result, peach and apricot flavors are fleshy and chunky.",84,Compañia de Vinos del Atlántico 2013 Columna Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"This elegant red blend—the new flagship wine from Bedell—starts with a soft, juicy nose with hints of cedar and cinnamon. On the palate, a burst of cherry, plum and blackberry flavors mingle with spice and smooth tannins. The finish has an appealing spin of exotic spices. Though ready to drink now, the wine will benefit from a few years in the cellar, allowing its elements to even further integrate.",88,Bedell 2005 Musée Red (North Fork of Long Island)
This is a simple North Coast Cabernet with herbal and green olive and pepper tones.,83,Line 39 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (North Coast)
"This is floral and aromatic, bearing soft, ripe yellow fruit, attractive acidity and a soft, rounded texture. A shaft of citric acidity cuts through the palate, making the wine feel lively and refreshing.",86,Adega Mayor 2011 Caiado White (Alentejano)
"Interesting and complex aromas suggest new oak, tea, leather and red cherry. Tangy cranberry flavors and a crisp feel in the mouth make this wine enjoyable in a lean style.",86,Chatom 2012 Sangiovese (Calaveras County)
"Buttery cream is on the nose of this vineyard-designate, a relatively affordable offering from an esteemed producer in the heart of the Napa Valley. Oaky on the palate, the medium-weighted wine is nicely offset by a searingly crisp bite of lemon that peaks on the finish.",87,Peju 2013 Persephone Vineyard Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Man O' War's 2008 Dreadnought put the winery on the map, and, although not quite as dramatic, the 2009 is a worthy successor. Aromas are lifted, peppery and cherry-filled, while the flavor nuances include smoke and pepper-cured meats. The wine is medium bodied and is marked by silky tannins and crisp acids. Drink now–2018.",90,Man O' War 2009 Dreadnought Syrah (Waiheke Island)
"This wine is a blend of international and indigenous Hungarian varieties, made from 60% Furmint, 17% Hárslevelu, 11% Chardonnay, 9% Sauvignon Blanc and 3% Muscat. A bouquet of creamsicle and lychee set the stage for flavors of tropical fruits and orange zest. It is sinewy on the palate, with a surprisingly velvety finish.",89,Sauska 2011 Cuvée 113 White (Tokaj)
"This wine still seems to be in its shell, showing considerable reduction that persists in the aromas and flavors. It drinks off dry with broad apple flavors.",83,Convergence Zone 2014 Drizzle Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Pinot Gris (Red Mountain)
"The difference between this and the brand new 2016 is obvious: this is maderized but still good. Aromas of orange blossom are floral, but overall this seems low on crispness. Plump on the palate, this tastes of peach and dried melon. A soft finish with a white-pepper character says drink right away.",86,Fabre Montmayou 2015 Rosé (Mendoza)
"With touches of the typical minerality of the appellation, this is a young, tight wine. Crisp apple, lemon and spice add interest to this perfumed wine. It will be better to drink from 2017.",88,Patriarche Père et Fils 2015  Pouilly-Fuissé
"There are some Chard elements in this rustic, countrified wine. The apple and peach flavors, with oaky vanilla overtones, are familiar. But itÕs a rough wine, with some odd, vegetal qualities. Satisfactory, if youÕre not very fussy.",83,Woodbridge 2000 Chardonnay (California)
"88-90 Barrel sample. Some spice here, from the rich Merlot. The wine has ripe blackberry, sweet fruits as well as concentrated tannins.",89,Château Plince 2009 Barrel sample  (Pomerol)
"Rasula shows ripe aromas of blackberry and prune with lingering tones of spice and leather in the background. It's a simple value wine with a chewy, rich mouthfeel.",85,Maggiovini 2007 Rasula Cabernet Sauvignon (Sicilia)
"Pure varietal, all stainless-fermented, and finished with 15g/L residual sugar, this fleshy, supple wine is packed with sweet pear-fruit flavor. Spicy highlights of cinnamon and nutmeg add depth.",88,Vercingetorix VX 2014 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"Aromas of dark berry, licorice and chopped herb lead the nose. The structured palate offers red and black cherry, clove, tobacco and a hint of orange zest alongside firm, ripe tannins. Drink 2018–2024.",92,Giuseppe Cortese 2012 Rabajà  (Barbaresco)
"The subdued nose gives way on the palate to earthy apple, reminiscent of Russet, underlined by a vein of lemony acidity that brightens from the inside out. Lemony earthiness lingers on the dry finish.",89,Domaine Schoffit 2013 Harth Tradition Riesling (Alsace)
"Held back for nearly four years, this Pinot still brims with acidity. Tartness is the shock that precedes columns of raspberries, cherries, pomegranates, persimmons and cola, bearing banners of exotic spices. A precise, intellectually pure wine, it should be decanted now, and will develop interestingly over the years.",93,Fort Ross 2007 Symposium Fort Ross Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"If you've ever had a Momtazi wine, you know that there is a strong earthy aspect to the flavors that sets the vineyard apart from most others. In the scents and tastes here you'll find composted earth, chalk, dried leaves and black tea ahead of black cherry fruit, but those funk-soaked flavors add up to a complex and intriguing wine.",90,Portlandia 2014 Momtazi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"A little heavy and soft, with jelled raspberry, cola and vanilla flavors. The finish turns sugary.",83,Nicholson Ranch 2006 Ramona Pinot Noir Rosé (Sonoma Valley)
"Sheldon's Roma's Vineyard Pinot Noir is exquisite. Very light in color (and alcohol level at 12.9 percent), it opens with gorgeous raspberry and violet aromas. Fully satisfying from start to finish, it has a lush mouthfeel, cherry spice high tones and a long, easy finish that will tempt you to want more. This is a beautiful wine. Only 60 cases made.",94,Sheldon 2011 Roma's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"90–92. Barrel sample. Solid and structured, while also a fruity wine, this has weight, richness and generous black-fruit flavors. It's quite a success, and showcases the pleasurable side of the vintage.",91,Château d'Hanteillan 2012 Barrel Sample  (Haut-Médoc)
"This wine is just what a Sonoma Valley Cabernet should be. It's softly tannic and likeable now, with rich, ripe blackberry, black currant, blueberry and oak flavors. Shows real elegance as well as structural integrity.",89,Gundlach Bundschu 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley)
"Equal parts power and grace, this wine appeals widely with its forward, concentrated apple and lemon flavors. Oak tones of caramel, spice and smoke show prominently on the nose, but integrate neatly on the palate. It's lusciously mouthfilling, finishing with a kiss of butterscotch and spice.",90,McCall 2013 Reserve Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island)
"Lemony and toasty, this approachable wine is rich and balanced, its texture soft and the flavors long-lasting, highlighted by a taste of lemon meringue.",88,Arrowood 2012 Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"From the cave cooperative located in nearby Vacqueyras, this is a full-bodied, plushly textured wine that manages to avoid being too soft. Black cherry and garrigue notes are joined by hints of licorice and mocha on the long, layered finish. Drink now–2020.",92,Vignerons de Caractère 2009 Roque Colombe G-S-M (Châteauneuf-du-Pape)
"A bold red, this offers aromas of ripe plum, crushed blueberry, espresso and vanilla. The brawny, one-dimensional palate doles out mature blackberry, white chocolate and a hint of mocha.",88,Tenuta Rapitalà 2012 Alto Nero Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"This  dense, impenetrable Sangiovese has wild blueberry backed by a creamy, almost milky, structure. It is soft and lush with round tannins and lingering spice notes on the finale.",87,Farnese 2007 Don Camillo Sangiovese (Terre di Chieti)
"A tuna melt or easy platter of cold cuts and cheese would pair with this bright Italian sparkler. It's a Dry expression, which means it tastes sweetish in the mouth, and shows notes of peach and citrus.",83,La Jara 2010 Millesimato Dry  (Prosecco)
"Dynamic, intense, and complex, a massive wine that explodes with blackberry, plum, dark chocolate and herb aromas and flavors. Terrific texture, thick and smooth, and totally drinkable tonight.",92,Domaine de la Terre Rouge 2000 Sentinel Oak Vineyard Pyramid Block Syrah (Shenandoah Valley (CA))
"This represents a softer, more subtle side of the variety, holding back on overripeness in favor of simple leather, compost and black pepper. Touches of unearthed truffle offer the wine's one note of richness.",88,Balletto 2013 Estate Grown Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"This producer continues to impress in quality and focus. Proving the point, this estate-grown white proffers inviting teases of jasmine and tropical-kissed peach and pear. Tangy acidity finds a complement of texture and body, delivering voluptuousness that remains elegant in the glass.",93,Gundlach Bundschu 2014 Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"This field blend of old white-grape vines—a rarity in the Douro—is rich in the bottle from a mélange of stainless steel, wood fermentation and barrel aging. It is smooth with concentration from the toast flavors and floral complexity. Its ripe character and generous texture make it a wine to drink now.",92,Quinta do Pôpa 2015 Pôpa Black Edition Branco White (Douro)
"Using fruit sourced from old vines, Umani Ronchi flexes its creative muscle with this beautiful white wine. It is fermented in stainless steel and cement for 10 months, an elaborate process that adds softness and creaminess to the finish. It also renders enduring aromas of apricot and vanilla custard.",90,Umani Ronchi 2009 Casal di Serra Vecchie Vigne  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore)
"Rough, sinewy and oaky, this full-bodied wine is concentrated and thick, a robust expression of bitter black fruit and leather.",84,Beaulieu Vineyard 2013 Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros-Napa Valley)
"Grown in the southern section of the valley in the foothills of the Blue Mountains, this rare varietal bottling from this appellation shows aromas of cranberry, raspberry and citrus, along with some hints of oxidation. It's tart and full in feel, not seeming entirely varietally correct.",86,Lagana 2013 Breezy Slope Vineyard Pinot Noir (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Rustic and sweet, with a soft mouthfeel and candied cherry-berry flavors.",80,Finnegan's Lake 2007 Fin Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Earth, mud and wet clay are laid against a ripe black raspberry frame on this bottling from winemaker Larry Brooks. Plenty of life, zest and lift enliven the beautifully spiced palate, with bright red cherries, cranberries and purple flowers cut by a line of pencil-lead minerality and a savory fennel element.",93,Tolosa 2012 Marley Anne Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)
"The wine is totally dry and racy in acidity, with complex flavors of citrus fruits, peaches, apricots, grapefruits and peppery spices. What a lovely, savory wine to drink with just about everything from mussels to grilled swordfish to roasted chicken.",88,Claiborne & Churchill 2006 Pinot Gris (Central Coast)
"Santa Barbara-raised Steve Gerbac makes a winning white wine with aromas of scorched lemons, browned butter and vanilla, sliced down the middle with white rock minerality. Broad, oak-driven flavors at the tip of the palate quickly tighten into a line of lime zest acidity that lingers, with white pepper and chamomile spices emerging in the midpalate.",92,Rusack 2013 Reserve Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"With organically grown grapes from both Lake County (58%) and Mendocino (42%), this showcases the best of both regions. It has a great mix of lemon, grapefruit, honeydew and kiwi freshness that remains balanced on the finish. It's a quaffable summer wine.",88,Bonterra 2010 Made With Organic Grapes Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County-Mendocino County)
The Jonck family's wine is dense and still young with firm tannins. It has excellent potential because the ripe berry fruits are right there to give richness and flesh out the tannins. Spice and acidity fill the background. Drink this fine wine from 2019.,90,Château l'Espérance 2014 Espérance  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"There's no mistaking the high sweet spice character of the Traminer grape in this crisp, fresh aperitif-style wine. While the acidity is low, there is freshness from mandarin orange and lychee flavors. Screwcap.",87,Gunter Triebaumer 2007 Spätlese Traminer (Burgenland)
"This is all about buttered toast, buttered popcorn and orange- and pineapple-soda flavors. Fans of the popular style will love it.",85,Rutherford Hill 2010 Chardonnay (Carneros)
"87—89 Barrel sample. There's plenty of botrytis here, giving a wine with a great fresh burst of acidity along with the sweetness.",88,Château Guiraud 2006 Barrel sample  (Sauternes)
"Sourced from grapes grown in the Côte Chalonnaise, this is a soft, red-fruit-flavored wine, with a ripe, jammy character that makes it almost sweet. It is ready to drink.",86,Château de Santenay 2014 Vieilles Vignes  (Bourgogne)
"This one-time-only blanc de blancs is made from a Stony Hill Chardonnay clone planted in a single block of the producer's vineyard—since planted to Pinot Noir. This sparkler is sublime, the mousse silky and speckled in minerality. Lemon, pear and brine combine to good effect on the palate, buoying the exuberant fragrances of orange peel and cream pie.",94,Iron Horse 2010 Cuvée M Chardonnay (Green Valley)
"Tight at first, this has a fine tannin structure that wraps around the wine like a scarf. The aromatics come with force, with intoxicating wafts of violet, pepper and herb.",90,Terre Rouge 2009 High Slopes Syrah (Sierra Foothills)
"This is the latest release of Portugal's most iconic wine. It's made only in selected years (the last vintage was 2000) from Ferreira's Quinta da Leda in the Douro Superior. This new vintage is superb. It's a richly tarry wine laden with dark plum fruits and tannins that are just beginning to mature. It's a ripe and luscious, demanding attention, yet will still age for many years. Drink now, or hold until 2020.",99,Casa Ferreirinha 2004 Barca Velha Red (Douro)
"Made from Tannat and aged in new wood, this is a dense and tannic selection that boasts jammy fruit and an opulent feel. Vibrant and complex, it can be aged for 4–5 more years.",94,Alain Brumont 2003 Château Montus Cuvée Prestige Tannat (Madiran)
"A taste of charcuterie gives this Syrah a meaty, sweetish mid-palate, but it manages to finish dry, with a scour of coastal acidity. The famously pure Edna Valley fruit shows up as classic blackberries, spicy and tangy, while the tannins are significant. Give the wine until 2017–2018 to try to resolve its internal difficulties.",88,Peloton 2011 Jespersen Ranch Syrah (Edna Valley)
"Using Ripanço, an old technique of destemming the grapes after harvest with wooden rods, the wine has intense color and a smooth, rich character. It is rounded and soft, with a light layer of tannins offering backbone to the generous fruitiness. Drink after 2015.",89,José Maria da Fonseca 2013 Ripanço Private Selection Red (Alentejano)
"This is a crisp and fruity wine that's perfumed and full of citrus and green fruits. It has a lively character that is filled out with the ripe fruitiness of the vintage. The aftertaste, bright and fresh, suggests it will benefit from another few months. Drink from summer 2016.",85,Château Vrai Caillou 2015  Entre-Deux-Mers
"Made with 100% Trebbiano, this has fresh scents of white spring flower, orchard fruit and citrus. The vibrant palate delivers green apple, lemon zest, mineral and a hint of saline alongside an elegant perlage. It finishes bone dry.",91,Suavia NV Opera Semplice Metodo Classico Trebbiano (Vino Spumante)
"Roasted, rubbery aromas fold in olive and asphalt. The palate has a decent feel and herbal flavors of olive and leafy, mulchy black fruits. Herbs and black olive flavors work the finish as well.",83,Funky Llama 2010 Malbec (Mendoza)
"A happy tradition of Emilia-Romagna, this frizzante Lambrusco opens with foxy notes of raw grapes and blackberry. There's a touch of bitter almond on the close.",82,Moro di Rinaldini 2011 Picol Ross Brut Lambrusco (Emilia-Romagna)
"Bella Vida replaces the Abbey Ridge bottling and does so with pizzazz. The best of the 2011 releases, this is a beautiful expression of grapes grown on red clay soils, with refined, deeply penetrating flavors of ripe raspberries. Smooth, supple and long, with uncommon purity, it finishes with a kiss of chocolate from 18 months in one-quarter new oak barrels.",92,J. Christopher 2011 Bella Vida Vineyard Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Made in the Sleepy Hollow style, extraordinarily ripe, almost botrytized in apricot and honey flavors like a dessert wine, except that it's bone dry. Really epitomizes this vineyard and corner of Monterey, where Chard ripens to beautifully while maintaining acidity.",91,Testarossa 2006 Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"This plump, medium-bodied blend of Grenache blanc, Roussanne, Viognier, Clairette and Bourboulenc features notes reminiscent of ginger, nectarine and melon, then finishes with fresh, zesty citrus. Drink it through mid-2018.",88,M. Chapoutier 2016 Belleruche White (Côtes du Rhône)
"Rose petals and citrus on the nose give way to an elegant spin of honey, citrus and melon on the palate. A gentle white wine with a soft touch.",87,Zacharias 2015 Moschofilero (Peloponnese)
"This opens with aromas of pressed rose petal, underbrush, truffle, white pepper and leather. The already approachable palate delivers juicy black cherry, cooking spice and licorice. Drink through 2022.",92,Sordo 2012 Ravera  (Barolo)
"A single-clone, single-block cuvée, this is nonetheless complete and satisfying. Blackberry and black cherry fruit are dusted with cinnamon and allspice. A vein of cola and a whiff of sandalwood add further complexity. More elegant than powerful, this retains its balance through a medium-long finish.",90,Thistle 2012 Block 21 Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Showing new wood, this is a straight down the line red Bordeaux. The tannins are firm, maybe the wood gives a burnt character but the fruit comes through strongly, giving fresh, sweet blackberry juice flavors. A good, dry, but lively finish.",85,Barrière Frères 2006 Grand Bâteau  (Bordeaux)
"Deep salmon in color, this wine offers a bouquet of cantaloupe and nectarine. It is bright on entry, with full mouthfeel and flavors of pineapple, grapefruit and white peach that culminate in a bright citrus finish.",88,Van Ardi 2015 Estate Bottled Rosé (Armenia)
"Two thirds Tempranillo, this Spanish-style red blend is filled out with 17% Merlot, 6% Grenache, and 11% Cabernet Sauvignon. The fruit is dark and compact, but nicely framed with barrel spices that add some welcome sweetness. Tannins are hard and the finish brings in a broad swath of earth, tar and bark.",89,Brian Carter Cellars 2008 Corrida Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The intriguing nose suggests blue flower, scorched earth, smoke, spice and ripe dark fruit. The palate is subtle and reserved, revealing mature black cherry, ground black pepper and allspice alongside tightly knit, velvety tannins, with a decadent licorice note on the finish.",89,Ognissole 2011 Magnus Nero di Troia (Puglia)
"Notes of ripe Russet pear dominate nose and palate. The fresh body gives full rein to these ample lively fruit flavors. Zesty tangy freshness counters the full fruit and creates a lively, harmonious, moreish and refreshing wine. The finish is dry.",91,André Kientzler 2015 Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"This is a fruity wine with juicy acids and fresh black-currant and berry flavors. The tannins are present, but they are well integrated into the fruit and acidity. It's bright and ready to drink.",87,Georges Vigouroux 2010 Château Lafleur de Haute-Serre Malbec (Cahors)
"Rich gold in color. Broad, layered aromas of very ripe fruit with hints of sweet smoke, brown sugar, honey and a savory earthy minerality. Full-bodied, bone dry, but richly textured with crisp acidity and a wide palette of flavors, ripe stone fruit, a creamy savory earthiness, sage and a balsamic kick on the finish. Very long length, slightly warm but with a lingering savory, mineral finish.",90,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2007 Hunawihr Clos Windsbuhl Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Whiffs of orange blossoms add delicate floral flair to sweet marmalade and honey tones on this penetrating dessert Riesling. While creamy and sweet on the tongue, earthy mineral tones and piercing acidity add balance and structure. It's delicious now, but certainly an age-worthy wine that will develop gorgeously over the next two decades at least.",94,Schloss Vollrads 2010 Beerenauslese Riesling (Rheingau)
"Blended with a little Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah, this is a soft, sweet, peppery Merlot, filled with luscious, warm-climate flavors of black cherries, raspberries and chocolate. There's a lot of sweet, smoky oak, too. Drink up.",87,Robert Hall 2010 Merlot (Paso Robles)
"Big, friendly and wrapped in a lot of chocolatey oak. The fruit is forward and light, and it is just big enough to hang in there with all the barrel flavors. —P.G.",87,L'Ecole No. 41 2000 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"In this Bordeaux-style blend, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot comprise a quarter of the finished wine. However, it's almost weightless, with dilute flavors of leaf, herb and lemon.",85,Eight Bells 2011 David's Block Red Willow Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley)
"Lightly honeyed, this off-dry wine is complex while also fruity. Intense flavor fills the mouth with spice, yellow fruits, pineapple and a touch of mango. The fruits are balanced by the more nuanced honey and spice character that is finished with acidity. Gros Manseng, a native grape of this region, is worth getting to know. Drink this delicious wine from 2016.",91,Domaine du Tariquet 2014 Premières Grives Gros Manseng (Côtes de Gascogne)
"This wine is a blend of Syrah (76%), Grenache (21%) and Viognier (3%). Perfumed aromas of orange peel, flowers, spice and dark fruit lead to plump raspberry and smoked meat flavors. It needs time to unwind.",91,Gård 2013 Vaucluse Lawrence Vineyards Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A malty, full bouquet with good complexity announces this well-constructed wine. Pleasant citrus and hay flavors, medium weight and a good steady bead add to the package. A good clean finish with a grapefruit tang wraps it up.",88,Pacific Echo 1995 Private Reserve Brut  (Anderson Valley)
"Light and vibrant, this opens with aromas of fragrant spring flower, stone fruit and a suggestion of nutmeg. The palate offers white peach, apple and a hint of almond alongside crisp acidity.",87,Alois Lageder 2014 Müller-Thurgau (Alto Adige Valle Isarco)
"A soft product of a soft vintage, offering rich fruit as well as a crisp texture. The balance is just right: green apples and lime to go with yeast and acidity that lies neatly under everything. Age this excellent wine for 2–3 years.",91,Nicolas Feuillatte 2000 Cuvée Spéciale Millésimé Brut  (Champagne)
"Aromas of raspberry, plum, freshly ground black pepper, herb and wood spice lead to pure tart cranberry and cherry flavors that bring a compelling feel. The tannins bring a light squeeze. It's a lovely example of the variety.",91,Spring Valley Vineyard 2014 Estate Grown Malbec (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"The Kanonkop Pinotage does a beautiful job of maintaining the grape's unique indigenous character—on the nose you'll find trademark smoke, banana and plum, and on the palate, like flavors, with an added clove and leather touch. There's also an appealing cherry-mocha spin that gives the wine additional draw. Pair with smoky BBQ ribs, steak.",87,Kanonkop 2006 Pinotage (Simonsberg-Stellenbosch)
"Earthy compost and sage provide a rustic undertone to this well-made wine, dotted in cranberry, green tea and a hint of menthol. Medium bodied, it offers velvety texture and body within a graceful structure.",90,Saintsbury 2014 Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"Tastes rich and flashy now, with a rich array of oranges, pineapples and peaches, accented with oak. The acidity is just fine. Hanzell Chardonnays have a history of aging, so try stashing it for six years and see what happens.",88,Hanzell 2010 Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley)
"This starts with dense, murky, earthy aromas of stewed black fruits and rubber. In the mouth, it feels full and aggressive, with rubbery tannins supporting thick, herbal flavors of rooty black fruits. A chunky, chewy, layered finish is generous in every way.",88,Valle Secreto 2010 First Edition Syrah (Cachapoal Valley)
"Leesy aromas of tropical fruits, banana and canned peaches are sweet and candied but fair. Good acidity keeps this upright, while apple juice, peach and citrus flavors finish short but clean.",85,Echeverria 2014 Reserva Unwooded Chardonnay (Curicó Valley)
"This 2007 Brunello is a big, opulent pleasure bomb with lavish layers, loaded thickly on top of each other: Chocolate fudge, dark cherry, blackberry preserves, rum cake, prune, exotic spice, pipe tobacco, cola, humus and leather. It shows huge personality, intensity and staying power, too. All that density is backed by solid tannins and a steady firmness. Hold 10–15 years.",95,Casanova di Neri 2007  Brunello di Montalcino
"Herbs and spices dominate the nose, and the wine has an intriguing blend of 9% Petite Sirah, 2% Grenache and 2% Mourvèdre in it. Interesting and flavorful, though not entirely varietal in character. The mix of spices tastes a bit like a Provençal wine, and it's delicious for the price.",89,Kunde 1998 Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley)
"Soft and fruity, this is a ripe style of rosé. It's dry and peppery, with fresh acidity cutting through its rounded texture. It's a rosé for food, with a full aftertaste.",85,Wines & Winemakers 2013 Casa Ermelinda Freitas Monte de Baía Rosé (Península de Setúbal)
"Much more accessible than the winery's 2006 Syrah, this mixes muscle and meat, highlights from smaller component parts (Mourvèdre and Grenache) and overall clever blending. While bringing in the tart red fruit, the composted leaves, the moist loam and light funk of Washington Syrah, it also shows some pretty baking spices and a tight, precise finish.",91,:Nota Bene 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Lightly perfumed with hawthorn flower and orchard fruit aromas, this linear white offers flavors of green apple, lime and tangerine zest. Crisp acidity supports the palate while a mineral note closes the tangy finish.",89,Erste Neue 2014 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige)
"Silky, with pronounced tannins that should mellow in time, this is an earthy, stemmy and perfumed wine. Succulent and balanced, it's brightly exuberant in black cherry yet brooding and complex throughout, changing slightly from savory to floral and back again. It's an incredible wine out of the gate; cellar with confidence, through 2021.",96,Williams Selyem 2013 Olivet Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"From a historic producer who has done much work to promote Verdicchio and the Marche region around the world, San Sisto is among the most sophisticated expressions of the variety. Matured in barrel, the deeply golden colored and saturated wine is redolent of vanilla, nut, mature melon and chewy caramel.",90,Fazi Battaglia 2001 San Sisto Riserva  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico)
"Lavender and ripe black-cherry aromas are enticing on this Pinot Noir. Dry and full bodied, it doesn't have a lot of concentration, but it's softly fruity, with hints of soil and autumn leaf.",84,Macedon 2010 Pinot Noir (Tikves)
"Assembled from dozens of individual lots, this sumptuous brut is an example of the art of blending. Based on Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, it's really as delicious and refined a sparkling wine as you could want for drinking now. Shows lush citrus, strawberry, honey, melon, fig and spice flavors that are wrapped into a smooth, silky bubbling mouthfeel.",92,Mumm Napa NV Brut Prestige Sparkling (Napa Valley)
"Reserved on the nose, this Cabernet shows aromas of forest floor, spice and root beer along with herbal berry fruits. A blocky rubbery round palate houses a mix of herbal berry and prune flavors, while this is earthy and showing a bit of oxidation on the finish.",89,Casas del Toqui 2012 Gran Toqui Cabernet Sauvignon (Cachapoal Valley)
"Very fruity and fresh in aroma, this elegant wine has light, crisp apple and lemon flavors, fresh-baked bread accents and lively acidity. A layered texture seems to blend in accents of almond and vanilla, increasing complexity with each sip. It's one of California's blue-chip bubblies.",95,Roederer Estate 2007 Brut L'Ermitage Estate Bottled Sparkling (Anderson Valley)
"Tradizione stands out in a crowd of Brunellos thanks to that extra layer of intensity and richness it offers in both the nose and mouth. Ripe fruit, leather, prune and tobacco build momentum on the finish.",91,Tenuta Vitanza 2008 Tradizione  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"A rich layer of caramelized honey penetrates through bristling limes, lemons and tangerines in this sprightly medium-sweet Riesling. It's light as a feather yet pulsating with sweet yellow peach and apricot flavors. Vibrantly acidic but nuanced and substantial, it drinks gorgeously now but has enough substance to age well through at least 2025.",94,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt 2014 Graach Josephshöfer Monopol Spätlese Grosse Lage Riesling (Mosel)
"Slightly creamy blossom and peach hints mark the nose of this wine. The palate is gently fruited—dry and light with a lovely aromatic aura of honeysuckle, jasmin, peach and lemon. Lithe and bright, it's perfect for a summer night.",91,Stadlmann 2016 Kapellenweg Gelber Muskateller (Niederösterreich)
"Fantastically bright acidity defines this wine, the winery's “finest selection,” which is memorable for its crisp black cherry and strawberry core of fruit. Voluptuous and silky on the palate, it carries a hint of Asian spice throughout, the slightest taste of wild vanilla wrapping things up on the finish.",92,De Loach 2012 OFS Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This smells a bit wayward and sulfuric, but it's juicy and acidic on the tongue, with lemony and oily, nutty flavors. It holds steady on the finish, which is lemony in character.",84,Altozano 2010 Finca Constancia Verdejo-Sauvignon Blanc (Toledo)
"Enormous tannins, dominant black fruit and a solid, dense structure. The wine, packed with dark fruits, dry tannins, very firm in character. With its huge tannins as well as fruit, this is a wine that really needs many years of aging.",96,Château Montrose 2009  Saint-Estèphe
"Round and juicy, this opens with aromas of stone fruit, dried herb and a whiff of pear. The ripe, enveloping palate doles out white peach, mature apple, juicy nectarine and a hint of bitter almond. A mineral note closes the lingering finish.",91,Gradis'ciutta 2015 Pinot Grigio (Collio)
"This is a successful expression of Pinot Grigio thanks to the wine's easy but studied sophistication and its creamy mouthfeel. Food-friendly and upfront, it would make a good match to seafood or white meat.",88,Abbazia di Novacella 2009 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige)
"An almost medicinal, tart wine that certainly has the dry texture of botrytis, but then shows more in the way of a herbal character.",86,Château Caillou 2006  Sauternes
"This creamy, rounded wine shows soft spice, baked apple and nutmeg flavors. It is rich, medium-dry in character and softly textured.",85,Wunsch & Mann 2011 Saint-Rémy Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"A high toast wine, the fruit and fresh acidity submerged beneath the wood. At the present, it is hard to enjoy, but in 2–3 years the fruit will kick in. It would be good if the producer had been less enthusiastic about the wood.",88,Château de Candale 2007  Saint-Émilion
"The storied Carneros producer dips a toe into Oregon with this new release. It's got ample herbal aromatics and bright, brambly berry fruit, with cinnamon-stick highlights. Quite young and tight, it has a few rough edges to be smoothed out with additional bottle age. This will drink best from 2020–2025.",91,Etude 2013 Yamhill Vista Vineyard Pinot Noir
"Mint and dark black fruit aromas lead to an elegant wine. It has solid tannins balanced by an open fruity character. The acids, tannins and touches of spice promise aging for at least another 4–5 years.",90,Château de France 2006  Pessac-Léognan
"Radiant and earthy, this blend of Frappato and Nero d'Avola boasts enticing scents suggesting dark-skinned berry, leather, sunbaked earth, sea breeze and a floral note. The creamy, succulent palate doles out juicy black cherry, black raspberry, white pepper and aromatic herb alongside supple tannins and fresh acidity. A saline note wraps up the finish. Drink 2017–2024.",95,COS 2014 Pithos Rosso Red (Vittoria)
"Aromas of spiced tomato, clove and rubber gloves don't click or suggest much quality. A cloying, sugary palate with mucky berry flavors is less than stellar, as is a sticky finish that tastes like strawberry jam.",81,Terra Andina 2012 Bold Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley)
"Rich, thick and velvety, this has a wealth of heightened acidity to buoy the more intense aspects. The wine hails from the mighty vineyard overlooking Sonoma Valley, which will, going forward, be within the new Moon Mountain AVA. Coconut macaroon and dark chocolate mark it from start to full-bodied finish.",90,Louis M. Martini 2011 Monte Rosso Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley)
"Although there's no oak on this wine, it has a spicy smokiness that could come from a drop of Grenache. There are also percentages of Chardonnay and Pinot Gris that fatten Sauvignon's minerals and limes. Acidity is mouthwateringly high. This isn't a great wine, but it is a unique one, especially for Santa Rita Hills.",87,Babcock 2009 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Sta. Rita Hills)
"With production of more than 51,000 cases, this Cabernet will wash down lots of steaks and burgers. It's softly tannic in the mouth, with easy flavors of blackberry tea and oak.",85,Frei Brothers 2011 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Aromas of red licorice candy and raspberry are fruity, forward and clean. The palate is more than competent and balanced, with creamy strawberry and raspberry flavors. The finish is short but easy, and for the price that's all you can ask for.",87,Manyana 2008 Tempranillo (Cariñena)
"Black cherry, chocolate and menthol accents color the nose of this ripe and plump Barbera d'Alba. The wine is firm and generous in the mouth with a chewy, slightly sweet finish. It sees one year of oak for extra spice on the close.",88,Luigi Baudana 2006 Donatella  (Barbera d'Alba)
"A wine of medium weight and alcohol that tastes bigger on the palate due to the tannins. There's dullness to the fruit, which shows blackberry and cherry amidst a trace of clove before a hint of greenness on the finish.",84,Billhook 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Chardonnay from the Loire spotlights the grape at its freshest. This lightly vanilla flavored wine is dominated by apple and pear flavors. The smooth texture is pierced with tight, mineral acidity that makes the wine so fruity and crisp. Drink now and until 2017.",84,Domaine de la Grange 2010 Domaine R de la Grange Chardonnay (Vin de Pays du Val de Loire)
"This is a soft, fragrant wine, with attractive acidity, creamy apples and fresh acidity. The Chardonnay gives a rounded character while also keeping the tight, mineral texture at the end.",86,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal 2008 Loridos Extra-Bruto Chardonnay (Vinho Espumante de Qualidade)
"A mix of Cabernet, Cab Franc and Syrah, this out-of-the-ordinary blend is a little funky and meaty, but still offers lots of juicy black fruit and a whole lot of toasted oak. If any one thing announces itself here it's the wood, which keeps everything austere and maybe a touch overcharred.",89,Cain 1997 Concept Red (Napa Valley)
"This wine aims to call attention to the tendency of Clone 17 (also known as the Robert Young clone) to provide baked apple and ripe, almond flavors and aromas, which this bottling does, in spades. Caramel, oak and vanilla round out the rest of the experience, which is balanced, but big in ripeness and wood.",88,Chalk Hill 2012 Clone 17 Chardonnay (Chalk Hill)
"The wine is firm and structured while still having fresh juicy fruitiness. Wood and fruit tannins give a dense core of dryness, leaving the acidity and red berry fruits still developing. From one of the best Premier Crus in Pommard, this will be best drunk after 2018.",91,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2012 Les Rugiens Premier Cru  (Pommard)
"Not a big, overwhelming blockbuster, this harmonious blend of equal parts Grenache Blanc, Roussanne, Clairette and Bourboulenc features ripe citrus and pineapple flavors, with a hint of melon thrown in for good measure. It's pleasantly medium bodied and creamy in the mouth, with a reasonably long finish. Drink it over the next 12–18 months.",90,Réserve des Oliviers 2009 White (Châteauneuf-du-Pape)
"A richly liquorous wine, ripe and packed with harmonious sweet textures. At the same time over the ripe structure there is a layer of lively lemon, spice and ginger, spiked with fresh tangerines. The end result is smooth, balanced and vibrant.",93,Château Doisy-Védrines 2006  Barsac
"An oversupply of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc has led to bargains like this wine, which delivers nectarine and white grapefruit flavors in a medium-bodied format. It's plump on the palate, then turns zippy and citrusy on the finish.",87,Dashwood 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"This superrich wine has luscious plum fruits, cushioned tannins and a ripe character. Full black cherries bring out the density and the solid backdrop. It can be drunk now, but will be better from 2016.",89,Henry Fessy 2012  Moulin-à-Vent
"This is a seriously beautiful Chianti Classico characterized by impressive elegance and a smooth, long feel that lasts many long minutes on the palate. The nose is equally pristine with bright but integrated aromas of dark fruit, spice and polished river stone.",92,Castello di Ama 2006  Chianti Classico
"Subdued aromas of scorched earth, dark cooking spice, black currant and a whiff of game emerge in the glass. The ripe palate offers mature dark-skinned berry, vanilla, tobacco and toast alongside mellow tannins. Drink through 2018.",89,Elena Walch 2011 Kastelaz Riserva Merlot (Alto Adige)
"Rich red fruits combine with good acidity, raspberry flavors and soft tannins. Ripe and juicy, it shows great fruitiness at the end.",88,Alex Gambal 2011 Cuvée des Deux Papis  (Bourgogne)
"Made entirely with Syrah, this has subdued aromas of blackberry and a suggestion of sandalwood. The dense palate offers dried black cherry, black pepper and oak alongside round tannins. Drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit.",87,Conti di Sn Bonifacio 2012 Sustinet Syrah (Toscana)
"Done entirely in stainless tanks, this fruity wine offers spring fresh flavors of citrus, pineapple and green melon. With barely perceptible residual sugar, the acids keep it lip-smacking and lively. There is just a hint of buttery caramel at the core.",88,Chehalem 2015 INOX Unoaked Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
"Grassy to the point of excess, this wine's lean, herbal flavors and lemony acids are tart and mouthpuckering.",82,Woollaston 2001 Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Nelson)
"Marked by fresh fruity acids and primary tastes of raspberries, cherries and cola, this is a pleasantly dry Pinot Noir. It's an everyday type that shows the silkiness of the variety.",84,La Crema 2008 Pinot Noir (Monterey)
"This is an unusual, exotic take on Malbec. The bouquet delivers cardamom, sandalwood and spiced black currant aromas. In the mouth, it's grabby with pinching tannins. Blueberry and cardamom flavors end ripe, with decent follow through. Drink now.",90,Ricominciare 2009 Altísimo Malbec (Uco Valley)
"Lemon, blossoms and a slight kerosene nose lead into a prickly, slippery texture, with lemon-lime and wet stone flavors. A classic example of Clare Valley Riesling.",89,Wakefield 2016 St. Andrews Riesling (Clare Valley)
"This Pinot falls on the lean side of the fence, with firm acid and tannins and mature flavors reminiscent of old-style European wines. It has a slightly tawny color at the edge, a brick color in the middle, earthy-oaky aromas, and lean cranberry and cedar flavors.",85,Naughty Boy 2010 Pinot Noir (Potter Valley)
"Despite cool conditions in 2013, this wine is sufficiently dense, ripe and strapping, with full berry and cassis aromas along with grit and animal notes. The palate is rugged, high in acidity and a touch hollow in the middle. Rattling flavors of blackberry and cassis finish edgy and gripping. Best from 2018–2025.",89,Pagos del Rey 2013 Gran Bajoz Viñas Viejas  (Toro)
"Young and loaded with primary fruit flavors—fresh-picked cherries right off the tree, red delicious apples, just-made cranberry sauce—this is lovely now but built for the long term. The 13.6% alcohol listed is verified by the juicy acidity and just a touch of herb in the back of the finish.",90,Lange 2009 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"A hint of lightly toasted brioche adds depth to the red apple and honeydew fruit aromas and flavors. The mouthfeel is surprisingly round, fleshed out by the rich fruit flavors, but then picks up some verve on the lightly bitter, pithy finish. Drink now.",86,Ngumu 2015 Chenin Blanc (Western Cape)
"With big, ripe fruits, this powerful wine oozes rich plum and spice flavors. It is dark and intense, concentrated with both acidity and wood aging. A line of freshness gives this dense wine an impressive lift of raspberry and red currant flavors. Drink from 2021.",93,Louis Jadot 2013 Petite Chapelle Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin)
"This is rich and rounded, touched by a note of vanilla that softens the natural texture and acidity. It's ripe yet still with refreshing, with juicy acidity on the finish. Age this for a year for even better drinkability.",88,Nathalie et Gilles Fèvre 2010  Chablis
"Palmela is the region just south of Lisbon, producing light, fresh wines that are both great values and great everyday drinking. The strawberry fruit flavors are immediately appealing, freshened by the acidity.",86,Companhia das Quintas 2000 Pegos Claros Castelão (Palmela)
"Aromas of cassis and black pepper follow through to the light-bodied but savory palate along with juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry and star anise. Supple tannins give it an easy-drinking texture. Enjoy soon.",90,Monte del Frà 2016 Lena di Mezzo  (Valpolicella Classico)
"Frankly delicious, a wine with the most decadent profile. Just erupts with only-in-California black currant, cassis, black cherry, chocolate, red plum jam and smoky cedar flavors that testify to the finest viticulture. For all that, the wine is quite soft and sweet. Give it greater structure, and the score would soar.",90,Vice Versa 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Delightful and delicious, this opens with aromas of violet, red berry, cake spice and an earthy whiff of moist soil. The polished palate offers juicy red cherry, crushed strawberry, orange peel and cinnamon while bright acidity and silky tannins provide balance.",90,Casale Daviddi 2014  Rosso di Montepulciano
"Initially plush, rounded sweet yellow apple and lemon drop flavors get a kick of acidity on the midpalate of this bright, fruity wine. Fresh and precisely framed, its finish is piercing and linear. Drink now through 2019.",89,J. Bäumer 2015 Rhein Riesling (Germany)
"This is a high acid, dry and minerally Chardonnay that you can call Chablisian. It has flavors of grilled lemons, limes and pineapples, with richer notes of sweet oak and lees and the buttered toast of oak. Defined by elegance, it should develop bottle complexities over the next three or four years.",90,Pine Ridge 2007 Dijon Clones Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Aldegheri, one of the most important producers in Valpolicella, has released a 17-year-old wine that has spent eight years in large oak casks and the rest in bottle. This fascinating expression offers a glimpse of Amarone history, but does so with elegance and grace. With the fruity sweetness long gone, this now boasts a tight, linear mineral note and dusty aromas of candied fruit, licorice, cola and smoke.",94,Aldegheri 1995  Amarone della Valpolicella
"This easy-drinking Primitivo opens with dark, inky concentration and sweet aromas of ripe fruit, cinnamon and nutmeg. The mouthfeel is plush, rich and velvety soft.",88,Botter 2010 Caleo Primitivo (Salento)
"Some nice toasty flavors underscore generic fruit. When all is said and done, it is a neutral, crisp white wine enlivened with a bit of spice and toast from the barrel aging. Still, a bit of veggie/canned pea flavor dampens the finish.",84,Weisinger's of Ashland 1999 50% CH / 50% SEM Semillon-Chardonnay (Rogue Valley)
"Notes of ripe, juicy mulberry and aromatic forest berries create an appealing nose. With some of that same juiciness, the palate manages to be full-fruited but utterly light. The tannins are a gossamer veil, while the midpalate offers a juicy core of freshness, darker hints of black cherry and a little smoke. This wine has poise and juiciness in equal measure.",91,Umathum 2015 St. Laurent (Burgenland)
"Tangy blueberry fruit tones show on the nose of this bottling, with caramel and floral accents. There's snappy black fruit on the palate, where powerful acidity keeps the wine dancing across the tongue.",88,Sevtap 2013 My Love Cabernet Sauvignon (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
"The aromas of cocoa, vanilla, coconut and dried herbs are still quite locked up, with the oak out front. The cherry flavors are dense, plush and layered, with vanilla and other barrel spices speckled throughout. It provides plenty of immediate appeal but will only benefit from some time in the cellar; best after 2019.",93,Pursued by Bear 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A bright, herbaceous and fresh wine, showing green fruits, lively acidity and and a steely edge that adds a fine texture.",87,Château Rousset-Caillau 2011  Entre-Deux-Mers
Very varietal aromas of sour cherry and cranberry lead to a fruit-filled flavorful palate. Light oak accents linger on the finish. It's a very pleasing example of the variety.,90,Vino La Monarcha 2014 Sangiovese (Wahluke Slope)
"Here's a super-modern and thoroughly lovable style of Barbera with intense and complex notes of milk chocolate, big black berry spice and espresso coffee. This wine stands tall among a new school of Barbera producers who have opted for a soft and extracted interpretation of this otherwise thorny and acidic grape.",92,Braida di Giacomo Bologna 2007 Bricco della Bigotta  (Barbera d'Asti)
"An opulent nose of oranges, ripe lemons and flowers leads this elegant white. The mouthfeel is complex with layers of citrus, tropical fruit and a spin of saline to tie it together.",87,Greek Wine Cellars 2015 Assyrtiko (Santorini)
"This intriguing blend of Falanghina, Biancolella and Pepella (three relatively unknown indigenous grapes) has a candy- or soda-like quality that recalls butterscotch and caramel. However, those notes are balanced by an elegant mineral tone and the wine has good dimension on the close.",85,Tenuta San Francesco 2007 Tramonti White (Campania)
"Funky, with mushroom and sweaty leather aromas that can best be described as Burgundian. But it's richly sweet in raspberries and cherries, and the smoky oak is nicely integrated with the fruit. A pleasant Pinot Noir to drink now.",87,Lane Tanner 2009 Julia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"This is a throwback to those brash, flavor-exuding Aussie wines of the past. Flashy, sweet-scented oak (think maple syrup and toasted coconut) marks the nose, while concentrated cassis and vanilla flavors coat the palate. This is big, but gorgeously so, with velvety-rich tannins and a long, plush finish. No, there's nothing subtle about this blend of 60% Cabernet and 40% Shiraz, but sometimes subtlety is overrated. Drink now–2030.",95,Heartland 2013 One Red (Langhorne Creek)
"Green hints of moss and ivy play with notes of wet pebble. This is playful and lively, fresh and so easy to drink. Enjoy while the flavors are at their aromatic peak.",88,H. & M. Hofer 2015 Freiberg Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"This really elegant Pinot Noir has good color as well as a perfumed, aromatic character. The fruit is ripe cherries, supported by a light tannic layer. Acidity gives this wine freshness as well as suggesting that it could age. Drink from 2017.",92,Roger et Didier Raimbault 2013  Sancerre
"Tough cherry and plum aromas lead it off, followed by simple, semitart raspberry flavors. There's not much depth or complexity; the palate bounces along inoffensively, and the finish is quick and light. Clean and basic wine.",84,Doña Paula 2008 Los Cardos Syrah (Mendoza)
"A little sharp and brusque, with a pinched finish. But it's dry and fruity enough, offering ripe layers of blackberries, cherries and plums. Drink now.",86,Newton 2008 Red Label Claret (Napa County)
"This is an easy, clean and direct Sauvy, with fresh notes of lime, tart gooseberry and green plum on the nose and mouth. The palate is lively and bright, finishing mouthwatering and refreshing. Drink now.",88,DeMorgenzon 2014 DMZ Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape)
"Grassy lemon-lime aromas are alert and bright. A fresh, fruity palate is home to mild apple, pear and lees flavors. On the finish, this Cava is lasting, steady and ordinary in a welcome, textbook way.",87,Segura Viudas NV Brut Sparkling (Cava)
"Vranken's releases seem to be bucking the trend towards drier Champagnes. This wine is soft and obviously the dosage is high. It is balanced and the fresh creamed apple flavors and light texture all work well together. It is in a light style, ready to drink.",87,Vranken NV Diamant Brut  (Champagne)
"Dark in color and voluptuous in body and texture, this wine was aged in French oak, 35% of it new. With a sizable presence on the palate, it generously reveals brooding flavors of apple and pear.",90,Landmark 2014 Flocchini Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"An excellent wine for drinking now. It's dry and fruity, with a meaty, fleshy texture housing flavors of blackberries, cherries, herbs and oak. Fine enough to drink with a good steak.",88,Peter Paul Wines 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This superripe wine is a blast of blackberry, cherry and blueberry fruit, puréed in the blender and then sprinkled with a dusting of cocoa and white pepper. But it's too sweet by far, and too soft, lacking the structure for balance.",83,Pianetta 2004 Syrah (Monterey)
"With a caramel character and light, bright acidity, this is a soft, not-quite-dry wine. It has a warm, open and accessible feel to it, light and fruity on the finish.",86,Sables d'Azur 2015 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This is a new wine from one of Chile's most consistent producers, and it's quite the saturated bruiser. The color is deep purple, while the nose is raw and heavy, with deep fruit and plenty of bacon-like character. The mouth is like blackberry pie, while the feel is full and tannic, although not at all offensive or tough. The finish is dark, brooding and just a little bitter. An interesting new entry to Chile's roster, and one that's very well oaked.",88,Lapostolle 2001 Cuvée Alexandre Syrah (Rapel Valley)
"Honeyed in character, this has notes of toast, sweet tropical fruit and lemon, with light acidity. The wine feels warm, ripe, open and drinkable now.",88,Henri de Villamont 2009  Rully
"Soft notes of juicy, yellow pear on nose and palate make this a friendly, off-dry and appetizing wine. The body is rounded but toned, while the fruit notes are fresh and juicy. Drink soon to make most of those pure pear notes.",89,Jean-Marc Bernhard 2015 Cuvée Particulière Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"This single-vineyard blend includes Pinot Gris, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc Musque, from a one-acre site in the Columbia Gorge AVA. It's labeled as a field blend, which suggests that the grapes were co-fermented; the results are harmonious and quite appealing. The mix of crisp citrus and tart pear fruit is set against flinty acids that set up the taste buds for chèvre or light seafood.",89,Viento 2006 Allegre Vineyard Verona White White (Columbia Gorge (OR))
"On the nose, this everyday SB delivers pungency and citrusy green-fruit scents. The mouthfeel is racy, while flavors of lime, passion fruit and grapefruit finish zesty and with green, herbal notes of thyme and oregano.",87,Undurraga 2013 Aliwen Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley)
"This Cabernet Sauvignon's char, vanilla, caramel, toast, herb and dark fruit scents are followed by equal parts fruit and barrel flavors. It delivers enjoyment notwithstanding the heavy oak influence, which may yet integrate in the bottle.",89,Woodward Canyon 2013 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This is a spicy, lushly textured wine with concentrated aromas and flavors of black berries, bramble, chocolate, chicory and coffee. Ripe, dark fruit and berry flavors linger into the medium-length finish, with a soft note of  earthy spice on the back.",86,Barista 2011 Pinotage (Western Cape)
"Made predominantly with Chardonnay, this opens with aromas of lemon zest, acacia honey and a toasted note. The lively elegant palate offers yellow apple, apricot, vanilla and a touch of baking spice. It's well balanced, with bright acidity.",90,Elena Walch 2014 Beyond the Clouds Chardonnay (Alto Adige)
"This is taut and mineral, with hidden power. It's very closed at this stage. It's a wine with acidity and notes of green fruits and crisp apples, with just a touch of wood. This will age for many years.",95,Domaine Jean-Paul et Benoît Droin 2010 Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis)
"The yellow color and doughnutty, honeyed aromas give it away: this is barrel-fermented, Bordeaux-style SB. The nose is barrique heaven, but the vanilla and resin qualities are stylish. Creamy but balanced in the mouth, with flavors of oak, vanilla, spice, honey and baked apple. Smooth stuff but very oaky, and not for everyone.",88,François Lurton 2008 Hacienda Araucano Humo Blanco Sauvignon Blanc (Lolol Valley)
"Medium bodied and dry, this has a savory spiciness, with long-lasting flavors of cherry and smoky, vanilla-scented oak. A coating of finely ground tannins gives it enough bite to accompany steak. One of the best Cabernet Francs from the Russian River Valley in a long time.",90,Bailiwick 2010 Cabernet Franc (Russian River Valley)
"Light, citrusy aromas also are suggestive of bath soap. The feel is juicy yet innocuous, while flavors of tropical fruits finish mild and simple. This is the definition of a quaffing wine.",84,Callia 2013 Alta Pinot Grigio (Tulum Valley)
"This is the annual release of a small, isolated vineyard block that's dry-farmed and named for the winemaker. The unctuous bottling shows luxurious aromas of baked black cherries, cinnamon, clove, cream and a touch of iron. The rich dark red-fruit flavors show on the sip, where the surrounding chaparral herbs invade the palate, offering dried sagebrush, eucalyptus and a wild mint sensation that last deep into the finish.",93,Boekenoogen 2014 Garrett's Vineyard Dryland Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"This shows patented bold blackberry aromas of Cabernet but also herbal, spicy, leafy notes as well. A crisp but thorough palate features pointy acidity, while herbal flavors of cassis, plum, spice, pepper and chocolate finish crisp and a bit sharp. Drink through 2022.",89,Andeluna 2012 Altitud Cabernet Sauvignon (Tupungato)
"Here's an interesting Brunello that recalls moist notes of forest floor and white mushroom, backed by cherry and wild berry. The wine opens with dense concentration and a dark ruby color. It ends with a long, polished feel.",91,Le Chiuse 2006  Brunello di Montalcino
"Savory, peppery spice and plummy fruit turn up in equal measure. This is gutsy and fruity, and its bright acidity will make it a winner on the table, where the subtle but firm tannins will also come in handy. A vibrant and versatile wine.",88,Kirnbauer 2011 Das Phantom Red (Burgenland)
This is the producer's most popular wine in Portugal. A touch of oak aging adds spice to the easygoing tannin and red-berry fruit flavors. It's easy to drink and ready now.,85,Borges 2015 Meia Encosta Red (Dão)
"Comprised of 48% Cabernet Sauvignon, 47% Merlot and 2.5% each of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this Santa Clara Valley red is bursting with rich, big fruit, ending with a quick finish.",87,Jason-Stephens 2007 Estate Meritage (Santa Clara Valley)
"A non-vintage blend of 42% Cabernet Franc, 29% Cabernet Sauvignon and 29% Sangiovese, this is built upon strong, herbal tannins. The addition of the Sangiovese brings in fat, buttery oak flavors that linger through the finish.",87,Sleight of Hand NV Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Dense planting for this vineyard has resulted in a wine that has greater concentration than in the past. The wine has firm tannins, while showing already delicious black-currant fruit. For drinking over the next 2–4 years.",87,Pezat 2011  Bordeaux Supérieur
"Dark purple in color, this Syrah-led blend with 15% Monastrell is jammy, toasty, herbal and minty green on the nose. A muscular, rubbery and tannic palate features blackberry flavors backed by a blackened finish of bitter coffee and herbal notes.",87,Monterebro 2012 Selección Syrah (Jumilla)
"This 100% varietal wine shines with high-toned red currant and raspberry flavors, exhibiting bright acidity on the moderately built palate. Tight-grained tannin provides structure, balancing the emphatic fruit.",92,Vineyard 36 2013 Thirty Six Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This shows a dry, leathery flavor, plus notes of sour cherry candy, mineral and cola. There are also oak-derived tones of caramel and vanilla. The mouthfeel is tart and tannic, but it's also elegant. Let this Pinot Noir decant, which will help it mellow.",88,Mahoney 2010 Estate Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"This light rosé is scented with rosewater, melon and strawberry. Finished dry and nicely structured.",86,Waterbrook 2006 Rosé Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA))
"As classy a bottle as you might expect from veteran winemaker Laurent Montalieu. Once again the fruit is crystal clear, setting up fresh pear, green apple and pink grapefruit flavors against crisp, juicy acidity. The finish is lively and spicy.",91,Soléna 2008 Pinot Gris (Oregon)
"This 75-25 blend of Chardonnay and Grillo (aged only in stainless steel) makes a great companion to fresh seafood dishes. The wine offers loads of citrus and pear notes, with a chalky mineral overtone and bright acidity.",88,Baglio del Cristo di Campobello 2011 Adènzia White (Sicilia)
"This amber-hued wine is Josko Gravner's calling card, and it not only helped kickoff Italy's orange wine movement, but it put the native grape Ribolla Gialla on the map. Delivering dried apricot, orange zest, saline, resin, ginger, anise, dried herb, nut and a blast of smoky mineral, it has an extreme character. While it's not for everyone, it's an impressive effort that combines structure, restraint, depth and complexity. Serve only slightly chilled. Drink through 2027.",93,Gravner 2007 Ribolla Ribolla Gialla (Venezia Giulia)
"Grenache makes up half of this wine, with the rest equal parts Counoise and Cabernet Sauvignon. Herb, cherry, clove and pencil-eraser aromas lead to plump yet delicate red-fruit flavors that linger on the finish. It's a very pretty wine.",90,Robert Ramsay 2013 La Previa Red (Snipes Mountain)
Aromas of black cherry and smoked meats lead to tastes of black cherry and vanilla. It is soft both on entry and finish.,85,Avia 2014 Hand Harvested Estate Bottled Pinot Noir (Primorska)
"This 100% Cabernet is tannic, acidic and dry, yet remarkably fruity as well. It shows a classic cool-climate Napa structure, with blackberry, currant and oak flavors. It's not yet ready to drink, so give it at least six years in the cellar, and possibly far longer.",90,Faust 2009 The Pact Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"New oak accounts for only 30% of the barrel regimen, but it dominates this Chardonnay, with buttered toast, vanilla and caramel flavors. Fortunately there's also strong pineapple, Asian pear and apricot fruit, but the oak is too powerful.",85,De Loach 2010 OFS Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This structured wine has a severe aspect, with dry wood and fruit tannins. The fruit is there, smoky and with considerable acidity. It's a wine that will remain serious as it ages. Wait to drink until 2018.",89,Château Beauséjour 2013  Fronsac
"Concentrated aromas of blackberry come with leather and dried-cheese scents. The palate is full in depth and solid in feel, with flavors of creamy oak, medicinality and blackberry. Feels rich, grabby and tastes resiny on the finish, but there's enough solid black fruit to override the oak.",87,Altocedro 2011 Año Cero Malbec (La Consulta)
"Made from grapes sourced from the Gebling Vineyard, this has broad, ripe yellow fruit and a touch of spice. With its rich mouthfeel, it is a serious wine, both complex and intense. Age for at least a year. Screwcap.",91,Hermann Moser 2011 Fortissimo Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"Mastroberardino has created an easygoing Aglianico with defined aromas of wild berry, spice, resin and black pepper. The wine is lean and compact in the mouth with a streamlined feel and a crisp, bright finish.",87,Mastroberardino 2007 Aglianico (Campania)
"This overly generous Cabernet Franc is supported by 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. Oak, pepper and herb characterize the aromas and flavors, with meatiness competing against notes of cedar. Soft, supple and brawny, the wine finishes in a hurry.",86,Kenefick Ranch 2011 Caitlin's Select Cabernet Franc (Calistoga)
"Right from the start there is a supreme and appetizing tanginess to the fruit. The nose shows orange flesh and zest, the palate counters this with intense grapefruit zestiness. Between these poles there is ample, ripe and juicy citrus—think tangerine and orange. The finish is long, lip-smacking, totally refreshing and fruitful.",92,Jäger 2015 Achleiten Smaragd Riesling (Wachau)
"The fruit bursts out of the glass, while the supporting tannins give power and intensity to this concentrated wine. It has all the richness of 2005, backed with juicy red fruits and some vibrant acidity. Age this wine, although its generous character means you could drink it in 5 years. Not available in the U.S.",92,Bouchard Aîné & Fils 2005  Echézeaux
"This is an impressive still young wine. With its dense texture and powerful tannins it is concentrated, packed with ripe berry flavors and juicy acidity. It is bold, certainly not reticent, made for some long-term aging. Drink from 2018.",92,Herdade do Rocim 2012 Olho de Mocho Reserva Red (Alentejano)
"Juicy and extracted, with bright jam tones and an open-knit structure. There's plenty of berry fruit here and a nice plum tone to the palate that carries over to the fleeting finish. A good choice for a big crowd.",86,Hellbent 2008 Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia)
"This premier cru is on the cooler left bank of the Serein river, making this vintage a crisply mineral wine that's tight with zesty lemon and fine crisp acidity. The hints of yellow fruits are still to develop. The wine is structured and needs to age, so drink from 2018.",92,Jean-Marc Brocard 2015 Vau de Vey Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"Rich and broad in the mouth, with notes of honeyed citrus reminiscent of tangerine and a tang of peppery spice. The finish is warm, spicy and long, with a hint of vanilla oak. Drink it now and over the next year or two for its undeniable richness.",90,Tardieu-Laurent 2009 Vieilles Vignes White (Châteauneuf-du-Pape)
"This blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon offers fresh blackberries on cold slate and a light herbal character with dill, oregano and tarragon. A minty quality carries into the sip, where black plum, pepper dust and light tar show.",88,Cooper-Garrod 2011 Test Pilot Red (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Warm earthy ripe aromas of raisin, baked berry fruits and prune are typical of Jumilla and Monastrell, which is 85% of this blend along with 15% Syrah. Punchy and tannic, but not fierce, this is ripe and tastes of raisin, prune and dried herbs. A lasting finish is raisiny and choppy.",89,Monterebro 2013 Crianza Monastrell-Syrah (Jumilla)
"Red cherry meets with tar, wet herbs and cinnamon stick on the nose of this wine. Framed by a decent tannic structure, the palate boasts flavors of more red cherry and thyme.",86,Danza del Sol 2011 Sangiovese (California)
"Sweet and simple, with pineapple and apricot jam flavors.",82,Glen Ellen 2010 Proprietor's Reserve Chardonnay (California)
"There is a good structure here, plenty to support the fresh fruits and red-berry flavors. This wine is full of fresh acidity with fruit and tannins in balance. It's going to develop well, always full of fruit and attractive acidity. Drink from 2018.",88,Château du Domaine de l'Eglise 2013  Pomerol
"Melony aromas come with a heavy blast of brine. This feels oily and marginal, with salty, briny flavors of orange and lime that finish disjointed before falling off.",83,La Playa 2014 Block Selection Tinga Reserve Chardonnay (Limarí Valley)
"Easy, fresh and crisp, this well-priced Grillo would make a great choice for, predinner sipping. Aromas include citrus zest, white almond and wild flower.",84,Calatrasi 2010 Terrale Oro Grillo (Sicilia)
"Rounded, soft and gentle, it has attractive tropical fruit flavors along with a touch of lime to give crispness. Ready to drink.",86,Louis Latour 2012  Viré-Clessé
"Green gooseberry and asparagus flavors blend with richer notes of Meyer lemons and golden mangoes. It's tart with acidity, but a honeyed finish adds balance.",84,Frei Brothers 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley)
"True to the winery's style, this wine pulls no punches, with aromas of black licorice, dark cherries and woodspice. It's rich and full bodied with a grainy feel.",91,Gorman 2013 The Devil You Don't Know Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Tropical fruit aromas are suggestive of bath soap and body oil. This feels obtuse, with depth and an oily sensation to the palate. Chunky, ripe, oily flavors of melon and orange finish loud and ripe, with a deeper set of tropical fruit flavors than your average Argentine Torrontés.",88,Monteviejo 2014 Petite Fleur Torrontés (Cafayate)
"Huge wine with sweetness and smooth qualities from head to toe. Aromas of mint leaf, pastry and sweet black fruits are magnetic, while the lush, layered palate is complete and packed with berry fruit, toast, fudge and tobacco flavors. Layered and deep on the finish, with cola, herbs and licorice notes. Beautiful wine. Drinkable now and good through 2013.",94,Benjamin Romeo 2006 La Viña de Andres Romeo  (Rioja)
"Rich and concentrated, this gorgeous, terroir-driven wine opens with aromas of crushed blue flower, graphite, plum and pipe tobacco. The powerful but weightless palate weaves together ripe black cherry, blackberry, clove, black pepper and mineral while velvety tannins offer support. Drink 2016–2035.",96,Milziade Antano 2010 Colleallodole  (Montefalco Sagrantino)
"Milk chocolate is girded in a wall of firm sturdy tannin as this wine takes on complex elements of wood, herbed spice and raspberry pie. Sanguine, it opens slowly, adding layers of red cherry and dark cherry to the soft full-bodied palate.",91,World's End 2014 Good Times Bad Times Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"Mid-gold in color, featuring broad, layered aromas of ripe yellow stone fruit, ruby red grapefruit and mineral notes. Concentrated flavors prevail across the palate showing crisp citrus fruits, nectarines, white peaches and hints of honey. Racy acidity balances the sweetness, as does its firm, taut texture, which gives the wine focus.",90,Caspari-Kappel 2008 Hochgewächs Süss Riesling (Mosel)
"Here's a charming sparkler with delicate aromas suggesting spring blossom and red berry. Made from 80% Lambrusco Marani and 20% Lambrusco Salamino, it's vibrant and lightly sparkling, with fresh strawberry and cranberry notes illuminated by crisp acidity. It finishes clean.",87,Rinaldini NV Rosato Secco  (Lambrusco dell'Emilia)
"Real Syrah character pervades this dry, full-bodied red wine. It has flavors of blackberries, mulberries, charred meat and black pepper, wrapped into firm tannins. This is a great price for such a versatile, food-friendly wine.",86,Montpellier 2012 Syrah (California)
"Dark purple in color, and very rich on the nose. There's also balancing tart aromatics of rhubarb and bramble. Looks, smells and tastes like a New World/California style of Pinot Noir. It's creamy and oaky in the mouth, but behind that there's ripe, varietal flavors that grow on you as the wine airs out. Maybe too big and brawny for fans of elegant PNs, but plenty good if you like a full-bodied modern wine.",87,Kingston Family 2007 Tobiano Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)
"For a tight, snappy rendition of Rioja, this answers the call. Herbal plum and tomato aromas are earthy and a touch horsey. Tomato, plum and herbal flavors amount to a saucy whole, while this is fresh, herbal and brothy tasting on a crisp finish.",90,CVNE 2010 Gran Reserva  (Rioja)
"This zippy, fruit-forward wine opens with bright raspberry and pungent spice aromas, adding in milk chocolate streaks through a supple, medium-weight middle. The finish gets a little tight, with some plastic flavors creeping in.",87,Spindrift Cellars 2005 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"A nicely balanced Pinot Noir from an unlikely spot––Portola Valley, on the western side of Highway 280 across from Stanford University––and a newish small producer. It's on the bigger side of the Pinot spectrum but has admirable texture and cherry and earth aromas. Only 130 cases made. Worth trying to see what unconventional areas can do with the variety.",88,Portola Vineyards 2008 Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Clara Valley)
"Perfumed and fruity, this shows touches of wood aging, although these are really just hints that lift the fruit. Acidity and a crisp, tangy texture are more important to this wine that bursts with concentrated citrus and green-plum flavors, finishing with so much freshness. Drink from 2017.",93,Romain Bouchard 2013 Vau de Vey Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"A ripe and smooth wine that brings out all the fruitiness of the vintage. Just enough structure gives the wine shape, while yielding pride of place to the juicy fruits and attractive berry flavors. Drink now.",85,Château Garrineau 2012  Bordeaux
"Aromas of toasted oak, dark berry and menthol lead the way. The firm palate offers bright red cherry, strawberry, thyme and sage alongside tightly knit tannins.",88,San Biagio 2012 Montersino  (Barbaresco)
"Made to benefit the Wente Foundation for Arts Education, this wine is made in small quantities. It is juicy and leathery, soft, structured and medium-bodied with a long finish of tar and tannin.",86,Wente 2011 The Art of Giving Red (Livermore Valley)
"Rich yet plenty retentive of acidity, this coastal white is complex in tropical mango and papaya while also offering finely tuned layers of fig and honeycomb. Light enough to enjoy on its own or with delicate fare, it's an enjoyable wine made well in small quantities.",90,Conarium 2013 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"Fresh and easygoing, this opens with scents of berry, blue flower and a whiff of baking spice. The light-bodied simple palate offers tart cherry, black currant and a hint of espresso alongside soft, not very persistent tannins.",86,Marchesi de' Frescobaldi 2014 Santa Maria  (Morellino di Scansano)
"Built around 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, this blend also contains 17% Merlot and smaller percentages of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. Given a good amount of time in barrel, it expresses char, bacon fat and a luxurious and thickly rich amount of black fruit. Concentrated, it should please a wide array of palates.",88,Franciscan 2014 Magnificat Meritage (Napa Valley)
"This wine's strawberry and raspberry flavors carry a slightly funky bouquet, but call it a feature, not a flaw. It has salted caramel notes from aging for nine months in 30% new French oak, and it's creamy and focused on the palate, finishing on a hint of cola.",90,Fairsing 2015 Fairsing Vineyard Pinot Noir
"Lemon, butter and marshmallow flavors follow rich butterscotch aromas as this medium-bodied, soft-textured wine spreads its unctuous, candied flavors across the palate. It's very tasty in an extreme, buttery style.",86,Las Positas 2015 Estate Chardonnay (Livermore Valley)
"This is the top wine from the Jean-Pierre Fayard family Provence cru classé estate. It is full of ripe red fruits supported by a mineral texture. The wine is generous, bone dry but packed with great fruitiness and finished with refreshing acidity. This sophisticated wine could do with a few more months, so drink from late 2017.",92,Château Sainte Marguerite 2016 Fantastique Rosé (Côtes de Provence La Londe)
"Aromas of mature black fruit, tobacco and a hint of leather lead the nose on this structured blend of Sangiovese and 15% Alicante Bouschet, Merlot and Cabernet. The palate delivers dried cherry, licorice and espresso alongside tightly knit, chewy tannins.",88,Massi di Mandorlaia 2011 Mandorlaia Riserva  (Morellino di Scansano)
"This 100% Syrah offers aromas of mature black currant, charred earth and a whiff of cedar. The palate delivers dried black cherries, clove, ground pepper and powdered sage alongside raspy tannins that leave a drying, astringent finish.",87,Terre del Marchesato 2011 Marchesale Syrah (Toscana)
"This blend is mostly Merlot (86%) along with Cabernet Franc, with the fruit coming from two of the state's top sites, Boushey and Champoux. Initially brooding raspberry compote, graphite and dried herb aromas are followed by supple, tart fruit and coffee flavors that sail on the finish. The balance is impeccable. It charms with its subtleties rather than its power, but make no mistake, it charms.",91,Avennia 2013 Valery Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A touch of apple skin immediately appears on the bouquet of this wine, giving this hearty selection a bright, sharp quality. The apple tone is followed by notes of dark chocolate and espresso bean.",87,Cantine Benedetti 2008 Corte Antica  (Recioto della Valpolicella Classico)
"Here's a pristine and tonic Pinot Grigio from northern Italy presented in equally clean packaging. The wine delivers a crystalline appearance that is accented by measured aromas of citrus, light peach and white flower.",86,Josef Brigl 2008 Altanuta Pinot Grigio (Valdadige)
"Still dry and tannic, this has a hard, brittle mouthfeel and lots of tart acidity. It has a gigantic core of blackberry fruit.",87,Houdini 2008 Glendale Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Despite the reserve designation, this is a tasting-room-only wine. It's rather light and elegant in style, with a raspberry veneer over sturdy herbal tannins.",89,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2015 Founders' Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Structured wine with a severe edge from the dry, concentrated tannins. It's serious, stalky fruit layered with a more juicy element and tight acidity. The wine does need aging to soften its austere character.",88,Château Tour de Guiet 2010 Excellence  (Côtes de Bourg)
"Aromas of balsam wood, dry spice, berries and vanilla are attractive and inviting. It feels lush and deep, with good layering and robust flavors of berry fruit, spice, herb and tobacco. Flush and slightly herbal tasting on the back end, this is a complex, quality blend of Malbec, Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah.",90,Lagarde 2010 Guarda Red (Luján de Cuyo)
"Pickle and sweet funk on the nose give this chunky wine a nose that's less than fresh. Flavors of orange, peach and cantaloupe are sweet but flat, and in the end it tastes more like a fruit juice than a really solid dry rosé.",83,Darien 2007 Rosado Tempranillo (Rioja)
"Tropical fruit, air freshener and bath soap aromas lead to a candied, sticky palate with a mix of sweet flavors that include papaya, powdered sugar and mango. The finish is confected and soft.",82,Sombras del Sol 2011 Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley)
"This blend of Marsanne, Viognier and Roussanne has a sweaty note and does not show the fruit ripeness that one would hope for. It's rather generic, lightly lemony, and just a little off-putting with that stale, sweaty character lingering into the finish.",83,Mount Baker Vineyards 2007 Proprietor's Limited Release Marsanne (Yakima Valley)
"Stoller does an all-stainless style of Chardonnay, and does it well consistently. The winery slogan—Authentically Oregon—fits the ultraclean, crisp and authoritative styling. The fresh apple fruit is pushed along by sappy acidity, showing length, purity and focus.",90,Stoller 2014 Chardonnay (Dundee Hills)
"Stalky, flat scents vie for attention with brighter citrus aromas on a bland nose. This Txakoli feels round but not too lively. Flavors of lettuce, green bean, green apple and tangerine finish with a hint of lime.",85,Ulacia 2013 White (Getariako Txakolina)
"Waxy and floral on the nose with hints of zesty orange peel, this dry, full bodied white is richly concentrated with tangerine, lime and fresh apple flavors. It's bold at 13.6% abv, but maintains a crisp, citrus pith astringency and orange blossom elegance to the finish.",88,Korta Katarina 2008 Posip (Korčula)
"I Capitani, a dynamic family-run winery not far from Taurasi, opts for a traditional wine that puts more emphasis on elegance and complexity and less focus on brawn and power. Aromas include cherry, cola, tar, licorice and red apple. The wine is already a bit brownish on its edges, so don't wait long to drink it.",89,I Capitani 2004 Bosco Faiano  (Taurasi)
"A broad-based wine with rich fruit, it also has a crisp edge. Ripe yellow fruits are cut with citrus and acidity. With a tangy end, it could well age, so drink from 2015.",86,Collovray et Terrier 2012 Les Vignes de Joanny  (Saint-Véran)
"A field blend ice wine—don't see that very often—it's full-bodied, almost lush, and packed with mixed slightly candied fruits—tropical, stone fruits and citrus. Concentrated and poised, it balances on fresh acidity. Just a hint of plastic in the back of the finish.",91,Viento 2009 Underwood Mountain Vineyards 55% Riesling/45% Gewurztraminer Ice Wine Gewürztraminer-Riesling (Columbia Gorge (OR))
"The wine is tight with a strong mineral element over the acidity. It shows a sense of chalky terroir, full of red-currant fruits and a nervy aftertaste. It will take some time to fully develop, so wait until 2023.",93,Meurgey-Croses 2015 Clos de la Chapelle Premier Cru  (Volnay)
"Pure notes of red apple rise from the glass, promising freshness, tart briskness and mellow fruit. A hint of shortbread conveys body and generosity. All of this comes together on the rounded palate that has the aromatic lift of rosehip tisane. Mellow autolysis gives the central freshness a generous background. Red-berry fruit flashes amidst the red-apple notes with appetizing tartness. This is a rounded but compact package that takes freshness onto a higher, elegant plane, finishing with enticing saltiness. Lovely now, it's sure to develop. Drink 2017–2027.",94,Nyetimber NV Rosé Sparkling (England)
"Underbrush, grilled herb, exotic spice, raspberry jam and balsamic aromas lift out of the glass. Round and ripe, the warm and forward palate presents dried black cherry, licorice, pipe tobacco and white pepper framed in firm fine-grained tannins. Drink 2018–2026.",90,Bersano 2011 Riserva  (Barolo)
"With bright acidity and balanced structure, this brisk Pinot Noir is ready to drink now. It has a silky texture along with fine flavors of raspberries, rhubarbs and sandalwood.",88,Tolosa 2011 1772 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)
"This older Albariño is hanging in there but it should transition to past its prime in the near future. For now, the nose offers aged citrus notes and pithiness. The palate is citrusy in feel but fading, while flavors of orange and peach pit finish bland. Drink immediately.",87,Fillaboa 2010 Selección Finca Monte Alto Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"A wisp of a white blend, this is mostly Chardonnay and Sémillon, with 9% Orange Muscat that comes through most powerfully and pleasantly on the nose. It's a light wine that's meant to be enjoyed chilled. With its ripe stone-fruit flavors and minerality, it's perfect for pairing with appetizers of all sorts.",87,Murrieta's Well 2011 The Whip White Wine White (Livermore Valley)
"Dry and tannic, with black cherry, blackberry, leather, cedar and peppery spice flavors. A tough, gritty wine that needs serious decanting.",87,Pursuit 2006 Campfire Red Red (Napa Valley)
"Gérard Charvet took over Rosiers from his father in 1983 and remains focused on the art of vinification. A percentage (30%) of wood aging has give this ripe wine its dense texture. That contrasts with the generous black fruits that are still developing. This is a serious, dense wine that will age. Drink from 2018.",90,Georges Duboeuf 2015 Domaine des Rosiers  (Moulin-à-Vent)
"A fresh, citrus flavored wine with attractive fruitiness and a crisp texture. There is a yeasty edge that should vanish and leave just fruit. Because it is mainly made from Chenin Blanc, there is a nutty, honeyed aftertaste.",87,Louis de Grenelle NV Platine Brut Sparkling (Crémant de Loire)
"Dry and short on fruit, with strong barrel aromas of pepper, cinnamon and resin. In the mouth, there's more wood than fruit, leaving heat, vanilla and spice to overshadow mild strawberry/raspberry flavors. What's best about the wine is the mouthfeel; it's round and creamy, with length. Anyone averse to forward oak should steer clear of Utopía.",85,Viña El Cerno 2006 Utopía Roble Malbec (Mendoza)
"This elegant Nebbiolo has an alluring fragrance of rose petal and ripe berry while the palate delivers succulent strawberry, mint and mineral notes. Silky smooth and very fresh, drink this young to catch the softer side of Nebbiolo in all its glory.",92,Cascina delle Rose 2012 Nebbiolo (Langhe)
"Savory spice and roasted meat aromas lead into flavors of tomato, olives and roasted meat. The wine has a brisk acidity and a smoky finish, making it perfect for grilled burgers, steaks and sausages.",89,Chrisohoou 2013 Xinomavro (Naoussa)
"Generous in style, with great freshness. The flavors are rich, touched by caramel, ripe white currants and some spice. A fine, red apple skin structure comes through to finish.",91,Jean-Marc Brocard 2005 Montmains Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"Oily, match-stick aromas are none too friendly, and not a lot improves as this unfolds. The palate is adequate in feel, but the flavors are bitter and oily, while the finish is nothing but bitter.",80,Fabre Montmayou 2012 Phebus Torrontés (Mendoza)
"Earthy notes dominate the nose and hide the lemon and pear notes that are more apparent on the fresh, light and dry palate. This is easy and mild, drink soon.",87,Domaine Zinck 2014 Eichberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"Elegant in construction, with fine acidity and a sleek mouthfeel. What really stars are the flavors. Massive in raspberry and cherry pie filling, cola and pomegranates, with lots of peppery spices and a smoky oak envelope. Should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",93,Lynmar 2009 Hawk Hill Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This wine has a dry, firm and dark character. It also offers acidity to go with the tannins, ripe black fruits and a dense, concentrated structure. The wine should be aged longer, so drink from 2016.",92,Adega Cooperativa de Borba 2011 Grande Reserva Red (Alentejo)
"Made with Nebbiolo, this conveys the grape's trademark aromas of violet, rose and red berry. A touch of cinnamon adds interest to the wild cherry and crushed raspberry flavors while zesty acidity leaves a tangy finish.",88,Josetta Saffirio 2009 Brut Rosé  (Nebbiolo d'Alba)
"Black plum, roasted coffee bean, toast and dried herb aromas unfold in the glass. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, espresso, orange peel, clove and sage while close-grained tannins provide the framework and grip the finish.",89,La Castellina 2011 Squarcialupi Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico)
"This 20-acre estate has produced a firm but already attractively ripe wine. It is still young and juicy, with black currant flavors dominating. The tannins are solid and need a while to soften. Drink from 2016.",86,Château le Piat 2012  Côtes de Bourg
"Pressed berries, plum flesh, toasted cherry pits and a charred cedar scent carry the nose of this bottling by a producer in Paso's Adelaida region. It's quite easy going down, with flavors of cracked pepper, blackberry fruit and a vanilla-licorice combo toward the finish.",89,Oso Libre 2011 Quixotic Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"This spritzy, sweet wine could serve well as a mixer for many hot weather punch drinks.",85,Girly Girl 2012 Moscato (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Concentrated swells of peach and honey sweeten this bright, sunny off-dry kabinett. While crisp, almost lacy, in mouthfeel, stark, lemony acidity drives a piercing finish. Drink now.",89,Karl Josef 2014 Piesporter Michelsberg Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
A hint of smoked nut from nose to finish lends a savory tone to this easygoing off-dry Riesling. Straightforward flavors of pressed apple and pear are sunny and bright. The finish is crisp and refreshing. Drink now.,87,Leonard Kreusch 2015 Bernkasteler Kurfürstlay Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"This is a light, citrus-fruit dominated wine. It has attractive fruitiness, tang and zest, and its acidity is crisp and refreshing. Apples and green fruits add a little richness at the end. Screwcap.",89,Château de la Ragotiere 2011 Vieilles Vignes Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"The weaknesses of this wine are excessively evident alcohol and extracted berry fruit that make it taste jammy and sweet. But it's a good example of the ultraripe Paso style, with supporting acidity and tannins, and a high drinkability factor.",84,Ancient Peaks 2009 Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"An everyday Chardonay, this is seemingly sweet and fruity, with pineapple, vanilla and buttered toast flavors.",84,Grayson 2011 Lot 11 Chardonnay (California)
"The wine leads off with aromas of oak, espresso, black currant, blue flower and a hint of vanilla extract. The palate offers ripe—nearly overripe—black cherry, cinnamon and spice. It closes on a sugary-sweet finish. This has reached its ideal drinking window so enjoy soon.",87,Il Molino di Grace 2007 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"A plummy interpretation of Merlot, this also brings aromas and flavors of herbs and spice. Flavors are sweet and easy drinking with lightly grainy tannins.",86,Boomtown 2013 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"From Laguna Ridge Vineyard, which surrounds the producer's winery, this bottling begs to be explored. It's beguiling from the beginning, with unexpected shots of soy, corn nuts and gamy charcuterie. Big, structured tannins support juicy flavors of black cherry and raspberry, resulting in a complex, velvety mouthfeel. Flourishes of dark chocolate and cardamom tease on the finish.",96,Merry Edwards 2013 Coopersmith Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
Spice notes from wood aging gives this wine a rounded character. Ripe berry fruits show strongly so drink soon while its fruitiness lasts. Screwcap.,86,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2011 Espirito Tinto Red (Tejo)
"An ambitious effort, this Pays d'Oc Merlot opens with bacon, earth and boysenberry notes that lead to a moderately intense palate. Vanilla notes wrap around flavors of Chinese tea, cedar and spice box and wind up with a fairly gripping finish. Drink now.",85,Montpezat 2005 Les Enclos Prestige Merlot (Vin de Pays d'Oc)
"Fresh and forward. The nose is pure, ripe and rubbery, with a deep level of black fruit. The mouthfeel shows zippy acidity and total ripeness of the grapes. The grippy finish is long and rock solid. The tannins make it a touch hard, but with food you can't really fail.",87,Santa Ema 2001 Barrel Select Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Maipo Valley)
"Oily-textured wine, flavored with mango and peaches. It's so soft and unctuous that freshness seems to have been left behind. In its place is the ripest fruit giving an open texture and an opulent aftertaste.",89,Fitapreta Vinhos 2008 Fitapreta Branco Antão Vaz (Alentejano)
"A fascinating blend of Petit Courbu and Petit Manseng this dry wine delivers honey, spice and ripe fruits. Apricots and freshly sliced pears give the wine a rich, generous feel. It comes from a parcel in the Château Bouscassé estate better known for its Madiran red wine. Drink this beautiful wine now.",90,Alain Brumont 2011 Les Jardins de Bouscassé  (Pacherenc du Vic Bilh)
"This Rhône-style red blend is light bodied and fruit forward, with slight spice nuances to add interest. Cranberry, pink peppercorns and anise show good balance and concentration on the nose and palate.",88,McPherson 2014 Les Copains Red (Texas)
"Sweet and brambly, Heron Hill's Ingle Vineyard Cab Franc is fragrant with aromas of cherry pie filling, vanilla spice and dried, ripe wood. The palate is dry and lean, but quite concentrated in fruit with a pleasantly tart raspberry finish.",86,Heron Hill 2008 Ingle Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes)
"The red wine companion to the excellent Two Vines Vineyard 10 White has got some stuffing, tannins and chewy, herbal flavors, but the fruit holds its own with flavors of wild plum and rhubarb.",85,Columbia Crest 2007 Two Vines Vineyard 10 Red Wine Red (Washington)
"This luminous white opens with aromas of honeysuckle, tropical fruit and a whiff of tomato leaf. The racy palate offers grapefruit, bitter almond and a mineral note alongside lively acidity.",87,Argillae 2015  Orvieto
"One for the cellar. It's vibrantly rich and forward in blackberries, black cherries, plums, dark chocolate and sweet smoky new oak, yet very tannic. Creates an astringency that lasts through the spicy finish. It would be a pity to open it before 2012, and will last for years after.",95,Sbragia 2006 Monte Rosso Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley)
Strong mint and menthol aromatics give way to intense fresh-cut cedar flavors.  There's just too much wood for this woodchuck to chuck.,82,Castello di Borghese 1998 Hargrave Vineyard Merlot (North Fork of Long Island)
"A young, structured Pinot Noir exuding tart red cherry and pomegranate, clearly grown in a cool climate in a cool year with an undertone of brushy herbes de Provence. The finish continues the theme of tartness and acidity, a willing partner for something unexpected like oysters or bacon-wrapped dates.",89,De Loach 2011 Marin Pinot Noir (Marin County)
"This is a simple wine with candied raspberry, mint and toasted oak notes.",82,Bridlewood 2011 Blend 175 Red (Central Coast)
"Grapey, with an off-putting scent of alcohol mixed with tire rubber. Beyond that, the cola and menthol aromas are pleasant, with chocolate and orange peel underneath. It’s hefty, chunky and plummy in the mouth, with lots of sweet oak running onto the finish, leaving a long and lasting woody impression. 164 cases made.",87,Carabella 1998 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"A rounded style, with full-bodied red fruits and a rich, silky texture. The wine still does have attractive acidity and a crisp grapefruit edge to balance it out.",89,Domaines Ott 2011 Château de Selle Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This high-priced Cabernet Sauvignon, which is entering its prime, shows reedy berry aromas along with notes of prune, cola and spice. In the mouth, this is a bit on the soft side, while candied cola, cassis and cherry flavors finish with a note of chocolate. Overall, it's ripe, tasty and ready to drink.",91,Antonio Mas 2011 Roll Fermentor Cabernet Sauvignon (Tupungato)
"Beautifully integrated oak and a firm structure combine in this rather tight but superbly balanced wine. It smells like black cherries and tastes like raspberries and blueberries, accented by toasted baguette, cinnamon and fresh cedar notes. The finish is long and lightly spicy. Best after 2018.",92,Bonterra 2014 Made With Organic Grapes Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Paxis is a warm, earthy wine, packed with ripe, soft and forward fruit. It does have a structure that could allow the wine to age, but there is no need as its fruitiness makes it ready to drink now.",88,DFJ Vinhos 2008 Paxis Red (Alentejano)
"Oak sticks out on this wine, with a buttered-toast note dominating the modest underlying fruit. There's also an herbal quality, which is sometimes found in Napa Valley Chardonnays.",85,Joseph Cellars 2010 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Made in a direct style to appeal now, and succeeds. Dry, soft and silky, the wine seduces with lush black cherry, raspberry, red currant, mocha and spice flavors that are deeply satisfying. Not an ager, but nice now through 2010.",91,Molnar Family 2006 Poseidon's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"From owner Jean-Pierre Palatin's vineyards at the highest elevation in this appellation, this mostly Merlot wine is soft and fruity, ripe but with little sense of structure. It is juicy and with some acidity. Light and perfumed, it is ready to drink. The winemaker is Thomas Guibert who also handles Ferrand, Palatin's Saint-Émilion grand cru.",84,Château Roquevieille 2013  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux
"Mushy citrus and papaya aromas are waxy and lack pop. Angular and lemony in feel, this varietal white offers a one-note flavor profile based on lemon. A ringing, citric finish affords for a hint of tropical fruit.",85,Mendel 2015 Semillon (Mendoza)
"A beautiful young Pinot that illustrates the pedigree of the vineyard, as well as the excellence of Ojai's block. Dry and classically structured, it shows a slight herbality and crushed brown spiciness to the blackberry, cherry, pomegranate, rhubarb, cola, anise, date and vanilla flavors. The list of complex flavors could go on and on. Best now–2011.",93,Ojai 2005 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"A ripe, creamy wine with a fragrant apple core, this is a full bodied, forceful blast of fruit and soft acidity. Finishes rich with hints of spice. Screwcap.",88,Prieler 2012 Seeberg Pinot Blanc (Burgenland)
"Finely chopped herb notes, recalling marjoram, thyme and anise, combine with with dried rose and red cherry aromas on the delicately wild nose of this bottling. The palate adds forest floor flavors to its dark red fruit, making for a heady expression that grows in complexity sip after sip.",93,Chanin 2015 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Waxy apple stars in this brisk, approachable white from a single estate-farmed block, the oak briny and salty in toast and honey. Textured and elegantly light bodied, it finishes with a satisfying note of lemon candy.",90,Dry Creek Vineyard 2013 DCV Estate Block 10 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This cloudy, unfiltered white has delicate grilled herb, wet stone and ripe orchard fruit aromas. The crisp, linear palate delivers saline-inflected white peach and nectarine flavors while a bright almond note closes the finish.",88,Corte Adami 2015  Soave
"Round and pillowy in feel, this is a simple wine, offering modest melon and pineapple fruit. Drink it over the next few months.",85,Cave de Tain 2015 Nobles Rives Marsanne (Collines Rhôdaniennes)
"That vintage date is not a typo. This winery held onto this wine for over a decade prior to release. After opening with aromas of leather, vanilla, mushroom and wood spice, the palate brings reserved, well-balanced fruit flavors. Drink now.",90,Lawrelin 2003 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Sourced from two great villages in the Côte des Blancs, Mesnil sur Oger and Oger, this is a beautifully proportioned wine. Tightly mineral in texture and dry, it also offers white fruits that are laced with intense acidity. There is aging potential here, so don't drink before 2018.",93,Bruno Paillard NV Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Extra Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)
"A fine, fancy Cabernet. It shows Diamond Mountain's famously hard tannins, but they're so finely ground, the wine is actually drinkable now, with a brief decant. It's entirely dry, with complex waves of blackberries, cherries, currants, violets, mocha, minerals and, of course, plenty of sweet smoky oak.",92,Martin Ray 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)
"With aromas dominated by minty new wood, this is a modern style of wine, the wood on the palate very dominant. There is enough black currant fruit to promise a rounding out of what at the moment is a dry, densely structured wine. Keep for 4–5 years.",89,Château de Belcier 2010 Le Pin de Belcier  (Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux)
"Both herbal and tropical in character, this wine presents a fascinating mix between cool and warm climate grapes from the same region. The mineral, tight texture holds these two disparate flavors together to give a balanced wine that is ready to drink.",88,Fiuza 2011 Premium Alvarinho-Chardonnay (Tejo)
"Roughly two-thirds Cabernet and one-third Merlot, this medium-bodied wine packs in ample plum fruit, accented by cinnamon and cedar. Finishes long, with a slightly velvety texture.",90,Mills Reef 2011 Elspeth Cabernet Merlot (Hawke's Bay)
"Many wineries source fruit from this exceptional vineyard, but few make a better wine than this. Fragrant, elegant and smooth, it's tight and detailed, with a toasty edge to pretty cherry fruit. It flows gracefully into a finish laden with milk chocolate highlights and a streak of cola.",94,Ken Wright 2012 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir
"Made from organically-farmed fruit, this Sicilian expression of Cabernet Franc is heavily marked by sour aromas of green vegetables and chopped dill.",81,Di Giovanna 2010 Cabernet Franc (Sicilia)
"Emphasizes intense passion fruit aromas that grow more pungent upon breathing. Feels tangy as it dances on the palate, with passion fruit, lemon-lime and tarragon flavors. Long and focused on the finish, with tons of zest.",89,San Pedro 2011 1865 Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley)
"Strong aromas of blackberry extract, cedar, nose-tickling herbs and a bit of bacon fat mark the nose of this release from a winery whose 84-year-old namesake died in October 2014. The flavors balance tartness with ripe berries, roasted fennel, emergent tannins and purple flowers that linger into the finish.",92,Robert Hall 2012 Syrah (Paso Robles)
"Heavy and dense in the mouth, with rich flavors of grilled blackberries, pepper and a lovely addition of toasted oak. Nice and dry, but a bit too soft, and would benefit from greater structure.",87,Brander 2009 Colson Canyon Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"This structured wine also has already delicious red fruit flavors. The core of tannins is surrounded by this cushion of ripe fruits, layered with acidity and altogether enticing now. Drink now, although the wine will certainly age.",88,Manuel Olivier 2012  Pommard
"Brooding aromas of dates, herbs and cherry lead to full-bodied coffee and pit-fruit flavors that show a sense of balance and finesse.",89,For a Song 2012 Petit Verdot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This wine has varied over the years, but with the cool 2010 vintage, it really shows how fine its terroir can shine. A full degree of alcohol lower than the 2009, it's bone dry, brisk in acidity, and stimulating in its minerally taste and texture—like a lick of cold steel. There is a fortunate streak of Meyer lemon candy that lends enough richness to satisfy. Reminiscent of a fine Chablis, it's drinking well now.",93,Knights Bridge 2010 West Block Chardonnay (Knights Valley)
"Easily as good as the winery's more expensive proprietary bottlings, this shows classic Russian River acidity and minerality, with flavors of tropical fruits, tangerines, golden apricots and limes. It's really rich, but classically dry, with a long, distinguished finish.",93,Iron Horse 2010 Estate Chardonnay (Green Valley)
"An austere blend of Cab Sauvignon, Syrah and Petit Verdot. There's color and power galore, but also a choppy, firm mouthfeel that guards intense cherry flavors and smoldering oak. An aggressive wine that doesn't back down from its essence. Will do much better with food than by itself.",87,Marques de Griñon 2002 Estate Bottled Summa Varietalis Red (Dominio de Valdepusa)
"Very soft, an unctuous, rounded wine, all charm, rich fruits, soft tannins and ripeness. It's certainly generous, almost opulent, a wine that rolls around the mouth.",89,Bouchard Père & Fils 2006 Les Clous  (Meursault)
"This kitchen sink-style blend has aromas of baking spice, dark plum and herb. It drinks off dry, with smooth currant and plum flavors that linger.",85,Original House Wine 2013 House Wine Red (America)
"Here's a pretty Italian rosé from the Abruzzo region with a full and generous bouquet of wild berries, white cherry, pomegranate and cranberry. The wine is smooth and soft in the mouth with more pretty berry nuances on the close: Pair it with smoked salmon.",87,Cantina Tollo 2008 Valle d'Oro  (Cerasuolo d'Abruzzo)
"By “Old Vine Cabernet” the winery refers to vines that were planted in 1973. But somehow the fruit doesn't express old-vine character. Instead, it's a mix of sweet-tasting strawberry and bitter stem flavors that lack focus, with a peppery highlight.",86,Upland Estates 2009 Old Vine Cabernet Cabernet Sauvignon (Snipes Mountain)
"Beeswax and dried chamomile flowers, baked apple and lanolin, lemon rind and a touch of honey: while these aromas are rich on the nose, they become even more bountiful on the palate, filling mouth and mind with their high-wire acrobatics that teeter between steely precision and decadent richness. This late harvest style shows off Riesling's aromatics to great effect. The finish is incredibly zesty and fresh. While this is already evolved, it shows no signs of tiredness and is sure to delight for years to come. Concentration and balance are phenomenal. The haunting aroma of lanolin gets under your skin. Drink now through 2030.",95,Domaine Bernhard & Reibel 2010 Vendanges Tardives Riesling (Alsace)
"This blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre is dry, acidic and not quite ripe. There's a green tobacco edge to the fruit. It's also a bit funky.",82,Andrew Murray 2010 Esperance Red (Central Coast)
"Red fruit dominates in this tightly woven, firmly tannic wine, blended with 9% Petite Sirah. Hints of charred campfire oak support black pepper, cinnamon and berry, the texture smooth and soft.",88,Decoy 2014 Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
"This opens with notes of pulpy red fruit and cherry spread over a dark, velvety consistency. There's a spicy touch of crushed white pepper on the finish that underscores the wine's overall structure and freshness.",89,San Fereolo 2010 Valdibà  (Dolcetto di Dogliani)
"Produced from 25-year-old vines, this is a delicious, crisp and clean wine. It has attractive apricot and melon flavors that are cut with lime acidity. Drink this fruity wine now.",87,Domaine du Vieil Orme 2016 Cuvée PHI Sauvignon Blanc (Touraine)
"Violet, dark berry and a whiff of spice lead the nose on this blend of 50% Sangiovese, 25% Merlot and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon. The sleek, straightforward palate doles out black cherry, raw raspberry and aniseeed accompanied by fine-grained tannins. Drink 2016–2020.",89,Rocca di Frassinello 2013 Le Sughere di Frassinello  (Maremma Toscana)
"Bryan Babcock's three decades of experience show better than ever right now. This bottling from Radian Vineyard offers aromas of charred cloves, wet slate, peppercorns and macerated raspberries. Lively and energetic on the palate, it bursts with flavors of wild berries and ripe cranberries, with a tart citrusy twist that's a wakeup call to the mouth.",93,Babcock 2012 Appellation's Edge Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"This wine is pale peach in color. The 100% Grenache, the wood influence (100% new 500L French oak) is almost completely overwhelming, showing notes of vanillin, wood spice and cream. It lightens up a bit on the dry palate but still can't make up the difference.",85,Gård 2015 Lawrence Vineyards Rosé (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Strong wood aromas continue to the palate of this firm, dry wine. Underneath, there is enough juicy fruit to bring richness as well as structure. It still needs time. Drink from 2016.",91,Vidigal 2010 Brutalis Red (Lisboa)
This blend of Touriga Nacional and Cabernet Sauvignon is solid and ripe. It's packed with dry tannins that interplay with the herb and spice characters. A zip of acidity rings on the finish. Drink from 2017.,86,Casal do Conde 2012 Reserva Red (Tejo)
"A bright and crisp wine with its red currant and raspberry flavors that are lifted by the delicious acidity. It is lively, and ready to drink.",86,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2015 Espirito Lagoalva Rosé (Tejo)
"Tart cherry and cranberry meet with woody cedar aromas, campfire and nettle on the nose of this widely available bottling. Cherry and strawberry flavors get hit with bittersweet chocolate and pine-cedar touches on the sip.",84,Castle Rock 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"This is an austere, leathery Cabernet with smooth tannins that will take time to move beyond its more earthy, herbal components and share its blackberry fruit. Pair with a steak in the meantime, preferably in a blackberry reduction sauce, which might coax out more of the wine's flavor.",87,Six Sigma Ranch 2009 Else's Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Lake County)
"Saucy aromas of stewed plum and tomato ragu lack clarity. This is midlevel Cabernet, with a light bounce to its step. Generic cherry, cassis and licorice flavors finish with acidic kick but no sense of refinement.",84,Proemio 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"This is the second label of Young Inglewood, a blend of 93% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot that spent 20 months in all-French oak, one quarter of it new. Meant to be approachable young, it is, while retaining a concentration of licorice, black currant and blackberry wrapped in dark chocolate. Firm tannins give it structure.",92,VENN 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This lively wine revels in its red fruits. It is tight, tangy and packed with fresh flavors, with just the right amount of weight and dryness to put it firmly on the table with food.",88,Château Boisson 2014 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
"For Odfjell, which normally puts out ripe, quality wines, this green, herbal Syrah is both surprising and disappointing. Our first sample was brutally corked and the second was green on the nose and then short, chocolaty and limited on the palate.",81,Odfjell 2005 Orzada Syrah (Maipo Valley)
"This wine is a solid, stylish Meritage with assertive red fruit, a black pepper backbone and plenty of structure for aging. A touch of oaked spice adds dimension. A good overall red to pair with hearty winter fare.",84,Atwater 2005 Red Table Wine Meritage (Finger Lakes)
"This dense and dark wine offers spice and toast flavors. It has a big, generous feel, leaving room both for the dry, still-young tannins and for aromatic blackberry fruits. It does need to age, so drink from 2017.",90,Château Eugénie 2012 Tradition Malbec-Merlot (Cahors)
"Tobacco, baked plum, toasted oak, vanilla and mature blackberry aromas waft out of the glass. The dense, one-dimensional palate offers raspberry jam, prune, mocha and a confectionary note alongside velvety tannins.",87,Nativ 2012 Eremo San Quirico Aglianico (Irpinia)
"Bright pink in color, this is a fresh rosé, just off dry, with lively citrus and wild strawberry fruits. Acidity cuts through the wine, making it crisp and ready to drink.",86,Casa do Valle 2013 Rosé (Vinho Verde)
"A good evocation of a Santa Ynez Grenache. Shows the right bite of acidity, with interesting cherry pie, bacon and sandalwood flavors that lead to a long, spicy finish. Drink up.",87,Kaena 2010 Tierra Alta Vineyard Grenache (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Pepper and focus characterize the slender, tart fruit of this refreshing, vibrant red. The tannins have that lovely palpable verve that signals just a little rusticity. Have this with hearty food or charcuterie. Thanks to the fresh acidity this is rather versatile with food—experiment.",90,Weninger 2013 Horitschoner Blaufränkisch (Mittelburgenland)
"Almost entirely varietal (3% Petit Verdot) with the fruit mostly split between Elephant Mountain and Alder Ridge vineyards, this wine is a bit aromatically locked up at present with notes of cherry, green herbs and blue fruit. It's medium bodied in feel, with the oak dialed back (33% new French), tart acids and a gentle squeeze of tannins with bitters on the finish. It should only improve with additional time in the bottle and has a lot life ahead of it.",91,Pamplin 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This offers aromas suggesting camphor, grilled herb, red berry and a whiff of exotic spice. The straightforward palate offers chocolate covered cherry, baking spice and espresso alongside firm tannins.",89,Monti 2010 Bussia Riserva  (Barolo)
"A solid wine, showing some generosity and richness, the fruits displaying a fine balance between sweetness, dry tannins and bright acidity. It has some of the sensuous character of good Volnay, opening into ripeness. Worth aging for several years, but already offering considerable pleasure.",92,Bouchard Père & Fils 2007 Caillerets Premier Cru Ancienne Cuvée Carnot  (Volnay)
"Based in Carmel, this producer ventures north to Napa and Sonoma for grapes. It crafts this earthy, ethereal wine from Russian River fruit and donates part of its sales proceeds to a handful of charities. Mushroom, licorice, tea and cherry are all well-represented, wrapped in a conservative idling of oak.",88,Peace Water 2012 Sublime Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Yellow peach, honeysuckle and russet pear combine in a very inviting nose. The palate amalgamates these flavors even more, bathing them in tangy but sightly sweet orange notes. The result is a bullet of flavor and freshness, balanced, friendly and very moreish. The finish is off dry and wonderfully clean and spicy.",91,Domaines Schlumberger 2015 Les Princes Abbés Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"This wine is mostly Pinot Gris and Viognier along with a pinch of Orange Muscat. It's easy drinking, with flavors of peach and the underside of a pineapple plus a touch of sweetness and a crisp finish.",87,Thurston Wolfe 2014 PGV White (Washington)
"Layers of butter and spiced caramel accentuate the richness of this sumptuously ripe, full-bodied wine. Fresh, crisp apple and pear flavors freshen the midpalate, leading to a lingering sweet-spice finish.",89,Martha Clara 2014 Estate Reserve Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island)
"This solid Barolo opens with aromas of mature dark berry, licorice, clove, chewing tobacco and a whiff of crushed flower. The palate reveals red cherry, strawberry, white pepper and thyme alongside bracing tannins. Drink after 2019.",89,Casetta 2011 Vigna Case Nere  (Barolo)
"Petruccino is a delightful and elegant wine with great red fruit intensity folded within leather, spice and tobacco. The blend is Sangiovese (60%), Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon and the wine offers crispness, softness and structure, respectively, thanks to these three varieties.",91,Podere Forte 2007 Petruccino Red (Orcia)
"Fresh citrus and green-apple aromas lead to a healthy palate with just enough bracing acidity. Flavors of tangerine, passion fruit and grapefruit are bold and typical of Casablanca SB, while this tastes of lime, green herbs and scallion on a fit finish.",90,Matetic 2016 EQ Coastal Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"91–93. Barrel sample. This is a rich, ripe wine with soft tannins and a generous texture. The dry core gives a sense of shape to all the opulence on the palate.",92,Château La Bon Pasteur 2012 Barrel Sample  (Pomerol)
"Rich and ripe, this has flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola and red currants, plus layers of exotic spices and toasty sandal-wood that change with every sniff and sip. With its silky texture and crisp acidity, it should develop over the next 6–8 years, but it's also wonderful now.",93,Williams Selyem 2010 Flax Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This is the second wine of Grand Cru Classé Château la Gaffelière. It revels in ripe juicy Merlot while keeping a sense of style and elegance. Produced by the Malet-Roquefort family, owners since 1705, the wine has some firm tannins while never losing sight of the generous black fruits. Drink from 2022.",93,Château la Gaffelière 2014 Clos la Gaffelière  (Saint-Émilion)
"The aromas pop on this blend of Alder Ridge Roussanne (57%) and Antoine Creek Viognier, with perfumed notes of flowers, pear and peach, along with light herb and spice grace notes. Palate coating, it brings a sense of gravitas and delight. It's fruitful and flavorful, offering richness while retaining its deftness, with a sense of texture that is knee buckling.",92,Waters 2015 Prelude White (Washington)
"This is a funky, pushy type of wine, with prickly aromas of green herb and berry. For a 2007, it is big and a bit rough, with an herbal, green-leaning berry flavor distinctive of this producer and its Los Lingues Vineyard. It finishes with additional herbal kick and heat.",87,Casa Silva 2007 Microterroir de Los Lingues Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"Here's a solid, straightforward Barolo that delivers aromas and flavors of ripe black cherry, raspberry compote, star anise, leather and menthol. You'll also detect the warmth of alcohol on the finish, while chewy tannins provide support. Drink 2017–2022.",88,Collina San Ponzio 2012  Barolo
"Pear, apple, hazelnut and crushed stone aromas unfold on this polished white. The aromas follow through to the full-bodied palate along with lemon drop and a tier of energizing mineral. Crisp acidity brightens the creamy flavors.",90,Franz Gojer-Glögglhof 2014 Karneid Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
"Aromas of blackcurrant, grilled pepper and oak lead the nose. The dense, extracted palate offers dried black cherry, mature blackberry, licorice, espresso and vanilla alongside firm tannins.",87,Feudo Disisa 2010 Vuaria Nero d'Avola (Monreale)
"This wine is youthfully pugnacious, gamy and nutty with sharp acidity that has yet to come into its own. From good fruit grown by good people, it has potential to soar in richly layered green apple and pear once it settles into itself.",86,The Calling 2015 Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
This is a powerful wine that's very richly textured and with a structure that promises aging. It has weight and superripe peach and apricot flavors. There is a fine cut of acidity to give both freshness and aging potential. Drink from 2016.,94,Bründlmayer 2012 Lamm Erste Lage Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"This blanc de blancs, fermented and aged in wood, is a fine Champagne. Its mineral texture and light oxidative character from the use of wood is contrasted with the tight citrus fruitiness and nervy steely texture. The wine is just mature although still with plenty of fruit. Drink now.",93,Louise Brison 2008 Tendresse Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)
"A pure and intense rendition of Priorato. The nose is stacked with minerality, smoke, ink and tough but regal black fruit aromas. It's powerful and concentrated in the mouth, with bold cassis and blackberry flavors in front of a long, flavorful, slightly lemony finish. Needs a few years to show its best; drink from 2011 through 2017.",92,Celler Burgos-Porta 2007 Mas Sinén Coster Red (Priorat)
"This wine has a big personality. It's dark in color and oozing with ripe black-cherry flavors that intermingle with a high level of tannin for that lip-smacking tooth-staining effect. So approach with caution, and then enjoy for all its boisterous impact.",91,Prima Materia 2013 Estate Bottled Aglianico (Kelsey Bench-Lake County)
"A pale straw-yellow in color, this take on a relatively rare grape delivers a nose of lime spritzer and grapefruit pith. Lively acidity shows on the palate, with flavors of poached pear and citrus rind. A brisk minerality makes this a perfect pairing for a wide range of foods, from shrimp paella to seared salmon to a BLT.",88,Sextant 2013 Grenache Blanc (Paso Robles)
"Rubbery plum and berry aromas offer notes of leather and metallic minerals. This has an oaky feel, meaning it's sticky and lactic. Herbal, slightly green flavors of plum and berry are sweetened and softened by oak in front of a minty, lightly herbaceous finish.",85,Domaine Jean Bousquet 2013 Finca Rosa Malbec (Tupungato)
"Hints of bramble and earth lend savory nuances to sunny yellow peach and melon flavors in this bright vivaciously crisp Kabinett. Off-dry in style, it's balanced by a stream of focused tangerine acidity leading from midpalate through a moderately long finish. Start drinking now.",89,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler 2014 Bernkasteler alte Badstube am Doctorberg Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"The aromas of this full-bodied sweet-seeming wine are floral and honey-like, followed by rich ripe honeydew melon and peach-syrup flavors and a soft mouth-clinging texture. It's not the usual style, but tasty in its own right.",86,Terra d'Oro 2016 Pinot Grigio (Clarksburg)
"A blend of Merlot, Nero d'Avola and Alicante Bouschet, this opens with aromas of cherry soda, smoked meat and plump red fruit. The wine's overall personality is simple and informal, with a raw, chewy mouthfeel.",86,MandraRossa 2010 Cavadiserpe Red (Sicilia)
"Big and fruity, this has generous tannins and ripe black fruits. With its full fruits bursting out of the glass, it is already suitable for drinking. Delicious, full bodied and a great testament to the vintage's quality.",89,Château de Terrefort-Quancard 2009  Bordeaux Supérieur
"Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc meet up with smaller amounts of Syrah, Zinfandel and Petit Verdot in this soft, silky blend. Mild tannin and a robustness of ripe black currant and cedar are seasoned in a strong whiplash of eucalyptus, as the finish touches a theme of black tea.",89,VGS 2014 Potelle Two Red (Napa Valley)
"This opens with banana, exotic fruit and honeysuckle aromas while the fruity palate offers white peach, green apple and candied tangerine flavors. A hint of white almond marks the close.",87,Perla del Garda 2016 Bio  (Lugana)
"Dry, crisp and with no oak influence, this stainless steel-fermented wine is rich in apricot, nectarine, pineapple, vanilla, macadamia nut and honey flavors. It's a nice, versatile white wine to have with a variety of food.",86,Indian Rock 2006 Vermentino (Calaveras County)
"A smooth wine that is very fruity while also rich. A ripe feel comes from the dominant Viosinho in the blend. There is a greener element, lightly tangy and herbaceous that gives a fresher aftertaste to this attractive wine. Drink from 2015.",89,Quinta de Chocapalha 2012 Branco White (Lisboa)
"Làvico, made from Nerello Mascalese grapes harvested on the slopes of Mount Etna (with 10% Merlot), exhibits aromas of burnt coal, bramble, lead pencil, blueberry and wild strawberries. The wine moves with delicate, feminine steps but is not without power and intensity.",89,Duca di Salaparuta 2004 Vajasindi Làvico Nerello Mascalese (Sicilia)
"This wine opens with a strong herbaceous character, as scents of forest floor and menthol accent the red plum and cherry core. Fine tannins and medium weight make this an accessible wine now, with hints of black pepper and licorice spice that develop on the finish.",89,Mullineux 2010 Syrah (Swartland)
"Herbal in tobacco leaf and cedar, this is a medium-bodied, restrained and elegant wine, structured in robust tannin and mouthfeel with plenty of underlying acidity to keep it fresh and food-friendly.",90,Textbook 2013 Mise en Place Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"From the relatively hot South Coast comes a big, powerful, chewy wine, with aromas of dried blackberries, light leather, some smoke and purple flowers. The real heft is on the palate, where sour tar is laced through stewed black plums, dark chocolate and herbs like dill and oregano. The tannins are a bit stiff.",91,Hawk Watch Winery 2011 Signature Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (South Coast)
"There's a hint of smoke throughout the nose and palate that adds a layer of complexity to this sweet, pretty Riesling. Aromas of honeysuckle blossoms combine with the freshness of pressed apples and a bright, high-toned acidity. Smoke, slate and stone kick in to create a long, elegant finish. Overall, a well balanced, enjoyable wine.",88,Lamoreaux Landing 2009 Round Rock Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Subtle white fruit—think pale yellow-plum and pear flesh—mingle with fern and yeasty notes on the nose. The palate is zippy, light and easy to like, with fresh, bouncy fruit.",89,Salomon-Undhof 2016 Hochterrassen Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"Fresh and fruity, this is full of red cherry flavors and crisp acidity. It has some age, hinting at a more toasty future. For the moment, it's at its best after eight years aging on the lees in the bottle.",90,Caves Transmontanas 2006 Vértice Pinot Noir (Douro)
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah begins with leafy, almost weedy aromas along with hints of graphite and mature black berries. But the lean palate lacks fruit richness and reveals evident alcohol sensations despite the modest level.",86,Casa di Terra 2012 Moreccio  (Bolgheri)
"Standard plum and berry aromas provide a nice opening to this dark, solid Malbec that's a little zingy and racy at its core. Flavors of plum and berry are typical for a wine of this class, which finishes with burnt flavors and a final resting place of grainy oak.",85,Durigutti 2006 Malbec (Mendoza)
"This deep-colored, full-bodied red gets a little swagger in its step from enticing smoky oak aromas and powerful black-fruit flavors that also carry that spicy oak streak. This is brash enough for slow-cooked barbecue but sophisticated enough for osso buco. The texture is fine-grained from supportive tannin, and the finish lingers. Best now through 2018.",91,Nottingham Cellars 2012 Ghielmetti Vineyard Micro-lot Reserve Malbec (Livermore Valley)
"Structured and with a strongly crisp and textured character, this wine also has a touch of toast from wood aging. Ripe green and yellow fruits are part of the concentration and dense flavors. It is still young, so wait until 2018.",94,Domaine Pinson 2013 Montmains Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"Here's a bright and tonic Riserva Chianti (made with Sangiovese and smaller percentages of Colorino and Merlot) that opens with bright aromas of forest berry, river stone and dark chocolate. The wine offers good freshness and soft, tame tannins.",89,Castello di Poppiano 2006 Riserva Conte Ferdinando Guicciardini  (Chianti Colli Fiorentini)
"Attractive aromas of pipe tobacco, plum and baking spice lead the nose. The tight, elegant palate delivers wild cherry, blackberry, licorice and a hint of mineral framed in austere fine-grained tannins that lend firm structure and polished texture. Fresh acidity provides balance. Give it time to unwind. Drink 2020–2030.",93,Terredora 2010 Pago dei Fusi  (Taurasi)
"This is a pretty wine, and the initial flavors are soft and mature, suggesting a wine that's ready to drink now. In the mouth it falls away quickly with a slightly oxidized character that suggests an early fade is on the way. It's gentle and drinks well enough right now, with some barrel notes of caramel and coffee beefing up the finish.",86,Anam Cara 2005 Nicholas Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This blend of Petite Sirah, Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre offers a wide array of aromas to start, from cocoa and mocha to brown spice, gingerbread, dark purple fruits and potpourri. The palate shows lavender, blueberry-strawberry juice, roasted oregano and thyme.",88,San Antonio 2011 Heritage Red (Paso Robles)
"This worthwhile bottling from an appellation better known for Zinfandel offers a burst of big flavor against soft, pliable tannin. Cinnamon, clove and red currant beg for attention alongside brighter, crisper undercurrents of acidity, making for a tight package of power and elegance.",91,Mauritson 2013 Rockpile Ridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rockpile)
"Lively aromas of grapefruit, white flowers and mineral lead into a light, fruity but rather simple palate that offers lime, green herb and stone. Overall it's straightforward and clean, but a touch dilute. In its favor, it's soft and easy to drink.",86,Ladoucette 2000  Pouilly-Fumé
"Hekate is an amber-colored dessert wine made from a blend of overripe grapes in central Sicily. Its aromas recall apricot, orange peel and chestnut honey and the wine offers special floral notes that last long over its silky mouthfeel. Hekate is named after a Greek goddess who bestowed kindness and wealth and was a guardian of youth.",91,Feudo Arancio 2006 Hekate Passito White (Sicilia)
"Gorgeous fine-tuning has shaped a vibrant wine that is rich in complexity. Aromas include blackberry, cigar box, espresso bean and the wine ends with thick, chewy tannins. There is meat on this wine's bones yet it closes crisp and fresh, not heavy.",91,La Regola 2004 Vallino delle Conche Red (Montescudaio)
"A Chardonnay at a decent price for what you get. It's sweet and creamy, with buttered toast, pineapple and peach fruit flavors that are accented with brisk acidity.",84,Bridlewood 2011 Chardonnay (Monterey County)
"This is a rich, weighty red with a velvety texture and plenty of alcoholic warmth. The fruit is ripe to the point of turning chocolaty and even a bit fudge-like, lingering on the richly textured finish. Drink now.",87,Cellier des Chartreux 2011 Domaine des Colombettes Les Terres du Roy Red (Lirac)
"A note of cracked pepper—a defining characteristic of Syrah—is the first note to hit, followed by scents of tobacco and blackberry liqueur. The palate tastes tart and acetic, showing a prominent balsamic tone. Drinking this with food might tame the acids a bit.",82,Doukénie 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Virginia)
"It's rare to see an offering of this variety in Washington. This one comes from Lonesome Springs Vineyard. Aromas are initially so light you need to strain to get at them, with notes of lemon zest and herb. The palate is medium bodied, with stone-fruit flavors that provide appeal.",88,Lauren Ashton Cellars 2016 Roussanne (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A pure expression of Sangiovese, this delivers aromas and flavors of black cherry, dried plum, licorice, ground black pepper and hints of leather and tobacco. Solid tannins give it a firm structure. Drink 2017–2022.",90,Salcheto 2012  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano
"While the nose is a touch brambly, profoundly ripe blackberry and cherry flavors are ruddy, almost pulpy on the palate of this plush juicy wine. Soft acidity and even softer tannins contribute to its easy-drinking style. Drink now through 2019.",86,Rooster Hill 2015 Estate Grown and Produced Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes)
"The scent of ripe Mirabelle plums engulfs the nose and unfolds even further on the palate. The plump fruit is tempered by sprightly, fresh lemon. It is purity of fruit with a wholesome edge of earthiness that distinguishes this streamlined, poised wine. The length is astonishing.",94,Pichler-Krutzler 2013 Loibenberg Riesling (Wachau)
"The gold color and honeyed aromas are a great invitation to this ripe, sweet wine. Wood aging has a given just a hint of toastiness to the opulent honey and lemon flavors. It's hard to resist now, but the wine will be even better from 2017.",93,Domaine Rotier 2011 Renaissance Vendanges Tardives Loin de l'Oeil (Gaillac Doux)
"Ripe plum, tobacco, dark spice and balsamic aromas adorn this invigorating red. Firm and full-bodied, the palate delivers wild cherry, crushed raspberry, star anise and grilled herb flavors with a backbone of youthful, bracing tannins. It's already tempting but give it time to fully come around. Drink 2020–2032.",93,Il Poggione 2012  Brunello di Montalcino
"A blend of Touriga Nacional and Trincadeira named after Pingo, the winemaker's dog. It's fruity, juicy and fresh with fine acidity and the right balance of spicy tannins. It is ready to drink now.",87,J. Portugal Ramos 2014 Smart Dog Red (Alentejano)

The flavors show a mixture of lightness, intensity and richness, along with a captivating sense of texture and acidity.",93,Spring Valley Vineyard 2012 Katherine Corkrum Estate Grown Cabernet Franc (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"The wine comes from a selection of parcels on the Castera estate. With a majority (60%) of Cabernet Sauvignon, the wine is structured and firm and still developing. It has red-berry and black-currant fruit along with plenty of tannic structure. Drink the wine from 2020.",90,Château Castera 2015 Château Bourbon la Chapelle  (Médoc)
"This unusual blend holds 57% Mourvèdre, 34% Syrah, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Malbec. It displays heaping amounts of black pepper along with aromas of dried herbs, vanilla and cherry. The style is elegant but with good concentration and a silky feel, with a tart uptick on the pepper and vanilla-filled finish.",88,Pondera 2011 Escapade Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a fruity, pineapple and citrus-flavored wine that is tight and with a tangy texture. It is fresh, juicy and attractively crisp. It has weight and richness from the intense fruit that contrasts with the acidity. It is delicious now although it will be much better from late 2016.",90,Château de Sancerre 2014  Sancerre
"This lip-smackingly complex, pure varietal wine from a prime Napa Valley location is awash in floral chewing tobacco and roasted coffee aromas. These expand on the palate into cedar and black currant, remaining softly alluring through a base of power. Decant or cellar through 2020–2022.",93,12C Wines 2012 G3 Beckstoffer Vineyard Georges III Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"This dark Rosso opens with aromas of dark fruit and bramble, with subtle background hints of wild mushroom and cured meat. Endnotes of crushed black pepper and crushed clove bring up the rear.",86,Tenuta Carlina 2010 La Togata  (Rosso di Montalcino)
"A gorgeous Chardonnay, flamboyant in tropical fruit, honey, cream and buttered toast, but so balanced in acids and minerals, so clean and pure, that it ventures into truly classic territory. The vineyard long has been a special one for Talley. Now, Testarossa gets to dip in, with fantastic results. One of the best Chardonnays Testarossa has ever produced.",95,Testarossa 2010 Rincon Vineyard Chardonnay (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"Lavender and violet notes accent ripe, fresh raspberry in this ripe but crisply structured red blend. The palate is juicy and velevety, showcasing bright acidity and a lingering granite finish. It's full bodied and robust in tannins yet maintains a taut, spry elegance.",90,Brooklyn Oenology 2014 Persistence Red (North Fork of Long Island)
"There are powerful tannins at work here. The wine has structure, a solid and firm texture and strong black currant flavors. It's still young, showing a dry, mineral edge that will need to warm up before it's ready. Drink from 2017.",90,Lavradores de Feitoria 2011 Três Bagos Red (Douro)
"Barrel notes dominate, with aromas of vanilla, pencil lead and coconut shavings out in front of purple fruit that's struggling to get to the surface. The palate is tart and elegantly styled, but the wood takes over the show.",87,Ribbon Cliff 2013 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Gritty berry aromas are solid but a bit underwhelming for a wine of this price. Heavy, sticky and tannic on the palate, this tastes of herbal berry fruits and a ton of oak. That woodiness reverberates on the finish via maple, resin and toast flavors, while hard tannins make this more about power than finesse. Drink through 2025.",92,Viña Cobos 2013 Volturno Cabernet Sauvignon (Perdriel)
"Il Veltro is a newish brand of Brunello from Montalcino that opens with bright berry nuances and background notes of spice, cola, tobacco and leather. The mouthfeel is rich and firm, enduring but not too heavy or overdone.",90,Il Veltro 2005  Brunello di Montalcino
"This offers good quality for the price from this historic producer, which heads south to this dry-farmed vineyard planted in 1976. The wine shows lots of lemon scents, from blossoms to peels, along with browned butter, sea salt and smoke. The palate offers singed lime peels, red grapefruit skin, iodine and sour yellow apple peels, proving quite complex.",92,Mount Eden Vineyards 2013 Wolff Vineyard Old Vines Chardonnay (Edna Valley)
"Fun and refreshing, this bright dessert wine has aromas of white spring flower and tropical fruit. The lightly foaming palate presents ripe apricot, peach and a hint of aromatic herb while a note of candied lemon drop closes the soft finish.",86,Cupcake 2015  Moscato d'Asti
"Despite the famed vineyard on the label, this seems a bit gauzy, chalky and stripped. There are light suggestions of berry and cherry, and hints of the nice details of earth and mineral that old vines can often bring. The finish is dilute and slightly metallic.",86,Et Fille 2012 Maresh Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"A subtle nose of citrus suggests a restrained wine. Indeed, the palate is slender, citrus-fresh and light, but enlivened by the peppery varietal edge that invariably adds interest. Clean, crunchy finish.",89,Fritsch 2013 Schlossberg Grüner Veltliner (Wagram-Donauland)
"This block selection is from the vineyard's highest elevation vines. It shows extra cut and precision, with mineral flavors under tight raspberry fruit. Tannins are polished and proportionate, and the wine has a sculpted mouthfeel. It was fermented with native yeast, and aged 15 months in one-quarter new French oak.",92,Bryn Mawr Vineyards 2014 Krista's Block Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"The aromas of barrel spice, toast, herb and plum are reticent on first pour. On the palate, sweet fruit flavors are supported by lightly grainy tannins. It's straight down the fairway.",88,14 Hands 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Of all Roessler's 2007 Pinots this is the only one that's overripe. It strikes you with a Porty aroma, an impression confirmed when you taste the raisiny flavors. Ready now.",84,Roessler 2007 Alder Springs Pinot Noir (Mendocino)
"A combination of 76% Zinfandel and 24% Petite Sirah, this vineyard's lineage traces back in stages. The core six acres of Zinfandel was planted before 1892, the other acreage much more recently. Still, the wine retains an old soul of leather, tobacco and baking spice, wrapped around a ham-fisted swath of toasted oak.",88,Ravenswood 2012 Barricia Single Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley)
"Perhaps the greatest way to taste this legendary winery in an affordable way, this appellation-blend bottling shows baked bramble pie, dried chaparral scrub, licorice, roasted beef and allspice on the palate. The plump blackberry and black-cherry fruit is leveled by rocky minerality and clove spice, all boosted by long lasting acidity.",92,Williams Selyem 2014 Pinot Noir (Central Coast)
"Concentrated and sweet, with medicinal aromas, a lot of color and burnt characteristics. The palate is big and acidic, with jumpy plum, berry and candied flavors. Short and stunted on the finish, and seemingly roasted. A step down from the previous vintage.",84,TerraNoble 2008 Reserva Syrah (Colchagua Valley)
"This wine has some bitter extraction giving it a hard edge. The fruit is lost in the dry, tannic structure. That hard edge will be tough to shift. Try drinking from 2017.",85,Château Garreau 2011  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux
"This 100% varietal wine comes from Conner Lee, Sagemoor and Klipsun vineyards. Already six years old, it's near full-bloom with aromas of dates, blackberry pie, dried herbs and spice. The black fruit flavors are full bodied and dense. Drink up.",91,Syzygy 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Upon opening, this intense, fragrant wine seems European in style, with Italian-like nuances of leather, fungus and tobacco. The enticing whiffs give way to a full-flavored palate that offers notes of mixed red fruits, while the finish loses some focus.",89,Ambassador Vineyard 2010 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"This is a pale colored, attractively perfumed wine. With red berry fruit flavors, bright acidity and a lively orange zest texture, it is fruity and ready to drink.",86,Casa Santos Lima 2015 Lab Rosé (Lisboa)
"The palest pink in color, this wine has a crisp texture but not much fruitiness. It is light with a touch of perfumed acidity. Drink now.",84,Château Thieuley 2016 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
"Here's a bright, tart, wonderfully drinkable young Sauvignon Blanc with some real complexity. It's savory in citrus, gooseberry, green apple and vanilla flavors, with just a touch of creamy oak.",90,Venge 2012 Juliana Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Smoky, yeasty aromas of burnt orange are spicy and good. This shows a citrusy palate with give and depth along with nectarine, yeast and smoky flavors. Toasty barrel influences are noticeable on the finish, which is moderately sophisticated.",87,Ruca Malen NV Brut Sparkling (Mendoza)
"Pinched and wiry-smelling on the nose, this Garnacha comes around with earthy red-berry aromas in front of a full, chunky, fairly oaky palate. Flavors of blackberry and vanilla are good but common, while the finish is dense but basic.",86,Valcantara 2012 Old Vine Garnacha (Cariñena)
"This opens with light and bright aromas of ripe red plum and berries, with glimmers of savory herbs and menthol. Accessible and open on the palate, the solid red-fruit core is brimming with juicy flavor, while a soft astringency unfolds on the close.",86,Simonsig 2011 Pinotage (Stellenbosch)
"Mostly from Pepper Bridge and Seven Hills vineyards, this wine has aromas of cherry, green herbs, pepper and flowers, with the Petit Verdot (15%) showing through. It's brawny in feel, with coffee and cherry flavors, chewy tannins and mouthwatering acids.",88,Three Rivers 2012 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This offers a hint of honey in the nose, then moves into a fresh palate loaded with a full range of yellow fruits. The acidity is spot on, and a suggestion of wet cement adds a hint of mineral to the lengthy finish. Drink now through 2024.",92,Trisaetum 2013 Coast Range Estate Dry Riesling
"The Australian producer tries its hand at California fruit, and this very straightforward bottling showing aromas of cranberries, raspberries and graphite. The palate is clean and familiar, with Bing cherries, oregano and black slate. It's a good-deal wine",86,Wild Oats 2013 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)
"The winery's '05 Cab is tannic and dry and elegant. It tastes like a young Bordeaux, a wine that needs time in the cellar to come around. The flavors are classic Napa Cab, all black currants, black cherries and oak. Just beautiful. Best after 2009, but good now with decanting and a big, important steak.",92,Peter Franus 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Of Loring's dozen single-vineyard Pinots released this season, this is one of the softest, sweetest and simplest. It's pretty good, with polished cherry pie filling, cola, carob, licorice and spice flavors. But it could have a firmer structure.",85,Loring Wine Company 2006 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Aged in neutral oak, this appealing wine has a strong underpinning of wet rock. The spicy, tart cranberry/raspberry fruit is rich enough to deserve more bottle age in order to reach its peak. Drink 2016–2020.",88,Division 2014 Methven Familly Vineyards Cru Gamay Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"A blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 20% Sangiovese, this offers aromas of black currant, caramel and mocha. The dense palate delivers toast, leather and cedar alongside teeth-coating tannins that grip the finish.",87,Tenuta Forconi 2013 Toscano Red (Toscana)
"Guigal customarily releases many of the firm's red wines after additional cellaring, so this 2006 is still on the market. It's nicely balanced for current drinking despite some slightly drying tannins on the finish, which only serve to accentuate the mouthwatering black cherry fruit. Leather and spice notes add welcome nuance.",87,E. Guigal 2006  Gigondas
This simple white opens with aromas of honeysuckle and pear while the easygoing palate offers hints of nectarine and green apple. Fresh acidity gives it a brisk finish. Drink soon.,85,Famiglia Cielo 2016 Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie)
"Chunky, roasted, somewhat stalky aromas are big and generous but lack purity. This feels snappy and tannic, while flavors of tomato, herbs and oak end with loamy, baked flavors. This is good stuff but it leans toward tomato sauce in flavor and feel.",88,Finca Valpiedra 2011 Cantos de Valpiedra Crianza  (Rioja)
"While this opens slowly, it conveys notions of yellow pear and aloe vera. These turn into full-blown fruit on the textured palate that also shows off a limey tang and enticing green pepper.",90,Hiedler 2012 Kittmannsberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"Impressive from the start for its rich blackberry and dark chocolate flavors, thick tannins and sweet overlay of smoky oak. Could be an ager, but some bitterness in the middle suggests the fruit will fall out before the tannins resolve.",87,Vellum 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A modern, superfresh white, as befits the Australian background of winemaker Peter Bright. It has lemon and pear fruit, attractive acidity and a zingy orange zest texture. Drink now.",85,Terra d'Alter 2010 Fado Branco White (Alentejano)
"Warm, fruity and ripe, this offers a good balance between a ripe, creamy, yellow-fruit character and juicy acidity that refreshes and gives a crisp aftertaste. The wine is totally ready to drink.",86,Chartron et Trébuchet 2014  Bourgogne
"Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, this reserve comes from a three-acre block of an estate vineyard. Dark, fleshy plum and soft, supple tannins give it a fruit-tinged structure and lushness, alongside plenty of full-bodied chocolate, tobacco and a hint of mint.",92,Flora Springs 2012 Rennie Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
"A very herbal wine, with vegetal flavors of celery and asparagus. Citrusy acidity comes through at the end.",83,Quinta de Ventozelo 2010 Cister da Ribeira Branco White (Douro)
This opens with hushed aromas that recall pressed white flower and orchard fruit. The rather lean palate shows raw yellow peach and a touch of acacia honey alongside bracing acidity. A note of bitter almond and a hint of mineral mark the finish.,86,Livio Felluga 2014 Pinot Grigio (Collio)
"This fine wood-aged wine is rich with ripe yellow fruit and a subtle toasty character. It's smoothly textured, brimming with fruit and spice, finishing on vibrant acidity. Impressive in its youth, it will be better from 2018.",91,Ramos-Pinto 2015 Duas Quintas Branco Reserva White (Douro)
"Ripe cherry and white pepper aromas lead the nose. The ripe, straightforward palate doles out fleshy wild cherry, raspberry and star anise while smooth tannins provide the polished framework. Drink through 2018.",89,Terre di Giurfo 2012 Maskaria Red (Sicilia)
"Sheldrake's Riesling begins with nosings of pear, apple and spice, and on the palate, offers apple and citrus with a minerally edge. Friendly and crisp, it's a good summer sip or cohort to Thai cuisine or grilled seafood.",85,Sheldrake Point 2007 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Made in a ready-to-drink, approachable style, this would be a fine introduction to Hawke's Bay/Gimblett Gravels Syrah. Blueberries, mulberries and spices abound, while hints of espresso and dark chocolate appear on the softly dusty finish. Drink this medium-bodied wine now through 2020.",91,Trinity Hill 2014 Gimblett Gravels Syrah (Hawke's Bay)
"This solidly fruity wine comes with a generous application of toasty, buttery oak flavors. About 40% was barrel fermented, the rest done in stainless steel. Fleshy peach fruit is awash in buttery caramel and toffee flavors.",90,Nk'Mip Cellars 2012 Chardonnay (Okanagan Valley)
Strong aromas and flavors like smoke and bacon seem heavy in this medium-bodied but tannic wine. A dish with bacon might bring it around.,84,Row Eleven 2013 Vinas 3 Pinot Noir (California)
"Crisp and fruity, this bright wine is full of lively acidity, tangy citrus and apple fruit and refreshing acidity. It is ready to drink.",88,Domaine de l'Idylle 2015 Cruet Jacquère (Savoie)
"Textural and spicy, this has a subtle mix of herb, salts, stem, leaf and wild berry flavors. It's fascinating and complex, with the sort of mystifying sex appeal that only Pinot Noir seems to be capable of. It spent 18 months in 30% new French oak to good effect.",92,Quintet 2014 Lichtenwalter Vineyard Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge)
"The Morrison Lane Vineyard Syrah is one of the highlights of the lineup from K Vintners, but has not previously been made by Walla Walla Vintners. Here it is shown unblended and wrapped in a generous amount of cinnamon, baking spice, milk chocolate and hazelnut flavors from barrel aging. The juice is a little overpowered, though the acids punch through with some tart raspberry fruit.",89,Walla Walla Vintners 2005 Morrison Lane Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This blend of 54% Grenache Blanc, 44% Roussanne and 2% Viognier makes for a very floral nose at first, then it unleashes aromas of grapefruit peels, seared yellow pears and candied apples. The palate is racy with joyous acidity and chiseled with wet stone, showing crisp apple and nectarine flavors.",90,Eberle 2015 Côtes-du-Robles Blanc White (Paso Robles)
"Sweet aromas of berry pastry and black licorice are moderately convincing, while the palate is reduced and chunky, with thick but dull prune and roasted berry flavors. The finish is more of the same: baked fruit flavors and sweet.",84,Santa Carolina 2008 Reserva Syrah (Rapel Valley)
"A complex blend of five grapes, this is a textured and fruity wine that is impressively fresh and crisp. Apples, strong citrus and apricots are all present in this tight, mineral wine. Drink from 2016.",88,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2014 Talhão 1 White (Tejo)
"Beautifully aromatic notes of ripe apple make for a most appetizing nose. The soft fizz on the palate underlines both the fruity apple purity and the bready backdrop of autolysis. A very harmonious refreshing wine that is dry, utterly light and moreish.",90,Jean-Baptiste Adam NV Les Natures Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"Heavy wood aromas are mitigated on the palate by the ripe fruit, making for a rich wine with black plum flavors as well as a core of tannins. It's going to develop well and quickly, so drink from 2016.",85,Château Carcanieux 2012  Médoc
This elegant Vermentino from Tuscany has a lovely floral fragrance of white flowers and stone fruit accompanied by succulent peach and ripe pear flavors. The fruit richness is balanced by crisp freshness.,89,Sada 2012 Vermentino (Toscana)
"Soft, ripe and fruity, this is a smooth and clean wine. It has yellow fruit, pineapple and white currant flavors that give a perfumed edge. It's not a wine for aging, so drink now.",84,Herdade do Rocim 2012 Bojador Branco White (Alentejano)
"This wine is crisp, tight and mineral while also full of lively apple and citrus fruit. It offers concentration from old vines and a fresh, forward character that demands instant drinking.",89,Philippe Viallet 2015 Apremont Vieilles Vignes Jacquère (Savoie)
"From winemaker Heidi Barrett's own brand, this Cab is tightly wound in cranberry and tart cherry, before evolving in the glass into a textured, layered experience of toasty oak and a lush, silkiness on the palate. It finishes with a touch of cedar, and should cellar well, through 2021.",90,La Sirena 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This is a fruity wine, full of herbal and apple flavors. The vines are planted on slopes across the Loire from Sancerre, giving minerality as well as juicy acidity. Young and fresh, the wine will benefit from waiting a few months more. Drink from early 2017.",87,Clement et Florian Berthier 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Coteaux du Giennois)
"Melon and citrus aromas and flavors mingle easily in this cleanly made quaffer. It's a bit plump on the palate, yet refreshing on the lemon-lime finish.",85,Jacob's Creek 2015 Classic Pinot Grigio (South Eastern Australia)
"Floral and herbaceous on the nose, there's an abundant freshness to the red plum and pomegranate flavors on this elegant Saperavi. Dry in style, with brisk acidity, it balances a crisp, fruity profile with a backbone of coarse tannins.",88,Telavi 2009 Marani Kondoli Vineyards Saperavi (Kakheti)
"Blue flower, sweet baking spices, ripe cherry and black raspberry sensations come together in this smooth, savory wine. Supple tannins and lively acidity support the juicy fruit palate.",88,Ciabot Berton 2012 3 Utin Nebbiolo (Langhe)
"A shower of crushed minerals lends transparency to this fleshy dry Riesling. It's bold in body and alcohol, heaving lusciously with ripe tangerine, peach and nectarine flavors, but zesty acidity adds levity. The finish is warm and smoky but long and languorous.",92,Domdechant Werner 2015 Hochheimer Kabinett Riesling (Rheingau)
"Ripe, rounded, creamy wine, with sweet spice, but still with a reservoir of the freshest acidity. Green apple fruits add crispness, while the wine finishes in a golden afterglow. Screwcap.",92,Sepp Moser 2008 Breiter Rain Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"Aged in 30% new French oak, this has brown sugar, cola and root beer notes to back up its black cherry fruit. Coelho has shaken up its lineup, made some clear improvements and kept prices in line. Drink now or through the early 2020s.",89,Coelho 2015 Paciência Coelho Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Shows the richness and balance of Stag's Leap Cabernets, with firm tannins housing solid flavors of blackberries, black cherries and black currants. Blended with 12% Merlot, it's voluptuous and delicious to drink now, and should develop bottle complexity over the next eight years.",90,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2010 ARTEMIS Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A field blended red wine of 33% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Cabernet Franc and 33% Merlot. There's red cherry and herbal stuff going on, but the wine also lacks texture and depth.",84,MICA Cellars 2009 CFM Jolon Vineyard Red (San Antonio Valley)
"Syrah can be expressive even when slightly green, as it is here. Strawberry and raspberry fruit flavors are set amidst sharp, slightly chalky, citrusy acids. Best to drink this with grilled meats.",86,Griffin Creek 2011 Syrah (Rogue Valley)
"From the outer reaches of Annapolis, where the ocean likes to assert itself, this wine is cloudy and stemmy, with a lively, carbonic-like freshness. Roses and citrus play off each other in complex, complicated ways, allowing the firm, present tannins to relax. Black tea and anise complete the picture.",92,Davis Family 2014 Campbell Ranch Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"A Pannobile blend is one that is tasted and approved by a group of producers in Gols, on the north shore of Lake Neusiedl. This firmly tannic wine is a good example of the style—solid, rich, more than the sum of its parts, giving big black berry fruits as well as vibrant juiciness.",90,Gsellmann & Hans 2006 Pannobile Red (Burgenland)
"Redolent with melon and pineapple, this medium-bodied unoaked Chardonnay is simple, fruity and clean, with a tart, citrusy finish. Drink now.",85,Chapel Hill 2008 Unwooded Chardonnay (South Australia)
"Lifted, pear-scented freshness dominates the nose while the palate is soft but has a pleasing and linear citrus focus. This is poised and offers sophisticated refreshment.",92,Steininger 2013 Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"Breezily aromatic notes of juniper, cypress and lemon zest overlay ripe and juicy peach tones on the nose. The palate is centered on pink grapefruit peel, with a toned, concentrated body that buffers the fresh acidity and delivers a softer style. Everything is tightly held, as in a bud that still needs to open. This is a wine for the long run. Future pleasures are indicated by those multifaceted aromas. Ready from 2016.",93,Domäne Wachau 2012 Kellerberg Smaragd Riesling (Wachau)
"This clean if somewhat simple bottling starts with an extremely light and delicate nose of red cherry, rust, sagebrush, thyme and anise. The texture is light on the sip but the tannins prove somewhat grippy, with flavors of pomegranate and cracked pepper.",88,Black Ridge 2014 Barn Block Reserve Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Quite a strong essence of grape extract as well as blackberry and vanilla run over and through this one. Heavy and full in the mouth, but also a bit sharp on the back palate; finishes with a mild tannic burn. Best up front. The intent and body are there, but overall it misses a beat.",84,Flynn 1998 Reserve Pinot Noir (America)
"This is gorgeous with a delicate but intense bouquet of pressed rose, wet earth, licorice cola and dried berry fruit. The mouthfeel is incredibly long and silky.",93,Negretti 2007 Mirau  (Barolo)

"Hits the popular Chardonnay sweet spot right down the middle, with honey, orange, apricot and oak flavors, with a creamy, buttery mouthfeel.",85,Midnight 2011 Estate Chardonnay (Paso Robles)
"White flowers, lemon peel and vanilla lead this elegant white. Though the wine's tropical fruit flavors are forward, its minerality and spice give it grounding. This is a very good everyday white perfect for grilled chicken and heartier vegetable dishes.",89,Gaia Wines 2014 Thalassitis Oak Fermented Assyrtiko (Santorini)
This is a very rich wine with black fruit and bitter coffee flavors and dense tannins. Its weight is almost too much for the firm structure that is underneath.,88,Château Cap Léon Veyrin 2009  Listrac-Médoc
"A pretty good Merlot for the price, it's dry and full-bodied, with cola, black cherry, oak and baking spice flavors. Easy to drink with everything from burgers to a char-broiled steak.",85,Lockwood 2012 Merlot (Monterey County)
"Basic aromas of spiced plum, cassis and black cherry set up a similar set of flavors, while the feel is pure, clean and easygoing. This is a no-nonsense, familiar type of mass-market Cabernet. It's generic in its approach and it doesn't vary much along the way.",86,San Pedro 2007 Castillo de Molina Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Cachapoal Valley)
"91-93. Barrel sample. An attractive and fruity wine that offers soft, cushioned tannins, along with ripe, easy fruit.",92,Château Grand-Puy-Lacoste 2011 Barrel Sample  (Pauillac)

"The oak—all French—is out front with notes of toast, crème brûlée and spice along with peach and lemon. It's light in style with a warm finish.",87,Browne Family Vineyards 2011 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
Briny citrus and hay aromas lead to a palate with mild citric acidity. Saline-influenced flavors of stalky white fruits and white pepper finish with dry citrus notes.,88,Mont Marçal NV Brut Reserva Extremarium Sparkling (Cava)
"This inky-black Bordeaux blend is based on Cabernet Sauvignon. It's bone dry, tremendously hard in tannins and also quite acidic, giving the overall impression of tough rusticity. However, there's a tremendous core of blackberries and cassis. Decant and drink now.",86,Donati 2011 Claret Red (Paicines)
"This chunky Côtes du Rhône blends 80% Syrah and 20% Grenache to yield deep notes of black cherries, dark chocolate and new leather, finishing long and fruit driven. Drink now–2015.",88,Sélection Laurence Féraud 2009 Red (Côtes du Rhône)
"Densely tannic and firm, this wine has fresh acidity and red-plum-skin flavors. It is a solid, chunky wine, likely to age well, with a vibrant, juicy freshness in the aftertaste.",88,Louis Latour 2005  Chassagne-Montrachet
"Made with late-harvested Garganega grapes, this opens with aromas of pressed Spanish broom, ripe yellow stone fruit and candied citrus drop. The aromas follow over to the soft, rounded palate along with a toasted almond note.",88,Corte Moschina 2014 I Tarai  (Soave)
"Big, brooding and ripe, this is packed with a blackberry flavor that is laced through the bitter chocolate and mocha notes and dark tannins. It is powerful and concentrated, smooth and dark tasting.",89,Château Lamour 2009 Réserve  (Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux)
"Surprisingly complex, yet accessible and appealing, this semisweet Riesling showcases plump yellow peach flavor offset by lemon-lime, saffron and pollen. It's sunny and ripe, yet nuanced with earth and mineral tones. Delicate in body, it finishes moderately long with a touch of honey.",90,Rooster Hill 2013 Reserve Semi-Sweet Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Bright and fresh, this easygoing wine offers aromas of wild berry and fragrant blue flower. The simple, easy-drinking palate delivers red cherry and a hint of white pepper alongside zesty acidity and limber tannins. Enjoy soon.",86,San Leonino 2013 Al Limite  (Chianti Classico)
"This classic-style wine has cedar, tobacco and dark fruit aromas, bold and ripe flavors and a structure that's very firm yet not harsh. Cinnamon, clove and allspice accents complement its black cherry and dark chocolate notes, while a thick blanket of tannin wraps it all up.",93,"Everhart Cellars 2014 The American, Pilot Ridge Vineyard; Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (El Dorado)"
"A lovely wine, soft and charming, but far from simple. Although it has complex layers of cherries, blackberries, cassis and cedar, it also shows a fine structure of ripe, smooth tannins and supporting acidity. Drink now–2015 while it's fresh and forward.",92,Flora Springs 2009 Trilogy Red (Napa Valley)
"Peach blossom and dusty melon aromas set up a snappy palate with a mix of salty, melony flavors along with hints of nut skins and papaya. On the finish, a yeasty flavor softens juicy, nervy acidity and related citrus notes.",87,Finca Manzanos 2014 Blanco Viura-Chardonnay (Rioja)
"Nearly purple in color, it is equally intense in flavor, almost like sipping a straight red wine, save for the low alcohol. This bottling, made by Turkish-born, former oil rig construction worker Ertugrul “Art” Sevtap, begins with candied pecans and other nutty aromas, then brings red apple, light herbals, and hazelnut to the palate. Pair with everything from cedar plank salmon to turkey burgers.",87,Sevtap 2012 Awesome Rosé Sangiovese (Santa Ynez Valley)
"In 1978, Zaca Mesa became the first winery to plant Syrah in Santa Barbara County, and Winemaker Eric Mohseni keeps pushing the quality. This offers notes of blueberry cobbler, rocks and fresh-turned soil, followed by blue fruit flavors, dark chocolate, leather and slight asphalt.",92,Zaca Mesa 2011 Mesa Reserve Estate Grown and Bottled Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)
"A pretty shade of pink bordering on mauve, this bottling shows bright watermelon, fresh strawberry and even red-plum aromas on the nose. The palate is zesty, almost effervescent, with baking-soda texture and lots of energy on the sip but not tons of flavor, with light red-berry elements.",87,Zaca Mesa 2015 Z Gris Rosé (Santa Ynez Valley)
"This wine is tough and structured, while still having plenty of weight and fruit for the future. As it integrates, ripe berry flavors will balance those tannins, giving a classic, structured Bordeaux. Drink from 2018.",88,Château d'Hanteillan 2013  Haut-Médoc
"Ripe grapefruit, green plums and other green stone fruits all show that this wine has some weight, allied with a steely interior. Still young, it fills the mouth with yeast and some toast, but more of an intense freshness.",91,Pascal Doquet 2001 Premier Cru Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)
"Nice yet quiet on the opening, with lime, apple and minerally aromas. Feels tangy, maybe a touch sharp and pointed, with standard Casablanca flavors of lime, bell pepper and green apple. Short and tangy on the finish, with washing acidity.",87,Quintay 2011 Clava Coastal Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"Salted caramel and baked apple contribute to the rich, full-bodied luxuriousness of this wine. Matchstick, lemon tart and pineapple add to the experience, finishing tart and with substance.",86,Black Stallion 2014 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"This wine has overlapping personalities. One drips richly in vanilla and honey, while the other is lemony tart and electric in acidity. They commingle on the finish, and will clearly decide whether to get along or part over time. Give the wine a good swirl.",86,Foppiano 2012 Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"While this was not a generally declared Vintage, there are many attractive, structured single-quinta Ports, such as this. It has ripe sweet black plum and dried prune flavors along with just the right tannic structure to let it age further. While it is drinkable now for its fruit, it will be so much better from 2020.",92,Quinta da Romaneira 2005 Vintage  (Port)
"Somewhat underripe, this Bordeaux-style blend has modest cherry and boiled asparagus flavors.",81,Cielo Malibu Estate Vineyards 2008 Rouge Red (Saddle Rock-Malibu)
"Tropical and forward, and with three months spent in oak, the wine offers some resin and vanilla both on the nose and in flavor. Tastes sweet, honeyed and nutty, with banana and melon notes. An easy drinker that will do best if well chilled.",85,Borsao 2010 White Macabeo (Campo de Borja)
"Aromas of resin, spiced plum, blue flower and a whiff of pipe tobacco float out of the glass. The smooth brawny palate presents dried black cherry, prune, vanilla, mocha and cinnamon framed in firm, velvety tannins. Drink 2018–2016.",92,Brunelli 2011 Campo dei Titari Riserva  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"Seemingly sweet and simple, this has orange and butterscotch candy flavors.",82,Lost Angel 2010 Chardonnay (California)
"Sun-ripened bramble and fresh herbs lend freshness to sweet cantaloupe and peach flavors in this deeply fruity yet earth-inflected auslese. It's lusciously sweet yet taut and bristling with acidity. The finish is marked by mouthfilling, lingering nectar.",93,Dr. Loosen 2015 Ürziger Würzgarten Auslese Riesling (Mosel)
"Plum, prune, oak and vanilla aromas combine to form a welcoming, solid bouquet. This feels snappy, fresh and firm, with no weaknesses. Toasty, earthy plum and cherry flavors finish lively, zesty and spicy, with mild tartness. Drink through 2018.",90,Viña Herminia 2009 Reserva  (Rioja)
"This is concentrated and ripe, with its fruit sublimated into a tense, mineral texture, layered with equally intense acidity. It has power, with the fruit lending a rich, full-bodied finish.",94,Schloss Gobelsburg 2010 Lamm Erste Lage Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"Smoke and crushed mineral notes, along with a lean, herbal tone, make this off-dry Riesling especially elegant and savory in style. Lime zest and lemon flavors fill the mouth with vital energy. It finishes moderately long, on a juicy tangerine note.",89,S.A. Prüm 2012 Essence Riesling (Mosel)
"This is a smooth and rounded wine that has a fine kick of acidity to keep it crisp. With toast and lemon juice blending well together, the wine is rich while also showing a mineral texture. This is a refreshing delicious wine that will be ready to drink from 2018.",91,Olivier Leflaive 2014  Meursault
"This leads with aromatic herb, wild berry and oak-driven spice notes. The tight, taut palate offers licorice, clove, baking spice, crushed sage and dried black cherry flavors but lacks fruit richness. It's framed by firm, close-grained tannins and vibrant acidity.",88,Molino 2014 Teoramo  (Barbaresco)
"Gorgeous and smooth, this elegant, 10-year-old red boasts aromas of new leather, tilled soil and pipe tobacco. The polished and structured palate delivers creamy black cherry, star anise and clove framed in refined tannins. It's a remarkable performance for what was an extremely hot vintage. Best through 2023.",95,Mirafiore 2007 Riserva  (Barolo)
"The spice of this wine shows most. Add that to its good acidity and lively texture, and the wine will be delicious and rounded in a few months time. Drink from late 2017.",86,Château des Arras 2016  Bordeaux Blanc
"Bright Cabernet aromas of blackberry and black pepper are followed by some bitter almond and cured meat tones. It has structure, firmness and intensity, with a medium build.",87,Viticultori Associati Canicatti 2010 Aquilae Cabernet Sauvignon (Sicilia)
"The warm Beauroy vineyard has produced a rich, full-bodied and concentrated wine. It has a ripe structure that's cut with mineral notes, honey and apple and pear flavors. The wine is still developing and needs to age. Drink from 2017.",91,Pascal Bouchard 2012 Beauroy Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"Coming from one of the state's premier Syrah vineyards, this warm-vintage wine seems aromatically quiet, with light aromas of funk, earth, red berries and coffee. Flavors are generous and ripe, with the alcohol occasionally poking out.",89,àMaurice 2014 Boushey Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"Quietly, under the radar, Treana's red blend is turning into an interesting and exciting wine over every vintage. The '05, a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, shows Paso Robles terroir at its best. The wine is soft, but no softer than a cult Napa Cab, and enormously rich in currant, licorice, chocolate, smoky oak and cinnamon spice flavors that are just delicious. Best now and for a few years.",92,Treana 2005 Red (Paso Robles)
"Made with 80% Sangiovese, 9% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Franc, this opens with aromas suggesting blueberry jam and a whiff of coconut. The round palate doles out mature black cherry, vanilla and cedar alongside smooth tannins.",89,Il Palagio 2013 Casino delle Vie Red (Toscana)
"This tangy, lemon-scented wine has a fine citrus flavor and a mineral touch due to its vineyard's high altitude. It is zesty and bright in character, with fresh final acidity.",87,Companhia das Quintas 2011 Quinta do Cardo Siria (Beira Interior)
"Heavy and smelling a bit of creamed corn and wax. The palate is oddly spritzy and big, with sweet, chunky apple and pineapple flavors. Finishes with sweet pineapple as well, and overall it's probably too tropical and chunky.",83,Viña el Aromo 2009 Winemaker's Selection Viognier-Chardonnay (Maule Valley)
"Winemaker Rick Hill extracts tons of aroma and flavor from this vineyard, which in this bottling shows sagebrush, deep black plum, smoked thyme and light gingerbread notes. The flavors are hearty and rugged, with more sagebrush and smoke, strong mulberrry fruit, peppercorns and roasted meats. It's a rich and savory wine.",95,Tantara 2014 Tondre Grapefield Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"This is a big, mouth-filling Merlot, full-bodied and dry. It's stuffed with black cherry, red currant, licorice and spice flavors that change with every sip.",89,Villicana 2010 Estate Grown Merlot (Paso Robles)
"This wine's intense berry aromas are followed by equally deep flavors, as its meaty, earthy, spicy nuances develop with each sip. It has complexity, concentration, a very smooth texture and that certain wild element that's attractive in Syrah.",92,Terre Rouge 2014 High Slopes Syrah (Sierra Foothills)
This wine is made to be drunk young when it is still in the first flush of its fruitiness. Black plum and blackberry flavors are fleshed out with soft tannins. The aftertaste is fresh with bright acidity. Drink now.,85,Lionel Osmin & Cie 2014 La Réserve Malbec (Vin de France)
"Heady floral aromas of white spring flowers come with accents of exotic fruit and cut grass. The juicy fruit palate offers pineapple, mango and papaya. Crisp acidity leaves a clean finish.",88,Abbazia di Novacella 2012 Sauvignon (Alto Adige)
"This delightful sparkler shows the versatility of the Verdicchio grape. A metodo classico, it has bright and delicious apple, tropical fruit and citrus flavors, with a walnut note on the finish. It's enjoyable now and the silky mousse makes this extra drinkable.",88,Colonnara NV Luigi Ghislieri  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi)
"A delicious, balanced Pinot Noir. Shows dry, pure flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola and sandalwood, with a delicious, drink-me-now appeal.",87,Radog 2007 Radog Pinot Noir (Monterey)
"This is a big wine in structure, but mellow and complex in flavor as if it's been well aged. Blended from Grenache, Tempranillo and Monastrell, it smells lightly sweet and tastes dry and inviting like vanilla, milk chocolate and raspberries.",87,Irwin Family Vineyards 2013 The Mix Red (Sierra Foothills)
"This is currently very dry and austere due to its tannins, but it's impressive for its noble structure and deep, complex flavors of blackberries, cranberries, brown sugar and spices.- With such depth and a long finish, it's clearly a cellar candidate. Don't even think about opening it until 2017, at least.",93,Gary Farrell 2009 Rochioli Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This vigorous sparkler has flavors of red berry, bread crust, bitter walnut and a confectionary note. It's a bit on the lean side, with sharp vivacious bubbles that give it a bracing finish.",86,Bellavista 2011 Rosé Brut Sparkling (Franciacorta)
"Dusty herb and cedar dot the landscape of this well-made, tiny-production wine, that shows plenty of varietal character. A juicy core of cassis is buoyed by tingling acidity, keeping the full-bodied character refreshing and food-friendly.",92,Prime Solum 2013 Brokenrock Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley)
"From an estate that claims to date back to Roman times and has been revived by the current owners, this attractive wine features dusty tannins and ripe, juicy blackberry-flavored Merlot. A touch of perfume and plenty of acidity at the end keep it fresh. Drink from 2017.",89,Château Saint-André Corbin 2013  Saint-Georges-Saint-Émilion
"This is a structured wine, dark and firm as tannins meld with the ripe berry fruits. It has the weight to have great potential. The wine, with its concentration and dense tannins, will be ready to drink from 2025.",93,Meurgey-Croses 2015 Domaine Clos de la Chapelle Champs Pimont Premier Cru  (Beaune)
"Fruity and oaky, with pineapple cream, tangerine sorbet and buttered toast flavors. Made in a ripe, opulent California style.",85,William Hill Estate 2006 Estate Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Smoky blackberry aromas introduce a blocky, ripe, chewy palate with full-force weight, extraction and tannins. Bold flavors of baking spices, clove, blackberry and plum end with chocolaty notes. This is a ripe, globular wine with definition and clarity to go with powerful, ripe flavors. Drink through 2024.",92,Las Vertientes 2013 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Apple, pear and nectarine fruit scents lead the nose of this wine, with a touch of raw almond contributing a gentle nutty accent. Medium weight with great vibrancy and freshness, a lively sweet citrus core lifts the palate and remains through the close.",88,Glen Carlou 2009 Chardonnay (Paarl)
"A blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Grenache, this wine offers both beefy and herbal notes among the more standard black raspberry and plum fruit flavors. Medium-full on the palate with a hint of sanguine character, this comes off a bit brighter and more balanced than one might anticipated from the bouquet.",87,Domaine Sainte Léocadie 2007 Fernand Averoux Red (Minervois)
"Ripe, loamy raisin and kirsch aromas set up a pinched clampy tannic palate that grabs like Velcro. This tastes of vanilla and creamy oak along with herbal red berry fruits. Resiny, vanilla-driven flavors crowd out residual berry fruit on the finish. Drink now.",88,Covila 2008 II Gran Reserva  (Rioja)
"Straightforward aromas of apple, crushed vitamins and yeast lead to a minerally palate. Dry apple and underripe nectarine flavors finish mild and minerally. For value bubbly, this gets it right.",87,Marqués de la Concordia 2013 Selección Especial Brut Sparkling (Cava)
"The wine begins well with aromas of dark fruit and spice, but the palate is less exciting; the burst of fruit gives way to a hollow midpalate, although it does come back to a solid if dull finish.",86,Giribaldi 2004 Rié  (Barbera d'Alba Superiore)
"Sort of a junior version of the winery's pricier vineyard block bruts, this blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir is addictively good. Slightly sweet in honey, it has lime, raspberry and yeast flavors, in a richly textured mousse.",90,Laetitia 2006 Cuvée M Sparkling (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"A taut, mineral wine with a domiNAce of Chardonnay to give the crispest citrus and a very textured feel. Definitely dry, the wine, not from a classic vintage year, seems still young and all fruit, so it would be worth aging for 3–4 years.",90,Charles Ellner 2001 Millésime Brut  (Champagne)
"A robust blend of 38% Zinfandel, 23% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Petite Sirah, 11% Barbera and 11% Syrah, all grown in Lake County, this rightly named Non Typical red is rich in strawberry and raspberry flavors with dusty overtones. Structured, but soft in the mouth, with a caramel finish.",87,Shed Horn Cellars 2010 Non Typical Red (Lake County)
"A clean, light wine with cherry and cinnamon notes on the nose and in the mouth. This isn't heavy or deep, but tasty, and evenly textured. Elegant herb and mineral shadings show on the close of this attractive easy drinker. Would do well with a very light chill. —M.M.",85,Viña Collado 1999 Tinto Red (Campo de Borja)
"A blend of red fruit and dark spice shows on the nose of this wine, with dried strawberry and red cherry running into licorice, purple flowers and black slate. The flavors are broad with cherry candy notes, boosted by a boisterous pepper spice, and settling into a decently tart finish.",89,Peachy Canyon 2013 Bailey Zinfandel (Adelaida District)
"Tropical fruit and melon aromas are filled out with a touch of toast and acidity. The result is a wine that is not quite balanced, with wood and fruit still at odds. The aftertaste, with a creamy texture, is more attractive. This is one of the first vintages since Labouré-Roi, which was hit by scandal in 2012, passed into new ownership.",85,Labouré-Roi 2013  Pouilly-Fuissé
"Too soft in acidity, so the blackberry, currant, cherry liqueur and spice flavors have a curious jamminess. The softness and high alcohol emphasize sweetness, affecting the finish.",82,Adelaida 2007 Michael's Estate Vineyard Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"Strong, full-bodied, tannic and muscular, this 50-50 blend of Cab Sauvignon and Cab Franc seduces you with sweet berry fruit, backed with stiff tannins and well-modulated streaks of iron and earth. For Cab freaks this is a gold mine of flavor, but it will need decanting or cellaring. It should keep for a decade or more.",90,Guardian 2007 Stillwater Creek Vineyard The Wanted Red Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Concentrated notes of pear peel and lemon zest make for an intense nose. The palate is juicy, light and fresh and majors on white-pear flesh with a bright touch of lemon that is dry and invigorating. The finish tingles with white pepper and lemon freshness.",91,Domäne Wachau 2016 Ried Liebenberg Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"Lots of personality in this Viognier. It has a meaty fleshiness, in addition to the peach pulp, orange and papaya fruit flavors, with fine acidity that makes it all feel clean and lively in the mouth. An interesting wine to pair with modern pan-Asian-fusion fare.",88,Wattle Creek 2011 Viognier (Alexander Valley)
"From one of the high vineyards on the slopes of the Schrattenthal, this complex Riesling has a fine initial raciness, then opens into perfumed white fruits touched by spice, apricots and a layer of tense minerality. Age for 2–3 years. Screwcap.",90,Zull 2006 Innere Bergen Riesling (Niederösterreich)
The Santa Ynez Valley stalwarts explore the slightly riper side of the grape with this bottling that shows fatter Anjou pear and Key-lime aromas but also tighter chalk and wet sidewalk tones. Sour green-apple skins arise on the sip alongside lime zest. The acidity is noticeable but not racy.,88,Gainey 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Still young and fruity, this wine is totally integrated, harmoniously blending the red fruits with a tight texture and fresh acidity. Although it is drinkable now, it will benefit from bottle age, so best drink from 2017.",91,J. M. Gobillard et Fils 2010 Cuvée Prestige Rosé Brut  (Champagne)
"This blend of 72% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Syrah and 4% Cabernet Franc shows smashed blueberries and blackcurrant on the nose alongside dried dill, pencil lead, cola and beef char. The palate is frame by judicious acidity and strong graphite flavors, with bright cherry and tart dark cranberry fruit, lifted by smoke and black pepper.",90,Jamie Slone Wines 2012 P1 Red (Santa Barbara County)
"This wine never saw any oak. What you get is what the grapes contributed, which is pure, intense tangerine and lime fruit, brightened with brisk acidity. It's a chiseled wine, but there's a streak of honey that relieves it.",86,Holman Ranch 2011 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Carmel Valley)
The 45% Cabernet Sauvignon in this wine gives it structure and aging potential. It is a ripe wine that is also stylish with attractive acidity and plenty of black-currant fruitiness. The wine is developing well and it should be ready to drink from 2018.,90,Bernard Magrez 2012 La Sérénité des Grands Chênes  (Médoc)
"Heavy and concentrated vanilla-cherry cola and gingerbread spice notes power the dense nose on this blend of 45% Mourvèdre, 37% Grenache and 18% Syrah. The dried cherries and vanilla bean character extends to the palate, where it also shows Vietnamese coffee flavors mixed with creamy mocha.",90,Calcareous 2012 Tres Violet Red (Paso Robles)
"Nearly a Best Buy, this Riesling offers early drinkability relative to many of its Clare cousins. Mixed citrus and crushed-stone aromas mark the nose, while the medium-bodied palate finishes long, with what seems to be a touch of sweetness. Drink now–2010.",89,Long Flat 2006 Destinations Riesling (Clare Valley)
"This wine from the Loire-based Bourgeois family marries impressive ripeness with bright, red-fruit flavors. Vanilla and oak spice accent pomegranate and red-currant notes, then add a velvety texture to the long finish. Drink now–2024.",90,Clos Henri 2014 Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
"This Chardonnay shows flashy orange, pineapple, peach and honey flavors, enriched with the buttered toast of oak barrels. The texture is creamy smooth.",87,Thomas Fogarty 2010 Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Slightly leesy, oily aromas are mature, with notes of salami, apple and melon popping up. The palate is lush and round, with good acidity keeping things vertical. Leesy flavors of melon, vanilla, spiced apple and brine finish chunky, with moderate complexity.",89,Pazo de Señorans 2013 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Dark ruby in the glass, this wine's simple cherry fragrance does not do justice to its black cherry, blueberry, vanilla and clove flavors. It's bright from the first sip, with silky tannins and black pepper and sage notes that continue into a finish punctuated by a burst of bright cherry.",92,Dalton 2013 Alma Scarlet Red (Galilee)
"The 2015 Estate Chardonnay is a fruit-foward wine, offering bright pineapple and citrus flavors that reverberate on the refreshing finish. On the whole, it is straightforward, with an approachable texture.",88,Kooyong 2015 Estate Chardonnay (Mornington Peninsula)
"This wine offers notes of toasted vanilla bean, herbs and red fruit. It's broad in feel while the fruit flavors are elegant in style, with the supple feel bringing much of the enjoyment.",88,WildAire 2012 Spofford Station Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR))
"Full-bodied and broad, this is a big mouthful of barrel-fermented Roussanne. Modest florals highlight grilled pear and pineapple fruit, toasted marshmallow and honey, turning to stone fruit on the long finish.",91,Brotte 2014 Domaíne Barville Roussanne (Châteauneuf-du-Pape)
"This new vintage of the Zena Crown seems already faded. Light, tart strawberry fruit lacks concentration and carries a bit of bitter herb flavor. Tannins are earthy and the finish abrupt.",86,Soléna 2013 Zena Crown Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Dense and dark in color, this wine has a black currant flavor. The tannins are ripe and soft, and the texture has a fresh lilt to it from the acidity and fruitiness. Only on the finish do the youthful tannins show, promising medium-term aging.",88,Château Bessan Ségur 2010  Médoc
This wine comes from one of Côtes de Provence historic cru classé estates. It is a ripe and smooth wine with crisp acidity and a fine bite of spice. The wine is packed with red fruits and finished with refreshing acidity.,88,Fabre en Provence 2016 Château de la Clapière Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Full bodied and softly tannic, this wine's fruit is front and center, wrapped in a subtle jacket of sweet oak. It dazzles with blackberries, cherries, raspberries, currants and chocolate flavors. Drink now for its sheer lusciousness.",90,White Oak 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Made with organically farmed grapes, this offers aromas of tropical fruit and white stone fruit. The round, juicy palate doles out white peach, yellow apple and a mineral note with a pleasantly bitter almond finish. Tangy acidity brightens the creamy flavors.",89,Pasini San Giovanni 2015 Il Lugana Biologico  (Lugana)
"Comprised of 62% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Syrah, this wine brings aromas of coffee, herbs and dark fruit. The fruit and barrel flavors are candy-bar sweet but still retain a sense of deftness.",90,14 Hands 2012 Limited Release Kentucky Derby Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Brilliantly dry and rich in acidity, this Pinot feels very refined in the mouth. With relatively modest alcohol, it offers an elegant and refreshing alternative to the heavy style of many California Pinot Noirs. Offers notes of earth, cherries, mushrooms, spices and sweet sandalwood.",95,Copain Wines 2009 Wentzel Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"From the new Happy Canyon appellation, this wine is so close to being so good. It's dry and rich in acidity, and complex in blackberry, cherry and currant flavors that finish long and sweet. This new 7200 line from Foxen is worth watching over future vintages.",89,Foxen 7200 2008 Range 30 West Red (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
"Long lees aging (six years) has been good to this wine. It has balanced the bone-dry character of the wine, allowing it to fill out. Now, it is a beautifully structured Pinot Noir-dominate wine, with a light tannic character as well as hints of almonds and plenty of citrus fruits. Drink now.",90,Boizel NV Ultime Extra Brut  (Champagne)
"This rich, concentrated wine is velvet smooth, with tannins enveloped by ripe berry and plum fruits. Wood aging has added to the the rounded character. Despite its approachability, it will age well, so the wine is best drunk from 2018.",91,Château Haut Bertinerie 2012  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux
"It opens with a delicate fragrance of yellow spring flowers and exotic fruit. The juicy palate offers up pear, honeydew melon and banana peel with a hint of nut on the finish. Simple but well-made.",86,La Cappuccina 2013  Soave
"This is a prickly, slightly raspy wine with a lean, grabby feel and briny, pickled flavors of herbal red-berry fruits. It's resiny tasting on the finish, with a snappy feel and lasting herbal flavors.",83,Chispas 2011 Tinto Garnacha (Cariñena)
This is an unassuming and easy red from the shores of Italy's beautiful Lake Garda that offers cherry fruit and loads of exotic spice. Its color is ruby red with bright highlights and it offers sour cherry flavors with some bitterness on the close.,86,Gorgo 2005 Podere Monte Maggiore  (Bardolino Classico Superiore)
"A soft, fruity and lightweight wine. It has red fruits, light acidity and a simple attractive touch of tannin. Drink now.",84,Adega Mayor 2011 Caiado Red (Alentejano)
"What a beauty! Masculine aromas of black fruits, cola and oak sit there begging to be sipped, while the lush, deep palate is home to dense blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors. Lively but dense, with tannins, plenty of oak and a finish of black pepper, fudge and vanilla. Complex and exciting Spanish wine. Needs time; best from 2012 through 2018.",95,Dominio de Atauta 2006  Ribera del Duero
"Lively, fruity and well made, this wine has plenty of raspberry and cherry flavors, good acidity and light tannins to add a bit of grip to the texture. For a medium-bodied wine, it has nice concentration.",88,Renwood 2014 Barbera (Amador County)
"Made using the fragrant Pinot Nero grape, this cheerful rosé sparkler shows a pretty pale-pink color, with delicate aromas of wild berry, cranberry and fresh raspberry. It shows bright, bubbling and persistent perlage.",86,Canella NV Rosé Brut Pinot Nero (Veneto)
"This Cabernet Franc blend opens with herbal oaky aromas of coffee and red fruits. The palate feels tartaric and shocking, with heavy extraction and an overall wiry feel. Jacked-up berry flavors come with more than enough oak, while this is steady but not finessed or elegant on the finish. Drink through 2021.",91,Zorzal 2012 Piantao Red (Tupungato)
"Although 2012 was a ripe, warm year, this wine is tomatoey and herbal. Stalky, salty flavors are barely acceptable.",83,Loriñon 2012 Crianza  (Rioja)
"A disappointment after the fine 2006 and 2007. Shows some unripe notes alongside overripe flavors, resulting in imbalance. The tannins will probably never age out.",85,Ballentine 2008 Old Vines Zinfandel (Napa Valley)
"This wine is relatively full bodied and ripe tasting, while also backed up by enough acidity to keep it refreshing. It tastes like crisp green apples with a hint of fresh herbs.",87,Boatique 2014 Musque Sauvignon Blanc (Big Valley District-Lake County)
"This wine varies in quality and perception based on when in its lifespan you taste it. Now, toward the end of the line, it's tropical and hanging in there, with green apple, citrus and other typical SB aromas and flavors. Even with 15% Carmenère in the blend for kicks, it's standard and workmanlike.",85,oops 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley)
"The opening aromas of reedy berries are gritty and crusty, while the palate is lively but feels snappy and raw. Flavors of cherry and plum are light, while the finish is straightforward, with a citrusy kick. Not as full and generous as past vintages.",85,Luna Beberide 2010 Mencía (Bierzo)
"This blend of Mourvèdre (78%) and Grenache is a very pretty pale peach color. Aged in a mixture of concrete, stainless steel and neutral French oak, it suggests aromas of citrus, strawberry, herb and spice. It tingles the palate with fresh, lively flavors, showing poise and presence with a citrus-filled finish that lingers.",92,Efeste 2015 Oldfield Estate Rosé (Yakima Valley)
"Thick and rich, this is a very concentrated Cabernet that can use more time in the cellar. For now, it has tannins that overwhelm the blueberry fruit and traces of cedar and cocoa.",87,Hawk and Horse Vineyards 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills Lake County)
"Soft fruit that shows velvet tannins and a full, ripe red berry character. There are milk chocolate and bitter cherry flavors and very fresh acidity, all comfortably integrated, just finishing with an edge of pepper.",86,Fischer 2005 Classic Pinot Noir (Thermenregion)
"From the oldest block of the estate's Seven Hills Vineyard, this pure Cabernet opens with intense aromas of mountain fruit. Bramble, light herb, cement, black cherry and cassis combine in a polished, elegant wine that probes deeply into the palate. Flavors abound—cassis, coffee, licorice and more.",95,L'Ecole No. 41 2008 Seven Hills Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This hearty blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller amounts of Malbec and Petit Verdot is a great go-to wine for a crowd. Cabernet leads the way with cedar, cranberry and tobacco notes, clipped by sizable tannin. As it opens, layers of dense raspberry and vanilla flavors unfurl.",88,Gundlach Bundschu 2014 Mountain Cuvée Red (Sonoma County)
"This opens with aromas of charred earth, violet and wild berry. The straightforward palate offers black raspberry, tart cherry and a hint of anise alongside polished tannins. It's rather simple for a Barolo and nearly accessible. Drink 2016–2021.",87,Arbéta 2011  Barolo
"Soft, ripe wine, open and with a fresh mousse. It has some tightness, a nutty quality and a lime juice aftertaste.",85,Ernest Rapeneau NV Brut Sélection  (Champagne)
"Soft and dusty, this is an herbal, elegant Cabernet from big mountain fruit, the tannins well-managed. It starts out with an intensity of black fruit followed by sturdy structure and a finish of chocolate and coffee.",90,Howell Mountain Vineyards 2011 Hillside Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain)
"With its excellent concentration of pure fruit power, this is like taking your mouth through a 100 yard dash of raspberry, blueberry and black cherry fruit, right down the heart of the throat. Along the way you find a tight wrapping of rock and espresso, but it's the snappy, sappy fruit that really shines here. Great length.",93,K Vintners 2008 Morrison Lane Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Just lightly peppery, this is a rounded, smooth wine. It has a creamy texture with baked apple and spiced pear flavor. The acidity is just right, with juiciness on the finish. Drink now.",86,Jean-Baptiste Adam 2012 Tradition Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
"Though golden-hued in the glass, this is rather mellow on the nose, with soft lemon cream, toasted apple and marzipan aromas. The palate shows intense acidic energy, with zippy, tight and clean nectarine sorbet and Meyer lemon rind flavors.",93,Center of Effort 2014 Chardonnay (Edna Valley)
"Whiffs of smoke and sea breeze entice on the nose of this amber-hued Georgian wine, which was aged in traditional clay vessels. Earthy on the palate, with hints of orange rind, mushroom and roasted chestnut, it's shockingly tannic for wine made from white grapes—thanks to being exposed to its grape skins during fermentation and maturation. A fascinating accompaniment to almost any kind of cuisine.",87,Iago's Wine 2010 Chardakhi White Dry With Skin Contact Unfiltered Chinuri (Georgia)
"At first it reveals a layer of damask rose petals and white blossom. Then a deeper, riper notion unfolds, almost hinting at pineapple. Concentrated but slender, the palate manages to remain refreshing and light despite the heady aromas. Perfectly pitched with just a hint of spice.",90,Tinhof 2013 Muskat (Burgenland)
"Deep black plum and black cherry flavors lend fruit concentration to this full-bodied and mouth-filling wine from a tiny hilltop appellation in Mendocino County. Its dark fruit flavors are quite ripe but not sweet, and a good wrapping of fine-grained tannins supports the richness very well.",92,Talisman 2014 Weir Vineyard Méthode Ancienne Pinot Noir (Yorkville Highlands)
"Smoky, roasted aromas of hickory and foresty berry fruits roll onto a palate that's bright and lifted by acidity. Oaky, spicy flavors of vanilla and mocha accent berry fruit, while a juicy finish with bold acidity and smoky, toasty notes of new oak closes this out. Drink through 2021.",91,Nieto Senetiner 2012 Terroir Blend Estate Bottled Malbec (Mendoza)
