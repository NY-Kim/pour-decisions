"This is a quintessential expression of young Nebbiolo, with pretty floral and strawberry notes that carry onto the palate, along with raspberry and mineral nuances and a whiff of spice. A bright, elegant wine made to be drunk young. Imported by Masciarelli Wine Co, Moonlight Wine Co.",88,Giacomo Fenocchio 2011  Nebbiolo d'Alba
"Honey, orange blossom and a little mustard make up the nose of this classic Loire Valley SB. Tangerine and bitter greens play a duet on the palate, and the finish is more or less a reduced version of those primary flavors. The overall impression is one of a simple, tight, easy-to-drink wine.",86,Pascal Jolivet 2000  Pouilly-Fumé
"This reserve offers rather light strawberry fruit, and some highlights of tobacco and milk chocolate. It spent 18 months in one-third new French oak. Despite the reserve tag and the excellent vintage, it comes across as simple and a bit dilute.",86,Vercingetorix VX 2014 Reserve Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Soft and herbal but quite delicious, this Cab offers flavors of blackberries, black currants and mocha, with a rich veneer of sandalwood. At its best now and through 2012.",89,Blue Rock 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Rich and opulent, this opens with toasted aromas of spice and nut, backed by accents of ripe fruit and blackberry jelly. The mouthfeel is soft, supple and slightly sweet.",88,Feudi di San Marzano 2010 Sud Red (Salice Salentino)
"Peppery, rich and low in pronounced oak, this estate-driven Cab has softened tannins and is most definitely drinkable now, with pungent, bright fruit and a lengthy, leathery finish.",88,Rutherford Grove 2010 Pestoni Family Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"Notes of ground coffee, cocoa and forest floor dominate this wine's aromatic profile. Supple, dusty tannins and soft acids frame the weighty palate. The finish is medium to long, but it comes with some warmth.",86,Vivác Winery 2009 Single Vineyard Syrah (New Mexico)
There's an electric current of spice on the first sip. Beyond it are waves of faint strawberry and thin layers of ripe red cherry and a touch of herb. The finish lingers.,87,Robert Mondavi 2012 Napa Valley Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"Concentrated aromas of berry fruits, spice and black currant jelly suggest that the wine is full and rich. In the mouth, severe tannins create a grinding sensation, while flavors of toast, blackberry, cassis and brown sugar lead to a heavy, burnt tasting finish that's blocky in feel.",88,Dominio de Atauta 2009 Parada de Atauta  (Ribera del Duero)
"Made entirely from Nebbiolo, this boasts finesse and structure. Aromas of rose and red berry carry over to the palate alongside bright cherry and yeasty notes of baked bread. Crisp acidity generates freshness, while the elegant perlage gives a silky texture. It finishes bone-dry. Oliver McCrum, Volio Vino.",92,Germano Ettore 2012 Rosanna Metodo Classico Brut Rosé Nebbiolo (Vino Spumante)
"A bit chewy, this brings old-vine texture into play, with herbal highlights around fruit flavors of mountain berry and pie cherry. The snap and tang of tart, just-ripe fruit is much in evidence. Young and sassy, this should continue to improve with further bottle age.",91,Winderlea 2013 Weber Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Very dark in color, this robust wine has enticing wood smoke and oak aromas, rich but dry fruit flavors like blackberry and blueberry, an abundance of muscular tannins in the firm texture and full but not overpowering body. It's very tight to drink now, so best consume it after 2022.",89,Le Casque 2014 Petite Sirah (Sierra Foothills)
"Hints of bramble, savory beetroot and spice lend complexity to lush, ripe black cherry and berry flavors in this full-bodied Cabernet Franc. Unctuous and juicy, it penetrates richly, shaded by soft layers of fine-grained tannins. Drink now–2017.",89,Dr. Konstantin Frank 2013 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes)
"This wine from the Tiefenbrunner estate at Castel Turmhof is a lively, crisp, fresh style of wine, with flavors of green peppers and mint, and good acidity.",86,Tiefenbrunner 2002 Kirchleiten Sauvignon Blanc (Alto Adige)
"This landmark Italian wine continues to show the best of Tuscany, as it faithfully does year after year. The quality is obvious, thanks to rich notes of chocolate, black cherry and spice that are wrapped tight within a lush, soft and texture. The close is velvety and very long.",94,Marchesi Antinori 2008 Tignanello Red (Toscana)
"Too soft in structure, and sweet, too, like berry fruit concentrate. Fans of sweet, simple red wines will like this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Zinfandel.",83,Pomar Junction 2010 Brooster Fighting Red Red (Paso Robles)
"The wine is two-thirds Grenache, 30% Syrah and the rest Mourvèdre. It's warm and fruity, lightly spicy and finishing with tannins showing green tea and leaf. This is mostly Elerding fruit from the Horse Heaven Hills vineyard; balanced and firm.",90,Owen Roe 2006 Sinister Hand Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"An attractive spicy, floral perfume joins rich fruit and spice flavors in this full-bodied, almost thick but luxuriously textured wine. An abundance of enticing oak aromas and flavors mingle with ripe cherry and blackberry notes, while piles of fine-grained tannin give a velvety mouthfeel.",91,Amador Cellars 2013 Ottimista Vineyard Sangiovese (Amador County)
"Grapefruit, crushed tomato vine, exotic fruit and aromatic herb are some of the aromas you'll find on this fragrant white. The elegant medium-bodied palate delivers green melon, citrus and white peach alongside a vibrant saline note that energizes the finish.",90,Castelvecchio 2015 Sauvignon
"This is a ripe and meaty wine (a second Riserva, next to the estate's Riserva Campocerchi) with enduring notes of wet earth, smoke meat, red cherry and dried apple skins. It tastes plump, succulent and bright and would pair well with stewed beef.",87,Collelungo 2006 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"Aromatically, this wine is currently subdued, with the notes of raspberry, cocoa and cherry that haven't fully blossomed. The flavors meanwhile are generous and ripe, while still showing a fine sense of balance. Additional time in the bottle or a long decant should allow it to open up.",91,Leonetti Cellar 2014 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"The bishop's (Evêque) vineyard has produced a stylish, full-flavored wine, densely packed with black cherry, ripe tannins and a juicy, fruity character. It is a dense wine with tannins that promise good aging. Drink from 2016.",91,Domaines Devillard 2011 Château de Chamirey Clos l'Evêque Premier Cru  (Mercurey)
"This is a refined wine, with a layered fragrance of black cherry, raspberry, black pepper and bell pepper. The palate reveals ripe blackberry, plum and baking-spice flavors that are supported by refreshing acidity. Enjoy now or hold for a couple more years.",88,Albino Armani 2010  Valpolicella Ripasso
"Rich and full in mouth, this has green and apple fruit flavors that are cut with acidity. The tangy texture gives a contrast and balance to the wine. Drink from 2017.",88,Isabelle et Pierre Clément 2014 Châtenoy  (Menetou-Salon)
"Mint and smoky aromas give this wine an attractive, juicy character. It is developing well and almost ready to drink. From Cahor's high altitude vineyards, the wine is bright and fruity with damson flavors and smoothed with wood aging. Drink from 2018.",90,Georges Vigouroux 2012 Château de Haute-Serre Malbec (Cahors)
"A big wine in every sense—including its heavy bottle—this is as dense as Zweigelt gets. It retains some of the great bitter-cherry flavor characteristic of the grape, adding spice and wood notes, plus a dense, firm texture. As it develops, this will show impressive depth of flavor.",91,Schwarz Wein 2010 Zweigelt (Neusiedlersee)
"The almost legendary wine of Gassac is in fact a deeply satisfying, rich but structured southern wine, with a fine balance between spice, red fruits and powerful tannins. There's a raw edge of youth here, confirming that these wines always have considerable aging potential.",92,Mas de Daumas Gassac 2005 Red (Vin de Pays de la Haute Vallée du Gassac)
"As gamy as foie gras, and just as rich, this 100% varietal wine fills the palate with baked plum, licorice and intense ripe fruit that borders on confected. Soft tannins and supportive oak give it structure and breadth.",90,Sbragia 2013 Teldeschi Vineyard Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley)
"One of the palest icewines to come across our tasting table, this is an extraordinarily fine example, with great purity of fruit and incredible balance. Tangerine and pineapple flavors shine with pristine clarity from start to finish, making it very drinkable.",95,Schloss Saarstein 2009 Serrig Schloss Saarsteiner Eiswein Riesling (Mosel)
"This wine—named for two adjacent vineyards—is 75% Dionysus Cabernet Sauvignon with the balance Bacchus Cabernet Franc. It provides a pleasing assortment of dried and fresh herbs, cherry, flowers and mocha with a seamless, almost creamy feel, bringing an impeccable sense of balance. It's irresistible now but has the stuffing to go the distance.",92,Trust 2012 A Stone's Throw Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This wine is bone-dry, although with some age the shock of the acidity has been rounded out by a hint of toast. It's linear, fresh and intensely crisp, with citrus and almond tones. Drink this wine from a good vintage now.",91,Aubry 2009 Le Nombre d'Or Brut Nature Chardonnay (Champagne)
"Shines with a nice purple lustre then opens with big blackberry and spiced plum flavors that are earthy and wild. The palate is round, ripe and feels good, and the flavors are centered on herbal blackberry and toast. Very good for the price range.",88,MontGras 2010 Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"Very young, needs plenty of time. Still showing fermentation notes, with brisk, grapey acidity and primary cherry and raspberry fruit flavors. Seems brilliantly constructed and capable of aging, though. Hold until after 2012.",92,Donelan 2009 Walker Vine Hill Syrah (Russian River Valley)
"This high-end blend of Montepulciano (70%) and Cabernet Sauvignon shows the best of winemaking in Abruzzo. This is a poised and confident wine, with defined aromas of ripe blackberry, leather and polished mineral. The tannins are plush and velvety; and the wine definitely delivers a very long and determined finish.",92,Illuminati Dino 2007 Lumen Riserva Red (Controguerra)
"Rounded and approachable, this estate-driven wine is 100% varietal and dusty on the palate in tight-grained oak and tannin. The flavors are richly rewarding, etched in chocolate-covered raspberry, clove and an herbal undercurrent that's hard to pin down.",90,Clos du Val 2014 Hirondelle Vineyard Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District)
"Hugely dense and dark, this is a powerful and concentrated wine. While all this structure is there, so are stylish fruits and the potential for suave elegance, which comes from the wood aging, the rich black fruits and the balance between tannin and fruit. Drink this impressive wine from 2018.",93,Luis Duarte 2013 Rapariga da Quinta Reserva Red (Alentejano)
"Fresh lemony notes are signalled on the nose and fizz on the simple, fruit-driven palate. There is an element of creaminess but the frothing mouthfeel is all about refreshment and easy fruit.",88,Cave de Ribeauvillé NV Giersberger Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Alsace)
"This has a dry finish with modest alcohol, and its emphasis is on phenolic flavors rather than the usual floral-perfumed aromas that characterize most versions of the grape. Here you'll find lemon rind, pineapple and tart, mineral-soaked acids. It's a fine match for white fish, shellfish, scallops or oysters.",88,Abiqua Wind 2015 Gloria Anne Gewürztraminer (Willamette Valley)
"The blend is 70% Syrah, 20% Grenache and 10% Carignan, and in 2009 the grapes were as ripe as they could be. Mocha and chocolate notes pick up a touch of prune. With its superripe fruit, ample weight, lush texture and warm finish, there are valid concerns about its ageability, but this offers hedonistic drinking for an affordable price.",91,Guillaume Gros 2009 El Niño Loco Red (Vin de Pays de la Méditerranée)
"Aragonez is the main force behind this smooth, rich wine. It has great tannins that are cushioned comfortably by the rich, juicy berry fruits. Spice and acidity roll around the mouth, giving a lift to the rich, still firmly tannic wine. Drink this impressive wine from 2018.",94,Fitapreta Vinhos 2012 Palpite Grande Reserva Red (Alentejano)
"What to mention first? A hint of mossy earth, chamomile tisane, Cox Orange Pippin apples or lemon zest? All of these aromas dance on the nose. They are still totally shy on the taut, dry and concentrated palate. For now, it is mossy citrus that is most aromatic while rich fruit still needs to unfurl. This strikes a note of utter purity, of something soaring and bright. Right now this is totally brisk, invigorating and refreshing but its true colors won't show for some time. Drink 2020–2035.",96,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2014 Clos Saint Urbain Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"Citrus and apple aromas are dusty. This is easygoing and just juicy enough, with apple, orange and tangerine flavors. A clean finish turns softer and more mealy the longer it sits.",85,Valdivieso 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley)
"The second wine of the Bruno Prats and Symington family joint venture, this is a deliciously fruity wine, but with a fine elegant backbone of light tannins and smoky wood. As befits a second wine in the Bordeaux tradition, this is ready to drink.",89,Prats & Symington LDA 2007 Post Scriptum de Chryseia Red (Douro)
"An aromatic wine with gardenia, ripe nectarine and honey. It's medium-plus sweet with jasmine and stone fruit flavors with the grape's natural acidity playing along nicely.",86,Washington Hills 2013 Riesling (Washington)
"This is a light and fruity wine that has some attractive red berry flavors and lively acidity. There is a tannic background that gives the a sense of structure, although the dry core lacks some fruit tones.",88,Quinta Santa Eufemia 2010 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port)
"This is a biodynamic blend of Merlot and Cabernet Franc that's focused on two principle components: green Cabernet Franc notes and dusty, mineral ones. Both speak to the wine's typicity yet the finish falls a bit short.",86,Duemani 2005 Altrovino Red (Toscana)
"This Chardonnay in a box is the equivalent of four regular bottles, but it's not a very good wine. It's ultradry and acidic, with unripe, vegetal flavors that just approach citrus fruits.",82,Monthaven 2008 Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"Clean, simple pear, melon and apple aromas are friendly. Reasonably full and fresh on the palate, this value-priced wine tastes of tropical fruits including banana and papaya as well as honey. A slightly oily finish gives weight to closing citrus flavors.",85,Viña Bisquertt 2014 Petirrojo Reserva Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley)
"This wine is rich and spicy. At this stage, with its muted fruit, it is all potential, but one can sense the ripeness and generous texture that will make it excellent once it matures. Give this powerful wine until 2023.",93,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2015  Corton-Charlemagne
"Once the sulfur aromas from recent bottling blow over, the wine shows ripe fruit with a soft texture. Pear and yellow fruits are going to come through in a few months. Drink from 2015.",86,Chanson Père et Fils 2012  Pouilly-Fuissé
"There's vibrant acidity and underlying flavors of pineapple, white peach and mango in this Chardonnay. The overall palate, however, is overwhelmed by oak.",84,Educated Guess 2011 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Light in color and stemmy and spicy in equal parts, this light, bright wine is complex and intriguing in its offering of white pepper, baker's yeast and cranberry coated in vanilla. It delivers flavor and nuance in a pleasing showcase of the variety.",91,Terlato 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This elegant blend of stainless- and barrel-aged lots captures the fresh fruit flavors of red apples, kiwi and lime, letting just a hint of barrel toast creep into the finish. It's leesy and bracing, finished at 14.8% alcohol but tasting much lighter.",88,Spindrift Cellars 2006 Woodhall Vineyard Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
"With 11% Petit Verdot, this hearty, full-bodied red shows crunchy, high-toned cranberry and elements of black pepper, pencil shavings and dried herb. A toughness of leather dives into the tobacco-laden finish.",88,Medlock Ames 2014 Bell Mountain Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"A majority of Merlot meets Cabernet Franc in this chocolaty-cherry wine, boldly full bodied and robust in tannin and oak. Brambly blackberry and black currant ride a soft mouthfeel that's moderate in acidity.",85,Stack House 2013 Red (Napa Valley)
"89-91 Both freshness and richness are well combined in this elegant Sauternes. What it misses in weight, it gains in honey and apricot flavors.",90,Château Raymond-Lafon 2010 Barrel sample  (Sauternes)
Strong mint and menthol aromatics give way to intense fresh-cut cedar flavors. There's just too much wood for this woodchuck to chuck.,82,Hargrave 1998 Merlot (North Fork of Long Island)
"This is a linear and polished Montepulciano, with bright fruit nuances of blackberry and cassis, followed touches of black stone, spice and mature plum. It feels smooth and fine in the mouth, with a rich berry-driven finish.",88,Illuminati Dino 2009 Ripamosso  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo)
"Harvested in December, this marries opulent flavors of honey and orange marmalade with intense acidity. Ready to drink in its youth, but it's likely to age for many years. Screwcap.",90,Türk 2010 Eiswein Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"This wine comes from the original, own-rooted, 1965 plantings. It would be interesting to trace the ancestry of these vines, as such things were far less understood 50 years ago. Soft, round and fruity, this offers pleasant flavors of melon and apple. A dash of vanilla cookie coming through as it finishes.",86,David Hill 2014 Estate Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley)
"The 8.3 designation refers to the residual sugar by weight. It is indeed a very sweet wine, rich in simple honey, orange and apricot flavors.",85,Santa Barbara Winery 2010 Lafond Vineyard 8.3 Riesling (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Orange blossom, nectarine and almond skin aromas are true to the grape and inviting. The palate maintains a light, juicy, citric feel as it delivers flavors of melon, apple and banana. Fresh and forward, with a hint of heat and bitterness to the finish.",87,Doña Paula 2010 Estate Torrontés (Salta)
"With a pale coral color and flavors like strawberry and watermelon, this wine is bright and appealing. It is medium bodied and has a hint of sweetness.",86,Peace Water 2015 Inspire Rosé (North Coast)
"The wine comes from vineyards planted close to the Atlantic Ocean, south of Lisbon. That gives cool character to this attractive blend of Alvarinho, Viognier and Sauvignon Blanc. It has green fruits over a perfumed character that is touched by a herbal edge. The finely wrought wine is ready to drink.",89,Cortes de Cima 2015 White (Alentejano)
"Toasted almond aromas lead the way in this elegant, harmonious offering. It's medium bodied and plump, easily supporting intriguing notes of smoke, pineapple, peach and citrus. Drink now–2020.",90,Kumeu River 2014 Estate Chardonnay (Kumeu)
"Sunbaked earth, mature black-skinned berry and brown spice aromas take center stage. The round easygoing palate doles out dried Marasca cherry, blackberry and a hint of star anise. Pliant tannins lend easy drinking support.",88,La Selva 2015  Morellino di Scansano
"A perfumed wine, it is big on spiced apricots and ripe fruitiness. It is rich, full in the mouth with a slight oxidative aftertaste of almonds and walnuts that gives a sense of maturity. Drink now.",90,Rijckaert 2009 Les Grands Elevages Savagnin (Arbois)
"This is sophisticated stuff that lives up to Oakville's reputation. It tastes rich and alluring from the first whiff of black currant and espresso to the ultrasmooth mouthfeel and elegant finish. Think extra-fine tannins, opulent currant, dark chocolate and black cherry flavors. Enjoy it now or save through 2023 to encourage even more bouquet.",93,Hoopes 2013 Oakville Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This is an odd and difficult wine. Strong chocolate aromas recall a just-snapped Hershey bar, and are bolstered with a touch of blackberry coulis. Cola and black cherry show on the palate, but play second fiddle to the overwhelming chocolate flavor.",83,Graveyard NV Deliverance Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"With its delicate layers of garrigue, black tea and black pepper, this wine hails from a vineyard on the edge of the ocean west of Occidental. Intriguing, it's light in its approach and texture, but completely beguiling and complex.",93,Red Car 2012 Hagan Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Fermented in clay amphora, this fascinating orange wine opens with alluring aromas of dried yellow stone fruit, baking spice, aromatic herb, pressed yellow flower and a balsamic note. Boasting more fruit and flavor than many other wines in this genre, the savory enveloping palate presents apricot, yellow peach, candied nectarine zest, crystallized ginger and a hint of flinty mineral. Tangy acidity provides balance and lift while a honeyed note closes the lingering finish. Simply gorgeous.",94,Tre Monti 2015 Vitalba in Anfora Albana (Romagna)
"Expertly integrated butter elements mix with peach and lime spritz on the nose. This single-vineyard Chardonnay offers stone fruit flavors, slight sea saltiness and a long vanilla finish for very easy drinking.",90,Clos La Chance 2012 Harman Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Deep and dense from head to toe, this Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend opens with heavy, loamy black-fruit aromas along with coconut, graphite, cedar and tobacco scents. A definitively rich and chewy palate is tannic and heady but cushioned, while baked, toasty blackberry flavors come with vanilla and marzipan notes and an inky, chewy, thick finish. Drink through 2019.",92,Finca Perdriel 2009 Vineyard Selection Red (Mendoza)
"A big, woody, totally modern style of Syrah. There is a lot more coconut, mocha and big berry fruit than anything you might find from France. It's dark and layered on the palate, with coconut and resin supporting black fruit. Finishes smoky and oaky, but structured, tannic and serious enough to impress.",88,Trivento 2006 Golden Reserve Syrah (Mendoza)
"Underbrush, tobacco, dark cherry, licorice and grilled herb are just some of the aromas offered by this structured wine. The palate delivers mature black cherry, black pepper, sage and licorice alongside tongue-coating tannins that need time to soften. It hails from a top vineyard site and is an impressive effort from this hot, dry vintage. Drink 2017–2024.",93,Produttori del Barbaresco 2009 Montestefano Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"Coppola turns to a respected grape source for Pinot, and what do you know? This is his best ever. It's a lovely wine, supple and bright, with cherry, pomegranate and spicy persimmon flavors. The 50% new oak is perfectly integrated into the wine's power.",91,Francis Coppola 2009 Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"An onion skin pink is an attractive start to this fresh, red fruited wine. It is crisp, but not bone dry, having a soft texture. There is a fine balance of acidity of fruit, giving a light-bodied wine good as an apéritif.",87,Nicolas Feuillatte NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne)
"Tastes a little sweet, which may be from the extremely high (15.4%) alcohol. There's a soft, sugary mouthfeel to the pie-filling cherry and oak flavors. Firm tannins round out the picture. Not an ager.",84,Thomas Fogarty 2004 Gist Ranch Cabernet Franc (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Attractive and fruity, this has red fruits at the fore. It is soft, round and balanced, with just the right amount of red currant acidity. Drink now.",85,Domaine Jessiaume 2009  Bourgogne
"All five Bordeaux grapes are blended in this aromatic wine sourced from the Seven Hills and Pepper Bridge vineyards. In the mouth it is compact with a dense verticality, opening with raspberry and moving on into cassis fruit. Tight and young, compact and nicely structured, this should be cellared through 2022 to 2024.",92,Pepper Bridge 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This is delicious, concentrated and showing a range of nuances; along with ripe apple and pear flavors come spicy hints of cinnamon and baking spices. Firm acids, good balance, and more texture and length than most domestic Chardonnays in this price range.",90,Dusted Valley 2007 Old Vine Chardonnay (Yakima Valley)
"This wine has an austere character with a hint of tannins in its structure. Crisp apple backs up the bright luminous acidity. Almost startlingly fresh, it needs time in the bottle—drink from 2017.",92,La Chablisienne 2013 Montmains Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"Restrained notes of yellow plum pervade the greenish, citric freshness. The palate is crisp and grassy, refreshing but textured, with added interest from fragrant lime peel. A concentrated palate leads to a superclean, lime-tingling finish.",90,Neumeister 2014 Steirische Klassik Sauvignon Blanc (Südoststeiermark)
"This ripe, soft wine is well balanced and offers attractive fruitiness. The creamy mousse and acidity bring richness and a fresh character. With its finely judged dosage, not too dry, not too sweet, the wine is very ready to drink.",88,Vollereaux NV Brut Réserve  (Champagne)
"Quite a lot of fruit flavor is packed into this straightforward, dry and non-oaky wine. It should be versatile at the dinner table because of its direct flavors, rather reserved texture and good balance.",87,Enotria 2011 Barbera (Mendocino County)
"Fragrant white florals and concentrated flavors of juicy pink pomelo are effortlessly decadent on this semidry Riesling. While soft and supple on entry, there's a nervy edge of Meyer lemon pith accentuated by a long, mineral-laced finish.",87,Glenora 2010 Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"This is an aromatic wine, with scents of green melon candy, lime zest, white flowers and white peach. It drinks off dry, with stone-fruit flavors brightened by zippy acidity leading to a mouthwatering finish.",90,Vino La Monarcha 2015 Riesling (Ancient Lakes)
"A 100% varietal wine, this is a tense study in black cherry, blueberry, and dry chalky tannins, which need further time to resolve. Still puckering on the finish, it offers streaks of cedar, pencil lead and coconut that are still integrating. Drink now through 2023.",91,Terra Valentine 2013 Wurtele Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District)
"Charcoal, cola and licorice are all components of this wine's dark and meaty nose. And the palate hardly disappoints; there's depth and harmony to the berry, coffee and mocha flavors. It feels good and has just enough kick to keep you thinking. A really nice crianza that will settle and only grow more complex over the next few years.",91,Peñagudo 2004 Crianza  (Rioja)
"This blend from Matthews is 47% Merlot and 33% Cabernet Sauvignon, with smaller amounts of Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec. It's thoroughly New World in style: thick, smoky, tannic and concentrated, with notes of black cherry and cassis at the core.",90,Matthews Estate 2009 Claret Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This red has a wide and broad personality that encompasses aromas of black fruit, leather and tobacco. There's less fresh fruit here: the wine definitely focuses on oak-driven tones, but it is lively enough to pair with roasted meat or dishes that require a touch of juicy succulence.",88,Donatella Cinelli Colombini 2004 Fattoria del Colle Cenerentola Red (Orcia)
"Part of a range of wines that have been made to showcase the different styles of Portuguese regions, this wine brings out the fruitiness of Tejo. It's easy drinking, with soft tannins, attractive acidity and fresh blackberry flavors. Drink now.",88,Wines & Winemakers 2012 Azul Portugal Red (Tejo)
"Made from 80% Syrah, 15% Grenache and 5% Riesling, this magenta-hued wine shows exuberant orange blossom and cherry flavors buoyed by moderate acidity and seaspray-like freshness. It finishes rich and fruity, bringing a creamsicle in summer to mind.",91,Ampelos 2016 Rosé of Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Sweet, candy-like aromas of raspberry, rose and white chocolate characterize this easy-going Riserva from southern Italy. The wine ends with spice and sour notes and offers lean consistency accented by piquant zest.",85,Leone de Castris 2003 Riserva Negroamaro (Salice Salentino)
"Very light in color, this wine has a pungent nose that features white flowers, cold steel and lime juice. The palate is bright with racy acidity, showing lots of honeysuckle, some ripe green apples and hints of honeydew and kiwi.",86,Irony 2013 Small Lot Reserve Chardonnay (Monterey County)
"Beeswax, light yellow melon, yellow peach and a touch of peach custard show on the nose of this blend of Grenache Blanc, Roussanne, Picpoul Blanc and Viognier. Lime zest and yellow pear dominate the palate, which is light, fresh, intriguingly textured and full of acidic sizzle.",91,Dubost 2015 Alexandrine White (Paso Robles)
"This is a smooth, rounded rosé made mainly from Négrette. Along with its youthful crispness, it also has a more creamy side and a crushed strawberry flavor, all lightened by balancing acidity.",85,Château Plaisance 2011 Rosé (Fronton)
"Coming from the relatively new but priming Kimsey Vineyard, this shows intoxicatingly rich yet never treacly aromas of ripe cantaloupe, ambrosia melon and peach-apple syrup. Glazed apples, walnut oil and orange bitters decorate the heavily layered and dense palate. Serve it with many varieties of cheese.",91,Zinke 2013 Roussanne (Ballard Canyon)
"The perfume of the Moscatel in this wine lingers satisfactorily, adding an exotic feel to what is otherwise a bright fruity wine. It is delicious to drink now as an apéritif.",85,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal 2016 JP Azeitão Moscatel Graudo-Fernão Pires White (Península de Setúbal)
"Apple, vanilla and a hint of sulfur is what you'll find on the nose of this consistently solid value-priced Cava. A slightly soft body and flavors of green herbs, melon and white pepper finish well.",87,Vins El Cep 2014 Kila Sparkling (Cava)
"Banrock Station's 2006 Shiraz is a throwback to the kind of super value Australian wines used to provide with more regularity. For $5, consumers get a decently textured, supple wine with plenty of forward blueberry and plum fruit and touches of chocolate and pepper. Look for it by the glass or buy it by the case for entertaining on a budget.",85,Banrock Station 2006 Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)
"This Chardonnay is one of the family-owned winery's workhorse bottlings, and it pulls its weight with finesse, showing light aromas of Pink Lady apple, grapefruit peel and almond on the nose. Lemon-lime acidity frames each sip, while grapefruit flavors meld with lemongrass and kaffir lime, finishing on riper stone fruit notes.",89,Gainey 2014 Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"This wine is tight, crisp with citrus flavors and intense acidity. It is developing into a refreshing, broader wine that will have a riper character. Wait until late 2017.",88,Château de Marsan 2016  Bordeaux Blanc
"Spice comes up in the nose and on the palate, punching up the fruit and bringing with it a nutty barrel-inflected base. Black cherry and blue plum cover the core fruit flavors, with a lovely sweet concentration dead center in the midpalate. This young wine is finely crafted and clearly built to age. Drink 2018 through 2028.",93,Furioso 2014 La Linea Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Heavily oaked up front, this smells of sweet spices, lactic berry fruits and hickory. The palate is fairly blocky and grabby, with resiny wood notes. Flavors of hickory and lactic berry match the nose on this oaky rendition of Malbec.",86,Kaiken 2014 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza)
"Blended from Syrah, Mourvèdre and the two Cabernets, Sauvignon and Franc, this wine feels bitter and acidic in the mouth. It's very tannic and overripe, with flavors of prunes.",80,Millésimé 2008 Scopire Red (Santa Ynez Valley)
"More like Zinfandel with its peppery, prickly mouthfeel, but not a bad wine for everyday purposes. It's dry and full-bodied and brisk, with blackberry, currant and herb flavors.",85,Oak Grove 2008 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Blackberry, violets, gingerbread, cola and cedar show on the great nose of this blend of 50% Grenache and 50% Syrah from the Fallbrook area north of San Diego. Complex flavors of incense and juniper spice up the backbone of blueberry and black plum, with a beef char component adding to the savory side.",91,2Plank 2013 Grenache-Syrah (South Coast)
"In so-called Penfolds years, when the stars align for the company, smart money is on the Bin series of wines like this Bin 407 Cabernet. It comes close to the luxury Bin 707 Cabernet in terms of quality, but at a much lower price, boasting ample body and velvety tannins. Hints of cedar, mint and mocha accent concentrated cassis and plum flavors. Drink now–2018.",92,Penfolds 2008 Bin 407 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia)
"Scoury and sweet in the mouth, this blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay has forward flavors of peaches, limes, oranges, honey and vanilla. With brisk acidity, it's a nice bubbly to drink now.",86,Korbel 2010 Natural Sparkling (Russian River Valley)
"Light and delicate, thist shows distant tones of fragrant fruit and tangy citrus. Its natural sweetness helps make the finish feel rich and generous.",87,Borgo Magredo NV Extra Dry  (Prosecco)
"Registering well over 16% abv, this blended Syrah nonetheless retains its complexity and avoids excesses of heat or barrel. In the blend are Mourvèdre and Merlot, adding some herbal highlights to the bright blueberry fruit flavors. This will benefit from another couple of years of bottle age.",88,:Nota Bene 2009 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The blend is almost equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc, with some Carmenet and Petit Verdot blended in for complexity. The wine is easy to like now for its dryness and elegance, despite relatively high alcohol. It shows California ripeness of fruit, with a smooth integration of oak. If there's a criticism, it's excessive softness. Drink up.",88,Niner 2010 Fog Catcher Red (Paso Robles)
"Pommery's style is soft and creamy, the richness coming from the dosage. But the wine is also elegant, everything in place, with a light, floating layer of Bartlett pears and light acidity. The soft finish could be fresher.",86,Pommery NV Brut Royal  (Champagne)
"No stuffing here, just thin berry and cherry fruit and a quick hit of chocolate.",84,San Juan Vineyards 2004 Red (Yakima Valley)
"A big wine with a nose defined by crushed coal and perfumed black fruit. The palate is plush and ripe, but also lively and pleasant. Tastewise, this is generous and defined by good berry, chocolate and herb flavors. Finishes with carob and cinnamon. Laudable New World Syrah, a k a Shiraz.",89,Ventisquero 2006 Grey Apalta Vineyards Shiraz (Colchagua Valley)
"An easy-drinking, sophisticated Sauvignon Blanc, very ripe in pineapples, oranges and kiwi fruit, but balanced with crisp acidity. A touch of new oak adds smoky creaminess. The single vineyard referenced on the label is in a warmer part of Napa Valley.",87,Maroon 2010 Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Sophisticated and subtle, this lovely wine expresses varietal elegance, with a bouquet of roses and raspberries to begin. The jumble of pretty fruits is framed with citrus peel and a dusting of chocolate.",91,Scott Paul 2013 La Paulée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Gritty berry and olive aromas are woodsy and a touch flat. This feels full and grabby, while flavors of tea, herbal blackberry, salt and roasted meat finish blackened and peppery, with a toasty element that gets more pronounced the longer this sits. Drink through 2022.",90,Valtravieso 2012 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"This is a strong, full-bodied rosé with ripe, jammy strawberry and raspberry flavors that finish off dry with fruity essence.",85,Taft Street 2012 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Pale straw in color with a faint touch of green, this wine has a nose of lemon blossom and freshly cut grass. Crisp, clean flavors of apple and lemon zest wash over the tongue, culminating in a burst of fresh acidity.",87,Puklavec & Friends 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Štajerska)
"This wine has a fine definition of minerality that's combined with tense structure. There is a hint of wood, a flavor of fresh-peeled apple and a taut, steely edge. Layers of acids mark the finish.",89,Jaffelin 2010  Puligny-Montrachet
"Aromas of lemon, white flower and white stone fruit lead the nose while the bright, juicy bright palate offers pear, peach and nectarine zest. A note of white almond caps off the finish.",87,Corte Mainente 2015 Cengelle  (Soave)
"Aromas of burnt orange peel, apricot, cinnamon and clove are accented by wild herb and nettle scents. This is full, resiny and borderline cloying in feel, while flavors of blow-torched caramel, peach, dried mango and oak finish honeyed and spicy, but also bitter. Drink this amber, mature wine now.",88,Telmo Rodríguez 2008 Molino Real Moscatel (Málaga)
"This is a tasty Pinot Noir, but it's not particularly characteristic of Doctor's Vineyard or Santa Lucia Highlands. It's soft, ripe and sweet, and while the raspberry, cherry and red currant flavors are balanced with acidity, the wine tastes like it could have been grown anywhere. Drink now.",86,Adelaida 2011 Vineyard Series Doctor's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Here's a gorgeous wine to pair with foie gras or pâté. A Riserva expression of Gewürztraminer, it opens with a bright golden color and segues to intense aromas of honey, candied peach, yellow rose, lemon curd and natural rubber. In the mouth, the wine is rich, opulent and long-lasting.",90,Cantina Cortaccia 2009 Brenntal Riserva Gewürztraminer (Alto Adige)
"This tilts the fruit emphasis away from peach and into pear, with a slight suggestion of vanilla cream. It's got medium weight and concentration, and it's supple, well integrated, and balanced for immediate consumption.",88,Winter's Hill 2015 Pinot Gris (Dundee Hills)
"Aromas of garden herbs, cherry and bittersweet chocolate lead to medium-bodied fruit and barrel flavors. The tannins are quite firm and need some time (hopefully) to soften. The oak seems to get out front.",88,Canoe Ridge 2014 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Fresh and full, with a deep berry nose, drying tannins and ample but not overdone oak. In the mouth, it's pretty solid, and the cherry and black-plum fruit is clean and tasty. It's on the stout side, with youthful acidity and a good deal of warmth to the smoky finish. From Poliziano.",88,Lohsa 2000  Morellino di Scansano
"This is a pretty wine, resplendent in jasmine and honeysuckle, with a light-bodied, integrated approach to highlighting fresh layers of apricot and peach. The viscosity is just right, focused and restrained, while the finish puts an exclamation point to the freshness of fruit.",92,Lawer 2014 Betsy's Vineyard Viognier (Knights Valley)
"Smoky cherry and the slightest whiff of bacon make for an appetizing proposition. The palate is lively, peppery and full of juicy black and red cherries. The tannins have some grip and are in tune with the freshness. This is lively, just medium-bodied and invigorating.",89,Hillinger 2013 Hill 1 Red (Burgenland)
"This Riesling is slightly sweet, but it's balanced by crisp acidity. The tangerine, green apple and peach flavors have a honeyed finish.",84,Kendall-Jackson 2009 Vintner's Reserve Riesling (Monterey County)
"The smoky, peppery aromas and smoky, pomegranate flavors may be atypical, but the wine is well-balanced and enjoyable to drink.",86,Peirano 2012 The Heritage Collection Tempranillo (Lodi)
"Reduced prune aromas are rubbery, herbal and not fully convincing. On the palate, this is gritty, tannic and tight, with tomatoey acidity. Oaky grapy flavors are compact, while graphite is noted on a finish that's weighted down by bulky tannins.",89,Señorío de Cuzcurrita 2011  Rioja
"Icarus, in Greek myth, got too close to the sun. So did this wine from Icaria. It's not bad, but simply overripe. Has a sweet taste of raisins, in addition to the sweet smokiness from oak. Drink now.",85,Icaria 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Aromas of underbrush, baked earth, oak, coffee, mature dark-skinned berry and a whiff of eucalyptus lead the nose. The firm, straightforward palate offers tart cherry, espresso, toast and menthol alongside fine-grained tannins.",88,Coppo 2012 Camp du Rouss  (Barbera d'Asti)
"Grapefruit flavor is the key to this attractive, fruity wine. Crisp and lightly herbaceous, it is fresh while also having a rounder background. Drink now, but better to wait until early 2016.",85,Domaine D'en Ségur 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Côtes du Tarn)
"A complex style of Muscadet, this starts with crisp citrus flavors and a tight structure. It has density and a fine, nervy edge that offers a delicate perfumed character as well as the possibility of aging. Drink from 2014. Screwcap.",90,Château de la Ragotiere 2012 Les Frères Couillaud Vieilles Vignes Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"This perfumed wine offers plenty (perhaps too much) acidity and red fruits, with only light tannins. That makes for a fruity wine, fresh and ready to drink now and until 2018.",85,Derey Frères 2012 Les Vignes Marie  (Marsannay)
"This is a dry, richly flavored and well-structured wine. A complex, spicy, earthy, cherrylike bouquet accompanies saturated flavors of currant, black cherry and pomegranate spiced with hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. It's not too full bodied and has good balance that comes from firm acidity and tannins.",89,Occasio 2012 Ghielmetti Vineyard Syrah (Livermore Valley)
"Dark purple flowers and tart boysenberry paste show on the nose of this intensely concentrated wine, alongside pencil shavings, bay lead and a lot of iron minerality. More bay leaf and pine needle show on the herbally full and texturally grippy palate, giving minty spice to the dark fruit flavors.",93,Tantara 2015 Dierberg Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"Dusty, earthy, soil and mineral notes lend complexity to sprightly lemon and honey aromas on this sweet, concentrated Riesling. The palate reverberates with tangy citrus flavors that cap off on a lingering kiss of honeysuckle.",91,Louis Guntrum 2012 Oppenheim Herrenberg Auslese Riesling (Rheinhessen)
"Superfresh raspberry aromas, rich cherry flavors and a texture that helps all that fruit cling to the palate make this medium-bodied wine compelling. It feels firm and structured due to good acidity, which supports the surprisingly bright and layered fruit flavors very well.",90,Uvaggio 2014 Barbera (Lodi)
"Made by 30-ish Roberta Borghese high above Manzano, which also happens to be the chair manufacturing capital of Italy, this is a perfect example of how good Tocai can be. The aromas are honey and grapefruit-orange. After an intro of crisp acidity, the same flavors appear and persist on the medium body. Match this one with a good seafood risotto.",91,Ronchi di Manzano 1999 Superiore Tocai (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"This is a big, voluptuous Pinot, solidly in the Garys' style, but it possesses a delicate silkiness despite the size. In its extreme youth, the wine is all primary fruit and oak, with flavors of cherries, black raspberries, red licorice, cola and smoky vanilla. It feels broad and obvious, in the way of a young wine. However, 1-3 years in the bottle should bring out complexity.",91,Vision Cellars 2006 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Dark blue-purple in color, this is a breezy, giving wine on the palate, fresh and light in blueberry preserves and soft layers of integrated oak and tannin. It finishes smooth and with a hint of chocolate.",88,Napa Cellars 2013 Classic Collection Winemaker Series Malbec (Napa Valley)
"Dark purple on the pour, this is a big, rich, Shiraz-style Syrah, dense in blackberries, black currants, grilled bacon on oak. It's tannic and dry, yet ripe with fruit. Very high alcohol gives it some heat that calls for barbecue.",87,Moonstone 2010 Syrah (Paso Robles)
"This Tempranillo-Cabernet blend begins with scratchy, earthy aromas of moss, leather and herbal red fruits. It's alert and lively in the mouth, with strawberry, plum, raspberry and citrusy flavors. The finish hollows out and shows good length and a light structure.",86,Bodega Otto Bestué 2009 Finca Rableros Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon (Somontano)
"Light salmon in color, this herbal rosé dances on the palate with a slight effervescence and 5% residual sugar. It offers a bouquet of robust red fruit and rose petal aromas, and saw no oak.",88,Ty Caton 2013 Rosé of Syrah (Sonoma Valley)
"In a departure from the fuller, riper style exhibited last vintage, this edition of Barbaresco Santo Stefano shows thorny, brambly elements of white cherry and forest floor. In the mouth, it shows tight astringency and not too much heft or supporting density. Drink after 2015.",89,Castello di Neive 2008 Santo Stefano  (Barbaresco)
"Vanilla and toasted almond aromas evolve into a scent of tarte tatin. Full bodied, with warm alcohol, this shows medium fruit concentration. The acidity is borderline in its balance, leaning to flabiness. The tactile heat on the medium finish is distracting.",84,Vignobles Garrigae 2010 Seigneurie de Peyrat Tradition Chardonnay-Viognier (Pays d'Oc)
"Even Cabernet Sauvignon, that defiantly international variety, takes on a Portuguese character. This has that dark chocolate, high acidity and dry, but juicy character that marks so many Portuguese reds. It also has a more unfortunate volatility that is just too prominent.",85,Companhia das Quintas 2005 Quinta da Pancas Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon Cabernet Sauvignon (Estremadura)
"A good, basic wine, this has a mix of fruity and vegetal aromas, tart cherry and watermelon flavors, firm texture with moderate tannins, medium body and a slightly astringent finish.",84,Cambridge & Sunset 2013 California Series Pinot Noir (California)
"Oak and matchstick are the early aromas on this barrel-heavy SB. The palate is smooth, mellow and a bit flaccid. Toasty, spicy flavors lead a mix of green herb, citrus and tropical fruit notes, while the finish offers residual woodspice but not much kick.",88,Lapostolle 2013 Cuvée Alexandre Las Kuras Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Cachapoal Valley)
"This successful riserva displays opulence and a bold, modern style that focuses on bright cherry and savory spice aromas. The wine is loaded with density and richness, and combines a ripe soft feel with a lively berries on the finish.",94,Collosorbo 2006 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"The winemaking efforts of Lazio (the region that houses the Italian capital, Rome) are slowly being noticed thanks to an admittedly small group of quality-minded producers. This Syrah shows ripe fruit and soft roundness with elements of prune, coffee and cherry liqueur.",87,Cantine Lupo 2010 Syranto Syrah (Lazio)
"A blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot, this bold wine features aromas of spiced plum, blackcurrant, leather and a hint of coconut. On the palate, assertive tannins support the mature blackberry, espresso and licorice flavors.",90,Feudo Principi di Butera 2012 Symposio Red (Terre Siciliane)
"Fermented in open lagars, this wine has a dense, almost dry and beautifully sculpted character. It's a solid, dark as well as juicy wine that's superripe yet kept in check by the powerful tannins. Age this wine for many years; don't drink before 2018.",93,Casa da Passarella 2010 Villa Oliveira Touriga Nacional (Dão)
"Pressed rose, slightly dusty mineral shadings, spice and black fruit make up the bouquet of this elegant, harmonious wine. This expression is astringent and firm, with bright acidity and a solid tannic backbone. Let it soften with more cellar aging.",93,Terralsole 2006 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Herb, spice, wild berry and wood aromas set up a round palate that's bigger than medium but not huge in size. Definitive Carmenère flavors of herbs, wild berry and spiced plum finish with moderate bitterness and tannic support.",88,Casa Silva 2012 Los Lingues Vineyard Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"The 2010 La Petite Chapelle is firmly structured and tannic, but presents attractive aromas of earth, roasted meat and cedar, rounded out by savory flavors of black olive and espresso. Give it another couple of years in the cellar.",90,Paul Jaboulet Aîné 2010 La Petite Chapelle  (Hermitage)
"Stalky, leathery berry aromas are a bit lacking in purity. This feels choppy, while stalky, lightly green berry flavors finish with herbal shadings and resiny oak.",84,Viña Eguía 2013  Rioja
"From the Vinho Verde subregion of Monção and Melgaço, this intense, bone-dry wine captures the richness of Alvarinho while not losing sight of its fresh lemon and crisp apple side. It has a tight texture that suggests the wine is still young, so drink from late 2016.",91,Anselmo Mendes 2014 Muros Antigos Alvarinho (Vinho Verde)
"Exceptionally ripe, concentrated mountain fruit as well as hard tannins characterize this fresh, young Cabernet. Through the tannic astringency, intense flavors of black currants, dark chocolate and the sweet sap of oak shine through. Needs time. Hold until 2016 and see how it's doing.",94,Terra Valentine 2010 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District)
"Great price for a Cabernet this smooth and tasty. Shows appealing blackberry and cherry flavors, with a sweet, smoky touch of oak. All five classic Bordeaux varieties constitute the blend.",88,Murphy-Goode 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Cinsault dominant, with Grenache and Rolle (or Vermentino), this is an enjoyable sipper of tart cherry and strawberry, with a delicate blossom note lingering underneath. Pair this with a some relaxation on a porch on a hot summer day.",87,McPherson 2015 Les Copains Dry Rosé (Texas)
"White-fruit aromas, brine and clam shell notes get this Albariño going. The mouthfeel is full and lemony. Flavors of pickled, briny citrus and nectarine carry onto the finish. This is at its best now; in 2014 it will not be so good.",85,Ramón Bilbao 2012 Valiñas Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"This huge, rich wine is great Grüner Veltliner. Despite the alcohol, Rupert Summerer has managed to keep the intense freshness, the lifted, crisp pear flavors and the exuberant pepper in control. Impressive.",91,Summerer 2006 Käferberg Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"According to Brigitte Roch, this was an exceptional year for the domaine. With such huge concentration, heavy black tannins, fine acidity and hugely ripe fruit, it is hard to disagree. This wine, made using an old-fashioned hand-operated basket press, is full of power, yet has an astonishing elegance.",93,Domaine Clusel-Roch 1999  Côte Rôtie
"Blending Encruzado and Malvasia Fina, this lightly wood-aged wine is rich, stylish and full of young fruit flavors. Green plums, apricots and a squeeze of lemon all give their bright character to the palate. There is a firm, mineral texture that promises some aging; drink from 2017.",89,Magnum Vinhos 2014 Ribeiro Santo White (Dão)
"Wonderfully rich, with a lush and luxurious mid-palate, this young wine is packed with berries and cassis, elevated with some citrusy acidity, and deep with notes of gravel and smoke. This wine is still hard and unresolved. Give it a lot of decanting, or just age for a few years.",92,Gorman 2007 The Bully Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"Showing as much freshness and acidity as the hallmark spice of a Gewürztraminer, this is a white-fruit-dominant wine, poised and elegant, with a touch of minerality. Keep for 2–3 years.",92,André Blanck et ses Fils 2010 Schlossberg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"An impressive Montsant blend of Grenache, Cabernet and Syrah with a purple color and friendly black fruit aromas. Not overly complex but deeply drawn and balanced. The plum, fresh raisin and blackberry flavors are smooth and structured, and overall flavor and liveliness are key attributes. Drink now through 2012.",90,Cellers Sant Rafel 2007 Solpost Fresc Red (Montsant)
"The wine is rich with layers of wood aging and ripe tropical fruits. Pineapple and peach dominate, cut with some attractive lime acidity. Full of the fruit of the vintage with a texture of serious intent, the wine is tight, tangy and likely to age well. Drink from 2022.",95,Château Latour-Martillac 2014  Pessac-Léognan
"Hints of ceder, bramble and smoked nuts add savory complexity to this ripe, full-bodied Syrah full of succulent black cherry and berry flavors. It's approachable yet elegant, framed by soft, feathery tannins and a zesty spray of cranberry acidity add. Drink now through 2018.",90,Chateau Lafayette Reneau 2013 Syrah (Finger Lakes)
"As you might infer from the name, this tastes sweet. It appeals to consumers who enjoy the trend of sugary red wines. You could almost drink it as a dessert sipper, with its candied blackberry and cherry flavors.",83,Jellybean Wines 2010 Candy-Apple Red Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Honey gold in color, this wine made from an indigenous Georgian grape has a bouquet of white cherries and lavender. Tart flavors of honeydew melon and white plum persist into the soft floral finish.",84,Gotsa Family Wines 2015 Dry Unfiltered Chinuri (Georgia)
"Light, clear and crisp, this is a soft, silky wine from several vineyard sources within the appellation, robust and rustic on the finish. Along the way, it exudes exotic hits of dark cherry, cola and vanilla, finding balance among the fruit and lively acidity, providing body without too much heat.",93,Papapietro Perry 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This cheerful, screw cap Valpolicella offers crisp raspberry and cherry flavors over a lean, compact body. It's a lightweight, easy-going wine that would pair with soups or sandwiches.",85,Speri 2007 La Roverina  (Valpolicella)
"A dusting of crushed slate and saffron accents this zesty lime and honey kissed Kabinett. It's dancingly light on the palate, but concentrated with swirls of marmalade and orange-peel flavors that extend through a long finish. Drink now through 2025.",90,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch) 2014 Thanisch Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"Dark hay in color with a concentration of oak on the nose, the palate retains that richness of nutty almond and apple pie, finding a balance that betrays the heavier implications of the initial aromas. On the finish it offers a lightness of being, as well as a touch of perfume.",88,Rally Point Wines 2013 Limited Production Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"From a 100-acre estate formerly the home of the Counts of Provence, this wine has a great fruity character allied to a more mineral texture. With richness and vanilla flavors it is both packed with raspberry fruits and showing structure. Keep until the end of 2014.",90,Château Réal Martin 2013 Perle de Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"There's lots of sweetness in this polished wine, with pretty orange, peach, vanilla and honeysuckle flavors. It would benefit from greater acidity, though, as it's a bit soft.",86,V. Sattui 2011 Riesling (Anderson Valley)
"This producer is making some fantastic best-bang-for-your-buck Cabernets. This one is an excellent case in point, a sultry, sophisticated and elegant take on the variety, with memorable characteristics of chocolate, raspberry and dried herb in the form of bay leaf. Structured and ready for the table, it's a standout.",94,JD 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)
"This wine demonstrates Viognier's exotic side, with flavors of tropical fruit, tangerine, white flower, vanilla, honey and spice. Despite the richness, it's dry and the acidity is mouthwatering. Don't serve this too cold, and pair it with Asian fare that's slightly sweet.",88,Fess Parker 2011 Viognier (Santa Barbara County)
The richness of vintage 2003  shows in this wine's layers of dried fruits on top of sweet tannins and a dense concentration. There is some licorice flavor arriving as the wine matures.,88,Château Puy-Servain 2003 Vieilles Vignes  (Montravel)
"A darker shade of yellow in the glass, this bottling from an Alban clone turns out to be a lighter, more delicate take on Roussanne. Touches of saffron, wax and toasted nuts show on the nose, and that light nutty character does extend to the sip. But the palate also offers apricot and lemon rinds against well measured acidity and a compelling minerality that combines white rocks and hot sand flavors.",92,Big Basin 2014 Homestead Block Roussanne (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"While delicious now with flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola and oak, all showered with tart, citrusy acidity, this wine also has a great future. Give it 6–8 years to evolve in the bottle for further complexity.",92,Talley 2011 Rincon Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"Here's a bright, fruity red that delivers blue flower, wild cherry, black raspberry and tart red currant sensations. Vibrant acidity and round tannins give this a delightful, easy-drinking quality.",86,Fattoria Bini 2013  Chianti
"There's not much pulp or grit here, but this easygoing (and well-priced) Chardonnay does offer distant aromas of stone fruit and honey. Citrus flavors and sharp acidity best describe the mouthfeel.",84,Moletto 2007 Chardonnay (Veneto Orientale)
"Coming from a who's who of Red Mountain vineyards, the inaugural release of this brand from Duckhorn Vineyards offers generous notes of dark coffee, espresso bean, dark cherries, sage and vanilla, with a pleasing interplay between fruit and barrel (64% new French). The plum and coffee flavors are restrained in style, with well-integrated tannins.",90,Canvasback 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"Focused flavors of mint and black currant come together in this distinctive Cabernet. There's a touch of oak too that adds spice, and the overall character is elegant. The wine will benefit from some aging to further integrate its parts.",87,Thelema 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch)
"This is a light and fresh wine with soft tannins and appealing red berry fruits. It offers attractive acidity at the end, a balanced wine that is ready to drink.",86,Gérard Charvet 2014 La Réserve d'Amélie  (Moulin-à-Vent)
"Unlike Marisco's 2015 The Ned Late Harvest, this is a botrytis-affected wine, featuring a darker color and more complex flavors. The aromas suggest Earl Grey tea and honey; the flavors resemble caramel-drizzled orange segments. A slightly bitter citrus-pith note marks the finish, providing balance.",91,Marisco Vineyards 2014 A Sticky End Late Harvest Waihopai Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"For a few years running we've been singing the praises of Abadal, a label from Catalonia that has been producing hit upon hit. This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah from the excellent 2001 vintage is in super form; the wine has a ripe, integrated nose of cocoa, dark fruit and chocolate, while the palate is bold and loaded with vivacious cherry and blackberry flavors. From front to center to back, this wine has it all going in the right direction. Good now through 2012.",92,Masies d'Avinyo 2001 Abadal Reserva Red (Pla de Bages)
"Aromas of crushed berry, fragrant purple flower, dark spice and a balsamic note almost jump out of the glass. The full-bodied structured palate delivers dried black cherry, raspberry compote, licorice and a hint of clove set against a backbone of firm, refined tannins. Drink 2018–2030.",92,Casanuova delle Cerbaie 2010 Vigna Montosoli Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"This reserve is actually one of the winery's less expensive Chardonnays. It's full, fruity and forward, with a lush mix of pineapple, peaches and tropical fruits, buttressed with juicy acids and highlights of toasted nuts. Thoroughly delicious, and ready for immediate enjoyment.",92,Domaine Serene 2012 Evenstad Reserve Chardonnay (Dundee Hills)
"This 100% Lagrein boasts alluring aromas of blackberry, tilled earth and a whiff of baking spice. The ripe luscious palate doles out black plum, cassis, star anise and a note of ground pepper alongside supple tannins. It will offer fine sipping over the next few years. Drink through 2020.",91,Terlan 2013 Porphyr Riserva Lagrein (Alto Adige)
"This is a fascinating wine, just by reading the list of grapes in the blend: Duras, Braucol, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon. The first two, local grapes, lend a rough edge of tannins, which demands aging, but also give flavors of herbs, wild thyme and solid meaty character. The roundness comes from the ripe Syrah, which adds perfume.",90,Domaine Rotier 2004 Renaissance Red (Gaillac)
"This tastes soft and simple now, although considering the vineyard sourcing, that could be misleading. There's a core of raspberry and cherry fruit, with intriguing forest notes of dried pine needles and mushrooms. The acidity is just right, neither bright nor too soft. The wine isn't showing much now, but could be a sleeper. Try after 2015.",88,Saxon Brown 2009 Durell Vineyard Hayfield Block Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Les Collines, Minick, Old Stones, SJR, Oldfield and Olsen provide the fruit for this wine. It's perfumed and leads with aromas of violets, dried herbs, olive and earth, with raspberry notes emerging over time. The palate is all about texture and elegance, while lingering on the finish.",93,Gramercy 2013 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"In the house style of this producer this wine is soft and fruity. Its strawberry aroma is followed by a gentle, ripe wine with red berries and balanced acidity. The wine is ready to drink.",89,Canard-Duchêne NV Charles VII Grande Cuvée de la Rose Brut Rosé  (Champagne)
"Dusty white-fruit and citrus aromas are more than adequate but nonspecific. This feels round, with salty citrus flavors. A modest finish is doing its best to stay fresh and vital.",86,Autoritas 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley)
"There is no lack of dark, smoky flavors in this 100% varietal bottling. Leather, cola, cassis, tar, burnt rubber and smoke all whirl about, with an underlying impression of dried leaves. The listed flavors may not stir you with longing when named in this way, but taken all together and accompanied by a bowl of beef stew, they will satisfy.",88,Silvan Ridge 2013 Tempranillo (Rogue Valley)
"Bold, full-bodied and polished, this opens with aromas that recall violets, ripe plums, red berries and cake spices. The smooth, savory palate delivers juicy Morello cherries, black raspberries, cinnamon, mocha, white pepper and a hint of mint. Generous, velvety tannins provide the framework and add finesse.",93,San Rustico 2010  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"The ripest of Breggo's '06 Pinots, the Ferrington stars red fruits, such as cherries, raspberries and persimmons, mingling with intricate Asian spices and a hint of mocha. Absolutely delicious, this silky, complex wine is pure pleasure.",93,Breggo 2006 Ferrington Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Roasted cherries, scorched earth, burnt coffee and dark brown sugar all mingle on the nose and palate of this wine. It's a bit rustic and old school, dusty and a bit dry on the finish. Try it in 2–3 years.",88,Pierre Amadieu 2010 Terroir d'Exception La Paillousse Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape)
"This gorgeous super Tuscan opens with inky dark concentration and bright aromas of dark cherry and prune. It feels soft, lush and creamy in the mouth. Pair it with stewed game meat.",90,Tenuta di Biserno 2011 Insoglio del Cinghiale Red (Toscana)
"Racy berry aromas come with a hint of oaky cinnamon. This feels raw, tannic and dense. Flavors of roasted plum, dry oak, savory spices and grilled meat finish firm and taste toasty. Drink through 2022.",89,Tionio 2013  Ribera del Duero
"Black cherry and black raspberry notes meet crushed mint, wet slate, Mediterranean spice, blistered tomato and Kalamata olive on the nose of this estate bottling. Lively herbs including marjoram and thyme mark the palate, then the wine warms toward tarter cherry, cranberry and turned earth on the midpalate. It finishes with aromatically lifting menthol notes.",92,Presqu'ile 2013 Presqu'ile Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"A deeply colored wine, reveling in the richness of 2007, a powerhouse of berry fruits, black plums and a layer of soft wood tannins. It certainly has plenty of ripe fruit, but the smoothness of the wine is the key here, a chocolate smoothness that wraps around the powerful fruit.",88,J. Portugal Ramos 2007 Marquês de Borba Red (Alentejo)
"Here's an earthy, dark red with soft tannins that's perfectly approachable now. Menthol, blackberries, cassis and leathery spice fill the nose and mouth, with moderate weight and a medium finish. A nice choice for grilled or herb-crusted lamb chops.",86,Graham Beck 2008 Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (Western Cape)
"Gritty aromas of asphalt, green peppercorn, saucy berry and hard spices precede a tight palate with grating tannins. This is oak-heavy, with sweet-and-saucy red-berry flavors. An oaky, tomatoey finish is rubbery in feel.",86,Viña Tarapacá 2011 Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"Rustic and sweet, a simple Syrah with flavors of candied berry, black pepper and sassafras.",84,Cameron Hughes 2010 Lot 292 Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)
"This full-bodied wine packs a lot of punch in terms of mouthfeel and flavor. The color is extremely dark, and the flavors resemble dark chocolate, black cherries and baking spices. It is dry in style, with lip-smacking, nicely astringent tannins that counterbalance all that richness.",92,Eruption 2013 Volcano Ridge Vineyard Red (High Valley)
"This is a very correct and straightforward Aglianico that delivers all the basic promises of the variety. There's firmness and deep structure here, but the wine is also flush with chewy fruit, tobacco, leather and dusty mineral tones on the close.",88,Mastroberardino 2008 Aglianico (Campania)
"Light in color, this shows red cherry and strawberry flavors. The tannins are soft, creating an easy wine that is ready to drink.",84,Barton & Guestier 2011  Beaujolais
"This brisk Pinot offers a rich array of raspberries and cherries, with oak influences. It's bright in acidity, with a dry finish, and the alcohol is relatively low. It tastes a little rude and rustic now, but could develop some bottle complexity over the next 5–6 years.",87,Kokomo 2011 Peters Vineyard Winemaker's Reserve Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Shafer's Merlot is very vintage driven, and this 2009 shows exceptionally ripe, sweet cherry and blueberry-pie flavors, enriched by 75% new French oak that brings toasty, spicy vanilla notes. It's flashy, opulent and delicious, but a bit forward and warm. Drink now.",90,Shafer 2009 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Very perfumed, this wine is exotic and rich with fruit, but also remarkably dry. Drink from 2017.",88,Domaine Sorin 2011 Red (Bandol)
"A big Pinot Noir, darkly colored and full-bodied in the mouth. The depth of fruit is impressive, packing a solid core of black cherries and plums. Might gain some bottle notes over the next 4–6 years.",90,Heart O' The Mountain 2008 Triple Seven Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"A blend of 85% Petite Sirah and 15% Petit Verdot, this is a mouthful of intense, smoky blueberry and leather. Licorice and tar intermingle on the midpalate with the finish decisively earthy in graphite.",86,Michael David 2011 Petite Petit Red (Lodi)
"Rodney Strong's Symmetry is more tannic than their '05 Reserve Cab, and it also has more complex flavors from being a blend of all five Bordeaux varieties. It shows a deep streak of dark stone fruits, black and blue berries, cassis, carob, violets and smoky cedar. Fine and elegant now, and it should develop nicely over the next decade.",94,Rodney Strong 2005 Symmetry Red Meritage (Alexander Valley)
"Touched by wood, this is a warm wine with soft plum flavors and light tannins. It could age well for 4–5 years, but is ready to drink now.",86,Domaine d'Eole 2011 Red (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence)
"The vineyard source for this tasty wine is farmed by a fifth-generation Japanese-American originally from California's Central Valley. Tightly wound in oak and tannin, it opens pleasantly to reveal a wealth of rose petals, earth and youthful ripe, dark cherry. With moderate acidity and body, it lingers on the palate.",91,Spell 2014 Umino Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Dramatically dark, staining the glass with glycerine streaks, this wine  unabashedly celebrates its hot country origins. Considerable tannins  frame a core of berry fruit, with a zingy, peppery note that stimulates  the taste buds, but acidity is soft. At the same time, it retains a  rustic character typical of the varietal.",86,Imagery 2000 Artist Collection Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)
"Fresh, bright and super lively on the palate, this very attractive Prosecco Superiore would pair with bite-sized quiche with cheese and ham or mini-pizza appetizers. Citrus and green melon are backed by acidity and tight, steely perlage.",87,Merotto NV Bareta Brut  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"This wine shows hints of tar or rubber when first poured, so decant it for best effect. Once past those, berry and citrus aromas and flavors emerge, lingering on the long, mocha-tinged finish.",89,Les Vignerons de Tavel 2016 Les Lauzeraies  (Tavel)
"This white blend is comprised of 50% Chardonnay and 50% Gewürztraminer. It has delightful aromas of white flowers, honeysuckle and lime pith and flavors of jasmine, lemongrass and dried rosemary in the mouth. The finish is clean, crisp and refreshing.",89,Ross-idi 2014 Nikolaevo Unison Chardonnay-Gewürtztraminer White
"This well-structured effort is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, and it bears nuances of herb and briar. There is a balanced mix of plum and black cherry flavors that are wreathed in smoke and coffee notes, which resolve into firm but smooth tannins.",89,Owen Roe 2010 Red Willow Vineyard 1973 Block Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley)
"A very nice Bordeaux-style blend ready to drink now. It's soft, dry and complex, offering waves of blackberries, black currants, blueberries, cedar and herbs, wrapped into fine, rich tannins.",87,Cameron Hughes 2005 Lot 119 Meritage (Alexander Valley)
"This is an inaugural release of this variety from the Mount George Vineyard in cool Coombsville, granted AVA status in 2011. Juicy and soft in blackberry and stone fruit, the wine is cradled by generous tannins and herbal tones. Full bodied, its sinewy structure suggests it would benefit from more time in bottle; cellar through 2022.",91,Silverado 2012 GEO Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville)
"Hot and fiery, this red is meaty, spicy and herbal on the nose. The disjointed palate shows baked, spicy plum and herbal flavors. A smoky, meaty flavor and forced, creamy-oak tone carry the finish.",85,Santa Alba 2013 Reserve Carmenère (Curicó Valley)
"Fenestra's whites tend to taste a little sweet, which helps in the case of this Kabinett-style Riesling. It's very fruity and floral, and the ripe citrus, peach, diesel and honeysuckle flavors are balanced by crisp acidity.",86,Fenestra 2007 White Riesling (Arroyo Seco)
"This is intense in both color and aromatics. Potent scents of black fruit, animal hide, graphite and bold oak are at the fore. It feels pure, lush and well built, with dark flavors of blackberry, chocolate, toast and spice. Coffee and pepper are the prime finishing flavors; drink now through 2015.",92,Peique 2007 Viñedos Viejos Mencía (Bierzo)
"Hugely concentrated wine, full of new toasty wood flavors, its structure packed with tannins. That said, there is also a weight of black currant fruit, richly jammy, adding to the sense of power.",90,Château Tour des Gendres 2008 Moulin des Dames Red (Côtes de Bergerac)
"One of the best Syrahs at this price point in California. It's lush in blackberries, blueberries, chocolate and sweet oak, with a creamy mouthfeel. Drink now for freshness.",92,Rusack 2009 Ballard Canyon Estate Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"This is rich with fruit as well as a mineral, tangy texture. A ripe character comes from the delicious raspberry fruit and acidity (60% Grenache, 40% Cinsault). The aftertaste is fresh, while remaining textured and ready for food.",90,Château de Calavon 2014 Rosé (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence)
"A bit on the light-bodied side, but nice and dry, with plenty of personality. The flavors are of briary, brambly wild blackberries, raspberries and blueberries, dusted with black pepper and cinnamon.",86,Maddalena 2011 Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"This is an attractive, fast-maturing wine with soft tannins, ripe fruits and a juicy, perfumed acidity. It has considerable weight and concentration, along with firm red-plum and berry flavors. It's an elegant wine that should be drunk from 2017.",91,Bouchard Aîné & Fils 2011 Cuvée Signature  (Clos de la Roche)
"One of the “12 Zins of Lodi 2014,” it was chosen in a judging by the Lodi Winegrape Commission to represent the region's finest. The deep red-black color is saturated to the rim. Deep, evocative aromas lead to ripe cherry, boysenberry, chocolate and nutmeg flavors that echo on the finish. The texture is full and smooth.",92,Za Zin 2010 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi)
"Not a bad wine but definitely overoaked for what it is. The nose bleeds resin and faux milk chocolate, while the chunky, herbal palate offers pretty good mouthfeel but also roasted berry flavors. Menthol and herbal notes rise up on the hot finish.",84,Simone 2008 Special Reserve Carmenère (Maule Valley)
"In line with the winery style, this is lean and tight on the palate, a bit of a citrus laser blending lime and grapefruit. Try it with raw seafood dishes, like a fluke carpaccio or ceviche.",89,Shaw and Smith 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills)
"Delicate flavors of baking spices like cinnamon, allspice and ginger light up this very dry, firm-textured bubbly. Vivid acidity keeps it light and lively. Plenty of citrus and green apple notes and a refreshing dryness make the mouth water.",91,Schramsberg 2010 Blanc de Noirs Sparkling (North Coast)
"An awkward, unbalanced wine. Has green, vegetal flavors alongside sweet candied raspberries.",82,Cline 2009 Zinfandel (California)
"Striking and sincere Sauvignon Blanc. One whiff, one taste and one swish across the palate and you'll know that this is elevated stuff. For starters, the bouquet delivers honest bell pepper, melon, passion fruit and apple aromas; and along with the fruit there's nuance, structure and balancing herbal notes. Full, long and regal. Drink now to capture this wine's powerful essence.",91,Cono Sur 2008 20 Barrels Limited Edition Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"This fruity, off-dry Riesling is sourced from the Lawrence Vineyards on the Royal Slope. Despite the relatively cool climate site, it has a ton of very ripe fruit, peaches and apricots. There is a slight bitterness, perhaps from skin contact, in the finish.",87,Finn Hill 2012 The Gnome Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Aromas bring notes of vanilla bean, black cherry and cassis, along with light volatility. The palate packs a big punch of fruit and barrel flavors, with vanilla notes running high throughout, causing some distraction.",88,Dumas Station 2013 Minnick Hills Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This is a lovely example of Ventoux Grenache (80%), with 15% Syrah and 5% a blend of Mourvèdre, Cinsaut and Carignan. It's slightly warm in style and supple in structure, but with hints of dried flowers and licorice to give verve and dimension to the black cherry fruit. Drink now and over the next few years.",90,Martinelle 2009 Red (Ventoux)
"This wine's light and refreshing nose cuts between orange-blossom ripeness, lime-juice sharpness, chalky minerality and a touch of milk fat. There is good energy on the palate, powered by tart green apple rinds and citrus zest.",88,Fess Parker 2014 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County)
"This is the winery's big, barrel-fermented Chard. Even under all that creamy, smoky oak and leesy richness, those Edna Valley acids shine through, making the lime, kiwi and pineapple flavors bright, and leading to a zingy, crisp finish.",91,Tolosa 2005 1772 Edna Ranch Chardonnay (Edna Valley)
"A detailed wine, with notes of wet slate, apricot and pear alongside high toned spices. It drinks off dry, with ripe stone-fruit flavors balanced by crisp acidity, leading to a lingering finish.",90,Cave Spring 2011 Cave Spring Vineyard Estate Bottled VQA Riesling (Beamsville Bench)
"Tart cherry, tobacco and leather present themselves on the nose, leading the way to fruit forward flavors of red plum and cherry pie backed by pleasant hints of vanilla.",85,Cramele Recas 2014 Dreamfish Cabernet Sauvignon (Viile Timisului)
"Just 75% Cabernet, the rest a mix of Merlot, Syrah and Petit Verdot, this turns generic, with bitter berry flavors. There's a little toastiness backing the tannins but a short finish, overall.",85,Mercer 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The use of 100% Syrah gives a deep pink color that borders on purple. Aromas are rather strong too, with the flaky, buttered crust of a hot cherry pie running into the more bitter elements of citrus rinds. Those characters play leading roles on the palate as well, cherry candy toying with just-ripe grapefruit, providing tensions that keeps the sipping interesting. Just 72 cases produced.",87,Solminer 2013 Linus Rosé (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Ripe berry, plum, milk chocolate, leather, truffle and balsamic notes lead the nose. The dense palate weaves together crushed black cherry, baking spices, mint and white pepper alongside underlying mineral notes. It's already accessible so enjoy now–2020.",90,Sorelle De Nicola 2009 Bordini Vigna di Montesommo Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"Extremely seductive aromas of caramel, toasted oak, beach campfire, blackberry, black cherry and thin mint cookies welcome the nose to this bottling. The palate is equally complex and inviting, with milk chocolate, cherry pie, smoked pork and dried oregano flavors, tongue-tantalizing all around.",93,Monticello Vineyards 2012 Jefferson Cuvee Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Ripe, soft red cherry fruits are linked to a light texture and soft tannins in this ready-to-drink wine. The final acidity brings out the attractive fruitiness of this fresh wine. Drink now.",87,Jean Reverdy et Fils 2013 Les Villots  (Sancerre)
"Boasting cherry-vanilla cola and ripe fruit notes, this is a young, fresh wine that shows hints of savory tones on the palate. Drink now.",86,Pali 2012 Riviera Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Pure notes of Conference pear define both nose and palate. The body is textured and concentrated but remains slender. Fresh acidity, dryness and slightly bitter pitch make for a beautiful, poised outline. Purity and length stand out.",91,Domaine Roland Schmitt 2015 Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Truly classy, with a deep nose of earth, tar and pure berry fruit. This wine delivers both the sweetness and ripeness that it should along with some rugged, spicy edges. The finish is big and packed with licorice, spice and pepper. A fine wine. Hold until 2006.",92,Collosorbo 1999  Brunello di Montalcino
"Fillaboa ranks among the most consistent high-quality producers of Albariño. This vintage delivers fresh lemon, melon and apple aromas. The palate is pointed but with some leesy richness and flavors of lemon, lime and stones. Finishes in mouthwatering style, with pineapple essence as the final act.",90,Fillaboa 2007 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"An ill-defined wine, closed and tight, this just hints at fruit without showing much intensity. The aftertaste has some bright lemon zest texture.",84,Seguin-Manuel 2013  Viré-Clessé
"Velvety, rich and intense upon first sip, this is a lively, well-built wine, held back in bottle and offering layers of blackberry, black cherry, anise and sage flavor. Fruity and feral, it delivers a lot of nuance within its powerful presentation.",91,Eric Kent 2013 Stiling Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This smoothly round and full-bodied wine offers a taste of the tropics, combining pineapple, payapa and coconut in tone and flavor. The oak (only 20% of it new) is pronounced, though on the way to integration, .",86,Levendi 2013 Reserve Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"The berry flavors in this wine are fighting to emerge, but they are overwhelmed by dusty tannins and a lack of texture.",80,Baron Herzog 2009 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi)
"Brick House was one of the first to plant Gamay Noir in the Willamette Valley, and may well be the state's leading producer in terms of quantity. This is loaded with chunky cherry fruit, a penetrating style that simply brings a grin with every sip. Aromatics of root beer, sassafras and hard cherry candy add to the complexity.",91,Brick House 2014 Gamay Noir (Ribbon Ridge)
"Red apple and brioche aromas are tinged with lemon. The palate has the same fruit, richness and freshness, but expresses this with lightness and ease. It's a versatile sparkler, ideal for both apéritif and dinner. The finish is dry, balanced and elegant.",92,Cave de Turckheim NV Mayerling Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"This structured wine opens with quintessential Sangiovese aromas of violet and black berries punctuated with whiffs of leather and balsamic herbs. The palate delivers a core of black cherry accented with mint, black pepper and licorice notes that add depth. The hint of prune on the finish reflects the warm, challenging vintage, but this is a delicious, well-balanced wine. Enjoy soon. Soilair Selections, Vineyard Road, WineCraft.",90,Riecine 2011  Chianti Classico
"A fine blend of equal parts of Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier, this ripe wine is crisp with acidity and a nervy mineral texture. It is still young, still tight and structured. But it will be a fine wine as it matures. Drink from 2019.",93,Chanoine 2012 Tsarine Millésime Brut  (Champagne)
"A mix of fruit spanning across the Russian River Valley, this complex Chardonnay is so inviting and approachable. Brimming in ripe Gravenstein apple and baking spices, it conveys alluring and lush crispness as well as balanced fruit and floral aromas.",90,Gary Farrell 2012 Russian River Selection Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This blend of Grechetto and Trebbiano Spoletino opens with a fragrance of tropical fruit and cantaloupe. The fresh but creamy palate offers rich flavors of green melon, pineapple and green apple, brightened by citrus notes and refreshing acidity.",87,Perticaia 2012 White (Umbria)
"Tropical fruits and richly herbaceous flavors come together in this ripe, fruity wine. It has a citrus core along with a fine tang of orange zest and pineapple. Ready to drink.",89,Domaine Fouassier 2010 Les Grands Groux  (Sancerre)
"Inky violet-red in color, this blend offers vivid aromas of cranberry, pomegranate and aniseed. Flavors of black cherry, blueberry pie, caramel and a dash of salinity endure through the lingering finish, against a backdrop of grippy tannins.",92,Golan Heights Winery 2010 Yarden 2T Touriga Nacional-Tinta Cão Red (Galilee)
Heavy toast aromas follow through to a wine that is packed with new wood and some fruit. It has a biting burnt edge that may soften.,83,Château Bourbon 2010 Clos Bourbon  (Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux)
"An attractive price for a straightforward, Amador County Zin, full-bodied and tasting of ripe blackberries and cocoa.",86,Shenandoah 2010 Zinfandel (Amador County)

You can taste the integrity of the fruit here and you will enjoy its clean freshness.",87,Leone de Castris 2007 Five Roses Rosé (Salento)
"This is a full-bodied version of the variety and yet it rides a line of soft texture and floral aromatics that ground it in nice ways. Meaty and fruity in cherry, it finishes thick and rich.",90,C R Graybehl 2014 Mathis Vineyard Grenache (Sonoma Valley)
"Forward and accessible, this wine has broadly displayed flavors of berry and milk chocolate, along with more subtle details of cayenne and herb. The nuances sneak up on you, but make for a fascinating ride. Drink now or give it another 3–4 years.",90,Lemelson 2009 Mt. Richmond Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Zinfandel is joined by Mourvèdre and a few other minor grape varieties in this overtly sweet, high alcohol wine. It's soft and glyceriney, with cherry, blueberry, dark chocolate and pepper flavors. You have to give it credit for being true to its style.",88,Peachy Canyon 2010 Especiale Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
Both fresh and baked apple make an appearance on the nose. Aromatic hints of citrus peel highlight the nuance of apple fruit in this slender but rounded wine. The spicy midpalate anchors this firmly and gives backbone to the beauty.,92,Weszeli 2014 Käferberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"Rich, dry and tannic, this Syrah has elaborate flavors of dried plums, blackberries, coffee, dark bitter chocolate and black pepper. It's a complex wine, compromised only by the heat of 15.4% alcohol.",87,Cinnabar 2008 Sextant Vineyard Syrah (Paso Robles)
"Aromas of forest floor, game and ripe berry come together on the nose. The earthy palate delivers dried black cherry, clove, smoke, baked plum and aniseed alongside chewy tannins. Drink through 2016.",88,Cafaggio 2012 Single Estate  (Chianti Classico)
"The aromas of apple, herb and mineral are light yet provocative. It's rounded in feel, with the Chardonnay (10%) and Marsanne (4%) in the blend providing additional heft and a finish that lingers. It doesn't seem entirely varietal but offers plenty of enjoyment.",86,Hedges Family Estate 2014 C.M.S. Unoaked White Wine Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))

It nicely blends structure and elegance.",92,Pala 2013 Riserva  (Cannonau di Sardegna)
"Sourced from the oldest vines in the vineyard, this lovely wine is scented with rose petals, cranberries and sour cherries.

Don't quit on this; it won't quit on you, finishing with a lick of sea salt caramel chocolate.",91,Hyland 2014 Coury Pinot Noir (McMinnville)
"Dark raisin and dried apricot flavors manifest on this immensely dark, old goldhued wine. Enormous concentration, as with the initially, almost painful acidity that comes through the spirit. This is an old wine, no question, but not too old, one to be savored in sips with all the flavors working at high intensity.",93,Sandeman NV 40-years Old Tawny  (Port)
"MacPhail's basic Anderson Valley Pinot is a good wine, dry and silky, with spicy flavors of cherries, currents and cola. It's a bit light in body, but tasty and interesting.",87,MacPhail 2006 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)

And the finish is straightforward but smooth. Stylish, with a little snap, crackle and pop.",90,Graffigna 2006 Grand Reserve Malbec (San Juan)
"Celebrate the best of Lazio cuisine (think platters of frutti di mare or puntarelle, a spear-like endive salad dressed in anchovies and garlic) with Frascati Superiore Luna Mater. The wine's soft aromas include subtle pulses of vanilla, banana and stone fruit.",88,Fontana Candida 2009 Luna Mater  (Frascati Superiore)
"Smoky beef aromas meet with crushed pencils, toasty oak, cola and sweet tobacco set against a subtle purple-fruit backdrop on this bottling by Rick Longoria. The palate is dry, easy to quaff and quite refreshing for a dark-red wine, with subtle touches of clove, black currant and more oak-smoked meat.",89,Longoria 2014 Tempranillo (Santa Ynez Valley)

"Aromas of scorched earth, underbrush, spicy plum, allspice and graphite lead the nose. On the palate, notes of cracked pepper and clove accent the mature blackberry, raspberry and fig flavors. It's balanced with well-integrated tannins and finishes on a note of bitter almond. Drink through 2016.",88,Mocavero 2010 Curtirussi Negroamaro (Salento)

"This is the winery's best Cabernet Sauvignon in years. It has classic black currant flavor, enhanced by smoky oak, and feels distinguished in the mouth. It's young, but should begin to mellow and show its stuff by 2017.",90,Rutherford Hill 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Crisp in tart, luminescent lemon, this variety was once much more prevalent in Sonoma County, but now presents itself as a rarity worth finding.

"This wine delivers a fresh hit of zesty acidity and earthiness that balance each other well, that liveliness a good match against more brooding aspects of black tea. Light bodied with just enough weight on the palate, it finishes with tastes of wild raspberry and strawberry.",91,Martin Ray 2013 Tina Marie Vineyard Pinot Noir (Green Valley)

"Based in the Côte de Sézanne, this producer has created a Pinot Noir-dominated blend. Its white stone-fruit aromas and soft texture point to a wine that is generous with its fruitiness, citrus and pear flavors leading the way. The wine is soft with a relatively high dosage. It is ready to drink.",88,Bernard Remy NV Carte Blanche Brut  (Champagne)
"Fragrant and aromatic with soapy, floral intensity and notes of mango and papaya, this is a vibrant Traminer that would pair well with spicy, exotic foods. It has a lean feel and ends with bright fruit flavors.",86,Ca'Tullio 2007 Traminer Aromatico Traminer (Friuli Aquileia)
"Aromas of asphalt, milk chocolate and generic berry fruits come with notes of creosote and chimney. This feels tannic and a bit flat. Savory, rubbery berry flavors are roasted and taste like oak-based clove on the finish.",84,Junta 2015 Momentos Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Curicó Valley)

"Creamy and smooth with soft oak shadings, this balanced 70-30 blend of full-bodied Grillo and fragrant Viognier is redolent of honey and bee's wax with softer tones of apricot and pear in the background. The wine has good density and structure but ends on a bright, crisp note.",87,Feudo di Santa Tresa 2006 Rina Ianca White (Sicilia)

"Big and lush, this has graphite, coconut, minty oak and huge berry fruit aromas. It's plush in the mouth but not wayward or overly big, with roasted plum, ­molasses, leather and raspberry flavors and a forward barrel note. Savory and long on the finish, this is a blend of 40% Monastrell, 30% Tempranillo and 15% each Syrah and Cabernet.",91,Bodegas Carchelo 2009 Sierva Red (Jumilla)
"This delicious, refreshing wine has crisp acidity and bright red apple fruit. Shot through with with zesty lemon character, it finishes with a waft of white floral perfume. Drink now.",89,Clos Poggiale 2016 Vermentino (Corse)
"Dark in color, intense in fruit flavor and firmly packed with tannins, this blockbuster Bordeaux-style blend feels massive and grippy. It tastes like cranberry and blackberry, leaving astringency on the palate that will match up to the richest foods. Age a few bottles through 2019 to see how it matures.",88,Marietta Cellars NV Arme Lot Number 3 Red (North Coast)
"This wine adds to the growing case to be made for Cabernet Sauvignon in Livermore Valley. Mother Vine Reserve is a smallish offering for Concannon, loaded with black olive, tea and black pepper. It's Cab Franc-esque in some way, yet intensely dark, brooding and velvety.",88,Concannon 2008 Mother Vine Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley)
"Rich and herbal in cranberry and cherry, this is a soft and approachable wine that's been tamed yet manages to retain a spicy, clove and cardamom edge.",86,Rodney Strong 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)

"This single vineyard Malbec belongs with Washington's best. The mix of purple fruits and intense barrel flavors of clove, cocoa and dusty mocha inspires an impromptu “wow” once in the mouth. Smooth, satiny and seamless, it has a gentle hint of earth and herb threaded through the finish.",92,Walla Walla Vintners 2010 Sagemoor Vineyard Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a big, kick-butt wine that shows the powerful fruit and hard tannins that make Pinots from this vineyard ageable. You'll find it tough and gritty now, with rich, deep flavors of cherries, currants, cola and cedar. Best beyond 2011.",93,Testarossa 2007 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Boasting weight and some richness, the wine shows that the northern Beaujolais crus are the most successful in 2010. The cherry and sweet plum flavors are laced with ripe acidity as well as a mineral edge.",87,Georges Duboeuf 2010 Sélection  (Saint-Amour)
"Aromas of moist underbrush, saddle leather, dried herb, menthol and a whiff of game take shape in the glass. The firm palate offers raw sour cherry, cranberry, cinnamon and a hint of tobacco while close-grained tannins provide the framework and leave an astringent finish. Give the tannins a few more years to unwind then drink.",89,Cantine Russo 2010 Rampante Rosso  (Etna)
"High acidity marks this wine, giving it a crisp character with subdued fruitiness. That should change over the next few months, so drink from late 2017.",86,Château la Verrière 2016 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
"With acrid matchstick aromas and little else, this wine gets off to a rough start and never finds solid footing. The palate is chunky and grabby, while the flavors are burnt and stalky, with bitterness to the finish.",81,Solo Contigo 2011 Premium Series Sauvignon Blanc (Mendoza)
"Aromas of spiced plum and chopped mint lead the nose and carry over to the brawny, one-dimensional palate along with vanilla, toast, coffee and liquor-soaked cherry. Dusty tannins dry out the finish while the heat of searing alcohol that throws it off balance. Drink sooner rather than later.",86,Carus Vini 2011 Baldero  (Chianti Classico)
"A grapefruit pith note dominates the finish, taking away from the more traditional refreshing lift that one might expect from Sauv Blanc. But the rest is gorgeous and inviting, with notes of white peach, hard gooseberry and white cranberry throughout.",86,Mulderbosch 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape)

"This late-harvest wine has hints of honeyed botrytis as well as apricot fruitiness, though it is far from cloyingly sweet. The texture is soft and mature, with good integration of the fruit and the botrytis character. Try it now with cheese or foie gras.",90,Global Wines 2012 Outono de Santar White (Dão)
"Compelling scents of white spring flower, stone fruit and a whiff of nut weave throughout this blend of Friulano, Chardonnay, Sauvignon and Pinot Grigio. The vibrant palate delivers yellow apple, orange zest, almond and mineral alongside tangy acidity.",90,Zuani 2014 Vigne White (Collio)

"Crisp and creamy, with red apple flavors. The wine is lifted by its crisp, green acidity, lightly coating the apple skin structure and tautness.",87,Domaine de la Grenaudière 2007  Muscadet Sèvre et Maine

"From the producer's dry-farmed estate vineyard, and supported by small amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this wine is elegant in sage and black cherry, silky on the palate in satisfying ways. Savory tea and an element of chocolate truffle give it additional complexity around a core of silky tannin.",91,Smith-Madrone 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District)
"This is a rich and full-bodied wine. While it is certainly packed with crunchy cherry flavors, it also has a more tannic and structured side giving it a firm texture to back up the fruitiness. The aftertaste is juicy and ripe.",90,Domaine de Roche-Guillon 2015  Beaujolais-Villages
"This is the casual sipper of the Château de Nages rosé pair, offering slightly briny, fumé notes on the nose, but following them up with peach and melon fruit flavors that finish long, crisp and dry.",88,Château de Nages 2014 Buti Nages Rosé (Costières de Nîmes)
"This wonderful and youthful wine shows how the Rhône varieties blend so well. It tastes as if the Grenache gives ripe fruit and the Syrah adds power and tannins. It's a big wine, with ample grippy texture, full body and good potential for aging through at least 2019.",92,Baiocchi Wines 2013 GB del Maggio Red (Fair Play)
"Il Massiccio is 85% Sangiovese with Merlot and Alicante, opening with bright cherry and raspberry aromas, with sour acidity and a touch of almond. Pair it with pepperoni or sausage pizza.",87,Tamburini 2008 Il Massiccio Sangiovese (Toscana)
"This estate Chardonnay is keeping stylistically with the winery's other offerings, though a tad weightier and richer in oak and crème brûlée. Fresh peach, pineapple and anise intermingle on the palate, with a silky yet complex texture. There is a palate-refreshing hint of lime on the finish.",93,Iron Horse 2012 Estate Chardonnay (Green Valley)
"This offers aromas and flavors of red raspberry, blue flowers, weedy underbrush and a whiff of dried sage. It's rather simple and already accessible.",86,Villadoria 2012  Barbaresco
"This easy-drinking Cabernet has flavors of blackberry jam and toast, wrapped into firm tannins. It won't improve with age, so drink up with a juicy burger.",84,Acronym 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Robert Mondavi winemaker Genevieve Janssens makes this wine, a small-production solo project that's worth seeking. The 83% Cabernet Sauvignon is sourced from Hendry Ranch and the 17% Cabernet Franc from Detert East Vineyard, a stone's throw from To Kalon. Impressively concentrated and lengthy, within a wealth of power, it is nuanced in black cherry, leather saddle and crushed rock, with the scent of violet never far behind.",96,Portfolio 2013 Limited Edition Red (Napa Valley)
"A bit sharp in acidity, with a bite right down the middle, but elegant and silky in mouthfeel and dry. Rich in flavor, too, offering waves of cherry, pomegranate, cola, persimmon and red plum fruit. Drink now.",90,Roadhouse Winery 2009 Purple Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Fragrant and refreshing, this savory white opens with delicate scents of white spring flower, orchard fruit and a whisper of crushed herb. The tangy palate delivers white peach, yellow pear and a hint of nectarine that linger on the crisp finish.",90,Tenuta Roveglia 2016 Limne  (Lugana)
"Bread, apple cider and yeasty complexity grace the nose on this Brut Nature. A smooth palate is now mature, ready and doesn't scrape or scour. Dry stone-fruit flavors blend with apple notes in front of a bready, toasty finish that has seltzer-like crispness. Drink through 2020.",90,Agustí Torelló 2007 Kripta Gran Reserva Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava)
"A wood-aged wine from the heart of the Dão, it has tannins, a tense mineral structure and layer after layer of black currant fruit and acidity. Dark and brooding at this stage, it needs to age for several years. Drink from 2016.",93,Sogrape 2010 Quinta dos Carvalhais Colheita Red (Dão)
"Apple and mild spice aromas kick off this simple white from the land of red Garnacha. The palate is fresh and juicy but light on character, while the flavor profile offers pithy, easygoing apple and melon flavors. This defines quaffable white wine.",84,Borsao 2011 Viura (Campo de Borja)
"The companion to the Hombre blend, this is 80% Malbec and 20% Syrah. The pairing works nicely, with the Syrah bringing details of anise, pepper and coffee. The wine has decent grip and definition, along with a pretty, toasty top note.",90,Stottle 2011 Homme Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Floral hints, latex, vanilla, oak and ripe berry aromas all show up on a fine bouquet. Ripe and creamy in feel, it holds dark, hard-pushing flavors of licorice, anise, coffee and blackberry. There's agility, elegance and complexity to this Malbec. Drink through 2017.",91,Los Vencejos 2010 Malbec (Uco Valley)
"This has extra richness that lends the wine concentration and ripeness. An intense structure of minerality is balanced by yellow fruit, bearing a round and full texture, with great depth of flavor. Age for at least five years. Screwcap.",93,Domaine Laroche 2010 Les Fourchaumes Vieilles Vignes Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"This is a juicy, earthy and expansive wine, with highlights of rose petal and wild strawberry. Pretty and ethereal, it offers body without an abundance of weight, the oak and tannin both integrated well.",91,MacMurray Estate Vineyards 2015 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"While there is plenty of acidity in this wine, it also has red fruit character that conveys a ripe, full feeling. It's juicy and fruity, crisp but still warm at the end.",85,Louis Jadot 2013 Cuvée Deux  (Beaujolais)
"What sets this Taurasi apart is a distinct floral note of blue flower or pressed rose that sits over a much broader and bolder base of dark spice, black fruit, prune, resin and cola. The little floral accent adds a feminine touch to what is without a doubt one of Italy's most masculine wines.",92,Villa Matilde 2005 Tenuta di Altavilla  (Taurasi)
"There's quite a showy, fragrant nose on this widely available bottling, with apple blossoms, tuberose and a touch of quinine. The palate also takes on a gin-and-tonic character, powered by lime juice, white peach and botanical notes.",85,Castle Rock 2014 Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"Fresh and inviting on the nose, this bottling shows sweet white flowers, Asian pear, yellow-grapefruit rind and lemon blossoms on the nose. Acidity explodes onto the palate, where a grassy, grapefruit-pith-driven tension rides into a rounded midpalate full of pear, nectarine and honeydew flavors.",92,Grassini 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
"Light, off-dry and refreshing, this would make an ideal poolside sipper. Hints of damp moss and fern add complexity to green apple and citrus flavors. Drink now.",88,Frisk 2014 Prickly Riesling (Alpine Valleys)
"Rugiens,  which is named after its red soil, is located in the south of Pommard. Dense, structured and powerful, this is a brooding wine that has concentrated tannins and fruit that is offset by a tight line of acidity. This is a wine that demands aging.",91,Albert Bichot 2010 Domaine du Pavillon Rugiens Premier Cru  (Pommard)
"Very sweet in black cherry and chocolate flavors, basically a Port-style wine, yet too soft, with a melted candybar feeling. Would benefit from greater acidic structure, but it sure is delicious.",86,Quady 2008 Elysium Black Muscat (California)
"This is a warm, rich wine with spicy black-fruit flavors. Touches of coffee have come through with the wood aging. Bright acidity gives a touch of freshness to the firm tannins at the end. Drink this generous, while still serious wine from 2020.",93,Château Canon la Gaffelière 2013  Saint-Émilion
"Savory whiffs of ramps and pollen blow off with aeration to reveal fresh scents of tangerine and apple. On the palate, it's off dry with intensely concentrated flavors of pink grapefruit and white peach. Zesty lime acidity lingers on the finish.",88,Dr. Fischer 2012 Ockfener Bockstein Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"There's lots to like about this wine, from its soft tannins and floral opening aromas to its spicy layers and integrated tannins. But at 16.5% alcohol, it's a crazy big wine, which makes it a difficult wine to pair with food or enjoy over a night without regrets in the morning.",86,Occasio 2010 Del Arroyo Vineyard Zinfandel (Livermore Valley)
The blend is 60-40 Grillo and Viognier and the wine offers aromatic components of both varieties. The first imparts green notes of kiwi and cut grass and the second offers sweet floral fragrances.,86,Duca di Salaparuta 2010 Calanìca Grillo-Viognier White (Sicilia)
"Some reduction still swings on the nose in the form of flinty smokiness, once this wears off, pure, taut, zesty lemon comes to the fore and remains the central feature of this streamlined, slender wine. There is midpalate texture and whistle-clean length.",91,Allram 2014 Hasel Alte Reben Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"This begins with a reserved nose that unfolds into deep, black aromas of licorice, turned earth and graphite. Pomegranate and acai fruit flavors mix with red clay and touches of whiskey, but the tannins are powerful. Give it until at least 2018 to smooth out.",88,Testarossa 2012 Brosseau Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chalone)
"Grassy aromas and a whiff of celery lead to a snappy palate with fresh but tart lemon, gooseberry and white-currant flavors. A juicy fresh finish with citrus flavors is typical of well-executed Txakoli.",88,Lasalde Elkartea 2015 Txakoli Aitzalde Hondarrabi Zuri (Getariako Txakolina)
"Green pear peel and flesh dominate nose and palate and make for a fruit-driven, slender but concentrated white. The melting texture is an added bonus.",89,Stadt Krems 2013 Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"Compact and full in the nose, with a fine level of berry fruit and some attractive wood spice. The mouth offers sweet berry flavors and some toasty oak, while the finish is round and soft. There's little complexity or style—what you smell and taste at first is what you get.",85,Valdivieso 2000 Single Vineyard Reserve Malbec (Lontué Valley)
"This is classic Santa Maria Valley Pinot Noir, with its dark color, full body, ripe berry and currant flavors and, especially, the array of exotic crushed brown spices. New French oak brings lots of smoky, buttery, toasty richness. Great to drink now with tuna, salmon, lamb and beef dishes.",93,Foxen 2010 Julia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"Owned by the Abeille family of Château Mont-Redon in Châteauneuf-du-Pape, this wine is delicious. Crisp and clean with great red currant and citrus fruitiness, it is finely judged with acidity and a light texture balancing the fruit. Drink now.",90,Château Riotor 2016 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Distinct aromas of cola, cedar and Bing cherry, as well as flavors of mocha and blackcurrants, weave fascinating complexity into this supple, full-bodied wine. The texture feels broad and relaxed, while the acidity and tannins are moderate. A nice viscosity carries its plump appeal through the finish.",92,Panthea 2012 Klindt Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"This wine is dark garnet to the eye, with a fragrance of raspberry, cherry and Mediterranean herbs. There is a pleasing balance of fruit and dried herb notes. Smooth tannins prevail, with flavors of black cherry, blueberry, eucalyptus, smoked meat and fresh-cut herbs of thyme and oregano paving the way for a blueberry, oregano and orange rind finish.",92,Golan Heights Winery 2010 Yarden Merlot (Galilee)
"Underbrush, dried plum, resin, leather and a whiff of baking spice aromas slowly emerge in the glass. The big chewy palate shows juicy blackberry, ripe black cherry, tobacco and clove set against a backbone of firm velvety tannins. Despite its heft, it also boasts surprising finesse. Hold for even more complexity. Drink 2017–2025.",94,Venturini Massimino 2005 Riserva  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"The Ormonde Chardonnay has a fresh, floral nature that is slightly feminine. Pretty floral and refreshing fruitelements mingle with hints of spice, resulting in a clean and friendly white that is both elegant and fun.",87,Ormonde 2006 Chardonnay (Darling)
"89-91 Very structured, the wood permeating the fruit, giving a toasty, spicy character. The fruit shows in the juicy under taste. Extraction might be a problem.",90,Château Tour de Pez 2010 Barrel sample  (Saint-Estèphe)
"An unusual and inviting lemongrass aroma and flavor go well with a buttery and vibrant texture in this medium-bodied and almost sweet wine. Blended from Sémillon, Chardonnay and four other grapes, it makes a nice change of pace.",89,Murrieta's Well 2014 The Whip White (Livermore Valley)
"Made in a rich, ripe style that perhaps favors power over elegance, this is delicious from start to finish. It's a big, intense wine, massive in blackberry and mocha flavors, with a bacon meatiness that's part Syrah, part smoky oak. While it's a little obvious in its appeals, it does show Syrah at its flashy Napa best.",94,Montagna 2009 Triangle Syrah (Napa Valley)
"Don't discount this Pinot Noir because it's in a screw top and the price is under $20. It's quite a nice wine, dry and silky. Made in a lighter style to be opened now, it has pleasant cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors.",86,Jekel 2008 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
"This barrel selection is loaded with tart cherry and blackberry fruit. Scents and accents bring hints of bread, butter, vanilla and coffee. The finish is lengthy and detailed, with no fall off in complexity. It was aged 18 months in roughly half new French oak.",92,Lachini 2015 Cuvée Giselle Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"Intensely floral on the nose, this is a blend of 70% Pinot Grigio grown in Carneros, 15% Traminer also grown in Carneros, and 15% Moscato giallo from Lodi, which the producer has previously employed in delightful wines of its own. Lilting and bright, it has substance behind the equal balance of fruit and spice, offering a taste of lemony ginger and pear.",90,Uvaggio 2014 Zelo Bianco White (Carneros-Napa Valley)
"Pepper Bridge and Stoney Vine vineyards contribute equally to this 100% varietal wine. It's the barrel influence that shows through first, with woodspice followed by green herbs, coffee and dark plum. The palate is rich with focused coffee and dark fruit flavors that have a touch of astringency.",89,Beresan 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"With its strongly mineral-textured base, this is a complex, impressive wine. It has fruit weight with lychees, mangos and spiced pears along with acidity that gives the wine just the lift it needs. Power and style go hand-in-hand in this wine. Drink from 2019.",96,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2012 Clos Saint Urbain Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
Peppery spice and simple but fresh dark fruit reminiscent of blueberry characterize this simple but very enjoyable rendition of Blaufränkisch. It may not be as concentrated as some but makes up for that in sheer drinkability.,88,Lenz Moser 2013 Blaufränkisch (Burgenland)
"Delicate aromas of lemon blossom, ripe Asian pear and a touch of yellow melon show on the nose of this versatile and tasty bottling. Grippy tension consumes the palate, led by lemon rind, but there's also a richer yellow-apple and pear core as well as a bit of pineapple.",92,J. Lohr 2014 October Night Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco)
"Close to the beaches of Saint-Tropez, this estate has produced a light-hearted wine that is fresh and crisp. The blend of Ugni Blanc, Clairette and Rolle give a light, bright character, with lemon and refreshing final acidity.",88,Château Saint-Maur 2014 White (Côtes de Provence)
"The 2003 Barbaresco is evolving well, if quickly. It shows mature flavors of smoky fruit, sweet plums, graphite and a touch of rubber. Soft on the palate, and delicious now, it should drink well for another five years.",87,Pio Cesare 2003  Barbaresco
"There's a bit of warmth to the nose of this wine, but forest berry and red cherry aromas and flavors keep things vibrant and flavorful. It's approachable now with soft tannins and an easygoing structure, ending with a hint of milk chocolate.",87,Flam 2009 Classico Red (Israel)
"Rich, with a hint of toast, this floral wine, with its almond blossom aromas, is drier than many other bottlings from this producer. It has a crisp, tight texture, with a mineral edge as well as a firm structure that suggests it is still young, so drink from 2018.",91,Canard-Duchêne NV Charles VII Grande Cuvée le Victorieux Brut  (Champagne)
"Dusty potpourri tones pepper the perfumey floral and fruit aromas on this dry, light-bodied Gewürztraminer. It's lithe and refreshing with a crisp finish.",85,Stony Lonesome 2014 Estate Reserve Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes)
"Dry, acidic and tannic, in the manner of a young Barbera, but the flavors of cherries, blackberries and currants aren't powerful enough to outlast the astringency. Drink this tough, rustic wine now.",84,Eagle Castle 2007 Barbera (Paso Robles)
"A good, although somewhat tough and gritty, Pinot Noir that just wants a steak to cut through its tannins and acids. Shows a dry, silky texture with flavors of cherries, tobacco and peppery spices.",86,Manzoni 2007 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"A bright cherry-red color, this lively, sweet-scented wine proves that Oregon can still make a Pinot Noir in a lighter style without having it turn vegetal. Despite a citrusy snap to the palate, it feels smooth and even a bit satiny, and the pretty cranberry/cherry fruit is annotated with cinnamon and light toast. A superb value.",87,Firesteed 2005 Pinot Noir (Oregon)
"This tastes like an alcoholic fruit drink with apricot, orange and mango flavors. Still, it's clean and pleasant.",83,Jenica Peak 2011 Coastal Series Chardonnay (California)
"A full-bodied, fleshy expression of the variety, this wine opens in aromas of toasted marshmallow and caramel, the oak impressive and memorable. From there it offers a wealth of baked apple and pear, finding its footing along a lush, richly defined path.",90,Michael Mondavi Family Estate 2015 Emblem Chardonnay (Carneros)
"In the crisp, balanced style of the producer, this nonvintage Champagne is light, poised and elegant. It is satisfyingly mature with good acidity and minerality. Lively and perfumed, it is ready to drink.",90,Billecart-Salmon NV Brut Réserve  (Champagne)
"Light citrus, green herb and nettle aromas are just what you'd expect from Leyda SB, and the palate has a plump, easy feel along with fresh flavors of melon, tangerine and nectarine. More round than linear, with good length and clarity.",87,Santa Carolina 2009 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley)
"Leathery and rubbery at first, with aromatic accents of celery seed, barnyard and melted tar. The palate is lighter than the nose, with herbal plum flavors and a lean, strained body. Thin and fresh, but nothing special.",84,De Lozar 2007  Ribera del Duero
"Oxidized aromas of spent yeast and stale fruit are not fresh. This feels foamy, wayward and unfocused. Citrus flavors are unconvincing, while this rosé tastes soapy on the finish.",83,Codorníu NV Anna Brut Rosé Sparkling (Cava)
"This impressive operation covers much of eastern Waiheke, although only a small portion of the property is planted to vines. The 2010 vintage was especially good on the island, and this wine is crammed with ripe, peachy fruit, framed by smoky oak and roasted nuts. Despite being weighty and round in the mouth, it finishes well, on a lingering citrusy note. Drink it over the next couple of years.",92,Man O' War 2010 Valhalla Chardonnay (Waiheke Island)
"Crisp and tightly wound, this is a relatively austere Cabernet with an astringent finish. Cassis emerges with enough airing, accompanied by tart cranberries, which act to accentuate the drying tannins. Try after 2020.",86,D'Arenberg 2013 The High Trellis Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)
"This wine is a blend of Grenache (53%), Syrah (22%), Mourvèdre (17%), Counoise (5%) and Cinsault. Smoke, char and black pepper aromas are predominant along with notes of tire rubber, white pepper and red fruit. The red-fruit flavors are lighter in style, showing a pretty sense of styling.",89,Brian Carter Cellars 2013 Byzance Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"As is right for a Bandol, Mourvèdre is the dominant grape in this rich wine. It is spicy from the same wood aging that also gives a mint-chocolate flavor to the powerful red-plum and berry fruits. The wine is still young, still firm. Drink from 2019.",91,Château d'Azur 2014 Tradition Red (Bandol)
"A velvet-textured wine, relatively light because of the vintage, but oh-so tender, the tannins whispering behind the sweet fruits. This is regarded as the second wine of Clos de Tart Grand Cru and shows the same generous, plush character.",91,Clos de Tart 2007 La Forge de Tart Premier Cru  (Morey-Saint-Denis)
"A warm, sunny blend of local grapes, this is ripe while still having a fresh, fruity character. The acidity at the end reinforces this contrast between richness and crispness. Drink now.",86,Cartuxa 2015 EA Tinto Red (Alentejano)
"White and black pepper jump out of the glass, calling to the senses in this wine from the Wallace Creek Vineyard. A complex tangle of body and texture interweaves between an underlying elegance that belies the considerable ripeness behind this wine.",93,Francis Coppola 2013 Reserve Syrah (Dry Creek Valley)
"Big, rich, and dramatic are just a few words that describe this 100% Cabernet grown on the low-yielding estate vineyard in Coombsville. It's lush with black currants, yet bracing in tannins, with a minerality that makes it feel firm and grounded. The barrels are 100% new French oak, lending a savory level of char and vanilla. This is clearly a wine to cellar for a long time. Start enjoying it in 2018, and it is likely to develop bottle complexity throughout the 2020s.",95,Caldwell 2010 Gold Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Beautiful to drink now, one of the most rewardingly plush Syrahs on the market. It's easy to like, with soft tannins and a creamy mouthfeel housing ripe, savory cherry and blueberry pie flavors. If only more Syrahs were this delicious.",92,Terlato 2008 Syrah (Dry Creek Valley)
"A fine, concentrated, mineral-textured wine, with pink grapefruit and lemon zest flavors. It is vivid, fresh, layered with crisp acidity that blooms in the mouth. There is a great, taut aftertaste.",92,Roger et Didier Raimbault 2007 Vieilles Vignes  (Sancerre)
"Smooth and rounded with light, perfumed sweetness, this is an easy and approachable wine. Its pear and kiwi flavors come together easily. Screwcap.",84,Adega Cooperativa Ponte de Barca 2011 Hera White (Vinho Verde)
"Fruity, rich and satisfying. Shows a mélange of pineapple, pear and peach flavors, with creamy vanilla and spice notes, brightened with crisp acidity. Could be a tad drier.",86,Happy Camper 2008 Chardonnay (California)
"Produced from the old vines of one of Cahor's emblematic estates, this is a dark, dense and concentrated wine. Full of black plum skins that are balanced with acidity, it is rich with black cherry and a smoky character from the wood aging. This 100% Malbec does need aging and should be drunk from 2019.",93,Domaine de Cause 2012 La Lande Cavagnac Malbec (Cahors)
"While the nose is subdued, lush honeydew and white peach flavors shine brilliantly on the palate of this taut, nervous wine. Streaks of steely mineral lend a polished feel that lingers on the finish. It's strikingly acidic still, but should meld together beautifully with some cellaring, ideally from 2019 on.",93,Fritz Haag 2013 Brauneberger Juffer Sonnenuhr Auslese Riesling (Mosel)
"Raspberries, cherries, cola and persimmons are the flavors of this fairly standard Pinot Noir. It's dry and delicately structured, with good acidity and a discrete coating of oak. Drink now.",86,Envolve 2012 Lennox Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Some caramel and candied fruit goes well with the flowery element on the bouquet. In the mouth, lime, peach and mineral run the show. After that comes a clean, light finish with just a hint of stone-fruit flavor. A good mouthfeel ensures that this will be a decent wine for trout caught during the summer.",84,Montecillo 2002 White (Rioja)
"This perfumed wine from a great year is rich in both fruit and structure, solid with tannins as well as ripe fruit. It is still youthful, dense and powerful. Wait and drink from 2018.",89,Château Garreau 2010 Cuvée Armande  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"The best thing about this oddball Best Buy is that it doesn't require a big investment in order to try something way different. The wine is packaged nicely in a stout bottle, and it does give some cava-like flavor due to the fact that it's 100% Xarello. Beyond that, it smells and tastes like kiwi, banana, papaya and other green fruits. Weird but good in its own way. Give it a shot.",87,Marqués de Alella 2007 Pansa Blanca (Alella)
"This ripe and full-bodied wine has a wonderful balance between pure acidity and ripe yellow fruits. From chalk and clay soils, it's both mineral and rich, both fresh and warm. It could be drunk now, although it will be much better from 2016.",88,Domaine Sangouard-Guyot 2013 Authentique  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
"This intriguing wine is dominated by the 60% of normally rare Petit Verdot. Made by the same team as Château Paloumey, this wine shows an impressive color, and a rich, black berry juicy character. The tannins are solid, but the exuberant fruit overrides everything else.",88,Château la Bessane 2006  Margaux
"Blended with 6% Petit Verdot, this wine is treated as a reserve-tier bottling. It delivers high-toned red fruit and plum notes dusted with spice and dried herb. It's robust in body and weight and long on the finish.",93,Rombauer 2014 Diamond Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Lots of oak and lees on this Chardonnay, but is never feels overworked. The acidity is brisk, and fruit flavors are rich in apricots, mangoes, tangerines and pears. Don't drink this delicious wine too cold, as it picks up nuances in the glass.",91,Dutton Estate 2012 Kyndall's Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Winemaker Brian Loring's take on this coveted vineyard shows rhubarb, pencil lead and a very clove-y cinnamon aspect on the nose. Raspberries mark the core of the palate, but the edges are speckled with strong herbs, from oregano to juniper. It offers a great mix of fruit and spice.",93,Loring Wine Company 2013 Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"More of an orange shade of pink, this rosé of Syrah offers red plum, grapefruit pith and chalky minerality on the nose. The palate shows broad red-apple and tangerine-skin flavors, although the texture is lacking a bit of grip and acidic brightness.",87,Refugio Ranch 2016 Rosé (Santa Ynez Valley)
"A rich, elegant and accessible blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre with well-ripened cherry, berry, currant, spice and cedar flavors. Showing its best now, so drink up.",87,Koehler 2008 Les 3 Cépages G-S-M (Santa Ynez Valley)
"On the nose this is classic Bordeaux, the dusty black currant and tight fruit very obvious. This is a lean wine, with a core of dry tannins, but there is definite black currant juice freshness, the wine showing high finishing acidity.",87,Hans Moser 2005 Cabernet Merlot (Burgenland)
"A tender notion of slightly bitter, dark fir honey appears first before a touch of smoke and ripe peach come in. The off-dry palate uses its sweetness to underline the rich peachy fruit that also has a touch of golden mirabelle. The big bold palate is concentrated and energetic, pervaded by a streak of zesty lemon freshness that keeps this from becoming too rich. There is undeniable drive here, and a very lasting persistent length of peach and lemon flavors which will develop much more with bottle age. Drink. 2017–2037.",95,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Clos Saint Urbain Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"A fruity and aromatic wine that is a blend of Syrah and Castelão. It has bright red fruits and a soft, ripe character. Berries and acidity complement the round finish.",84,Wines & Winemakers 2012 Samora Rosé (Tejo)
"This vintage of Rupìcolo (a 70-30 blend of Montepulciano and Nero di Troia) is an austere wine with brooding aromas of spice, blackberry jam and bitter chocolate. The wine has drying tannins with deep dimension and persistency. The price is just right too.",87,Rivera 2006 Rupìcolo Red (Castel del Monte)
"A blend of 81% Merlot, 12% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot. An unusually tight Pedestal, this absolutely must be decanted. It opens well, with black fruits, toasted grain, and firm tannins, then hits a wall and stops short. However, with a lot of breathing time and/or aerating, it broadens out a bit and shows more length and finesse.",91,Pedestal 2008 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A touch of peach colors the white and green fruit notes of this zippy white, its freshness amplified by a slight spritz. It's light bodied, dry and very refreshing, with a lovely herbal edge on the palate.",90,Jurtschitsch 2016 Terrassen Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"Well-rounded pear and apple aromas get a fresh squeeze of lemon in this good-deal Sauv Blanc. It's easy to drink, with apple popover flavors (whose toasty elements come from the 20% barrel fermentation) and a brisk acidity.",87,Santa Barbara Winery 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Solidly structured, this wine is medium- to full-bodied, moderately tannic and heading toward maturity in flavors. The medium garnet color goes to tawny at the rim. Aromas of cola, cherries and a touch of smoke are followed by rather lean fruit and clove flavors. Unfined, unfiltered and fermented with wild yeast.",86,Foursight 2011 Charles Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Citrus aromas are familiar. Lively and zesty in the mouth, with refreshing acidity. Orange and passion fruit lead the palate, which transitions to grapefruit. Crisp on the finish. Good for an everyday white wine.",86,Viña Casablanca 2010 Cefiro Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"There's a savory roasted-meat quality to the nose of this blend of 68% Grenache, 20% Mourvèdre and 12% Syrah that also offers crushed riverstone, a touch of violet and coffee-syrup scents. The hefty, meaty character carries right into the palate that is thick in body, chalky with structure and redolent in roasted blackberry and tangy elderberry fruit.",92,Alta Colina 2014 Estate Cask Reserve G-S-M (Adelaida District)
"Made entirely with Refosco, this robust red has a shy nose that eventually reveals prune and a whiff of ground green pepper. The dense palate offers mature plum, vanilla and a hint of cocoa alongside the heat of evident alcohol and evolved tannins. Drink soon.",87,De Stefani 2014 Kreda Refosco (Veneto)
"This flavorful blend of Müller-Thurgau, Muscat and Riesling is lightly fizzy, and off dry, with residual sugar listed at 22.5g/L. Citrus fruits are limned with ginger, and it is a thoroughly refreshing and low-alcohol delight.",88,Season 2014 Transparency White (Southern Oregon)
"The sweetest of the Madeira single-variety wines, this Bual is still laced with intense acidity. That brightness is contrasted by the toffee and caramel flavors, yielding a wine that is superrich while remaining so fresh at the end. This fine wine is ready to drink.",95,Blandy's 2002 Colheita Bual (Madeira)
"Ripe pear-pineapple fruit is layered with vanilla and tinged with citrus. This is a plump, slightly heavy Chard best served cold at parties and picnics.",84,Concha y Toro 1999 Xplorador Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)
"This bold wine has a charred oaky aroma, flavors that are almost sweet and also plenty oaky, along with ripe and concentrated berry flavors that peek out from under the smoky toasted layer after a few moments.",86,Dante Robere 2014 Zinfandel (San Francisco Bay)
"This conveys pure strawberry fruit with just the right amount of tannin, making for a beautiful, perfumed wine. The dry core is still juicy with acidity and raspberry fruits, while acidity shoots through at the end. Drink from 2020.",92,Domaine Bruno Clair 2014 Les Longeroies  (Marsannay)
Cherry and cassis aromas are fiery but acceptable. This Cab has a medium-bodied palate and flavors of salty berry fruits and creamy oak. Dry oak spice is the most noticeable flavor on a mellow finish.,88,Porta 2015 Single Vineyard Estate Bottled Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"Lifted lemony freshness greets the nose, while savoriness dominates the palate. It offers pear and citrus, as well as riper stone-fruit, earthy hints and pungent watercress and white pepper—all packaged in a ripe but streamlined body.",90,Türk 2013 Kremser Weinberge Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
This round yet direct Cava offers stone-fruit aromas that are upright and clean. Simple citrus and nectarine flavors hold steady on the finish.,86,Marqués de la Concordia 2012 MM Reserva de la Familia Brut Rosé Sparkling (Cava)
"This vineyard selection offers a compact and clean aromatic package that hits all the right notes without being overdone. Blackberry, cherry, vanilla and spice chime in on the palate and help drive the wine's long, chewy finish.",91,Poggio Antico 2003 Altero  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"This opens with aromas that recall spring flower, citrus and a whiff of honeydew melon. The rather lean, linear palate shows grapefruit and flint alongside racy acidity. A bitter almond note signals the finish.",86,Broglia 2013 Bruno Broglia del Comune di Gavi  (Gavi)
"Immaculate freshness abounds in this zesty Chardonnay. While supple and quite creamy on the palate, pristine lemon and pear flavors and a vibrant backdrop of lemony acidity invigorate. Elegantly meshed vanilla and spice tones linger on the finish.",89,Bellangelo 2014 1866 Reserve Chardonnay (Seneca Lake)
"The nose offers plenty of cooked plum preserves, warm spice and toasted, nutty oak. There's a nice, lush texture and body, and bright red cherry and plums flavors on the palate. The fruit flavors may be slightly lacking in concentration, but supple tannins make for smooth, easy sipping.",86,Comtesse Thérèse 2006 Aquebogue Estate Merlot (North Fork of Long Island)
"Light graphite notes of pencil shaving and slate roof come on the heels of wild berries, orange zest and powdered licorice. Shadings of ash and smoke liven the mouth but the finish is exceedingly tannic and dry.",86,Cantina del Nebbiolo 2007  Roero
"Right now, although the nose is closed, exposure to air reveals the purity of lemon oil on a taut and tight palate still singing with yeasty notes. This is in its very infancy and promises to open up beautifully with its straight, soaring backbone of freshness. Underneath all the tightly curled layers of citrus peel slumbers a salty stoniness that signals ageability; the long, lemony finish corroborates this. How utterly lip-smacking. Drink 2020–2030",95,Josef Jamek 2014 Ried Klaus Riesling (Wachau)
"This starts off slightly rubbery, but comes around quickly enough to display ample white grapefruit and pith notes. It's a bit tight and austere from start to finish; probably at its best with seafood.",84,Hope Estate 2009 Verdelho (Hunter Valley)
"Notes of red currant, rhubarb, tart strawberry and Cherry Dr. Pepper grace the nose and mouth of this straightforward and easy-drinking red. It's lightweight and softly structured, with a short but clean and pleasant finish.",84,Laroque 2015 Pinot Noir (Vin de Pays Cité de Carcassonne)
"The nose hovers somewhere between pink grapefruit and Cox Orange Pippin apple: that is to say the flavors are pure, fruity and crisp. The palate is dry and aromatic, fizzy and easy, foaming and light. This is an ideal party wine, enlivening everything with its weightless freshness.",88,Allimant-Laugner NV Rosé Pinot Noir (Alsace)
"Under the same family ownership as Château Lamothe-Cissac, this estate has produced a broa rich wine, dominated by its 60% Cabernet Sauvignon. It is rounded already with juicy blackberry fruits and dark tannins. Drink this already fruity wine from 2019.",88,Château la Tonnelle 2014  Haut-Médoc
"This is a medium-dry Riesling with plenty of weight and richness, but also wonderfully perfumed aromatics of citrus blossom. Lime and green apple fruit carries the palate, and finishes long, with an almost tactile sense of minerality.",91,Spy Valley 2009 Riesling (Marlborough)
"This is a fresh and easy selection, with low-intensity aromas and flavors of tart gooseberry, lemon-lime citrus and soft grass. The mouthfeel is light and breezy, and the finish is clean and brisk. Drink now.",86,Pelter 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Galilee)
This soft wine is easy and open. It has generous fruits and gentle acidity. The result is a smooth wine that is ready to drink now.,85,Bailli de Provence 2016 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"The rustic aromas are off-putting in this wine. It has a proper density but seems to have a musty character. This could blow off over time, because the fruit is here.",85,Château Bellegrave 2008  Pauillac
"Dark, alluring aromas of licorice, blackberry and toast share space with earthy, mossy notes on the nose of this full-bodied winner that's showing wall-to-wall weight and tannins. Black plum, cassis and tobacco flavors are a common Rioja trifecta, as are dry, peppery, figgy flavors on the finish. Drink from 2018–2028.",92,Bodegas Landaluce 2009 Capricho  (Rioja)
"The aromas are surprisingly light considering the variety, with whiffs of both lime and peach. It drinks dry, with the variety difficult to discern.",84,Armstrong Family 2015 Dineen Vineyard Riesling (Yakima Valley)
"An interesting blend of 24% Viognier, 24% Roussanne, 24% Chenin Blanc, 14% Chardonnay and 14% Sémillon, this offers aromas of buttered brioche, waxy apple, white melon rind and firm pear. The medium-weight palate is well-balanced and harmonious, the ripe fruit tones countered by ample acidic lift. A hint of salinity enlivens the finish. Drink now–2018.",90,Avondale 2013 Cyclus White (Paarl)
"Yellow peach, apricot and tangerine aromas lead to the tangy palate along with notes of ginger and white pepper. Crisp acidity gives it a clean, crisp finish.",87,Cantina Valle Isarco 2014 Kerner (Alto Adige)
"As is normal for Embruix, the nose is generous and jammy, with extracted flavors of grapy black fruits and earth. The palate is smooth and jammy, with easy tannins and ripe flavors of plum and cassis. The finish is loamy, plump and soft. Drink through 2017.",90,Vall Llach 2011 Embruix Red (Priorat)
"This Syrah-Grenache rosé is intensely herbal, with strong notes of thyme, sage, parsley, laurel and lavender, all grounded by a tart cherry character. The palate is pleasantly zippy in acidity and a touch astringent through the close, with notes of orange pith and melon rind that linger nicely. Drink now.",87,Château la Grave 2015 Expression Rosé (Minervois)
"A blend of 54% Merlot with smaller percentages of Cabernet Sauvignon (28%) and Cabernet Franc (18%), this is a nicely structured red that's soft, accessible and juicy, with notes of cranberry and cassis liqueur coming to the fore.",88,Wise Villa 2011 Wisdom of Wise Red (Sierra Foothills)
"This is a very pleasant and elegant blend of Nero d'Avola, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot that does a great job of presenting a united aromatic front. There are no loose edges here and the wine is compact and smooth in the mouth. Very nice.",89,Duca di Salaparuta 2005 Triskelè Red (Sicilia)
"Here's a wine that delivers big, ripe fruity tones such as sticky black cherry and blackberry comfiture but that leaves just enough room for those distinctive Sardinian notes of Mediterranean herbs. Pair this wine with red meat, especially lamb, and roasts.",87,Pala 2005 Silenzi Red (Isola dei Nuraghi)
A waxy vein of petroleum cuts enticingly through juicy-sweet pink grapefruit and peach flavors in this dainty semisweet Riesling. It's vivaciously spry yet finishes long on a lingering lacy veil of sweetness. Drink now through 2022.,91,Boundary Breaks 2013 No. 198 Single Vineyard Reserve Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"It's easy to like this vibrant Chardonnay for its generous fruit flavors, subtle oak influence  and creamy texture. It smells like a fruit tart and tastes fresh and rich at the same time. The ripe fruit flavors grow on the finish.",87,Belle Ambiance 2012 Chardonnay (California)
"Dry and silky but heavy, with earthy flavors of herbs, mushrooms, cherries, cola and spice. Drink now.",84,TreViti 2006 Stolo Family Vineyard Anno di Isabella Pinot Noir (Central Coast)
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère, Rara Neagra, Shiraz and Malbec, this Moldovan wine has aromas of sweet cherry juice and vanilla. It has flavors of dried figs, fresh black plum and dried red plums. The finish is persistent with grippy tannins.",89,Equinox Estate 2012 5 Elemente Red (Moldova)
"This offers fruity and spicy fragrances of blackberry and clove. On the palate, it has a tight core of black cherry and spice, with firm, chewy tannins that are tightly wound. Give this a few more years to come around.",87,Valentina Cubi 2010 Arusnatico  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
"A rich, opulent Cabernet, made in the modern style. It's firm in tannins and dense with blackberry, currant, olive, dark chocolate and new oak flavors, but is really too young to drink now. Give it at least 6–8 years.",90,Bacio Divino 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Hints of milk chocolate and spice accent this sumptuously rich, silky wine. Ripe black cherry and berry flavors are approachably juicy and fruity, fringed by soft, feathery tannins.",87,The Old Field 2010 Commodore Perry Merlot (North Fork of Long Island)
"Ripe pomegranate and candied raspberry aromas meet with potpourri and cinnamon touches on the nose of this bottling from the Franscioni family. The palate is very approachable, with raspberry sorbet flavor and a graphite edge, providing both the richness that the appellation is known for and smart restraint.",92,Roar 2015 Sierra Mar Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Firm and juicy, this Pinot has a core of berry fruit and plenty of acidity. The earthy, herbal accents are typical of this AVA. Overall, it shows fine balance and decent concentration.",87,Cherry Hill 2010 Dijon Cuvée Estate Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Heavy oak, vanilla and lightly herbal black-fruit aromas are savory and border on soupy. In the mouth, this is rich, saturated and jammy. Flavors of maple, chocolate and toast accent fully extracted dark-fruit flavors. Full chewy tannins result in a pounding finish. Drink through 2022.",91,Viña Chocalan 2013 Vitrum Malbec (Maipo Valley)
"Glimmers of minerality lend elegance to zesty white grapefruit, lemon and pear notes in this dry, full-bodied Pinot Gris. A brisk backbone of acidity balances nicely against a mouthfeel that's succulent and satisfying. Drink now through 2016.",87,Thirsty Owl Wine Company 2014 Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes)
"Dry on the nose, with balsam shavings, pepper and secondary red fruit aromas. The palate has a choppy, fairly hollow feel and then short flavors of plum and berry. Spice and mint notes work the finish, which is mellow. Overall this is standardfare RDD.",85,Splendore 2007  Ribera del Duero
"Blue flower, red berry and mint aromas lead the nose. The straightforward palate offers fleshy wild cherry, raspberry, vanilla and mocha alongside chewy tannins. Drink through 2019.",88,Gattavecchi 2011 Poggio alla Sala  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano)
"Soft and direct. Tastes like a liquid granola bar, with melted flavors of raspberries, cocoa, roasted almonds, vanilla, cinnamon and brown sugar. Drink now.",85,Verve 2007 Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"While the producer does have vines in Volnay, this wine comes from the negociant side of the business. The wine has structure and some firm tannins. At this stage, the Volnay roundness lies behind the dry surface. But it does have weight and the potential to age well. Drink from 2021.",90,Maison Jessiaume 2015  Volnay
"This is a beautiful Cabernet for drinking now. It's soft and lush and dry, with complex flavors of red and black currants, sweet herbs and cedar. Shows real class and elegance.",88,Geyser Peak 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Apple and nectarine aromas are clean and snappy, with a hint of yeast-based vanilla. A fresh, citric palate delivers lime, green apple, pineapple and nectarine flavors, while the finish is clean as a new razor, with nothing off, bitter or pithy.",88,Marqués de la Concordia 2013 Vega de la Reina Hacienda Zorita Verdejo (Rueda)
"Forest floor, truffle, new leather and woodland berry scents mingle in the glass. The palate is linear, taut and austere, offering sour cherry, licorice and sage notes, framed by firm acidity and assertive, close-grained tannins that grip the finish. Drink after 2019.",89,Tenuta Valdipiatta 2013  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano
"This full-bodied Assyrtico offers aromas of pineapple, citrus and spice on the nose, while the palate brings layers of fruit, minerals and lemon. Delicious with a good acidity, imagine this white with grilled chicken or fish.",90,Athiná 2012 Assyrtico (Santorini)
"True to the variety, this expression of Riesling offers touches of nature rubber and kerosene backed by a light and luminous mouthfeel. There's a touch of sweetness as well as a polished mineral aftertaste.",87,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano 2010 Montiggl Riesling (Alto Adige)
"A good Pinot Noir, lusty, dry and fruity, although it's a bit raw in youth. Shows rich cherry marmalade, cola, spice and sandalwood flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. The vineyard is not among the valley's best, but Siduri interprets it as well as anyone.",90,Siduri 2009 Keefer Ranch Pinot Noir (Green Valley)
"Trollinger, also known as Schiava or Vernatsch outside of Germany, is a rarity in the U.S. market, but this delightfully crisp, raspberrry-scented bottling is worth seeking out. It releases sweet raspberry and cherry perfume, but also darker notes of smoke, granite and cedar. Cranberry and strawberry flavors are tingling and tart, framed by tight tannins and a deep granite finish. Drinks well now but should improve further from 2021.",93,Wachtstetter 2013 Steillage Trollinger (Württemberg)
"Odd aromas of talcum powder and bath oils are fragrant but not very wine-like. This is flat on the palate, with very little cut and oily tasting flavors of ripe white fruits.",81,Casa Solar 2011 Viura (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"A dark, masculine, brooding Brunello, with savory aromas of leather and cured meat behind ripe fruit and blackberry. It's tight and clean, with a streamlined mouthfeel that testifies to the wine's firm tannic structure. Executed in a traditional style, it shows possibilities for long-term aging.",91,Altesino 2007  Brunello di Montalcino
"Legendary winemaker Jim Clendenen delivers aromas of sour cherry, dried pine needles, bay leaf and kirsch-like brandy on this wine. The full, dense palate features butter-fried herbs including tarragon, marjoram and black pepper, all laid across a roasted lamb-like gaminess, followed by hints of dark chocolate and mint.",94,Clendenen Family 2009 Le Bon Climat Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"This wine is both fruity and creamy, with a profile that's heavy in tropical peach and vanilla. Medium-bodied and bold, it has a softness to the palate buoyed by natural structure and length.",90,Apsara 2014 River's Reach Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford)
"This garagiste-sized project presents a complex take in this 50% Grenache and 50% Syrah project, with tight boysenberry, slight asphalt, pressed violets and black pepper on the nose. There is a pronounced density of black fruit on the palate, with blueberry dominant, as well as gingerbread warmth, roasted pork, hoisin sauce and a strong tannic grip.",92,Rendarrio Vineyards 2012 First Born King Grenache-Syrah (Paso Robles)
"Sulfur, burnt matchstick and powdered sugar aromas make up the bouquet. This Malbec-derived sparkler is round and full, with a light bubble bead. Heavy, sweet-tasting stone-fruit flavors finish melony and sugary sweet.",84,Reginato 2011 Celestina Método Tradicional Rosé of Malbec (Mendoza)
"Ripe plum, dark coffee and spice flavors join the firm tannins in this intense wine. It has a strong structure that needs to soften to allow the juicy black-currant flavor to surface. Give it 4–5 years.",90,Château Tour Seran 2010  Médoc
"This is a softly floral wine, with citrus and fresh pear notes that accompany green apple. It is ripe and fruity, with a light tang of orange on the finish. Screwcap.",87,Pierre Sparr 2011 Riesling (Alsace)
"Peach and a hint of fresh lettuce are the key aromas to a basic bouquet. This feels solid but pithy, while orange and other generic citrus flavors turn slightly bitter on the finish.",86,Paramus 2014 Verdejo (Rueda)
"Sour and thin, this has green mint, cherry and spice flavors.",82,Cannonball 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Matriarch often measures up to the level of BOND and Harlan Estate itself. It is a blend of various BOND components. The '06 is a classically structured Napa blend, fat and flashy in youth, offering complex waves of blackberry and cherry tart, black currant, cola, licorice and sweet, spicy oak. There's a savory meatiness reminiscent of salty bacon. But the tannins are significant. Drink now through 2018.",94,Matriarch 2006 Red (Napa Valley)
"This cellar-worthy treasure has attention-grabbing spice, leather and smoky oak aromas. Ripe fruit flavors are heavily shaded with undeniably delicious accents of cedar and chocolate. It is bold in flavor, full in body and quite tannic in texture. Hold until at least 2018; the wine should improve even more after that.",93,Hoopes 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This wine is firmly in the herbal-vegetal camp. It smells like yellow tomatoes and tastes like tarragon and parsley, with a full body and soft acidity. It finishes slightly sweet.",86,Langtry 2014 Lillie Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Guenoc Valley)
"Big, fruity, mature wine, showing a petrol character as well as a rounded texture and a shot of minerality. The wine is both chewy and generous, packed with fruit skins and green bean-acidity. It is ready to drink, very fresh.",93,Domaine FL 2008  Savennières-Roche-Aux-Moines
"88-90 Barrel sample. Very sweet fruit, deliciously approachable. Chocolate and ripe black fruit. The layer of tannin is important to keep all this opulence together.",89,Château la Pointe 2008 Barrel sample  (Pomerol)
Pretty mineral tones of delicate talc power and dried flowers frame a powerful wine that reveals a dense core of dried fruit and raisins at its heart. This Amarone is dense and sweet in the mouth with chewy tannins and good length.,90,Sartori 2003 Corte Brà  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
This blend of Pinot Noir and the rare local César grape is as light as red wine can get in Burgundy. This northern region close to Chablis produces bright fruity expressions that attractively balance red cherry flavor with racy acidity. Drink now.,87,Simonnet-Febvre 2014  Irancy
"Rich, soft and luscious, this bottling shows ripe black cherry, caramel, crème brûlée and a tinge of herbs on the nose. It's creamy, dense and smoky once sipped, with baked plum and blackberry-pie flavors laced with vanilla and caramel, proving undeniably delicious and certain to please many palates.",91,Niner 2013 Heart Hill Vineyard Estate Grown Syrah (Paso Robles)
"Saffron and honey accent juicy tropical mango and pineapple aromas in this vibrant yet delicately framed ice wine. The palate is elegantly nuanced with hints of candle wax, herbs and crushed stone; savory spice notes linger on the finish.",87,Leonard Oakes 2011 Ice Wine Vidal Blanc (New York)
"Bristling in acidity and steely in wet stone, this SB is crisp and layered in lemon, with more lemon on the finish. It yearns for shellfish.",88,Ousterhout 2013 Redwood Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Alexander Valley)

"Winemaker: Boela Gerber. This is rich and oaky upfront, with forward scents of honeydew, orange creamsicle, pineapple cake and vanilla bean. Those notes carry through to the medium-bodied palate, alongside notes of wood-grilled peach and toasted walnut that are carried along by a bright seam of orange-flavored acidity. Some time in the cellar will allow the oak to further integrate with the ripe fruit tones; drink 2018–2022.",92,Groot Constantia 2015 Cape Winemakers Guild Auction Chardonnay (Constantia)
"This fresh white wine from Mt. Etna offers pristine aromas of honey, peach cream and white mineral. Lasting notes of brimstone and slate give the wine added dimension and you will surely imagine a natural pairing with seafood or shellfish risotto.",90,Le Vigne di Eli 2007  Etna
"A little too hot and brawny in tannins, which provides a cut across the palate that interferes with pleasure. If you can get past that, the wine is nicely dry and rich in fruit, with cherry, tobacco, spice and oak flavors.",86,Mounts 2007 Estate Grown Cabernet Franc (Dry Creek Valley)
"A zesty nose promises refreshment and poise. The palate not only keeps this promise but tops it. Orange, mandarin and lemon frame riper peach and Mirabelle plum explode like a firework of fruit on the palate. This is fruit-framed, citrus-focused joy, combining immense concentration with immense elegance. There is a long and exciting life ahead of this.",96,Franz Hirtzberger 2013 Singerriedl Smaragd Riesling (Wachau)

Perfect for summer drinking.",89,Viña Casablanca 2011 Nimbus Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"One of a series of releases by this Port producer, this Colheita, or Port from a single harvest, is beautifully poised between red fruits and mature almond and an old gold character. It has intensity, a product of the aging in wood that has just concentrated the wine. Like all Ports of this type, it is ready to drink.",95,Taylor Fladgate 1968 Single Harvest  (Port)
"Sweet, rich, dense, very much of its year. At the same time, there is the Barton touch that leaves some fine elegance, to go with the smoky fruits and richness, while acidity gives it a fine lift.",91,Château Langoa Barton 2003  Saint-Julien
"Violet red in the glass, this wine features a bouquet of cherry, violet and vanilla. Flavors of cherry, blueberry, anise, ground black pepper and green bell pepper are fixed in a framework of tannins that offer full mouthfeel right into the orange peel finish.",91,Pelter 2013 Matar Petit Verdot (Jerusalem Hills)
"One of the smallest crus, Saint-Amour produces firm and structured wines. This Sélection shows both rich black fruit and solid tannins that are typical. Over the next six months, it's likely the fruitiness will become more dominant.",87,Georges Duboeuf 2011 Sélection  (Saint-Amour)
"Racy acidity and oak-inspired lemon, lime and tropical fruit flavors mark this bone-dry, elegant wine, with a minerally edge. Don't drink it too cold.",87,Windsor Oaks 2012 Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This is a thick and savory wine, compressed and somewhat flabby on the palate. A curious nose takes time to develop into full-bodied black cherry and blackberry.",85,Wattle Creek 2013 Grenache (Russian River Valley)
"One of several Pioneer Block Sauvignons now coming out of St. Clair, the 2008 Snap Block leans toward the pungent side of Sauvignon Blanc, with aromas of crushed tomato leaf leading the way. The flavors are decidedly herbal, but, backed by a solid underpinning of citrus fruits, the results are zesty and refreshing.",88,Saint Clair 2008 Pioneer Block #18 Snap Block Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Aromatic hints of creamy stone fruit swirls about the nose. There are hints of Mirabelle plums and yellow pear but on the palate very fine, smoky and exquisitely integrated notes of French oak appear. There is rich vanilla and cream but with a counterpoint of fresh, bright lemony acidity. While stylistically unusual this barrique-aged Grüner certainly is a delicious, creamy and serious wine. You'd never even guess it's already four-years-old. Ready now but will evolve. Drink 2016–2022.",92,Laurenz V. 2012 Four Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"The dominant dark-cherry aroma smells bitter and high pitched. The palate feels supple and medium bodied, and it tastes a touch confected, like blackberry jelly used to fill donuts.",82,Ingleside 2007 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Virginia)
"A very light, almost rustic red that calls for hearty meals. A sonorous note of vanilla-oak amid the cherryish red fruit accompanies the streamlined acidity from start to finish.",89,Bründlmayer 2012 Reserve Zweigelt (Niederösterreich)
"The flavors of sweetened herb tea, pineapple and buttered toast mark this fresh, vibrant young Chardonnay. It's brisk in acidity and dry in the finish. A bit rustic, it's a fine wine to drink now.",86,Sojourn 2012 Campbell Ranch Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"Part of a series of sparkling wines from Piera Martellozzo, this is a blend of Raboso and Pinot Nero. In fact, the wine's bright pink color comes from the former varietal and its delicate floral bouquet from the latter.",86,Piera Martellozzo NV Perle di Piera Pink Pearl Rosé Sparkling (Delle Venezie)
"Barolo Conca opens with inky dark concentration and soothing aromas of black fruit, spice, cola, plum, prune and dried lavender buds. The nose presents those ethereal and delicate aromas, but in the mouth, it delivers thicker flavors of chocolate and mocha. Drink after 2018.",94,Renato Ratti 2007 Conca  (Barolo)
"Lime leaf, white peach and mineral aromas rise up from the glass, with botrytis adding a grace note. The spritzy stone fruit flavors are off dry and show spot on balance.",89,Charles Smith 2014 Kung Fu Girl Riesling (Ancient Lakes)
"Ripe Concord pear and an intriguing, phenolic mouthfeel combine in this highly drinkable light white. There is enough weight to support food and a pleasing hint of savoriness as well as depth.",90,Hugl-Wimmer 2013 Wimmer Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"A big, complex wine from this continually improving property, this is now performing at its classed-growth level with concentrated ripe berry fruits and chocolate flavors. The wood aging is still showing through and needs time to integrate better, but as it does, this will be a great wine.",95,Château Bélair-Monange 2010  Saint-Émilion
"Winemaker John Kinney blends 50% Cabernet Sauvignon from Galles Vineyard with 50% Del Arroyo Vineyard Petite Sirah, trying to take advantage of the Cab's floral, herbal notes and the Petite's concentration and wall of tannins. He has largely succeeded. This dark-black wine is very much full of intense cherry and structured tannins and leathery spice. Petite Sirah lovers will particularly swoon.",88,Occasio 2009 Sotto Voce Red (Livermore Valley)
"Made from Moscato di Canelli, this dessert wine is more like a still wine in bouquet, not exuding sweet as much as floral. On the palate, it's a different story, taking on richness and thickness around flavors of baked apple and nutmeg, finding a good balance on the finish.",88,Benessere 2013 Estate St. Helena Vineyard Moscato (Napa Valley)
Montagny is at the southern end of the Côte Chalonnaise before it merges into Mâcon. That gives this wine its warmth and ripe apple and peach fruits. It is crisp and fresh at the same time with great juicy acidity. The wine has a spicy aftertaste. Drink now.,87,Vignerons de Buxy 2014 Buissonnier  (Montagny)
"At 20g/L of residual sugar, this is sweet enough to work well with spicy dishes, like many curries. Green apple, peach and pineapple flavors show a fine balance of ripeness and acidity on the long, mouthwatering finish.",89,Mt. Difficulty 2014 Roaring Meg Riesling (Central Otago)
"An attractively fruity wine, this is rich in cherry and light spice flavors and is laden with acidity. It has a dry set of tannins, but it is so densely juicy that it is ready to drink now.",89,Clos de Haute-Combe 2011  Juliénas
"This Tuscan blend of 85% Sangiovese, 7% Ciliegiolo, 5% Canailo and 3% Malvasia opens with aromas of underbrush, oak and a whiff of farmyard. The palate is tired. While you can detect black cherry, plum, black pepper and espresso, the fruit is starting to fade, leaving astringent tannins unsustained by fruit richness.",84,Castellaccia 2008 Riserva  (Morellino di Scansano)
"Tangy and zesty, this crisp wine shows a strong sense of chalky terroir, with a mineral edge and tight acidity. These elements mean the wine will take time to age. Drink from 2021.",91,Bouchard Aîné et Fils 2015 Le Porusot Premier Cru  (Meursault)
"This wood-aged wine conveys mint aromas and new-wood flavors. It is rich, full in the mouth and developing quickly. The black currant fruitiness is fresh, giving a delicious, juicy wine to drink from 2016.",87,Les Hauts de Tousquiron 2012 Cuvée Lucie  (Médoc)
"Whatever the Jackson family does in Santa Maria works quite well, including this wine. The wondrous nose shows chives, exotic pears, mandarin pith, sesame seeds, a touch of smoke and chalky grip. On the palate, flavors recall fried green apple peels, lemon juice, quince, star fruit and lemon pith.",92,Kendall-Jackson 2013 Jackson Estate Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"Deep and hearty black cherry, vanilla, cola and black-pepper aromas make for a lush, imposing and yet classic nose on this bottling. It's simultaneously soft and powerful on the palate, with black-cherry foam, crème de cassis, vanilla custard and melted milk-chocolate flavors set against a backbone of vibrant acidity and plush tannins. It's a decadent mouthful.",92,Peachy Canyon 2014 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)
"Creamy vanilla and pear pie provide a fleshy and full-bodied texture to this wine, which leans tropical in guava and melon. Aged in entirely neutral oak, the fruit shows well within a wave of ripeness.",87,Sanglier Cellars 2014 River Tusque Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"Pale salmon colored, this is a straightforward summer sipper with notes of cherry, watermelon, and wet stone. It drinks dry with a hint of effervescence and tart flavors.",85,Waterbrook 2012 Rosé Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a fat, soft and smooth wine. It has juicy red fruit and acidity, with light tannins that lend support. It's ready to drink.",84,Terre de Vignerons 2016 Le Phare Merlot Merlot (Atlantique)
"Red plum and scratchy, herbal aromas form a decent bouquet. This Cab is modest and edgy in feel, with equally raw and edgy red-berry flavors that finish quick and punchy.",84,Acordeón 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Smoky flint and crushed mineral tones contrast concentrated raspberry and strawberry flavors in this richly concentrated rosé. Full bodied and supple in texture, it's sturdy enough to accompany heartier fish and fowl dishes far beyond the summer months. Sunny acidity brightens the finish.",88,Lamoreaux Landing 2015 Dry Rosé (Finger Lakes)
"This is roasted, savory and spicy up front, with solid berry aromas. It feels crisp and fresh, with a blend of cherry, strawberry and herb flavors. It's spicy, lively, fresh and clean on the finish.",87,Vaza 2008 Crianza  (Rioja)
"This is a perfumed wine. Although the tannins are still firm from 14 months in new oak, it does have fine, fragrant red-fruit and acidity. The texture is dense, still young, and will be fine from 2019.",87,Château Tertre de Belves 2014  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux
"This ripe and soft wine has a great balance between the rich red berry fruits, bright cherries and acidity. The structure is full, generous and gives the wine a comfortable feel. Acidity at the end lends a fresher aspect. Drink from 2017.",88,Domaine Parigot 2013 Les Peuillets Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune)
"This is classic in herbaceous aromas and flavors, rich in juicy blackberry and blueberry while also offering savory pencil shavings and dark chocolate. Leathered, firm tannins complete the picture, providing structure and integration to a wall of well-managed oak.",90,Arrowood 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
Zippy acidity drives this dry medium-bodied Riesling. Its fresh green-apple and lime flavors are delicate in concentration but refreshingly crisp. Drink now through 2020.,87,Barnstormer 2015 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Scents of roses and cherries fill the nose, followed by raspberries and light milk chocolate in the mouth. There's a suggestion of wet stone also. The balance is good, although the wine skirts the edge of being a bit too thin on the finish.",87,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2011 Tualatin Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"All the parts of this juvenile wine have not begun to come together. You have ripe, jammy blackberry, cassis and blueberry flavors, firm tannins, evident new oak, and crisp acidity. All they need is time to marry. The wine is 100% Cabernet, and the grapes used to be vineyard-designated by Beringer. Cellar until at least late 2008, and the wine should improve for many years.",91,Corley 2004 State Lane Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville)
"The slightest touch of wildfire kicks off the nose, followed by aromas of hibiscus, light cranberry, dried rose petal, roasted pork shank and white pepper. It's quite light upon first sip, then a peppery intensity builds as flavors of underripe raspberry, fresh thyme and dewy oregano arise. For a lighter style of the grape, it's a classic, and stays fresh for days.",94,Chanin 2014 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"Hints of honeycomb and beeswax add heft to the notes of fresh green flower and sweet citrus. Ripe yet elegantly composed, this has concentrated fruit flavors that extend onto a long, honeysuckle-kissed finish.",88,Penguin Bay 2011 Pinot Grigio (Finger Lakes)
"Very laid back, the nose shows some mango and pear, but you really have to go looking for them. In contrast, the palate is almost pushy–this is a big, fat intense wine. Essentially quite simple, but very tasty. Short to medium finish.",85,Il Falchetto 2006 Tenuta Del Fant  (Moscato d'Asti)
"Flashy and flamboyant, but smells and tastes overoaked, with buttered toast, caramel and vanilla meringue notes swamping the underlying tangerine, lemon and mango fruit. Drink now.",86,Dutton Estate 2009 Dutton Palms Vineyard Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Gentle friendly notes of yellow mirabelle plum play on the nose. The palate is equally fruity and appetizing, chock-full of fruit and freshness. Drink soon.",88,Dopff & Irion 2015 Cuvée René Dopff Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
"A pretty peachy color, this bottling, which is 100% Mourvèdre, shows an intriguingly salty strawberry hint to the nose, where dried cherries and brisk watermelon aromas also pop. There is zesty acidity to the sip with richness in the midpalate, offering flavors of sea-salted peaches, orange-rind tang and impressive length for a rosé.",90,Liquid Farm 2015 Vogelzang Vineyard Rosé (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
"Fairly tannic, this Merlot has some ripe, even sweet, cherry fruit. It's done in a light style, but it feels and tastes ripe, which means the winemaker knew what he was doing. A lovely effort that takes full advantage of the character of the region's fruit. —P.G.",88,Ste. Chapelle 2000 Winemaker's Series Merlot (Idaho)
"Reduced and extracted, with 10% Syrah blended in, this big-boned wine imparts big tannins around a taste of boysenberry, strawberry and tobacco.",87,Meeker 2013 Barrel Select Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"Squeaky-fresh lemon and lime shine a spotlight against sweet melon and stone fruit flavors in this gossamer-textured spätlese. It's dancingly delicate, yet deeply penetrating on the palate, finishing on lingering notes of hazelnut and white flowers.",93,Schloss Johannisberger 2013 Grünlack Spätlese Riesling (Rheingau)
"Nice manners and medium body make this an easy-drinking, lighter wine. The aromas are like cherries and strawberries, the fruit flavors are almost sweet, and the texture is soft and smooth.",86,R35 2013 Zinfandel (Lodi)
"Lovely aromatics mix floral, fruit and barrel components in equal proportion. The wine has some solid tannins, and sits in the mouth with a bit of gravitas. Wild cherry, raspberry, fresh herb, and a little stiffness to the finish. Definitely a wine to age a few more years.",89,Bethel Heights 2008 Flat Block Estate Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Like the label says, this is an everyday sort of wine. It's crisp in acids and off-dry, with pleasant orange, pineapple, lemon and vanilla flavors.",84,Dreaming Tree 2012 Everyday White (Central Coast)
"Solid fruit brings firm, taut black cherry and cola flavors to the front. This is a muscular, flavorful, somewhat blocky wine that brings Pinot Noir up to burger wine status—and you may take that as a compliment. Some barrel toast adds butter and almond to the finish.",89,Kason 2006 Black Label Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"The 10% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend adds extra muscle to this toasty, sleek wine. It's light but polished, with pretty scents and flavors of rose water and raspberries. The generous acidity of the grape keeps it lively and fresh.",88,Novelty Hill 2011 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Chopped mint, menthol, blue flower and red berry aromas take the lead in this wine. The taut palate offers Marasca cherry, raspberry, star anise and ground clove flavors alongside fine-grained tannins.",90,Rivetti Massimo 2014 Froi  (Barbaresco)
"There is already a hint of tawniness to this wine (second bottle— first was TCA-infected) that suggests a short life ahead. It's charming at the moment, surprisingly far along the aging curve, but with pretty cherry fruit and some sandalwood in the tannins. Drink up.",85,Longplay 2009 Lia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"With fruit from the Aube and from the Côte des Blancs, Drappier has been able to put together a blend of Chardonnay from four different vineyards. In taste, warmth dominates—this is not a hugely crisp wine, the richness prevailing. But the warm pear and peach flavors all come together, a wine that is in the Drappier pure fruit style.",88,Drappier NV Quattuor Blanc de Quatre Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)
"This soft and fruity wine is crisp, fragrant and fresh. It has light acidity that balances with the forward apple flavor, as well as a dry lime edginess and nervy texture. Drink now. Screwcap.",86,DFJ Vinhos 2012 Paxis Branco Arinto (Lisboa)
"Shows some notes of mold or vegetables, marring an otherwise fine wine. It's pale in color, dry and crisp in acidity, with a beautifully silky texture and flavors of cola and cherries.",83,W.H. Smith 2008 Umino Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Named after the series of vineyard terraces that rise steeply from the Lot river, this wine is soft and easily accessible. It does have the Malbec structure although this is comfortably balanced by the black fruit and acidity. The wine will be ready to drink from 2017.",85,Rigal 2014 Les Terrasses Malbec (Cahors)
"Lots to like in this Cabernet, which has ripe, juicy flavors of blackberry, plum, dark chocolate and flashy oak. Made thoroughly in the modern style, it's marked by soft tannins and a certain uniformity. Drink now.",87,Emblem 2008 Oso Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A soft, open wine, kept together by its dry tannins. Good black fruits, fresh acidity and an attractive smoky character.",85,Château Monroze 2008  Bordeaux Supérieur
"Ripe berry, black cherry and leather aromas come together nicely in front of a creamy palate with just enough acid-tannin tension. Lightly herbal, spicy blackberry flavors are savory rather than dark and fruity. The wine tastes spicy and peppery on a finish that feels right.",89,Catania 2014 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"Made from Cold Creek and Wahluke Slope fruit, this pure Syrah is compact and dense, and it reveals blueberry and boysenberry flavors that are set in a frame of coffee-flavored tannins. The acids are suggestive of lemon verbena, and the 15.5% alcohol shows a little heat in the the throat.",89,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2009 Ethos Reserve Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Several varieties figure into this blend, from 26% Zinfandel and 21% Syrah to smaller amounts of Merlot, Petite Sirah, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon. Big and powerful in smoky leather and black currant, it offers a rich softness on the palate, with a tightly wound savory, peppery aspect to the finish.",90,Roth 2012 Heritage Red (Sonoma County)
"A very nice wine for drinking now with roasts and Italian fare. It's a light- to medium-boded wine, marked by cherry, red currant, bacon and spice flavors brightened by a bite of acidity.",87,Sausal 2007 Estate Grown Sangiovese (Alexander Valley)
"Stony polished white-fruit aromas are lean and clean. This brut nature shows modest heft as it expands on the palate, but mostly this is racy and fit. Yeasty flavors of white pepper and lime finish with a leesy note and stoniness.",89,Cave Geisse 2013 Brut Nature Sparkling (Pinto Bandeira)
"Stainless steel-fermented and kept on the lees for two months, this new vintage still feels a bit dilute—a function of the low brix and difficult vintage. Pungent with scents and flavors of rosemary and citrus, it is best drunk chilled and young.",86,Walnut City WineWorks 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"Fermented in stainless steel, this is a crisp white with decent acidity that traffics in pomelo, white fig and peach fuzz. It stays light in style and refreshing before finishing with a somewhat diluted feel.",87,Napa Cellars 2014 Classic Collection Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
88–90. Barrel sample. This dry wine is balanced by a dark concentration of juicy fruit. It has enough density of both black fruit and dry tannins to promise good aging.,89,Château Coufran 2012 Barrel Sample  (Haut-Médoc)
"Aromas espresso, toasted oak and a whiff of exotic spice lead the nose while the evolved palate shows mocha, oak and a note of dried black cherry before a rather abrupt finish. It's shy on freshness and lacks the fruit richness needed to stand up to the dominant wood sensations.",87,Gianni Gagliardo 2009 Preve Riserva  (Barolo)
"Maybe a little more ripe and heady than some of its Chilean buddies, but this SB from Montes offers freshness, zip and good citrus, tarragon and other green-herb flavors. The feel is good, the character fresh, and the finish long and clean. Offers maybe a little more green-leaf character than some might like, but overall this is another fine value SB from Chile. Drink immediately.",87,Montes 2007 Classic Series Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca-Curicó Valley)
"A fairly standard Chardonnay, rich in oak, lees and ripe citrus and tropical fruit flavors, but raised up by brisk acidity and a fine minerality that gives it extra complexity. It's rich with honey and brown sugar, but doesn't feel cloying.",86,Icaria 2012 Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"Freshly baked bread, toasted hazelnut, yellow apple, ginger, subtle oak and vanilla are some of the sensations conveyed by this sophisticated sparkler. Made from 100% Chardonnay, it boasts a remarkably refined mousse and bright acidity. It also has great length and a crisp, dry finish.",91,Ferrari 2006 Riserva Lunelli Chardonnay (Trento)
"Coffee, beef stock, blackberry and graphite aromas require patience to process. A lively, ringing palate is jammy at its essence. Dark, toasty flavors of blackberry and blueberry are mildly green and herbal. It feels rubbery on a tannic finish.",89,Finca Flichman 2015 Paisaje de Tupungato Malbec (Mendoza)
"Ripe, rich and creamy, this is a dense wine from the lees aging. Spice and a touch of toast come from the wood aging that smooths the wine and gives it extra complexity. This is a rich wine, with a tangy aftertaste, that is ready to drink.",88,Borges 2015 Reserva White (Douro)
"Bursting with sweet toast from the barrel aging, this offers ripe and pretty berry fruit, deep and long, with highlights of oolong tea. The alcohol is not intrusive, and the acidity keeps it buoyed and lively.",95,Sequel 2008 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Made in limited quantities by consulting winemaker Paul Hobbs, this is 100% varietal from a single vineyard, aged entirely in new French oak. Soft and malleable tannins manage its tangy, succulent blue fruit, supporting all that full-bodied ripeness and girth.",92,Black Cordon 2012 The Black Cordon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Dating back to the early Middle Ages, the estate is based around an ancient chateau. The wine, from old vines, is structured and dense with firm tannins and ripe black-plum fruits. It shows fine acidity at the end. Drink from 2019.",88,Château Roustaing 2016 Vieilles Vignes  (Bordeaux)
"This opens with soft, bright fruit nuances of raspberry and crème de cassis and a smooth, polished quality of tannins. It finishes with a warming earthy tone of wild mushroom.",90,Fratelli Casetta 2007 Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"Reserved green apple, lees, flower and mineral aromas lead to off-dry green apple and stone fruit flavors. The acidity gives the palate some snap.",89,Savage Grace 2014 Underwood Mountain Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Gorge (WA))
"This Priorat-like blend of 50% Grenache, 28% Syrah, and 22% Mourvèdre is pungent and spicy, with a bit of menthol in the nose. Supple and luxurious fruit, a mix of raspberry and black fruits, baking spices, sweet barrel flavors. Powerful and rich, this is a big wine with tobacco and clove highlights and a little heat in the finish.",94,Gramercy 2009 The Third Man Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"From the family behind Bosquet des Papes in Châteauneuf, this is a solid Côtes du Rhône, with modest tannins but decent structure and typical notes of leather, dried cherries, chocolate and cinnamon. Drink it over the next few years.",87,Domaine Nicolas Boiron 2008 Red (Côtes du Rhône)
"Aromas of citrus, white stone fruit and a vegetal hint suggesting tomato leaf lead the way. The racy palate offers grapefruit, pineapple, fresh white peach and flinty mineral while a pleasantly bitter note closes the finish.",90,Cottanera 2015 Bianco  (Etna)
"This wine is soft, fruity, rounded and red fruit flavored. Soft tannins and black plum skins give the wine a light structure. The wine is developing well and will be ready to drink from 2016.",87,Casca Wines 2014 Cascas Winemaker Selection Red (Douro)
"This bottling blends 60% Monterey County, 23% Santa Barbara County and 17% Sonoma County fruit to deliver bright and juicy berries on the nose, from strawberry to blackberry as well as graphite and tree bark. The flavors are very full, with more berries and star anise, although the texture is somewhat simple.",88,Meiomi 2016 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County-Monterey County-Santa Barbara County)
"This multigrape blend opens with spicy aromas of baked plum, tomato and cumin. The mouthfeel is fresh and dry, with focus. In terms of flavors, it's earthy, with baked berry, baking spice and licorice notes. The finish is smooth and earthy tasting, with roundness. Drink now through 2016.",90,Marques de Griñon 2007 + Summa  Varietals Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon-Petit Verdot Red (Dominio de Valdepusa)
"Pleasant and tasty, this has the raspberry, lime, dough and smoke flavors typical of a fine California sparkling wine. It's a little scoury, especially by the standards of Iron Horse, with a sand­papery roughness to its bubbles. Drink it now, well chilled.",86,Iron Horse 2007 Classic Vintage Brut Sparkling (Green Valley)
"Sweet and simple, with sugary flavors of blackberry and cherry jam and smoky vanilla. Almost like a dessert wine.",82,Cupcake 2007 Merlot (Central Coast)
"A bold white wine, it smells and tastes like grapefruit, canteloupe and very crisp apples. It has a fresh, acidic texture that cleans the palate and makes the mouth water, but wraps in enough richness for good balance.",87,Steven Kent 2013 Lola Sauvignon Blanc (Livermore Valley)
"Well-rounded and integrated strawberry, black plum and licorice aromas show on the nose of this appellation blend from Paso Robles' most exciting Italian variety producer. It's light and easy on the palate, with red plum, cranberry and chaparral herb flavors packed tightly with tannin. It's good now but will improve with age.",90,Giornata 2014 Sangiovese (Paso Robles)
"This wine is from the home vineyard of the Larochette family. It has produced a ripe, still young wine that is full of yellow fruits. Hints of butter and vanilla add a rich dimension to this full-bodied wine. Drink now.",88,Domaine Fabrice Larochette 2015 Le Château de Chaintré  (Mâcon Chaintré)
"This blend is made with 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot—all Conner Lee fruit. Firm and supple, it's loaded with raspberry and cherry fruit that goes deep and stays balanced. One-quarter new French oak was used.",92,:Nota Bene 2010 Conner Lee Vineyard Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Despite being an Extra Dry Prosecco Superiore, this shows more dryness than it does sweetness. The finish is tonic and firm, with notes of white flower, peach and honey.",87,"Foss Marai NV Strada di Guia, 109 Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)"
"Just off-dry, this is a smooth, caramel and red fruit flavored wine. It has plenty of acidity to balance its soft texture, with red currant freshness coming in at the end. Drink now.",86,José Maria da Fonseca 2014 Periquita Rosé (Península de Setúbal)
"Spicy, fruity and nicely rounded, this wine boasts great flavor intensity without the sharp points sometimes associated with Montepulciano. It's an easy, approachable wine perfect for everyday dining with solid tannins and good length.",86,Masciarelli 2003  Montepulciano d'Abruzzo
"Boysenberry, cherry and a touch of minerality take over the nose on this wine from Mike Rennie and Gary Winder, who are pioneering grape growers of the Temecula Valley. Tar and tobacco pair up with bright acidity and smooth oakiness on the palate, making for easy drinking.",87,Leoness 2011 Lopez Ranch Vineyard Selection Zinfandel (South Coast)
"This starts off sweet and unctuous, with scents of superripe nectarine and apricot that flood the bouquet, followed by hints of baking spice, lightly toasted nuts and honey. The full, round texture is balanced by refreshing acidity that carries through to the long, bright finish. Drink now–2016.",90,Fleur Du Cap 2010 Noble Late Harvest Bergkelder Selection White (Stellenbosch)
"Made from organically farmed grapes, this is a simple Merlot for everyday fare. It offers a pretty fragrance of red berry and white pepper accompanied by raspberry, cherry and red currant flavors with a hint of pepper.",85,Pizzolato 2012 NSA Merlot (Veneto)
"From the Evergreen Vineyard, in the Ancient Lakes region north of the Wahluke Slope, this is surprisingly high-powered, at 13.9% alcohol, with a big smack of oak in the nose. That oak is wrapped around green banana and green apple fruit, with a little vanilla on the side. As young as it is, it seems likely to knit together and improve over the next year or two.",88,Milbrandt 2009 Evergreen Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Vibrant aromas of lychee, white flowers and spice give way to off-dry fruit flavors, with the concentration seeming a bit light. Still, it delivers a lot of appeal.",88,Pacific Rim 2015 Twin Vineyards Gewürztraminer (Yakima Valley)
"Pear drop, leafy arugula and faint lemon form the aromatic trio that governs nose and palate of this light, refreshing white. Drink soon.",87,Höpler 2014 Grüner Veltliner (Burgenland)
"Amarone sometimes benefits from a tiny dash of volatility (that usually comes across with aromas that resemble red apple or cider), but in this case those notes have turned to apple sauce and ultimately distract from the overall picture. The wine is chewy and bright in the mouth with firm tannins.",85,Pietro Clementi 2004  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"Grainy oak and green aromas rest on top of generic red-fruit scents. This feels chunky, blocky and tannic, with herbaceous medicinal flavors of tomato, oak resin and green herbs. A spicy saucy-tasting finish holds onto the wine's minty green herbal essence.",84,Loscano 2010 Gran Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Luján de Cuyo)
"This 100% varietal wine hails entirely from Hyde Vineyard, a meticulously farmed and magical site. With a rich nose leading the way, it shows dusty licorice and chocolate plum. Voluptuously well crafted, it finishes in a lengthy tinge of baking spice.",93,Duckhorn 2013 Merlot (Carneros)
"Ripe raisiny aromas are soft, maybe to a fault. This feels wide, grabby and modest in structure. Jammy raspberry and raisin flavors finish plump and easy, with low acidity. Drink now.",88,Ardales 2011 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"The nose is tightly closed, yet there is the suspicion of fine fruit. The grippy palate brims with peppery dark-plum fruit and very fine distinct tannins that give this a taut, rigid frame that still needs to relax. This is unusual in so far that it is a Cabernet Franc from Austria, grown on slate. It works well: The tannic structure and fruit are fully expressed. This needs bottle age and will blossom into a far more relaxed and fruitful wine. Drink 2020–2030.",92,Gunter Triebaumer 2014 Gillesberg Cabernet Franc (Burgenland)
"Hints of anise, black pepper and toasted coconut make this dark, smoky Merlot a bit exotic and unexpected. Full-bodied with a concentrated yet vibrant black fruit palate, it ends with flair on a rather tropical coconut finish.",87,Keswick Vineyards 2009 Merlot (Monticello)
"Here's a big, lush Cab, appealing now for its jammy blackberry, cherry, currant and chocolate flavors. But the tannins make for an unsettled astringency that needs rich meats to cut through. Fine now with complex beef dishes, but better after 2010.",88,St. Clement 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Firm tannins mark this as a wine for aging. At the same time, the sweet and ripe fruit gives weight and richness. Wood flavors just creep in to round out the tannins at the end. Keep for 7–8 years.",90,Château Fonréaud 2006  Listrac-Médoc
"The wine has fine, juicy fruit over smooth tannins. Its smoky flavors, touches of wood aging and rich tannic structure are integrating well. It will be ready to drink from 2020.",90,Château Baracan 2015  Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux
"A unique version of Andrew Will's Champoux, this is more than half Cabernet Franc, with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot filling in the rest. Thick and tannic, yet perfectly ripe and almost silky, it coats the palate with black cherry, graphite, slate and a bit of chalk. All that said, the fruit more than holds its own against the terroir's minerality. Drink this with your best steak, and give it plenty of breathing time.",95,Andrew Will 2007 Champoux Vineyard Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Structured wine with 30% of Cabernet to give shape to the very ripe Merlot. The wine has both acidity, some firm tannins and a concentrated, dry core. It's likely to age well over 3–4 years.",85,Domaine de Courteillac 2010  Bordeaux Supérieur
"Already delicious, this wine shows its wood aging with such finesse, while letting its elegant white-fruit flavor come through. It has an herbaceous edge, rounded out with a more ripe fruit character. This is meant for aging.",93,Château Latour-Martillac 2009  Pessac-Léognan
"Soft and rounded, this has an attractive fresh-fruit character. It's warm with a yellow fruit flavor; a crisp touch of grapefruit tempers the richness.",86,Pierre André 2010 Réserve  (Bourgogne)
"Beautiful savoriness rises from the glass—pepper and yeast, but also something of pine and watercress. The palate swings with all of these flavors and embeds them on a rich cushion of gentle fruit: ripe yellow pear and juicy yellow plum. The white pepper always edges its way in and tempers the generosity of the fruit. This simply is gorgeous and very moreish.",94,Eichinger 2015 Ried Lamm Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"Generous fruit flavors of strawberry preserves are the focus of this full-throttle Pinot Noir. Stone fruits and anise, along with a butterscotch vein from barrel aging, add further interest. Drink this over the near term.",89,Vista Hills 2009 Skyraider Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Dusty cedar and Bourbon-barrel notes dominate fruit on this unusual blend of New York Blaufränkisch and California Valdiguié, Petit Verdot and Syrah grapes. It's a delicate, wispy wine, with faint streaks of crisp red cherry and plum, but it finishes warmly on a vanilla spice note.",85,Cereghino Smith 2012 Super Hudson Red (America)
"Tight and earthy, this spent 18 months in French oak—30% new. Flavors of wild berry and light chocolate are set in a tightly wound wine, with a strong mineral accent and drying tannins.",87,Foris 2008 Siskiyou Terrace Cabernet Franc (Rogue Valley)
"Passion fruit, citrus and other nice aromatics make for a pretty nose, which is followed by genuinely good and correct flavors such as grapefruit, lemon and citrus rind. The finish is also quite nice, with a certain roundness and acidity that makes it tantalizing and tasty.",89,Bernardus 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey)
"This charming red opens with aromas of woodland berry and violet. The savory, easy-drinking palate offers plum, black cherry, a hint of spice and a smoky note alongside soft, polished tannins. Enjoy soon.",87,Val di Botte 2013  Chianti
"This tiny production Chardonnay shows the hallmarks of Edna Valley. It's bright and brisk in acidity, very clean and dry, and classically pure in lime, kiwi and papaya fruit. Bring on the Dungeness crab and buttered sourdough bread and enjoy.",90,Tolosa 2010 Edna Ranch Block 569 Chardonnay (Edna Valley)
"Initially this smells closed, charred, oaky and minty more than lush and fruity, but with airing things get reversed. The palate is rich, ripped and juicy, with excellent structure. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, spice and reedy tobacco finish dry, powerful and with a strong note of licorice. Drink through 2020.",92,Losada 2010 Altos de Losada Mencía (Bierzo)
"Tan in color, with stale aromas of apple cider, this feels simple, like fruit juice. Plain and straight, this tastes sour and spent, while citric flavors mix with tart apple notes on the finish.",81,Bodegas Aquitania 2014 Bernon Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"This 100% Grenache pink wine kicks off with a fairly light nose that shyly presents steely aromas of lemon wedge. There is a firm structure to the sip, where pink grapefruit and other citrus elements ride a chalky structure. Texture is key here.",88,Archium 2015 Rosé (Santa Barbara County)
"Subtle scents of white flower and peanut shell meld with core aromas of tropical fruits. The palate feels viscous and open knit, and the residual sugar makes for a clingy finish.",84,CrossKeys 2011 Ali d'Oro White (Virginia)
"This blends estate-grown Wädenswil and Dijon 115 clones into a briary, open and forward expression that accents its core of cherry fruit with a dash of cola. It lightens up as it finishes but remains nicely balanced and layered, with subtle hints of chicken stock.",90,Fairsing 2015 Dardis Pinot Noir
"Green notes reminiscent of tomato leaves accent fig and melon flavors. It's only medium in body, but comes across as otherwise ripe in style, with a medium-length finish.",88,Astrolabe 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Pale gold-colored wine from an exceptional vineyard. The warmth of the volcanic soil gives richness to the fruit while still keeping some feeling of dryness. It has weight, dried spice and pepper. Honeyed fruits show right at the end. Drink from 2014.",93,Domaine Schoffit 2009 Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Clos Saint-Théobald Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc offers aromas of red and black berries, bell pepper and cedar. The palate delivers concentrated blackberry, cherry, chocolate and spice. It has rich flavors but lacks freshness and energy.",88,Pratesi 2009 Carmione Red (Toscana)
"Give this gorgeous wine a few more years in the bottle so that the evident oak tones become tame and supple. You can count on the wine's aromas of cherry, blackberry and plum to carry it forward. At this young stage, however, those oak shadings are too evident and the wine is in its infancy. Drink after 2012.",91,Feudi di San Gregorio 2005 Serpico Aglianico (Irpinia)
"Soft and smooth around the edges, this Rhône-style red blend is made mostly from Grenache and is nevertheless assertive in its earthy, spicy aromas and baked fruit flavors. The texture feels polished while the fine tannins and acidity keep it firm enough to be appetizing.",88,Sol Rouge 2012 Gypsy Rouge Red (Red Hills Lake County)
"Dried apple skin, lemon peel and jasmine aromas make for a pleasant nose in this widely available screwcap bottling. The palate is tangy, with sour orange notes accenting its more rounded stone fruit flavor, making for a solid weeknight sipper.",86,Las Palmeras 2014 Chardonnay (Monterey County)
"Superripe Grenache gives this fortified dessert wine (16% alcohol) distinctly chocolaty overtones, but there's also an overripe note of prunes. Despite that, it doesn't pack the alcoholic punch or massive weight of Port, making it relatively easy to drink, with an affinity for chocolate desserts.",86,Les Clos de Paulilles 2005 Rimage  (Banyuls)
"Lightly aromatic, it offers notes of pencil shavings, dark fruit, coffee and pepper. It's medium bodied with a lower alcohol feel and abundant coffee flavors backed by gritty tannins.",87,Reustle 2012 Prayer Rock Vineyards Winemaker's Reserve Syrah (Umpqua Valley)
"This wine is lush, with aromas of cassis, lavender and kirsch enveloped in wafts of church incense. Bright cherry and violet meld with velvety tannins and delicate acidity. The finish is long and full of cedar and botanicals.",89,Veramar 2015 JB Winemaker Series Merlot (Virginia)
"This entry level cuvée is finished with a screw cap, and pulled from a mix of barrels and clones from across the estate. It's forward, fruity and big, like an especially bold Beaujolais. Along with primary berry fruit there are light touches of pine needle and chocolate. It's full bodied and ready to go with your winter meal's roasted fowl.",90,WillaKenzie Estate 2014 Gisèle Pinot Noir
"The wines from this remote ranch off of Jalama Road combine mossy forest-floor touches with dark hearty aromas, in this case showing pine, rust, juniper, thyme and purple fruit on the nose. The texture is grippy, and there is cranberry fruit in the background, but the palate's attention turns mostly to eucalyptus, dark spice and even tobacco toward the finish.",93,JCR 2014 Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
"Jumpy, bright berry and currant aromas come with a scent of wet dog fur. This is fresh but shallow, with simple, lively cherry and plum flavors. On the finish, this is easy and friendly but it evaporates quickly.",87,Zuccardi 2013 Serie A Santa Rosa Bonarda (Mendoza)
"For being one of the more widely available Chardonnays around, this vintage performs strongly against more expensive wines. Pineapple, vanilla and light caramel aromas lead the nose, while vibrant acidity kicks off the palate. Pear, Gala apple and pineapple flavors make it a reliable weeknight sipper.",88,Edna Valley Vineyard 2015 Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"Black cherries, turned loam and black slate swirl into a standard nose for this winery's workhorse bottling. It's quite tasty on the palate, with blackberries and boysenberries finding complexity amid licorice, slate and black dirt.",89,Jaffurs 2012 Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"Tannic and concentrated, this is a powerful wine from its first moment. Ripe perfumes confirm the wine's richness, while acidity and density show strongly. Power and concentration match big berry fruit and finishing acidity.",95,C. da Silva 2011 Dalva Distinctive Vintage  (Port)
"A fruity, juicy wine with balanced tannins and red fruits. It is a lively perfumed wine that has some toasty tannins in the background. Drink this ripe wine from 2019. One of five wineries owned by Bernadette Faure and Alain Aubert; their daughters oversee vineyards, winemaking and marketing.",90,Château German 2014  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux
"Exciting, fresh and full of spicy, toasted undertones, this wine immediately calls for a food pairing of a richer seafood (think oysters, crab) or poultry. The flavors are balanced and buoyed by crispness, but the wine still offers complexity and a lingering finish.",87,Lamoreaux Landing 2006 Estate Bottled Reserve Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"A single vineyard wine, with light soil producing a fruity style of Riesling, fragrant and fresh. It has currant and spiced pear flavors, with a bright texture. It is ready to drink.",87,Jean Becker 2009 Lerchenberg Riesling (Alsace)
"Black cherry to the eye, this wine has a bouquet of raspberry and Mediterranean herbs with a strong note of lavender. It is well-crafted, with flavors of cherry, blackberry, smoked meat, thyme and black pepper. Silky tannins line the palate, and the finish offers a burst of cranberry and pomegranate.",92,Yatir 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Judean Hills)
"Robust black-fruit aromas of berry and cassis come with a mild animal note and leathery scents. This is jammy and a bit loud in terms of mouthfeel, while flavors of raisin, berry and chocolate finish meaty and loamy. Drink  through 2017.",90,Campo Alegre 2011  Toro
"This dessert-style wine is very fruity, quite sweet and boosted in alcohol. It has a spicy, earthy aroma, lots of plum and prune flavors, a rich mouthfeel and lingering finish.",88,Shenandoah Vineyards 2013 Black Muscat Muscat Hamburg (Amador County)
"A barrel-fermented Chardonnay with creamy texture, this opens with bright, prominent Meyer lemon notes before delving into softer flavors of pear and vanilla on the midpalate. The acidity holds through to the finish, accented by a touch of honey.",90,B.R. Cohn 2011 Sangiacomo Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros)
"The Loureiro is the grape of the Lima Valley subregion in Vinho Verde. The texture of the wine is rounded and creamy, although the crisp green fruits give a great bright lift to this delicious, fresh wine.",90,Quinta do Ameal 2009 Loureiro (Vinho Verde)
"Pinay is a tight and defined red blend from northern Italy with bright accents of cherry cola, forest berry, licorice and dark mineral. There's a sharp, sour note on the close that would pair with smoked cheese.",87,Attilio Ghisolfi 2007 Pinay Red (Langhe)
"Probably the best wine we've tasted from Santos Beck. This has a jammy, meaty nose accented by hard spices, while the palate is creamy and a touch brambly. Coffee, pepper and tannins work the finish. Drink now.",85,Santos Beck 2004 Gran Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Concentrated black fruit flavors are pleasant but obscured by generous oak treatment and slightly confectionery flavors of cherry vanilla and mocha chocolate. Hints of tree bark and green, vinous flavors peep through cream and vanilla notes on the midpalate.",84,Hudson-Chatham 2010 Field Stone Old Stones and Old Vines Baco Noir (New York)
"Leafy underbrush, scorched earth, tobacco, vanilla, toasted oak and spiced plum aromas lead the nose. The smooth palate offers crushed black cherry, game, grilled herb, espresso and cooking spice. Firm, fine-grained tannins provide support.",90,Cecchi 2011 Riserva di Famiglia  (Chianti Classico)
"Great structure on this Cab, with firm tannins and a fine hit of acidity. It's ripe and appealing with black cherries, cherry liqueur, vanilla and oak. Already throwing significant sediment, it should continue to evolve in interesting ways for a few more years.",90,Windsor Oaks 2008 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Chalk Hill)
"The wood that dominated during the futures tastings in 2008 has calmed down, merging more easily into the rich fruits. There is an attractive smoky character, focused berry flavors and delicious spice. It should age well over 3–5 years.",91,Château du Tertre 2007  Margaux
"Ripe notions of juicy peach and yellow pear rise from the glass. Around the edges they have an aromatic touch of grapefruit zest. That zesty notion remains a constant fixture on the very rich medium-sweet palate, countering the luscious richness of the fruit which shines with honeyed peach, juicy pear and ripe tangerine. It is the zestiness that frames everything on this rich powerful palate. This is lovely now but it has all the fruit and concentration to age well. Drink 2017–2037.",94,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Hengst Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Possibly too rich, this is a full, sumptuous wine. It has great weight, density, a smooth, wood-aged character that shows through the sweet plums. For what it is, a very rich wine that shows some pepper alcohol—it offers a juicy character and ageability. Drink from 2016.",86,Château Canteloup 2010  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux
"Nectarine and white peach aromas are pithy, pointed and briny like sea water. This feels citrusy and pulpy, while zesty citric flavors of grapefruit, scallion and green herbs finish with residual pithy briny notes.",86,Mas Igneus 2013 Barranc Dels Closos White (Priorat)
"Forest floor, truffle, baked plum, eucalyptus and baking spice unfold on this structured red. The linear, elegant palate offers dried black cherry, clove, ground pepper and tobacco framed in polished, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2020.",90,Tenuta Villa Trasqua 2008 Nerento Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"A barrel fermented Chardonnay that is uncharacteristically soft and fruity. Aromas of bananas and bubble gum lead to slightly sweet, uncomplicated flavors. The texture and body are light.",80,Campus Oaks 2012 Chardonnay (Lodi)
"From a vineyard planted ni 1909, this is a soft, dusty Carignane swirling in acidity, bright red fruit and spice, among McCay Cellars' first forays into Rhône-inspired wines. Lightly textured and restrained in alcohol, it's wonderfully elegant.",90,McCay Cellars 2011 Carignane (Lodi)
"Earthy aromas of roasted red plum blend with scents of latex and cured meat on a jumbled nose. Like any Rufete, this feels drawing and rubbery, with choppy tannins. Flavors of tomato, currant and red plum are tart and narrow on a drawing finish.",85,La Zorra 2014 Teso de la Media Fanega Rufete (Sierra de Salamanca)
"Sourced from the family's Animo Vineyard atop Atlas Peak, this Cab comes from the highest-elevation blocks on the vineyard, some 1,350 feet up. Ripe plum fruit flavors surround savory elements of black tea, the structure well-honed and age-worthy through 2020–2025.",91,M by Michael Mondavi 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"The Gaiole in Chianti area of Chianti Classico tends to produce some of the most traditional and pure expressions of Sangiovese, so Tangano is aged for 18 months in oak to add a spice note and to soften the tannins. The wine opens with prune, dark fruit, leather and tobacco tones.",88,Cantalici L'Antica Fornace di Ridolfo 2008 Tangano Red (Toscana)
"A little too sweet, this has candied flavors of lemon, lime and vanilla. Brisk acidity provides balance, but it would be better if it finished drier.",84,Clif Family 2011 Rte. Blanc Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Has that pure appellation fruit taste of ripe green apples and sweet pears, framed in crisp acids. Feels bright and delicious in the mouth, accented with oak notes of vanilla and smoke. A creamy texture lends allure. This rich, hedonistic wine instantly appeals to the senses. Editors' Choice.",90,Ledson 2001 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Despite the broad appellation, South Coast fruit seems to dominate in the tropical fruit aromas, accompanied by a generous dose of spicy, vanilla-tinged oak. Similarly tastes very ripe and fruity, although has noticeable sweetness.",85,Kendall-Jackson 1998 Vintner's Reserve Chardonnay (California)
"Open and flattering, as are many of the 2000s, showing a dose of smoky, toasty oak layered over buttered nuts, honey and peach. Turns more citrusy on the finish, with tangerine and mineral notes lingering gently. Quite oaky, but has the depth of fruit to support it.",91,Louis Latour 2000 Le Referts  (Puligny-Montrachet)
"This pure, supple, fruit-laden Syrah is loaded with wild blackberry fruit, and detailed veins of licorice, coffee, and iron filings. The wine's excellent length and polished tannins showcase exceptional handling of superb fruit.",93,Syncline 2010 McKinley Springs Vineyard Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills)
"90-92. Barrel sample. A rounded rich wine, showing the juicy fruit of the year along with rich tannins. It is spicy, lively and impressive.",91,Château Citran 2011 Barrel Sample  (Haut-Médoc)
"With much of the freshness of 2006 now evolved into more mature flavors, this balanced if somewhat stalky wine has fine perfumed black currant fruit flavors, with a firm core of tannins and wood aging.",85,Château Hyot 2006 Cuvée la Fleur Tabenot  (Côtes de Castillon)
"This two-region Zin is from Atlas Peak and Amador County. It shows a really great Zin quality in the leathery spiciness that accompanies the berry flavors, and in the smooth, polished tannins. Amador seems to bring wildness, while Napa brings elegance. The result is a great Zinfandel at a great price.",91,Villa Mt. Eden 2004 Grand Reserve Antique Vines Zinfandel (Napa-Amador)
"Dusty, earthy berry aromas veer toward raisiny. This is 80% Tempranillo and the rest Cabernet Sauvignon. In the mouth, it's mostly smooth and voluminous; flavors of ripe, earthy cherry and plum finish dry and peppery. Drink this mature Andalucian wine now.",87,Al Zagal 2008 Rey Zagal Red (Vino de la Tierra Altiplano de Sierra Nevada)
"This is Knoll's flagship wine, from the Dürnstein Schütt vineyard. It is powerful, intense stuff, a roll-call of ripe flavors, even in the difficult 2007 vintage. The wine brings out spice, yellow fruits, fresh apple skins and peppered grapefruit. The extra element is the complexity that goes deep into flavors that need to develop over several years.",93,Emmerich Knoll 2007 Ried Schütt Smaragd Riesling (Wachau)
"A wine that appears almost too delicious at this stage. Through the black fruit and sweet tannins, the texture is immediately attractive. However, there is a dense structure behind this open exterior that should see it age well.",93,Château Branaire-Ducru 2008  Saint-Julien
"Hints of smoke, crushed mineral and pollen lend an earthen dimension to pristine white grapefruit and tangerine in this elegant off-dry Riesling. Juicy citrus flavors are satisfying and thirst quenching, accentuated by zesty acidity and a pleasant touch of astringency on the finish. Drink now through 2021.",90,Baron Knyphausen 2013 Charta Kabinett Riesling (Rheingau)
This no-fuss Valpolicella delivers light cherry and almond flavors. It's a wine to pair with a late-evening ham sandwich or with Chinese food.,84,San Cassiano 2010  Valpolicella
"The dense nose of this bottling intrigues as it unleashes dense blackberries, graphite, slate and a touch of licorice. The palate is tightly wound, with pomegranate, elderberry and tart plum enhanced by fennel, bay leaf and an aromatic lift on the finish. Bottle age will improve this wine immensely.",92,Tantara 2014 Lindsay's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"The underlying wine is thin in fruit, so what stars is oak, with its toasty, caramelized aromas and flavors. It's also fiercely tannic. You'll find some briary blackberries and blueberries, but the wine illustrates why Petit Verdot is best used as a blender.",86,Trinchero 2007 Central Park West Vineyard Petite Verdot (St. Helena)
"A concentrated and toasty raspberry flavor permeates the light- to medium-bodied palate, which is endowed with crisp acids.",83,Sutcliffe 2012 Rosé (Colorado)
"A new addition to the popular Indian Wells line, this consists of 60% Merlot, 28% Syrah and splashes of five other grapes. The Merlot, not surprisingly, dominates. Pretty and round, it has a soft, almost pillowy texture, with an easy, accessible mouthfeel.",88,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2010 Indian Wells Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Somewhat rugged and astringent now, with a bite of acidity, but it's an enormously rich wine, with blackcurrant and chocolate flavors. Best now with grilled meats. A Bordeaux blend based on Malbec.",86,Paoletti 2008 Piccolo Cru Red (Calistoga)
"Herbal aromas of tomato, spice and red plum are a fair announcement of what's to come, namely a sharp, acidic palate with sizzling plum and raspberry flavors. Blazing acidity and little body make for a long, tart finish.",82,Michel Torino 2014 Coleccion Pinot Noir (Calchaquí Valley)
"Fermented in a mix of stainless steel barrels and neutral oak barrels, this was fermented with native yeast and given sur lie aging. It went through 100% malolactic fermentation, which has softened the mid-palate, a mix of lemon, grapefruit and Satsuma orange. There are still traces of phenolic bite, but those citrus rind flavors have been well rounded also, though this carries some heat in the finish.",88,Coelho 2009 Renovação Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"Aromas of lemon-lime, jasmine and honeysuckle prepare the palate for crisp, clean flavors of lemon zest and lemon curd.",87,Minkov Brothers 2011 Le Photographe Rheinriesling Riesling (Thracian Valley)
"Pretty and polished Pinot, with a light, delicate mouthfeel and good varietal flavors. Offers waves of cola, red licorice, cherry pie and sandalwood. Notable for its attention to detail, and could even develop over the next six years.",88,Ancient Oak Cellars 2010 Siebert Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Blueberry, graham cracker and mild herbal notes define the nose on this high-altitude Malbec from Chile. The palate is rich and a bit zingy, with jammy density and mountainous flavors of boysenberry, blueberry and toast. A pure and zesty finish is the right ending to this dark, lusty Malbec.",90,Luis Felipe Edwards 2010 LFE900 Malbec (Colchagua Valley)
"From 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay, the tirage on this sparkling brut took place in 2008, the late-disgorgement in October 2013. The time in bottle has given it a honey-baked edge, sensibly dry, with highlights of baked apple and dried apricot.",88,Chandon 2007 Late Disgorged Vintage Brut Sparkling (Yountville)
"Part of a range of wines that showcases the different styles of Portugal's regions, This wine is smooth, creamily textured and with a warm ripe character. It has pineapple and mango as well as crisper lemon flavors to give a rich wine that is still poised and finely balanced. Drink now.",85,Wines & Winemakers 2016 Azul Portugal White (Palmela)
"Lightly herbal and slightly earthy aromas meet fresh, ripe berry flavors in this medium-bodied wine. It's smooth and soft in texture, low in tannins, and easy to enjoy.",86,Josh Cellars 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Almost instantly identifiable as a Napa Valley Cabernet for its classic black currant and cassis flavors, wrapped into sturdy tannins, and finished with acidity. The fruit is ripe and sweet, with an edge of green olives, yet the finish is thoroughly dry, with a complex spiciness. Drink now through 2020.",90,Napa Valley Cattle Company 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Hard, cool-climate aromas of asphalt and black olive are offset by stewy, savory notes. This Syrah is chewy and tannic in feel, with herbal, roasted flavors that suggest marginal ripeness. Earthy berry and salty flavors carry the finish.",86,Leyda 2012 Single Vineyard Canelo Syrah (Leyda Valley)
"An overt and attractive toasted-oak aroma leads to assertive, smoky, buttery flavors in this traditional reserve-style California Chardonnay. Full bodied, it pulls out all the stops for a grand expression of pear, toasted almond and nutmeg flavors that are backed by ample acidity.",90,Matchbook 2015 The Arsonist Chardonnay (Dunnigan Hills)
"The closed nose gives away very little, just the barest whiffs of yellow flowers. The one-dimensional palate offers fleeting sensations of tart apple and hints of green melon and lemon zest.",85,Corte Moschina 2012 Roncathe  (Soave)
"A vibrant pink hue in the glass, this rosé has nice ripe fruit aromas of wild strawberry and fresh cherry that follow through to the juicy, red fruit-dominating mouth. Round and full, the rich mouth could use a bit more cut.",86,Le Cirque 2010 Rosé (Vin de Pays des Côtes Catalanes)
"Chumash tribe descendent and Fresno State-trained winemaker Tara Gomez uses her extensive experience to make a solid lineup of wines. This one holds dense aromas of boysenberry extract, Dr Pepper, toast, condensed cedar and beef char. Elderberry is the dominant fruit flavor, showing both woodiness and dark purple fruit.",91,Kitá 2012 Camp 4 Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Layered and medium in weight, this is a well-crafted, concentrated wine from an exceptional vineyard site in the cool, southeastern reaches of Napa Valley. The rich pineapple and coconut is tempered by crisp acidity, finishing in caramel-accented oak.",94,Venge 2013 Maldonado Vineyard Dijon Clones Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"This is minty and light, with a soft texture and red cherry tones. The finish turns overtly earthy, even barnyard-like.",81,Chime 2011 Pinot Noir (California)
"This Two Blondes is the best ever—powerful and ripe, with a plush mix of raspberry and strawberry fruit, tart and tangy and mouthfilling. This wine has a huge midpalate, but doesn't stop there; as it slowly winds through a full-throttle finish, threads of chocolate, coconut, caramel and coffee appear. The flavors go on for several minutes.",94,Andrew Will 2007 Two Blondes Vineyard Red Wine Red (Yakima Valley)
"Made entirely with Sangiovese and without any added chemical sulfites, this wine leads off with earthy aromas of wet soil, leather, fragrant blue flower and red berries. The one-dimensional palate opens with sour cherry accented with a hint of cinnamon-spice alongside chewy but fleeting tannins. It's a bit diluted and finishes abruptly.",86,Terre di Melazzano 2012 Riscoperto  (Chianti Classico)
"This wine is rich, full of dark fruits and dusty tannins. It has a solid structure with ripe black fruits and concentration. Wood aging and a dry edge have given the wine a core that will allow it to age. Drink from 2018.",87,Parras Wines 2014 Montaria Reserva Tinto Red (Alentejano)
"This white blend is composed of 60% Chardonnay, 20% Sauvignon Blanc, 10% Riesling and 10% Gewürztraminer. It has aromas of lemon, mint and white peach, with flavors of green apple and white peach.",87,Bulgariana 2012 White (Thracian Valley)
"Smoke, toast, mesquite and barbecue tones emerge from the nose of this nicely concentrated Barbaresco from La Spinona. There's not much fruit here as the wine's aromas are mostly occupied by the secondary perfumes acquired through wood aging. Expect those to evolve and become more ethereal with time.",89,La Spinona 2007 Bricco Faset  (Barbaresco)
"Aromas of raspberry and blue flower open this lovely wine. The juicy palate offers ripe marasca cherry while cinnamon and white pepper add depth. This isn't very complicated, but who cares—the delicious flavors and smooth tannins make it an absolute joy to drink. Not an ager so enjoy soon.",89,Fattoria di Magliano 2012 Heba  (Morellino di Scansano)
"Sourced from a high-altitude vineyard near the top of the Awatere Valley, this wine shows some of the leafiness characteristic of the region. The fruit is more roasted root vegetable than tree fruit, with a potent savory and fairly muscular character.",86,Jules Taylor 2009 Ballochdale Estate Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
"Plump mulberry, asphalt, lavender and cola aromas power the good though slightly curious nose on this wine from a renowned vineyard. The distinctive palate is very aromatic and violet-like, with strong fennel elements alongside boysenberry and herb-laced cherry cola flavors.",90,Seven Angels 2010 Denner Vineyard Syrah (Paso Robles)
Organically grown grapes in an old field-blend vineyard make a juicy wine that is dominated by red fruits. It has structure under the red berry flavors and the acidity. It is still a young wine and shouldn't be drunk until 2018.,87,Secret Spot Wines 2014 Vale da Poupa Field Blend Biologico Red (Douro)
"A big-production, medium-bodied effort, this has noticeable sweetness that softens the acidity. Sweet apple and pear fruit dominate an easy-drinking, approachable, simple but enjoyable Pinot Gris.",87,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2014 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"Dry, minty and spicy, with cool, lightweight berry and cola aromas. The palate is fairly light and easy, with lean red-fruit flavors, dry spice and a creamy tasting accent. Spice more than fruit carries the finish. Pedestrian wine that's competent.",84,"Baron de Escal 2009 Tempranillo, Garnacha, Mazuelo  (Rioja)"
"Considered the flagship of the century-old Sella & Mosca fleet, this edition of 100% Cabernet Sauvignon disappoints. The supporting structure is fine, but the cherry fruit present on the nose and palate is too lean. The finish is short, too. This highly regarded wine is just not showing well at this time. Tasted twice with consistent notes.",84,Sella & Mosca 1995 Marchese Di Villamarina Cabernet Sauvignon (Sardinia)
"Pineapple, sulfur and matchstick, and finally some woody toast steer the bouquet. The palate is big and blowsy, with toasty baked apple and pineapple flavors. Finishes sweet, with honey and a sprinkle of white pepper. Yet another sweet, resiny, basic Chardonnay from Chile.",84,Santa Carolina 2009 Reserva Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)
"Squeezed lemon rinds and pith, wound up wet concrete notes, a touch of toasted almond and a slight show of nectarine flesh comprise the nose of this bottling. Classic Cali Chard buttery notes lead the sip, with ripe stonefruit, sea salt, caramel and jasmine, uplited by a decent acidity.",87,Byington 2014 Wrights Station Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Production from 41 acres of land donated over more than a century to the Hospices of Lyon produces an attractive and aromatic wine. It is full of light, juicy fruit and fresh red cherries. Drink this refreshing wine now.",85,Domaine des Hospices Civils de Lyon 2014  Beaujolais-Villages
"A six-barrel reserve selection, this offers a notch or two more depth and density than its companion Bayliss-Bower Vineyard designate. Along with the soft and sultry fruit flavors comes a cavalcade of barrel-generated details: baking spices, toasted coconut, caramel and salted peanuts.",94,Ghost Hill 2012 Prospector's Reserve Pinot Noir
"From a small north-east facing vineyard in the Vallée de la Marne, this ripe, soft, generous wine also has great intensity. It is full and concentrated, with pear and apple fruits allied to touches of bitter almonds, wood and fruit. It's a vintage that could age, although it is just right to drink now.",93,Tarlant 2003 La Vigne d'Or Extra Brut Pinot Meunier (Champagne)
"The aromas are up front, with barrel notes of char, vanilla, coconut and baking spice followed by cigar box. The wood really shows through on the palate as well, with the tannins bringing a strong sense of astringency.",86,Castillo De Feliciana 2013 Reserve Red Wine Tempranillo (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"High-toned apples and pears and a grassy, herbal note scent this unique blend of Croatian and international grape varieties. Deep gold in color, it's a savory wine with a bruised apple palate, but an interesting pick for everyday.",83,Bibich 2008 Riserva R5 White (North Dalmatia)
"Soft, fruity wine, with an earthy character. The wine has acidity and red fruits with a final fresh burst of ripeness. Not for aging, drink now.",85,Quinta do Crasto 2008 Crasto Red (Douro)
"Expanding on their fathers' legacies, the cousins Jean-Laurent and Jean-Dominique Vacheron have a deserving reputation for their almost-Burgundian Sancerre. This latest vintage, packed with both fruit and structure, shows why. It is ripe with red cherries and dark plums laced with acidity. The wine is full of great ripe fruit and generous tannins. Drink from 2018.",92,Domaine Vacheron 2015  Sancerre
"Soft, rich fruit, with layers of plum, cherry, berry and accents of toast and vanilla. Smooth, seductive style, plenty of acid, good balance and the fruit is pure, clean and ripe all the way to the lingering finish.",91,Steele 1998 Catfish Vineyard Zinfandel (Clear Lake)
"This is an approachable, lightweight Sauvignon Blanc with upfront tropical fruit aromas. The mouthfeel is clean and mild, while flavors of white grapefruit and lime finish sweet and easy, alongside notes of dried pineapple and mango.",85,Santa Rita 2013 120 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley)
"Stalky smoky aromas open a wine that is spicy, smoky from wood and full of red fruits. The wine is light with acidity as well as a layer of crisp tannins. Drink this from 2018.",86,Domaine du Petit Bondieu 2015 Vendôme Cabernet Franc (Bourgueil)
"Punchy, grassy aromas of citrus and tropical fruits capture most of what's good about coastal Chilean SB. This feels angular, fresh and minerally, with flavors of tangerine, lime, lemon and grapefruit. A tangy, lasting finish is pure Leyda.",89,Luis Felipe Edwards 2015 Marea Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley)
"This unoaked Chardonnay is marked by quite crisp acidity, as the malolactic fermentation was prevented. It's the opposite of opulent, a flinty wine with hints of Meyer lemons and Kaffir limes. Try with shellfish.",87,Wente 2006 Eric's Small Lot Chardonnay (Livermore Valley)
"Cute packaging belies the surprising depth to this Riesling. It's remarkably balanced, with an array of mineral, floral and fruit dimensions. Juicy, with preserved peach flavors and zippy lemon acidity, it's a thirst-quenching, solid pick from the Pfalz.",89,Blue Fish 2012 Sweet Riesling (Pfalz)
"). Phillip Zull's offering in the light, fresh Grüner Veltliner stakes is as light and fresh as they come. It's a burst of fruitiness across the palate, starring bright citrus and green fruits, with bone-dry acidity. Screwcap.",87,Zull 2010 Lust & Laune Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"The fruit has veered somewhat funky and stewy here, giving the wine a soft, lean quality that struggles to share its quiet undertones of cherry and vanilla.",85,Rutherford Grove 2009 Pestoni Family Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"A pungent Viognier, with aromas of oranges and apricots, and an appealing accent of English breakfast tea. The fruit flavors are almost Riesling-like, but fatter and rounder.",87,Illahe 2010 Viognier (Oregon)
"A pure-tasting wine, this has a mineral character, tight, balanced acidity and lemon and white-fruit flavors. One of the rare white wines from the Côte de Nuits, this has power and a toasty element.",91,Domaine Bruno Clair 2010 En la rue de Vergy  (Morey-Saint-Denis)
"A very strong wine of superior tannic and acid structure. You can feel the pedigree in your mouth, smooth, elegant and luscious. The fruit is as ripe as it might be. The flavors are earthy and tobaccoey, and the wine turns astringent on the finish.",86,Crane Family 2000 Don Raffaele Estate Merlot (Napa Valley)
"This fine producer, based in Morgon, has made a rich and structured wine. With its perfumed red-berry fruits and balanced acidity, it is a savory wine that is ripe and ready to drink.",89,Domaines Dominique Piron 2015  Beaujolais-Villages
"Here's a light, spicy, pretty red wine, mixing juicy and sweet plum and purple grape flavors with plenty of acid. You might pick up hints of tobacco, a little white pepper; the acids keep the wine fresh and the fruit is youthful and vibrant.",87,Abacela 2006 Umpqua Cuvée Tempranillo (Southern Oregon)
"This wine is brooding, with aromas of dark cherry and game. The palate boasts bold fruit and savory flavors along with slightly bunched-up tannins.",88,Hedges 2013 Descendants Liégeois Dupont Les Gosses Vineyard Syrah (Red Mountain)
"This quirky medium-bodied wine has a flavor spectrum all its own. It smells floral and tastes like spiced red candy, and is noticeably sweet.",81,One Hope 2013 Pinot Noir (California)
"A new offering made entirely from estate fruit, this is a selection of the best blocks and barrels of the vintage, with its core component being 90% Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon. The remainder is Zinfandel. Together they provide black color and a whiff of bay leaf and peppercorn, around well-integrated layers of black cherry, vanilla and black tea.",90,Paraduxx 2012 X2 Estate Red (Napa Valley)
"Fragrant notions of orange peel accompany the red apple freshness. This has ample apple and orange fruit at the core, along with a pure, lemony zestiness that pulls everything taut and into focus. Full of life and tension, the wine makes you want to sip and sip again.",90,Joseph Fritsch 2014 Riesling (Alsace)
"This wine is a blend of Merlot (58%), Cabernet Sauvignon (36%), Cabernet Franc (5%) and Petit Verdot. Vibrant aromas of cherry meats, raspberry, dried herb and barrel spice are followed by a fruit-forward flavorful palate backed by firm tannins. It has a high yum factor.",93,DeLille 2014 D2 Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This Reserve Series bubbly accents its crisp green apple fruit with toasty aromas. Done via Méthode Champenoise, it spent five years en tirage. There's a fine bead and lingering persistent flavors with hints of nutmeg and lemon curd. All in all, this is a very fine effort.",90,Seufert 2011 Blanc de Noir Sparkling (Willamette Valley)
"An unusual combination of flavors that are searingly tart and yet seem to have a sugary core, this is scented with honeysuckle and orange blossom, and opens out quickly into a fruitbowl of ripe, tangy flavors. Apples, pears, oranges, candied lemons, even a hint of papaya are all in the mix. But be ready for some tongue-tangling acidity.",88,Cathedral Ridge 2008 Riesling (Columbia Valley (OR))
"Intense tropical fruit aromas take the lead. The ripe, juicy palate offers banana, pineapple, grapefruit and white peach alongside lemon zest and mineral. Adding balance, refreshing acidity gives way to a clean, lingering finish.",89,Fattoria La Rivolta 2012 Falanghina (Taburno)
"Young Hunter Valley Sémillon is one of the most perplexing wines to evaluate, and I suspect that in 8–10 years' time, my rating will seem overly stingy. Still, this light-bodied wine appears to lack depth, complexity and length, offering just some odd, resiny scents and waxy, citrusy flavors.",83,Pepper Tree 2006 Reserve Semillon (Hunter Valley)
"Fruity, juicy wine, with some acidity pushing through the light structure. It is attractive, with a tangy, spicy edge.",86,Quinta de Ventozelo 2008 Vintage  (Port)
"There is a vividly refreshing nose to this biodynamic wine, full of aromatic lift from brisk stone fruit and white rock minerality. It's full on the mouth, nicely balanced with no edges sticking out at all, and just a tad of tart apple on the finish.",89,Demetria 2012 Cuvée Papou White (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Meaty, smoky aromas and good, high-amplitude fruit flavors give a robust personality to this full-bodied, dry and firmly tannic wine. It will make a good pairing with pasta, roasted birds or grilled meat.",90,Andis 2012 Cooper Ranch Barbera (Amador County)
"Scents of vanilla and baking spices frame bold raspberry fruit on the nose, while the flavors take a more savory turn, toward mocha and grilled meat. This is full bodied and maybe even a touch warm, but it works, ending long and plush. Drink now–2025.",93,Lambert 2013 The Commitment Shiraz (Barossa Valley)
"Fermented and aged in stainless steel, this is aromatic, with notes of ripe peach, melon and honeysuckle. It's full bodied, somewhat viscous in feel, carrying considerable alcoholic warmth.",85,Abacela 2013 Estate Grown Viognier (Umpqua Valley)
"There is good density of fruit tannins here, boosted by wood. The wine has dried fruit, spice, perfumed blackberry and lively acidity. It could well age for 1–2 years.",89,Domaine du Grand Bouqueteau 2006 Réserve  (Chinon)
"Generous, abundant, ripe fruit flavors and a tasty touch of spicy oak make a fine combo in this medium-bodied, plush-textured wine. With repeated sips the fruit flavors taste even more intricate and interesting. The texture firms up nicely due to fine tannins and welcome acidity. While tempting to drink now, this will be best after 2018.",93,Failla 2013 Savoy Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Rather light, easy-to-enjoy aromas suggesting fresh strawberry and raspberry, along with equally fruity flavors don't indicate how full-bodied and high-octane this wine is. Still, it has a smooth texture and lingering finish.",86,Iron Hub 2013 Esola Zinfandel (Amador County)
"Beautifully pure notes of crisp Cox's Orange Pippin apples shine on the nose. The palate is equally tart and wonderfully refreshing. This is a high-wire act of freshness and stony depth. You think you can almost taste the stone underneath all of these beautifully expressed apple notes that are pervaded by zesty freshness. What an invigorating, lip-smacking finish. This is lovely now but will develop. Drink now through 2030.",93,Maurice Schoech & Fils 2014 Kaefferkopf Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"Soft, fresh, just off dry, a fruity wine that is light and fragrant. Crisp acidity cuts through the wine, giving a tight, nervy edge along with bright fruitiness.",85,Cave de Cleebourg 2011 Riesling (Alsace)
"Very ripe pear fruit is dangerously close to tipping over into cloying richness, almost hinting at cream soda. The palate is less overwhelming. As always, that special streak of Alsace acid saves the day.",88,Kuentz-Bas 2014 Tradition Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"This generously structured wine is rich in tannins and fine, ripe black fruit. Its structure and juicy acidity will allow it to age well. Drink from 2020.",90,Château de Ricaud 2015  Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux
"Humo Blanco means “white smoke,” and the name applies to the daily morning fog that spreads over the Lolol area where this comes from. Leathery, earthy aromas of cherry and plum are ripe, while the palate is tannic and rubbery. Earthy cherry and plum flavors finish lasting and potent.",86,François Lurton 2013 Humo Blanco Gran Cuvée Pinot Noir (Lolol Valley)
"Not very expressive, this shows subdued aromas that recall coconut, toasted oak, espresso and raw, red berry. The palate delivers red berry, licorice, mocha and vanilla alongside mild tannins. It's already surprisingly accessible. Drink 2015–2020.",89,Domenico Clerico 2010 Briccotto  (Barolo)
"Markham has been a reliable Petite source over the years, and succeeded even in the difficult '98 vintage. Rich blackberries and blueberries are dusted with black pepper. The one indication of a tough year is the dry, tannic finish, but it should work fine with a rare steak. —J.C.",88,Markham 1998 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley)
"This will be a wonderful wine. Already, it is fine, with lovely acidity, bright and richly sweet at the same time. Yellow fruits mingle with honey, pear, almonds and the intense sweetness of botrytis.",97,Domaine Huët 2010 Le Mont Première Trie Moelleux  (Vouvray)
"Mazzocco's style has settled into high alcohol, in this case 15.8%, sweet, jammy pie-filling fruit flavors, and soft tannins. If this is the kind of Zin you enjoy, it's for you.",82,Mazzocco 2006 Maple Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"Savory and deep given the price, with dark color, obvious ripeness and even a touch of vanilla and mocha on the nose. Round in the mouth and immensely fruity, with plum and berry flavors blending with vanilla. Textured and medium-long on the finish. Good for everyday quaffing, especially in the cold fall and winter months.",86,Riscal 2006 Riscal 1860 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)
"This famous site was planted in 1972 by Dick Erath, and the 44-year-old vines deliver an aromatic, elegant yet substantive bottle of Pinot. It's a complex mix of wild berries, cherries and chocolate, showing the generous flavors of the vintage. Delicious already, it's got the power and presence to age gracefully through 2023.",93,Vidon Vineyard 2012 Maresh Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Not quite as distinctive as some of the other 2009 Block offerings from St. Clair, this is nonetheless a solid wine, exhibiting gently leafy nuances layered over pick grapefruit and melon flavors. It's mainstream in style, not overly heavy, with a crisp, refreshing finish.",88,Saint Clair 2009 Pioneer Block 1 Foundation Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"A ripe, pure wine of red fruit around a core of toast, dominated by vital acidity and an edge of dry tannins. The wine is linear, finely balanced, fruity and exuberant.",91,Domaine Jacques Prieur 2008 Champs Pimont  (Beaune)
"This wine shows the riper, spicier side to German Pinot Noir. Lush black cherry and plum flavors are fleshy and dense on the palate, tinged with notes of cassis and bramble. Crisp acidity adds elegance and structure, along with a penetrating layer of finely textured tannins. Drink now for its bold, decadent style.",91,Thörle 2011 Saulheimer Kalkstein Trocken Spätburgunder (Rheinhessen)
"Concentrated black plum and violet notes mesh with potting soil, cola and a candied black-raspberry character on the nose of this bottling. The palate combines boysenberry with woody elderberry fruit as well as a warmer red cherry and red-plum core, edged by pine needles, juniper and tart pomegranate complexity.",91,Cambiata 2014 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"A dark-red color, aromas like dark chocolate, flavors recalling black cherry, and a dry rather than sweet taste make this a great wine for a special meal. It has layers of fruit, a bit of smoke, and lots of fine tannins that pile up for a rich mouthfeel and lingering finish.",89,Girasole 2013 Hybrid Red Organic Grapes Red (Mendocino)
"From the northern Vinho Verde region of Melgaço which is the natural heartland of Alvarinho, this tangy, fruity wine bursts with acidity and creamed apple flavors. It is still young, a lively and fruity wine that will benefit from some calming down and broadening out. Drink from the end of 2015.",89,Wines & Winemakers 2013 Toucas Alvarinho (Vinho Verde)
"Fresh and zesty, this opens with aromas suggesting white spring flower, pear and exotic fruit. The tangy palate offers white peach, citrus and pineapple while a mineral note accents the finish.",87,Gran Passione 2015 Falanghina (Beneventano)
"This is modeled after a Rioja crianza, showing young, mixed fruits from a blend of 62% Tempranillo, 12% Graciano, 11% Merlot, 9% Cabernet Sauvignon and 6% Grenache. Showing generous acidity, hints of apple, peach, cranberry and herb, it's a fresh and fruit-driven young wine, perfect for warm weather enjoyment.",88,Brian Carter Cellars 2010 Corrida Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Full body, ripe grapy fruit flavors and a healthy pinch of spicy oak join with a smooth texture that is just slightly tannic. The feeling is mouthfilling, and the wine is dense enough with cherry and berry flavors to be satisfying. It's a blend of mostly Zinfandel and Syrah.",86,Dalliance 2012 Red (Lake County)
"Heavy, soft and a little dull, but it feels lightly silky in the mouth, and is fully dry, offering good flavors of cherries, currants and herbs.",85,Heron 2010 Pinot Noir (California)
"Bright and packed with succulent apple and pear fruit, this retains ample juicy acidity for a perfectly balanced, fresh style. With its underlying wet stone minerality, it offers exceptional value.",90,Foris 2016 Pinot Gris (Southern Oregon)
"Ripe oaky aromas of marzipan, vanilla and baked berry fruits are soft and raisiny. This blend of 40% Carignan and 30% each of Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon feels rich, saturated and smooth. Flavors of raisin, prune, spiced cherry and cheesy oak finish with a reprise of raisiny ripeness. Drink through 2018.",90,Berta Franquet 2010 Red (Priorat)
"A surprisingly tasty and well-balanced Pinot for this price category, this smells lightly spicy and ripely fruity. It feels smooth but not overly soft in texture and has lively, delicious fruit flavors.",86,Angel's Cup 2013 Vineyard Selection Pinot Noir (California)
"Meaty, earthy aromas of mixed berry fruits show a fair amount of wood. The palate is ripe and blocky, with black-fruit flavors, primarily blackberry and plum, accented by a noticeable herbal element. Toasty and spicy on the finish, this is a commendable value-priced Carmenère.",89,Santa Carolina 2013 Reserva Carmenère (Cachapoal Valley)
"Fruit and more mature flavors are coming together, giving a structured wine with black-currant flavors balanced with mint, spice and a rounded texture. This stylish wine is almost ready to drink; just wait until summer 2016.",90,Château de l'Annonciation 2012  Saint-Émilion
"This is a wine that is totally dominated by wood. So much so that there is little sign of fruit. Maybe it will integrate, but there is a question mark.",82,Maison Bouey 2011 Cuvée  (Bordeaux)
"At first taste, the tannins dominate. Then fresher fruit shows through. The wine is firmly dry, the texture linear, the fruit showing some black currant character.",87,Château Ramafort 2008  Médoc
"Smooth and generous, this wine is soft and missing any bite. It is round and unfocused, but ready to drink now.",84,Georges Duboeuf 2014 Le Clos Devouluet Durand-les-Verchès  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
"Clean, bright and focused, this is currently showing its youth, though with great promise to continue to mature and flesh out with another couple of years. Notes of yellow apple, beeswax, straw and honeysuckle abound on the nose, while flavors of orange oil and honeycomb flesh out the medium-weight palate, with great verve and lingering spicy elements through the close. It's approachable now, but should drink best from 2018–2021.",91,Hamilton Russell 2015 Chardonnay (Hemel en Aarde)
"Easy to like this softly appealing Merlot. It's a gentle wine, with a silky texture, and has candied flavors of cherries and raspberries. Pretty good price for a nice Napa Merlot.",86,Courtney Benham 2009 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Harsh and hot, with sweet and sour flavors of oranges and mint.",81,Bogle 2006 Petite Sirah (California)
The wine is velvet soft with smooth red berries and gentle tannins. It has a line in acidity along with spice and a rounded texture. Drink this lightly wood-aged wine now.,88,Henri Bourgeois 2014 Les Baronnes  (Sancerre)
"Pale orange-pink in color, this is a lightly fruited wine on the palate. Soft acidity, orange and lime fruits and a smooth, rounded texture all contribute to this open wine.",86,Château la Tour de l'Evêque 2014 Pétale de Rose Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Crisp, dry, and packed with red currants, this mineral-textured wine is ripe while also intensely crisp. Its acidity and taut character are delicious, refreshing and well in balance. The creamy mousse and lively aftertaste add to the brightness of the wine.",91,Mailly Grand Cru NV Rosé de Mailly Brut  (Champagne)
"Still quite young and showing some grapey fruit flavors, this second vintage release is bursting with purple fruit and chocolate malt flavors. Streaks of cola and a mineral-drenched finish add depth and texture.",93,Drouhin Oregon Roserock 2015 Zéphirine Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"This is downright herbaceous from front to back. Hard aromas suggest eucalyptus, black olive and sweaty leather. In the mouth, grit and high acidity provide little cushion, while herbal flavors of cherry and blackberry taste salty and baked.",82,Santa Rita 2010 Reserva Organic Carmenère (Central Valley)
"A fortified blend of Tannat and Malbec, this is a ripe and sweet, styled like a vintage Port. It has a powerful structure from the two tannic grapes in the blend, along with ripe damson fruit and spice, with acidity on the finish.",88,Lionel Osmin & Cie 2010 Estela Vintage Red (Vin de Liqueur)
"Femme is Duval-Leroy's top cuvée. This, from the great 1996 vintage, is as much wine as sparkling experience. It has great depth of flavor and a powerful steely background, with tight acidity. The grapefruit flavor is only superficial, because behind this crispness, the wine shows considerable richness.",94,Duval-Leroy 1996 Cuvée Femme Brut  (Champagne)
"Raisiny, inky aromas are ripe but not overly sophisticated. On the palate, grabby tannins are drawing and heavy. Flavors of raisin and prune carry over from the nose, while the finish is chewy, jammy, raisiny and offers a licorice/anise note.",88,Tossals 2012 Junior Red (Montsant)
"Generous and ripe, this is a wine that is finely balanced and very ready to drink. Ripe tannins, soft texture and final acidity make for an easy-drinking wine.",86,DFJ Vinhos 2014 Portada Winemakers Selecton Red (Lisboa)
"Dry and crisp, with good varietal flavors of citrus fruits and lemongrass. But this wine is also very potent in unripe, green notes that include the notorious feline component. That lowers the score.",83,Titus 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"With 4% Viognier giving this wine a distinct floral lift, it's aromatic with notes of nectarine, pear and toasty barrel spice. It's creamy, almost oily in feel, with an assortment of stone fruit flavors that carry through the finish.",88,Waterbrook 2013 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A showy nose of violet perfume and grape candy emerges from this bottling. Similar flavors persist on the palate, along with a touch of licorice. The wine is not overly complex, but it's quite easy to quaff.",88,Lusso Della Terra 2011 Sangiovese (Paso Robles)
"While the wine is soft and almost ready to drink, it does also have the Douro mineral texture and dry tannins. The Tinta Roriz (Tempranillo) dominates, giving the wine its round and rich character. Drink now or wait until 2016 for the tannins to soften further.",87,Caves Aliança 2013 Foral Red (Douro)
"Peach and yeast aromas are mostly fresh. This Xarello has a citrus-like palate with the suggestion of spritz. Melon, green banana and papaya flavors finish with mild pithy bitterness but nothing off-putting.",87,Albet I Noya 2015 XA Xarel-lo (Penedès)
"The winery continues to try to figure out how to grow Cabernet in this remote part of the county. Ripeness isn't the problem. Structure is. The flavors are upfront in blackberries, cherries and currants, but complexity and dryness remain challenges.",85,La Fenêtre 2006 Santa Barbara Highlands Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Barbara County)
"A very zinny Zin, packed with the variety's briary blackberry, anise, dark chocolate, bacon and crushed black-pepper flavors. It's the winery's best Zinfandel since the 2006 vintage.",91,Frank Family 2009 Zinfandel (Napa Valley)
"Hints of autumn leaf and bramble add rustic warmth to this delicate wine. Medium bodied, the palate is brisk with tart red cherry and berry flavors accented with soft tannins on the finish.",86,Heron Hill 2010 Ingle Vineyard Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes)
"This straightforward Verdicchio opens with subdued aromas of stone fruit and citrus. The palate is a bit lean but offers lemon and peach flavors. Bright and simple, with racy acidity, this will pair well with light seafood dishes.",86,Velenosi 2009 Querciantica  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi)
"The aromas seem a bit muddled, with notes of red fruit, herbs, vanilla and flowers. The cherry flavors are tart, with a kick of acidity on the finish.",88,Love That Red 2014 Stakes Race Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Made in the sweet, simple way, with pineapple and orange jam fruit, buttered popcorn and vanilla flavors. However, the price isn't bad, and it will appeal to a lot of your friends at parties for its California richness.",84,Mark West 2010 Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"The aromas are almost completely shut down, with light notes of corn on the cob and peach. The flavors are lightly concentrated, making it a strain to hear what they have to say.",85,Hogue 2014 Reserve Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A bit funky and gassy on the nose, and while the wine offers ripeness and sweetness on the palate, there's always a little something strange and sulfuric lingering. It has its plum and acidity, but the tannins and overall mouthfeel are grabby.",84,Martín Berdugo 2006 Joven  (Ribera del Duero)
"A 50/50 blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this brings sweet cherry flavors to the forefront, albeit with some noticeable volatility. You can taste it in the slightly vinegary finish; but that said, it's a perfectly pleasant wine with enough fruit to carry it for a couple more years.",87,Foundry Vineyards 2006 FV Red Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"A tannic, structured wine, full of rich stone fruit flavors, with the acid hints of red berry fruits. It is fragrant and ripe with some depth and intensity.",88,Domaine du Clos du Fief 2006 Cuvée Tradition  (Juliénas)
"This blend of Merlot and Sangiovese offers a bright aroma of red berry with hints of orange peel and violet. The palate delivers juicy black cherry, raspberry and black pepper flavors in a straightforward and easy-drinking style.",87,Bigi 2012 Vipra Rossa Red (Umbria)
"Solid cherry and berry aromas are smooth and appealing, while a spot of pinched leather adds character to the nose. This feels tight and good, with racy acidity leading a red plum flavor to a dry, tight finish. Nice in a no-nonsense way.",89,Viña Mayor 2008 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"Intense scents of violet and iris lead the nose of this wine, along with a whiff of woodland berry. The fresh, linear palate offers Marasca cherry, crushed raspberry, star anise and chopped herb flavors framed by youthfully assertive, fine-grained tannins and bright acidity.",92,Cigliuti 2013 Serraboella  (Barbaresco)
"This is the winery's first varietal Malbec. Estate grown at the Bella Terra vineyard, it's an exciting debut, with floral scents over vivid purple fruit, and residual flavors of cured meat, smoke and pepper. About 14% Petit Verdot has been added to the blend.",88,Ash Hollow 2005 Malbec (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Rich and thick in leathery blueberry, this Syrah from the great Carneros-based Hyde Vineyard is a study in full-bodied black licorice and dark chocolate caramel. Though bigger in style, it retains acidity and balance.",91,Mira 2010 Hyde Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley)
"Pungent and sweaty, this makes an immediate impact on the nose. That vibrancy carries over onto the plushly textured palate and electric, mouthwatering finish. A fun, flashy wine for near-term consumption.",87,Hunky Dory 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Chris Gorman's “Devil” project includes this juicy, fruity red blend, based mostly upon Bordeaux grapes. The forward cherry-berry flavors push through with some power into a chocolate-malted explosion with peppery highlights.",89,Gorman 2012 The Devil You Know Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A bit rough and scouring in texture, this tastes too sweet. Its orange and strawberry notes have a sugary edge. It's an easy bubbly to drink at parties.",85,Gloria Ferrer NV Sonoma Brut Sparkling (Sonoma County)
"Dusty, earthy plum and cherry aromas are a bit scratchy but enjoyable and powerful. A smooth, plummy palate entertains flavors of toasty black fruits and peppery spice, while the finish is meaty and full, with easy tannins. Drink through 2017.",91,Montgó 2012 Monastrell (Alicante)
"Vanilla, coconut and baking spice aromas are at the fore, with the wood primary. The palate is rich and full bodied, with dark fruit and oak spice flavors. There are some good things going on but the oak—half new American and half seasoned French—rides right over them.",87,:Nota Bene 2013 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Syrah (Red Mountain)
"It's almost two-thirds Riesling, which gives the wine its tight focus and strong mineral and citrus overtones, but there's also Sauvignon Blanc, Marsanne, Viognier and Chardonnay in the mix, giving it layers of fruity complexity. Awfully good for the price.",88,D'Arenberg 2007 The Stump Jump White (McLaren Vale)
"Fresh, minerally red-fruit aromas set up a light but good palate. Modest oak and red fruit flavors are earthy and a bit warm, while the finish is easy, clean and fresh. For $7, there's almost nothing to take issue with.",86,Beach Kite 2012 Pinot Noir (Central Valley)
"Le Rime is made as both a Chardonnay-Pinot Grigio blend and as a pure expression of Pinot Grigio for the U.S. market. Easy and fresh, this wine has touches of pear and citrus.",85,Banfi 2011 Le Rime Pinot Grigio (Toscana)
"Aromas of rubber, leather and herbal berry suggest ripeness issues, but in the mouth this is upstanding, with mild acidic cut. Flavors of leathery berry filter into an earthy, slightly muddled tasting finish with warmth and weight.",86,Denario 2012 Malbec (Patagonia)
"Staunch but murky aromas of coffee grounds, leafy berry, olive and lemon peel announce a tight raw palate. Flavors of olive, plum skins and herbs finish with a reprise of spent coffee along with scratchy tannins.",84,Viña el Aromo 2011 Private Reserve Carmenère (Maule Valley)
"A rather high-toned note akin to resin appears at first but quickly turns into the sweet notion of fir honey. The palate is honeyed, too, with a rich, almost candied center of caramelised peach. There is concentration at the core and a convincing freshness.",90,Domaine Fernand Engel 2013 Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Quite lively and solid, offering loads of black currant and bramble on the nose, and ripe dark fruit with smoky accents on the palate. The mouthfeel is supple, with a nice peppery tang, and it finishes well, with tart berry and licorice notes.",88,Stonehaven 1998 Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)
"Racy and precise, this opens with scents of white spring flower and orchard fruit. The chiseled palate delivers yellow apple, peach, aromatic herb and flinty mineral set against vibrant acidity.",90,La Lastra 2014 Riserva  (Vernaccia di San Gimignano)
"The nose gives little away, the clean palate falls in line with almost equal neutrality. It's only on the aftertaste that you get some of that savory yeastiness we so associate with fresh, young Grüner. Drink soon while there still is some freshness.",85,Lenz Moser 2015 Prestige Grüner Veltliner (Austria)
"A blend of grapes, so maybe it is not surprising that the aromas and flavors are a blend: melons, pears and limes, all presented with great freshness and verve alongside a rich texture. Editors' Choice.",88,Cantina Terlano 2002 Terlano Classico White (Alto Adige)
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese and Merlot (with small percentages of other varieties mixed in), this extracted wine delivers mature fruit, dried rose petal and dark chocolate. The wine is fresh but gritty and thickly textured as well.",88,Michele Satta 2009  Bolgheri
"This wine shows a more savory side of Cabernet Sauvignon without being in any way underripe or malnourished. It's a big, ripe wine, but the mulberry and cassis fruit is marked by cinnamon and clove shadings. It finishes lush, velvety and warm, with hints of chocolaty richness. This should drink well through at least 2024, and possibly for longer if it firms up a little.",92,Penley Estate 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra)
"This wine fills the senses with notes of grass, lemon curd, slate and unripe green apple. Flavors of peach-ring candies and lemon come though on the zesty and tangy palate. The finish is long and tingly, although the flavors quickly dissipate.",87,Veramar 2015 Seyval Blanc (Virginia)
"Soft, peppery and a little on the sweet side, this Cab Franc has upfront flavors of cherry preserves. Rich tannins provide much-needed balance. Drink now.",85,Arger-Martucci 2004 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley)
"The pencil lead, herb and vanilla aromas start out light and elusive. The black-cherry flavors, in contrast, are expressive, showing a good sense of balance and length.",90,Genoa 2012 Danforth Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"Made with 80% Sangiovese, 10% Ciliegiolo and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has subdued aromas suggesting espresso and toast. The palate is rather lean in terms of fruit richness, offering red currant, clove and a hint of vanilla alongside close-grained tannins that lead to a mouth-puckering close.",86,Collemassari 2013 Riserva  (Montecucco)
"Dark and somewhat heady, this opens with dense aromas of mashed blackberry, black tea, bark and peppery spice. The palate is similarly dense and concentrated, although the medium tannins lend the wine a crushed-satin texture that keeps it from feeling too decadent. The finish is long, with a solid pepper streak.",89,Saronsberg 2008 Provenance Shiraz (Coastal Region)
"A Bordeaux-style blend, predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon, from vineyards throughout the Napa Valley. This red is made in a more robust style, the tannins still a tad dry, the fruit earthy in sage and cedar with black cherry and chocolaty spice at the fore.",87,Atalon 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A tight wine, the tannins almost too much for the fresh but lightweight fruits. The wood element is poised to soften the edges of the acidity and black currant fruits, but it needs another six months. The aftertaste is dominated by soft Merlot.",86,Château Grivière 2007  Médoc
"Wild berries, white cherry and even a touch of green olive or caper come to the forefront of this delicately colored rosé from Sicily. The wine loses momentum in the mouth, however, because of its bitter, slightly astringent feel.",84,Avide 2008 Herea Frappato Rosato Rosé (Sicilia)
"Freshly cut pear and tropical aromas lead to medium-bodied flavors. The style is clean and well made, with the concentration dipping a bit at times.",85,Columbia Crest 2014 Grand Estates Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A big, ripe and spicy wine, this is packed with woody notes as well as powerful fruit. It has solid tannins and dark flavors of bitter chocolate and black cherries. It's rich and concentrated, with good aging potential. Drink from 2018.",93,Poças 2012 Reserva Red (Douro)
"One of the few Finger Lakes' Gewürztraminers to exhibit such spot-on varietal typicity, this is gorgeously aromatic with loads of honeysuckle, lychee, stone fruit and exotic spice notes. Off-dry, concentrated and bold on the palate, it's balanced with just a touch of phenolic bitterness.",88,Sheldrake Point 2011 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes)
This estate-grown inland Mendocino Zin has an inviting spiciness and is plenty briary with a full body of flavor but its high-alcohol level masks any other nuances.,85,Nelson Family Vineyards 2007 Estate Zinfandel (Mendocino)
"This has creamy flavors of vanilla, honey, lime and orange.",82,Bogle 2011 Chardonnay (California)
"Caramel flavor and ripe red fruits give this organic Malbec (60%) and Merlot (40%) blend some weight. Pink in color, it has ripe crushed strawberry flavors and light acidity at the end. Drink now.",84,Château de la Vieille Tour 2014 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
"Pretty green floral, apple and pear notes scent this fresh, easy-drinking Riesling. Brisk and semidry in style, it seems sweetened by a lacy haze of sugar that lingers on the finish. Drinking now.",87,Pflücken 2014 Semidry Riesling (Mosel)
"A rich, mouthfilling,  sophisticated wine. The secret is in the balance, with the concentrated fruit flavors—dried apricot, mango and lemon—in just the right proportion. It tastes delicious now, but will certainly age over five years or more.",94,Domaine Leflaive 2006 Les Pucelles Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet)
"This pretty rosé sparkler from Prosecco producer Villa Sandi boasts a nice, easy style that manages elegance and dimension at the same time. Evident yeast tones create softness and buoyancy.",88,Villa Sandi NV Opere Trevigiane Brut Rosé Pinot Nero (Veneto)
"Nicely made, this enters the palate with confidence and strikes a juicy pose, layered with white peach, apricot and pear. The fruit flavors gather strength in the midpalate, dappling in bits of baking spice, cinnamon and custard, and then gently fading into a smooth, supple finish. Classy winemaking here; this is a lovely, fruit-driven bottle with extra dimensions of texture and spice.",90,Rex Hill 2006 Pinot Gris (Oregon)
"Light in color, with basic apple and green-melon aromas, this is a mild Verdejo with a fairly plump mouthfeel. A cross of melon and citrus flavors falls off on the finish before turning bitter.",85,Mocén 2016 Eco Made From Organic Grapes Verdejo (Rueda)
"From one of the most familiar brands of Franciacorta, this opens with aromas of red apple skin, lemon zest and candied nectarine slices. The palate offers Golden Delicious apple and hints of liqueur alongside zesty acidity and tight, persistent bubbles that leave a crisp finish.",88,Bellavista NV Alma Cuvée Brut Sparkling (Franciacorta)
"Make no mistake—the model for this wine can be found among the classified growth white wines of Bordeaux. The barrel influences are many and varied, layering in a mix of smoke, caramel and cracker; and the fruit is supple and beautifully blended. White raisins, Asian pears, pineapple and peaches blend together gracefully, and the alcohol remains at a moderate 13.8%.",92,Chaleur Estate 2007 Blanc White (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Heavy oak on top of cherry aromas results in a chemical-driven, woody bouquet. This feels high in acid, with an oaky, resiny offset. Sour plum, vanilla and resiny flavors finish short, lean and citric.",81,Tramuz 2013  Ribera del Duero
"This opens with aromas suggesting pressed yellow flower, orchard fruit and an unusual whiff that recalls brimstone. The brisk palate offers yellow apple, citrus and a bitter medicinal note.",86,Terredora 2015 Corte di Giso Falanghina (Irpinia)
"This is a dry, richly flavored and well-structured wine. A complex, spicy, earthy, cherrylike bouquet accompanies saturated flavors of currant, black cherry and pomegranate spiced with hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. It's not too full bodied and has good balance that comes from firm acidity and tannins.",89,Occasio 2012 Ghielmetti Vineyard Syrah (Livermore Valley)
"Round and welcoming up front, with toffee, caramel and mocha aromas that are not too sharp. Feels smooth, with pure flavors of toasted nuts, caramel, cocoa dust, dried apricot and underripe peach. Complex and nutty on the finish, with a sweet aftertaste of chocolate and toffee.",90,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L. NV Élite Oloroso Sherry (Jerez)
"Aromas of truffle, ripe dark-skinned berry, baking spice and grilled herb unfold on this structured red but accessible red. The ripe, chewy palate doles out fleshy wild cherry, raspberry jam, cinnamon and clove. Well-integrated tannins lend an almost weightless quality. Drink 2018–2023.",92,Il Poggione 2011  Brunello di Montalcino
"A blend of Aglianico and Piedirosso, this savory, hearty wine opens with earthy aromas of underbrush and dark spices. The dense palate delivers ripe black-cherry flavor that's layered with black pepper, clove and cinnamon. A mineral note closes the juicy finish, alongside firm but silky tannins.",90,Tommasone 2010 Pithecusa Red (Epomeo)
"For whatever the reason, this winery's Bordeaux reds, including Merlot, have shown tremendous improvement over the last few years. This Merlot is soft, sensual and lovely, with cherry pie, red currant, violet, mocha and new French oak flavors. Easy to drink now with robust grilled meats or stews.",90,Gundlach Bundschu 2010 Merlot (Sonoma Valley)
"Aromas of blue flowers, dried aromatic herbs and dark-skinned berry lead the nose. The juicy palate offers fleshy black cherry, raspberry, white pepper and roasted coffee bean alongside assertive, dusty tannins. A green note of powdered sage leaves an astringent finish.",87,Paniole 2012  Maremma Toscana
"On one of the high terraces above the river Lot, Château du Port produces a highly structured wine. It is full of tannins as much as fruit, with a dark, firm character that brings out the potential of this concentrated wine. Drink from 2017.",91,Château du Port 2012 Cuvée Prestige Malbec (Cahors)
"Stewed cherry, exotic cardamom and mace spices and hints of juniper and bay leaf bring an earthy component to the nose of this Pinot. Dark cranberry and black-plum-skin flavors meet with earth tones of turned loam, pine needle and menthol on the palate.",92,Black Ridge 2012 Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Lightly herbal, scented with tart pear and tasting the same, this organically grown estate wine is King Estate's best Pinot Gris. Their signature bottling sets a good standard for the grape in Oregon; this elevates it with more detail, density and personality. The alcohol is a sensible 13%, allowing subtle green fruit and herb grace notes to emerge.",89,King Estate 2008 Domaine Pinot Gris (Oregon)
"Crisp in citrus, with noticeable tension that softens in the glass, this wine offers tremendous value and elegance. Medium bodied and well integrated in terms of oak and power, it has a lovely note of preserved lemon on the finish.",90,Kirkland Signature 2013 Signature Series Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Tropical in scent, almost to the point of air freshener, this also has an oily, bitter hint to the bouquet. It feels choppy and citric, with a nuttiness to the core of tangerine, lemon and melon flavors. Good but fading.",84,Solsticio 2011 Verano Torrontés (Mendoza)
"Crafted in an oxidative style, this wine is light brown to the eye, with aromas of toasted nuts and caramelized pineapple. Flavors of hazelnut, toasted almond and lemon sorbet continue through the smooth finish that ends on a zesty note.",89,Erzetič 2009 Amfora Sivi Pinot Pinot Gris (Goriska Brda)
"This offers subtle black-skinned fruit, leafy underbrush and cooking spice aromas. The dense, forward palate shows dried cherry, blackberry jam and licorice notes, with assertive tannins that leave a firm finish. Drink through 2022.",89,Il Bosco di Grazia 2012  Brunello di Montalcino
"Delicate aromas of spring flower, nut and yellow fruit guide the nose on this linear white. Delineated flavors of Golden Delicious apple and citrus fruit, accented with a light vein of mineral, are balanced by bracing acidity.",87,La Lastra 2013  Vernaccia di San Gimignano
"Baked plum, underbrush, toast and whiffs of exotic spice come together on this blend of 65% Corvina and 35% Cabernet Sauvignon. The full-bodied palate offers ripe black cherry, redcurrant, cocoa and anise alongside firm, fine-grained tannins.",90,Bolla 2012 Creso Red (Veronese)
"Art gallery openings, backyard barbecues and other occasions when you want a nice, dry, affordable red are suited to this boxed wine, the equivalent of four regular bottles. It has pleasant blackberry, currant and cherry jam flavors.",84,Bota Box 2005 Shiraz (California)
"Textured and medium bodied, this wine has a simplicity of citrus and peachy stone fruit buoyed by bright acidity. Fermented entirely in stainless steel, it was aged in concrete, stainless steel and French oak. It displays the concentration of the vintage.",88,Flora Springs 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Smells and tastes just great, with all the hallmarks of an important Napa Cabernet. It's rich in blackberries, black currants, cassis and minerals. Near- perfect tannins and a tasteful overlay of sweet oak add textural complexity. For all that, the wine feels young and brusque. It wants 6–7 years of age to begin to strut its stuff. Open after 2012.",93,Azalea Springs 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Laser-like cassis and black cherry aromas come with an accent of toasted oak. A pure, well-balanced palate isn't at all pushy or heavy, while snappy, fresh flavors of raspberry and spiced plum finish racy, toasty and the slightest bit herbal. Drink through 2022.",93,Bodega Catena Zapata 2010 Nicasia Vineyard Malbec (Mendoza)
"Equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot figure into this wine, along with 20% Malbec, all from the producer's estate. A mix of coconut and cherry-berry cobbler entice aromatically, seasoned in dried herb and black peppercorn. Dry, dusty tannins make their presence felt, the wine all in all tart, generous and lively, finishing in a slow drag of tobacco.",94,Von Strasser 2012 Reserve Red (Diamond Mountain District)
Black currant and dark cherry sensations are accented with notes of espresso and roasted coffee bean. The subdued palate is already evolved and has an abrupt finish.,86,Astorre Noti 2012  Rosso di Montepulciano
"Relatively soft for a St.-Estèphe, this nevertheless has plenty of firm tannins to project the powerful fruit forward. It has structure and weight, piled with plum juice and acidity. Great aging potential.",92,Château Tour de Pez 2008  Saint-Estèphe
"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (60%) and Merlot. Cocoa, baking chocolate and dark-fruit aromas lead to ripe generous black-fruit flavors, backed by well-integrated tannins. The finish lingers.",91,JM Cellars 2013 Longevity Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Very sweet, this has honeyed-apricot, orange and vanilla flavors. It's an opulent wine, but as rich as it is, you find yourself wishing it were even sweeter.",87,Ojai 2011 Kick On Ranch Riesling (Santa Barbara County)
"Dusty, minerally, stony aromas come with a floral note and accents of peach and melon. This blend of Merseguera, Malvasia and Viognier is lightly spritzy, with citrus and green apple flavors that turn mildly bitter and pithy. Drink now with anything from the sea.",88,Mustiguillo 2014 Mestizaje White (Spain)
"Dark in color, this wine packs deep blackberry and boysenberry aromas together with violet, allspice and sandalwood. The palate is redolent of licorice and nutmeg, wrapped in an unrelenting texture that lets the black plum and lilac flavors just peek out. Time will allow this to blossom. Drink 2019–2034.",94,Calera 2014 Ryan Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan)
"This wine is much more easy-drinking than its pedigree might suggest. Made in Israel from an indigenous grape that is grown in a Palestine, it has aromas of apricot, jasmine and strawberry. It is very soft in the mouth, with flavors of guava, honeydew melon and lemon. The finish offers a light dose of bright citrus.",87,Recanati 2014 Marawi (Galilee)
"There's a tinge of caramelized sugar amid ripe yellow peach and apricots in this ripe, yet deftly balanced Riesling. Off dry in style, it has a strike of lemon-lime acidity that jolts the palate from its juicy, fruity ease. It's quaffable but equally penetrating.",89,Schloss Johannisberger 2012 Rotlack Kabinett Feinherb Riesling (Rheingau)
"Take the bubbles out of Cava and this is pretty much what's left. The nose is light, with peach and banana aromas. Tangy flavors of orange and pineapple are lively but lacking, and the finish is ripe but simple. For flush flavors and just enough zap, this is good.",84,Huguet de Can Feixes 2006 Can Feixes Blanc Selecció White (Penedès)
"Rich and intense but also round and soft. A horsey note adds complexity and rusticity to the dark chocolate, leather and black cherry aromas and flavors. —J.C.",88,Kurtz Family 2000 Boundary Row Grenache (Barossa Valley)
"Fresh fruit flavors of red apple and raspberry carry the wine into a light, fairly brief finish. The tannins are thin, almost stripped feeling, and there isn't enough weight to make a strong varietal statement.",87,Quady North 2012 Cabernet Franc (Applegate Valley)
"Intense granite tones lend elegance and complexity to this plump, cherried blend of Merlot, Dornfelder and Lemberger. Supple and round on the palate, it's framed delicately with soft tannins and a fringe of smoke and dried herbs.",88,Pflüger 2012 Cuvée Noir Red (Pfalz)
"This wine has bold aromas of wood smoke and vanilla, a very firm, fine-grained and tannic texture, and lots of black cherry and dark plum flavors. It's a big, robust wine—pour alongside hefty proteins and settle back for the evening.",91,Hawk and Horse Vineyards 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills Lake County)
"Amber to the eye, this wine features an enticing bouquet of almond blossom and toffee. It is slightly chalky on the palate, with a sophisticated mélange of baked apple, peach, smoked meat and pencil-lead flavors. A touch of brightness marks the soft finish.",88,Gotsa Family Wines 2015 Dry Unfiltered Rkatsiteli Mtsvane White
"Billowing with scents of marmalade, wildflower honey and raspberry preserves, this is an intoxicatingly perfumed TBA, but the palate doesn't disappoint either. Rich and creamy with undulating streaks of peach preserve and tangerine, it lingers on and on, with its tea and honey-kissed finish.",94,Dr. Nägler 2011 Rüdesheimer Berg Schlossberg Trockenbeerenauslese Riesling (Rheingau)
"Batailley 2006 has been mainly about tannin from its earliest stages, and this has not yet changed. What has changed is that the tannin isn't by itself any more: black plum fruit is now giving some richness. It does need to age, but the elegance and the balance are coming.",90,Château Batailley 2006  Pauillac
This is a pale-colored wine with a soft texture and gentle strawberry fruits. The texture comes through slowly to give a firmer edge to what is a wine for medium-term aging. This is stylish and smooth. It should be drunk from 2018.,88,Philippe Jeannot 2015 Quentin Jeannot La Fussière Premier Cru  (Maranges)
"Pleasantly fruity and almost sweet, this medium-bodied wine offers a fruit bowl of flavor and freshness on the palate.",86,"AVA Grace Vineyards 2014 Peach, Bright, Lovely Chardonnay (California)"
"A little one-dimensional, but offers enough cherry, red currant and smoky oak flavors to get by for everyday eating. A good example of the art of blending, with 115,000 cases produced.",84,Beaulieu Vineyard 2011 Coastal Estates Merlot (California)
"Another in a string of fine Pinots from this producer. Shows real cool coastal influence in the brisk acidity, delicate structure and deep flavors of cherries and cola, which seem to have a long hangtime complexity. Very good, and should develop over the next 5–6 years.",92,Freeman 2008 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Sicily makes some of the absolutely best dessert wines you will ever taste, and Feudo Disisa's late-harvest Krysos is an excellent example. The wine opens with intense aromas of apricot, chestnut honey, almond marzipan and dried apricot. It feels soft, thick and enduring on the long, sweet finish.",93,Feudo Disisa 2006 Krysos Grillo (Sicilia)
"A little roasted and leafy smelling, which is typical for base-level Chilean Merlot. The palate is sweet almost to the brink of being candied, with plum and chocolate flavors running the show. Not much structure or tannic bite here, but as a whole it's tasty and gets better as it opens up.",85,Montes 2007 Classic Series Merlot (Colchagua Valley)
The Schoenheitz predilection for sweet wines is strongly in evidence in this wine. It's all spice and sweet fruits flavored with bergamot. It's a drink-me-now wine.,85,Henri Schoenheitz 2013 Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Bombastic and burly, this wine holds a depth of black raspberry and cherry at its edge, surrounded in swathes of smoky oak. Rich and full bodied, it is a testament to the intrigue of baking spices and black tea, but more significantly to dark chocolate and espresso.",89,Sonoma-Loeb 2013 Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Marked by excessive oak, with toasty-sweet caramel flavors dominating the ripe blackberry and cherry pie flavors. Nice tannins, though. Drink now.",84,Cosentino 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa County)
"Blended with 25% Cabernet Franc, this engaging wine has aromas of herbs and blackberries. The fruit shows a real sense of vibrancy and purity, laden with tart, cranberry-like acidity and firm, lightly chalky tannins. Just a baby now, it should be at its peak in 2025.",90,Carden 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Black cherry, dark plum and charred rubber give this a masculine opening. Generous and layered across the palate, this tastes of blackberry, chocolaty oak and spice. A lasting, tannic finish is loaded with oak and baking-spice flavors. Drink this ripe, delicious bruiser through 2021.",91,Lamadrid 2013 Single Vineyard Reserva Cabernet Franc (Agrelo)
"Hugely rich and in a seriously heavy bottle, this is a statement wine. Its texture is there, surrounded by superripe fruit and touches of pepper from the alcohol. This almost tropical-fruit wine needs to age a little longer, so drink from 2018.",90,Domaine Laporte 2015 La Comtesse  (Sancerre)
"A mix of plum and vanilla, this is an easygoing Merlot that's good for most group occasions and palates, muted in aroma but developed in flavor.",85,Benziger 2011 Merlot (Sonoma County)
"Aged 22 months in 35% new French oak, this semisweet wine is so rich and luscious it could be poured at the end of a meal to pair with chocolate or chunks of salty pecorino. It smells like strawberries and black cherries, tastes ripe and jammy and has a soft, mouth-filling texture and low acidity.",90,Miraflores 2014 Estate Zinfandel (El Dorado)
"Hazy aromatics of sautéed apple and baking spice mark the nose, with notes of toasted nut and dill that surface on the palate. It feels full, round and supple, gaining some lift toward the close.",85,Tarara 2010 Charval White (Virginia)
"This is a compelling example of Oregon Pinot Gris. Apple, pear and lemon curd carry the bulk of the flavors, with a lightly peppery lift to the midpalate. The spicy character extends through a pleasing, long finish.",91,King Estate 2014 Backbone Pinot Gris (Oregon)
"This is the biggest and ripest of Talley's Pinots, the kind some criticize as Rhône-like. Yes, it's full-bodied, and you might mistake it for Grenache, with its cherry flavors and voluminous tannins. Yet it's beautifully balanced and complex, and should develop bottle complexity for a decade. If you drink it now, pair with big dishes, like duck or game.",93,Talley 2005 Rincon Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"This wine has an elegant edge, with its hints of tea, spice and mint on the nose and its pleasant, harmonious plum and red berry flavors on the palate. Easy to drink and food-pairing friendly.",84,Casa Rondeña Winery 2005 Meritage (New Mexico)
"At 12g/L residual sugar, this just barely qualifies as dry. Fruit flavors suggest lemon curd and green pineapple, and there's an interesting savory note. But flatness across the palate keeps the score from going higher.",87,Anam Cara 2012 Nicholas Estate Dry Riesling (Chehalem Mountains)
"Aromatic notes of orange peel and flesh charm on the nose of this wine. The palate is gentle, dry and fresh, with a super-clean finish offering apple and grapefruit.",89,François Baur 2015 Turckheim Riesling (Alsace)
"Mulchy, leafy aromas lead to a pinchy palate with salty, hard berry flavors that lack cushion. This is a rough wine with saltiness and bitterness on the finish.",82,Hacienda del Plata 2010 Zagal Malbec (Mendoza)
"In keeping with the winery's commitment to exploring some less-traveled wine roads, this is a coferment of 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay. Soft, delicate and aromatic, with a pale rose color, it is definitely not in the mainstream of Oregon Pinots. Nonetheless, it's very well crafted, aromatic and delivers plenty of flavor and depth.",89,ENSO 2011 Bieze Vineyard The Prince Pinot-Chardonnay (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Soft and friendly, this has instantly likeable cherry, cola, anise and sandalwood flavors. Perfect for drinking now.",86,Courtney Benham 2011 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Impressively silky for the price, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (53%), Shiraz (35%), Petit Verdot (7%) and Malbec (5%) is a bargain that should be easy enough to find, with 10,000 cases imported. Toasty oak and vanilla notes frame mixed berries and olives, marrying sweet and savory elements into a pleasing, medium-bodied red for early consumption.",87,Bleasdale 2008 Langhorne Crossing Red (Langhorne Creek)
"This is a firm wine, full of tannins as well as plenty of ripe berries. It is concentrated, juicy and perfumed, an attractive wine already. The dry core gives structure to this panoply of fruitiness. The name comes from French king Louis XI who acquired the vineyard in the 15th century.",93,Chanson Père et Fils 2013 Clos du Roi Premier Cru  (Beaune)
"Dancing on the nose and palate, this Pinot Noir rosé fills the glass with whiffs of cherry blossoms and sugar cookies. Tart red-cherry and berry flavors are delicate and spry on the palate, lingering nervously in a luscious mousse of soft, rolling bubbles. Finishes elegantly with a bristle of stony minerals.",92,Peter Jakob Kühn 2012 Spätburgunder Rosé Sekt Brut Pinot Noir (Rheingau)
"Here's an unoaked wine that will be great as a cocktail sipper, or with a wide range of foods, from veggies with a garlicky dip to roasted chicken or broiled halibut. It's bone dry and very crisp in acidity, with interesting flavors of citrus fruits, figs, green melons, wildflowers, vanilla and dusty spices.",87,Bianchi 2006 Signature Selection Pinot Grigio (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"A very rounded, wood-aged wine, this is rich and admittedly delicious, although the wood smothers the fruit. It has hints of ripe yellow fruits, a touch of quince and a fine line of citrus to finish it off. Give it until 2015 for the wood to balance out.",89,Herdade do Rocim 2012 Olho de Mocho Reserva Branco White (Alentejano)
"Berry aromas are jammy and sweet smelling. This feels chunky and bit out of shape. Herbal boysenberry flavors come with a green core, while mint, spice, heat and herbal flavors carry the finish.",85,Oveja Negra 2014 Reserva Malbec-Petit Verdot Red (Maule Valley)
"Squeezed lime, wet concrete and green apple rind scents show on the nose of this basic bottling. Kaffir lime tang meets with ripe red apple and pear notes on the palate, framed by a stony texture.",86,Firestone 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley)
"A touch green and vegetal on the nose, with hints of canned peas and bell pepper. Fortunately there's enough lime and minerality to keep it fresh. Feels crisp, tight and wet, with green notes pervading core citrus flavors. Finishes pithy and zesty, with mild bitterness.",85,Botalcura 2011 El Delirio Sauvignon Blanc (Maule Valley)
"The oak, a mixture of French, American and eastern European, provides aromas of baking spices, pencil lead and cocoa on this blend of Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The plum, dark fruit and cranberry flavors play along beautifully, with the silky feel adding to the appeal.",91,Goose Ridge 2010 Vireo Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This aged blend of 50% Sangiovese and 50% Montelpulciano opens with black fruit and oak aromas. The dense palate delivers dense raspberry and wild cherry, layered with clove and chocolate alongside dusty tannins.",87,Le Caniette 2005 Nero di Vite  (Rosso Piceno)
"Made of 50% Sangiovese, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot, this opens with delicate black-skinned fruit and tilled earth aromas. The straightforward palate delivers ripe black plum and exotic spice flavors, smoothed out by ripe tannins. Enjoy soon.",87,Renieri 2013 Invetro Red (Toscana)
"Concentrated boysenberry, licorice and asphalt scents carry mild green accents of alfalfa and mint. This feels ripe and lush but not too heavy. Flavors of baked blackberry, licorice and loamy earth finish warm and cushioned, with notes of anise and pepper accompanied by some heat and burn. Drink through 2020.",90,Durigutti 2012 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza)
"There's just not much here. The strawberry fruit is wispy thin, the acids tart, the tannins light, and the whole shebang shows only modest depth and grip.",87,Lemelson 2014 Chestnut Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"Smells like a briar patch under summer sun, with accents of leather and tomato. The pungent aromatics fade into a weighty mouthfeel. It’s all red berries, and it’s tight and young. Shows fine structure and a pure quality. A very likable wine.",88,Elk Cove 1998 Windhill Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This aromatic, herbal wine is crisp and lively, with bright acidity and green fruits. Citrus and gooseberry flavors bring out an even fresher side. It finishes light and fruity. Drink now.",87,Domaine de Villalin 2014  Quincy
"A superb Sauvignon Blanc. The cool vintage gives it brilliant acidity, modest alcohol and dryness, yet it's wonderfully rich in long hangtime citrus, wet stone, green apple, apricot and mineral flavors. Better than the excellent 2008, a white Bordeaux-style wine to drink now.",92,Alpha Omega 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Aromas recalling woodland berry, underbrush and a whiff of toasted nut lead the nose on this easy-drinking red. The light-bodied, straightforward palate offers tart sour cherry, strawberry and a touch of clove alongside firm acidity and fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2017.",87,Donatella Cinelli Colombini 2014  Rosso di Montalcino
"Deep berry aromas combine seamlessly with sweet notes of marzipan and complex accents of balsam wood on what is an inviting, rich nose. This is rewardingly bright and structured on the palate, where blackberry, boysenberry and plum flavors carry onto a full, long finish. This is high-end, ripe Malbec. Drink through 2018.",92,TintoNegro 2011 Finca La Escuela Altamira Estate Grown Malbec (Mendoza)
"Here's a sound, everyday-style Cabernet for drinking now. It's dry and tannic, with rich flavors of blackberries, black currants and plums, enhanced with sweet, smoky oak.",85,Bigvine 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Half Cabernet with the rest Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Mourvèdre and Petit Verdot, this wine opens with aromas of sweet barrel spices followed by dried red and black fruit. The palate is fruit-forward and flavorful, bringing you back for another sip.",89,Genoa 2012 Flying Colors Super Tuscan-Style Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Dark in color and dense on the nose, this has aromas of pastry, blackberry, jammy plum and even an exotic note. It feels chewy and solid, with a full-bodied texture and deep flavors of black cherry and prune. It comes up a bit short and clipped on the finish.",89,Federico Paternina 2006 Clisos Reserva  (Rioja)
"This waxy, petrol-infused wine underwent both barrel and stainless-steel fermentation. It's dark in color, exhibiting a majority of barrel-induced flavors like caramel and toast with any hint of fruit remaining elusive.",83,Educated Guess 2013 Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Bright pink in color, this 100% Touriga Nacional rosé is ripe with caramel and red berry flavors. It misses out on acidity, leaving the wine flat at the end.",83,Quinta da Alorna 2014 Rosé (Tejo)
"This is firmly tannic, with dark berry and black cherry fruits. Minerally and textured, it shows the full effect of Beaujolais's granite soil. It also has a rich feel that will evolve over the next several months.",88,Domaine Chasselay 2011 La Carrière  (Chénas)
"Mild vinegar and full-fledged herbal aromas are typical of traditional Chilean Merlot, and while the palate is solid, it's also scratchy, with tart raspberry and semiweedy flavors. Finishes with burnt brown sugar, herbal flavors and grating acidity.",83,Viña La Rosa 2008 La Palma Reserva Merlot (Cachapoal Valley)
"Made with Vermentino, this opens with aromas of apricot, tropical fruit, pressed yellow flower and dry hay. The palate offers juicy yellow peach, banana, nectarine, crunchy celery and savory herb. Fresh acidity brightens the rich flavors.",90,Terre del Marchesato 2013 Papeo Vermentino (Toscana)
"This wine from a historic vineyard is hard to put down. It combines flint, pencil lead, smoked wood, chopped chives, sweet onion, crushed limestone and a touch of white pepper on the stonefruit-based nose. A strong toast and brioche character carries the sip, touching on white sesame, graphite and even shaved parmesan. It's savory, tangy and addictive.",94,Testarossa 2014 Sierra Madre Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"This wine is rich in aromas and flavors of blackberry preserves, ripe cherries, raspberry sauce and vanilla bean. It's low in acid, leaving a round and soft impression on the palate. Drink now.",84,Roos Family 2016 The Coco Merlot-Cabernet Franc (Western Cape)
"This bright wine offers delicate fruit notes of wild berry and white cherry, backed by hints of black pepper and cola. Easy on the palate, it shows a fresh point of acidity on the finish.",86,Tommasi 2010 Vigneto Rafaèl  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore)
"From a single vineyard on flinty silex soil, this is a taut and concentrated wine. Its intensity is enhanced by the tense texture and powerful youthful acidity. At this stage, it is still young, still with its exuberant fruit. So wait to drink this wine until 2018.",93,Alphonse Mellot 2014 Les Herses  (Sancerre)
"Heady floral scents of wisteria, jasmine and hawthorn lead the way. The bright, frothy palate doles out crisp green apple, Bartlett pear and a hint of lime alongside a foaming mousse.",87,Masottina NV Brut  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Aromas of passion fruit, grapefruit, lime and bell pepper are textbook for the region. This feels fresh as a whistle, with pyrazine-led bell pepper, green bean and lime flavors. Additional notes of bell pepper, with hints of white pepper drive the finish on this crisp, refreshing Sauvignon Blanc.",87,Santa Carolina 2015 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley)
"Sort of sweet and gaseous to start, with rubbery, medicinal aromas. The palate is tight and closed, with warm, crusty dark-fruit flavors, an herbal influence and heat. Thus the finish is a little fiery and peppery, and there's chop and bite to the overall feel. A kitchen-sink blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Syrah.",85,La Posta 2007 Cocina Blend Red (Mendoza)
"Dave Corey co-fermented 83% Grenache with 17% Syrah to produce this rich wine, which offers nose-tingling aromas of blackberry brandy. It's soft once sipped, but also a bit brutal, with blood and barrel-age prominent alongside flavors of blackberry-peppercorn cake. Serve as dessert.",91,Core Winery 2010 Elevation Sensation Grenache-Syrah (Paso Robles)
"This Bordeaux-style blend remains a fair value, showing some sweet barrel spices along with opening fruit flavors of red and black berry. It thins out in the middle and finishes with a simple, fruity flourish.",86,O•S Winery 2009 Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is an austere, brooding wine with tones of smoke, cured ham, toasted oak and mature black fruit. The delivery is broad and immediate and the wine ends with a drying, almost gritty texture.",87,Castello Vicchiomaggio 2005 Agostino Petri Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"Rich in pineapple custard, pear and mineral flavors, this Chard offers lots of direct pleasure. Drink now with crab cakes, roast salmon, or squash risotto.",86,Artevino 2006 Reserve Chardonnay (Mendocino County)
"Complex from start to finish, beginning with aromas of smoke, kumquats and grilled pears and ending cleanly, with tart pineapple notes. The texture is a compelling mix of gravel and custard, yet the wine never seems heavy.",89,Stonecroft 2000 Chardonnay (Hawke's Bay)
"Earthy and filled with baking spice, this wine offers floral aromas, bright acidity and flavors of baked strawberry compote steeped in cinnamon. Lush on the palate, as so many of the producer's wines are, it is quite mouthfilling and will take on more nuance with time, through 2022.",92,Merry Edwards 2012 Georganne Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Structured, smoky and full of black cherry fruits, this is a wine whose appellation of Villages brings out just that extra bit of weight and richness. It's still fruity, ready to drink and fresh on the finish.",86,Henry Fessy 2014 Nouveau  (Beaujolais-Villages)
"Castello Banfi in Tuscany does a great job with Chardonnay, as evidenced by this wine. It's rich and soft, with bright aromas of peach, citrus, vanilla and savory herb. A pinch of acidity on the finish works beautifully as well.",90,Castello Banfi 2011 Fontanelle Chardonnay (Toscana)
"A streak of savory flavors, like sage and soy, runs through this otherwise grapy, plummy, medium-bodied wine, giving it a unique profile. Firmly tannic in texture, and showing a bit of the typical spiciness, it's ready to drink.",85,Lyeth 2012 Malbec (California)
"Perfumed berry, pressed violet, leather and a balsamic note lead the nose of this 100% Sangiovese. The sleek, savory palate doles out fleshy black cherry, licorice, clove and tobacco interwoven with lithe tannins and fresh acidity.",90,San Leonino 2012 Al Limite  (Chianti Classico)
"Aromas of ripe—almost overripe—berry, leather and tobacco lead the nose of this wine. The palate shows more restraint, with succulent sour cherry, clove and vanilla flavors accented by hints of white chocolate and orange zest. Very smooth and richly textured.",90,Le Salette 2010 I Progni  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
"Good price for a rich, spicy Zinfandel. It's as ripe as anything out there, with flavors of cherries and blackberries, while oak barrel aging shows up in the form of sweetly buttered cinnamon toast. Drink this exuberant wine with steaks and chops.",87,Sebastiani 2009 Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
Bortolotti makes a well-priced Non-DOC Prosecco Extra Dry with fragrant aromas of white flowers and peach. The luminous sparkler has just enough sweetness to underscore those fresh peach flavors and offers tingly bubbling.,86,Bortolotti NV Single Extra Dry  (Prosecco del Veneto)
"This is cloudy to the eye, with a mix of vinegar, briny plum and milk chocolate on the nose. The mouthfeel is blowsy, while the flavors are briny and pickled.",82,Caligiore 2011 Pianissimo Made with Organically Grown Grapes Malbec Rosé (Mendoza)
"This is a rich, heavy wine, a Chardonnay on steroids. It's packed with ripe and lush tree fruits, and those flavors are matched with generous barrel toast. Though it feels a bit thick on the palate, it has enough acidity to avoid being flabby and is terrifically delicious. Drink now through 2021.",92,Domaine Serene 2015 Evenstad Reserve Chardonnay (Dundee Hills)
"Aged 22 months in French and American oak, this wine hails from a rolling hillside in the appellation and is 100% varietal. Subdued aromas give way to an expansive and full-bodied array of red currant, cranberry and black pepper, with a vibrant underpinning of minerality as well as tobacco and baking chocolate.",91,Flambeaux 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley)
"Here's a delicate-smelling Prosecco Cartizze with subdued tones of stone fruit and white mineral over a sweet, creamy filling. Soda-like intensity in terms of its effervescence crackles and fizzes in the mouth and keeps the palate refreshed.",90,Adami NV  Prosecco Superiore di Cartizze
"With a sniff of noble reduction, this is a well-made robust wine, indicative of its historic estate and small-production values. A juicy core of broad plum, dark cherry and pomegranate wrap seamlessly around a fresh streak of minerality and rich texture.",92,Pellegrini 2014 Olivet Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Smells decidedly burnt and stalky, with rubbery berry and black plum aromas. Shows grip on the palate, along with the same flavors hinted at on the nose: leather, burnt coffee, herbs and roasted berries. Feels pretty good, but the stalky, burnt core dominates.",84,Viña Bujanda 2008 Crianza  (Rioja)
"A majority of Grenache plays lead here, with an accompaniment of 35% Syrah and 12% Mourvedre. Concentrated in a grip of leather, there's further integration of earth and black fruit that stays bright and vibrant on the palate, a medium-bodied coming-together of savory with ripe.",90,Davis Family 2013 Throne Red (Russian River Valley)
"A blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Canaiolo and 5% Colorino, this offers delicate ripe black-skinned fruit and cooking spice aromas. On the palate, ripe black cherry, espresso and clove flavors are framed by firm tannins. Drink through 2019.",89,Mangiacane 2011 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"Ripe cherry and luscious watermelon aromas waft from this summery, fresh wine. It's dry on the palate but concentrated, with bright cherry and berry flavors. Round and lush yet briskly balanced, it's a great summer quaffer at a fantastic price.",90,Dr. Konstantin Frank 2013 Dry Rosé Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes)
"Raw, fresh, almost scratchy aromas of cranberry and plum are direct. This feels fruity and bright on the palate, with lightly medicinal cherry and plum flavors that finish with a sprinkle of spice and a note of saline.",85,Mureda 2013 Organic Syrah (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"This is a rich, intense wine, its spice and pepper characters mingling with ripe tangerine and peach notes. It is full, round and concentrated. The pure fruit character is delicious, though it could age a year.",89,Domaine Fernand Engel 2010 Réserve Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Sweet rosé, soft crushed strawberries with crisp, clean balanced acidity. The wine is fruity, fresh and great as an aperitif or with a fruit dessert.",85,Château la Varière 2010 Rosé (Anjou)
"An evenly dispersed nose of sage bark, cherry compote and lightly toasted cedar introduces this bottling by Fred Brander, a Santa Ynez Valley winemaking pioneer now actively trying to create a new Los Olivos District appellation. The flavors are balanced between cherry fruit and oak, with smooth tannins throughout.",91,Brander 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley)
"This Rhône-style blend—two-thirds Roussanne, the rest divided between Marsanne and Viognier—was made using grapes sourced from the estate Destiny Ridge Vineyard. Intriguing aromas suggest clover, sweet grass and honeysuckle, while the flavors run from stone fruits into hints of light tropical fruits. It's lovely and evocative.",91,Alexandria Nicole 2011 Shepherds Mark Destiny Ridge Vineyards Estate Grown White White (Horse Heaven Hills)
"This is a tasty, juicy, easy-drinking wine with good fruit flavors. Well balanced and medium bodied, it offers some of the density and texture expected, but without going over the top in tannins.",88,City Winery Chicago 2014 Big Shoulders Cabernet Cabernet Sauvignon (North Coast)
"Aromas of ripe red apple skin, dried rose petal and roasted almond lead the nose and follow through to the palate. It has vibrant acidity and a brisk, persistent perlage but it lacks fruit richness. It closes on a note of bitter walnut.",86,Cà di Frara NV Oltre Cruasé Sparkling (Oltrepò Pavese)
"The nose does not want to give a lot away. The palate, however, shows spicy hints of nettle and a fresh bouncy zesty backbone of lemon and grapefruit, which makes it all the more appetizing.",90,Steininger 2015 Kittmannsberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"From the estate vineyard, this crisp white opens with ripe, slightly tropical aromas of cantaloupe, guava and papaya, with a darker, riper undertone of honey on the palate. Although fleshy and full on the palate, it's also bright in acidity and offers attractive floral aromas throughout.",90,St. Supéry 2012 Dollarhide Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
This 50-50 Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon is a rich wine that is full of lightly peppered ripe apple and pear flavors. It feels generous while being full in the mouth with good concentration and crisp acidity. Drink now.,90,Vignobles Carreau Selection 2015 Château l'Escadre  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"For a wine that can often be found for less than its $15 asking price, this is a very solid sipper. Ripe raspberry, red cherry and crushed slate show on the nose, while the light palate offers easy flavors of fruit punch and an herbal depth.",87,Hahn 2016 Pinot Noir (Monterey County)
"Lots of red flowers, from roses to hibiscus, show alongside plump candied red cherries, exotic Asian spice, black tea and hearty chaparral herbs on the nose of this bottling. The palate is heavy with bay leaf, thyme and eucalyptus served atop a strawberry-cherry base. It's earthy and herbal, yet redolent with ripeness.",94,Melville 2014 Block M Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Perfumed and floral, crisp and modulated in acidity, this is an exuberant expression of the variety. Ample acidiy and cherry and orange flavors unfold on the palate, followed by a brisk finish that's laced in spicy nuance.",91,Lawer 2016 Estate Vineyard Rosé of Syrah (Knights Valley)
"This directly appealing wine brings notes of the underside of a pineapple, chamomile, talc, wet stone and apricot, mixing delicacy and nuance. It's creamy in feel with rich, concentrated fruit flavors and a long, detailed finish.",93,Sixto 2012 Moxee Chardonnay (Washington)
"Dark black fruits and a dense, almost black color are signs of the concentration of this concentrated wine. Nine months in wood have added to the richness of the wine while preserving the blackberry and black-plum flavors. It is just ready to drink, although it will be much better from 2017.",91,Global Wines 2012 Cabriz Reserva Red (Dão)
"Most of Saint Clair's Pioneer Block offerings are excellent, but the 2011 Block 16 from the Awatere comes across as a simple, fruit-driven Pinot Noir. A punched-up cherry note dominates, leaving little room for complexity or structure. Drink now.",84,Saint Clair 2011 Pioneer Block 16 Awatere Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
"This blend of Merlot, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc opens with jammy, almost impenetrable aromas of blackberry, maraschino cherry, pipe tobacco and dark chocolate. “Huge” is the operative word.",90,Il Pollenza 2007 Red (Marche)
"V. Sattui has been making some pretty good Cabernets, and here's another one. It's classic Napa, with smooth, polished tannins, fine acidity and ripe, full-bodied flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar. Might even develop additional bottle complexity over the next 6–8 years.",90,V. Sattui 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This Pinot Blanc is creamy smooth and soft, with a delicious line in peach acidity and lively green fruits. Crisp, ready to drink, and very fresh.",87,Stift Klosterneuburg 2009 Jungherrn Weissburgunder (Vienna)
"Creamy and herbal on the nose, with mild vegetal aromas and big but bland black-fruit scents. The palate is big and chunky, with heavy berry flavors tempered by herbal notes. Same goes for the finish, which is thick and hefty but a little sticky.",86,Viña Bisquertt 2007 Ecos de Rulo Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"Tempranillo could be an interesting variety in South Australia going forward. This rosé features hints of sous bois and cherries on the nose, then adds melon and spice notes on the palate. It's plump in the mouth, then finishes on a dry, silky note.",88,Gemtree 2016 Luna de Fresca Biodynamic Tempranillo Rosé (McLaren Vale)
"If forced to drink too much of this clumsy, grassy, horsey smelling blend, you might be a dissident, too. This is sticky and cloying on the palate, with sweet, candied, herbal black-fruit flavors that finish under a covering of residual sugar.",83,Dissident 2014 Reserve Red (Curicó Valley)
This wine has a geranium aroma and a strangely perfumed character. It is light and fruity although not likely to develop much.,83,Quinta do Romeu 2011 Red (Douro)
"This 100% varietal wine sourced primarily from Oakville Ranch Vineyard is exuberant with rich, round red fruit and earthy sage notes. Bright and lively, with underlying grip, it offers further full-bodied flavors of vanilla, dark chocolate and tobacco as it opens.",92,Sojourn 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"Here's a big, fruity, jammy Cabernet. It shows ripe, candied flavors of cherries, raspberries and chocolate, with polished tannins and a dry, spicy finish.",85,Lyeth 2007 L de Lyeth Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"Aged more than two years in air-dried French oak, this is classic Oakville Cabernet Sauvignon, velvety and plush. It boasts juicy blackberry and black cherry fruit aromas and flavors, with weighty oak and a mix of coconut flake and chocolate that linger on the finish.",93,Venge 2011 Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"Young and tight, this wine is scented with fresh raspberries and cocoa. The fruit flavors include red currant and spicy cherry as well, and it feels sleek and elegant, though confined. The way the wine spreads out across the palate is encouraging, as are the hints of pepper, herb and stone. Decant before drinking.",89,Brian Carter Cellars 2005 Byzance Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Baked black-plum aromas meet with star anise on the nose of this bottling. The texture is easy and light on the sip, where somewhat muddled flavors of mulberry and dried earth ride a decent acidity that rises toward the finish.",86,Bridlewood 2014 Pinot Noir (Monterey County)
"Shows rich, firm mountain tannins and well-ripened, concentrated flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and cocoa, and is thoroughly dry. But the wine loses a few points for hot caramelization, which may be partly over-charred oak and partly shriveled, overripe berries, if not both.",85,Meeker 2004 Kiss Ridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)
"This three-grape white blend starts with oily aromas and weight before finding some minerality and white-fruit notes. The palate has citrusy kick and zing to bolster green apple and orange flavors. The finish is wide, a touch clumsy and citrusy in flavor, with tang and lasting freshness.",85,Dinastía Vivanco 2012 Vivanco Viura-Malvasia-Tempranillo Blanco White (Rioja)
"It displays a very pretty pink color, but that's the showiest side of a rather reserved wine. The nose smells slightly of rosebush and the palate is a bit watery, with some stone fruit and noticeable tension.",83,Vino Vargas 2013 Costa Rosa Rosé (Paso Robles)
"This is an herbal, cool wine. Concentrated citrus flavors percolate through the wine to give freshness and bright acidity. It's light, very crisp and ready to drink.",85,Domaine de Villargeau 2014 Les Genêts Gris Sauvignon Blanc (Coteaux du Giennois)
"Dusty berry and cherry aromas include candied notes of cherry cough drop and marshmallow. Simple and choppy in feel, with some resiny oak character, this tastes like red plum and vanilla, while the aftertaste turns salty.",85,Viña Albali 2011 Crianza Tempranillo (Valdepeñas)
"The Gamache brothers call this blend, which is half Cabernet Franc, one quarter Merlot, and the rest split between Malbec and Syrah, a happy accident—the result of having a shortage of Cabernet Sauvignon for blending. The Franc is a great base wine, a little rough and green, but packed with firm, cool-site red grape flavors. Aromatic and tasting of mixed fruits, it's blended just ahead of bottling, so the juice gets the same care as the pricier varietal wines.",87,Gamache 2005 Boulder Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a bit rustic, with superripe blackberry flavors that veer into raisins. As a consequence, there's a fruity sweetness at its core. It's also extremely tannic. While it's flashy and impressive, it won't benefit from age due to its inherent instabilities.",87,Black Ridge 2008 San Andreas Red (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this opens with aromas of ripe plum, black-skinned berry and a whiff of cedar. The palate delivers spiced blueberries, dried blackberries, mocha, clove and crushed herbs alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2019.",90,Castello di Meleto 2010 Rainero Red (Toscana)
"Dense, smoky aromas of well-toasted oak are lactic on impact, with blackberry and cassis scents in support. This is woody, resiny and tannic on the palate, which makes it rough now but bodes well for down the line. Charred, toasty oak and herbal blackberry flavors finish minty, with a speck of creosote. Drink through 2020.",90,Lagar de Bezana 2013 Edición Limitada Syrah (Cachapoal Valley)
"Hard-driving aromas of nettle, jalapeño, sea brine, wet stones and grapefruit set up a chunky palate with a ton of weight. Passion fruit, orange and controlled vegetal flavors are in harmony. Drink now.",88,Arboleda 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Aconcagua Costa)
"Crisp, textured and with great acidity, this wine is still developing. It is packed with fresh citrus and apple fruits cut with strong minerality. Drink this structured wine from 2017.",90,Domaine de la Croix Senaillet 2014  Saint-Véran
"Thickly textured and sweet, with simple fruity flavors of cherries, strawberries and watermelon.",81,Altoona Hills 2008 Rosé Kosher Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)
"The result of a joint venture between the Chapoutier and Laughton families, this is a full-bodied, superripe wine. Aromas and flavors of chocolate and raisined cassis are almost Amarone-like, while the tannins are softly dusty in texture and the finish long.",91,Cluster M45 2008 Shiraz (Heathcote)
"This is a smooth, rich Cabernet whose fruity flavors are upfront, yet it has the complex, upscale structure of a great wine. With classic blackberry and crème de cassis flavors, it's almost as good as its more expensive vineyard-designated brethren from Janzen, at half the price.",92,Janzen 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Powerful and dense, this shows structured, ripe and concentrated black plum and dark cherry flavors. It has dense, firm tannins, which look likely to dominate the wine for many years, leaving a strong, dry aftertaste.",92,Domaine François Lamarche 2005 Clos de Vougeot  (Clos de Vougeot)
"Made with organically farmed fruit, this blend of Grillo and Viognier shows zesty freshness and floral richness. The palate shows creamy heft and cleansing acidity.",87,Feudo di Santa Tresa 2011 Rina Ianca White (Sicilia)
"You could get lost in the enticing fragrance of this wine thanks to wild berry, blue flower, baking spice, chopped herb and saddle leather aromas. The smooth, elegantly structured palate is just as inviting, doling out juicy black cherry, raspberry, cinnamon and white pepper flavors. Polished tannins and fresh acidity lend balance and support. An impressive effort from this winery—one of Montalcino's little known gems.",95,Armilla 2012  Brunello di Montalcino
"It's rare in Burgundy that a producer can add his name to a vineyard, but Faiveley's tradition goes back at least a century. This is huge and dense; the notes of spice, sweet black plum and acidity are all comfortably balanced with the powerful tannic structure. This needs at least seven years of aging.",94,Domaine Faiveley 2010 Clos des Cortons Faiveley  (Corton)
"Toasted nut and bread crust aromas carry over to the bright palate along with mature apple, strawberry, citrus and a note of dried herb. Soft small bubbles lend elegance while fresh acidity lifts the finish.",88,De Filippi 2010 Mariacristina Pas Dosé Metodo Classico Pinot Nero (Oltrepò Pavese)
"Spicy and lightly peppery, this fresh rosé brings concentrated strawberry fruit into focus. Made from organically grown grapes, it expands into a full-bodied finish with a lick of milk chocolate.",90,Upper Five 2015 Rosé of Grenache (Rogue Valley)
"Flavors roll from cranberry to sweet red cherry in a red-fruit riot. It was aged in 52% new and 24% one-year-old oak, but it's unobtrusive and not especially toasty. The barrel time has begun to smooth out any bumps and rough edges, though a touch of phenolic bite remains. Drink from 2018 to 2022.",90,Chehalem 2014 Ridgecrest Vineyards Reserve Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge)
"This is a solid wine with its dark tannins and structure from a vineyard close to some of the greatest Grands Crus. It is concentrated, showing the density of the appellation. There is a basic richness to this wine with its ripe black fruits. It is developing slowly and has a fine future. Drink from 2022.",93,Louis Latour 2014 Les Suchots Premier Cru  (Vosne-Romanée)
"This blend of 70% Sangiovese, 20% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon from a vineyard at the 33rd degree north latitude shows blackberry jam with vanilla bean, shaved cinnamon and plump purple flowers on the nose. Red currant and red cherries pop on the palate alongside lots of earthy flavors of wet clay. The tannins need a bit of mellowing still.",89,Fallbrook 2012 Dalla Collina Gracie Hill Vineyard Red (South Coast)
"Ripe and full in the mouth, this is a yellow fruit and citrus flavored wine. Tangy, salty and textured, it also has a rich feel with its peach and kiwi accents. It's a wine for aging, so drink from 2017.",90,Domaine Loew 2012 Bruderbach Clos des Frères Riesling (Alsace)
"Smooth and supple, this wine has structure and tannin so well cushioned by the ripe fruits and fine acidity. The structure and tannins are integrated into the rich red fruits and dark plum juiciness. The aftertaste, with an elegant freshness, brings the balance together. Drink from 2018.",93,Domaine Jean Grivot 2013 Roncières Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges)
"Expressive notes of white pepper, watercress and citrus make this a quintessential and zippy Weinviertel Grüner, where the variety is known in the local dialect as “Pfefferl”, i.e. little pepper.",90,Ebner-Ebenauer 2013 Hermanschachern Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel)
"This is a bold and powerful yet layered and nuanced wine, with hints of green peppercorn, tobacco leaf, cigar box and leather that add depth and interest to the cassis and brambly blackberry core. The gripping palate offers structured, mouthcoating tannins that are framed by ample acidity and ripe black berry tones. Notes of spicy black licorice and espresso unfold on the long finish. It's delicious now, but this will age beautifully through 2020.",93,Glenelly 2011 Lady May Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch)
"Firm and structured, this dense and dark wine offers ripe black fruits and a concentrated texture. It also shows good acidity and the fruitiness of 2011, giving a wine that is both rich and fresh. Age and drink from 2017.",93,Domaine Chanson 2011 Clos des Mouches Premier Cru  (Beaune)
"Tasted from a half bottle, the rich and complex flavors of Brut La Française show just that extra touch of maturity. The wine has peach and almond flavors that contrast well with the taut, nervy edge. It's full in the mouth and ripe, and works well both as an apéritif and a food Champagne.",90,Taittinger NV La Française Brut  (Champagne)
"This pleasant Merlot is a little tough and gritty, but it's rich and candied in blackberry and cherry, roasted almond and vanilla flavors. Give it some time to breathe in the glass.",86,Robert Mondavi 2010 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Nectarine, apricot and botrytis aromas are sound but familiar. Round, full but not quite sticky, this tastes like toffee, honey and pear, with baking spice flavors, nutmeg in particular, on the finish.",88,Viña Requingua 2013 Toro de Piedra Grand Reserve Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Curicó Valley)
"Vanilla, baking spice, cranberry and cherry aromas lead to soft, medium-bodied fruit flavors with an elegant styling. It's a very pretty representation of the vintage with good balance.",89,Market Vineyards 2011 Arbitrage Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Dry herb and spice aromas precede a solid, drawn-down palate, with lively acidity and flavors of medium-dark berry, toast and herb. Modest in intensity, this is composed.",85,Zinio 2008  Rioja
"A tongue-scraping, bone-dry style reminiscent of an Australian Riesling, this aromatic, juicy and lightly effervescent wine tastes of citrus fruits and skins, along with hints of grapefruit and cucumber. There's plenty of acidity to cut through rich sauces.",88,Penner-Ash 2008 Riesling (Willamette Valley)
"Subdued aromas of French oak, toast and acacia waft out of the glass. The rather lean palate offers oak-driven spice, chopped herb and a hint of citrus set against racy acidity. It's rather shy on fruit richness.",86,Poggio Alloro 2014 Le Mandorle Riserva  (Vernaccia di San Gimignano)
"Continues Martin Ray's track record with this bottling, an elegant, likable Pinot Noir that appeals for its silky texture and forward fruit. Cherry, currant, toasty oak, vanilla and white chocolate flavors end with a spicy, clean finish.",88,Martin Ray 2006 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Made with dried Garganega grapes, this has delicate aromas suggesting dried white flowers, ripe fig and a whiff of cake spice. The rounded palate offers mature apricot, acacia honey and light touch of cinnamon.",88,Ca' Rugate 2014 La Perlara  (Recioto di Soave)
"90-92 Barrel sample. The juicy blackcurrant flavors of the year show through here, the wine a firm balance between juicy fruit and the driest of tannins.",91,Château les Ormes de Pez 2009 Barrel sample  (Saint-Estèphe)
"A dark core of black plum, blueberry and violet marks the nose of this single-vineyard bottling. The palate showcases purple fruit and floral notes, with concentrated black plum skin and more violet leading the way.",88,Epiphany 2014 Hampton Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"This is a dark, intensely astringent wine with so much grape and oak tannin that it's challenging to enjoy now. Since PV is known as a grape that provides color and tannin in Bordeaux wines, it's no wonder that it's so stiff today. It will drink best after 2020.",87,Parducci 2013 Reserve Petit Verdot (Mendocino)
"With a pretty pink-salmon color, this Pinot Noir-based blush is rich and full-bodied. It has considerable weight for a bubbly, but the acidity and freshness and yeasty tang lift it up to Champagne elegance. Impossible not to fall in love with this raspberry-scented beauty, but why wouldn't you want to?",94,Schramsberg 2007 Brut Rosé Sparkling (North Coast)
"Fruity, crisp, this is a classic Provence rosé. It is packed with fragrant raspberry fruits, bright acidity and a bright, warm, sun-drenched aftertaste. Drink now.",85,Barton & Guestier 2011 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Split pea and earthy mushroom give way to sparkling acidity and a bright, flush taste of lemon and grapefruit in this succulent white, low in oak imprint. This is a food-friendly wine that can stand on its own, complex and layered with a citrus-squeezed finish.",90,Kunde 2015 Block 4SB20 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Valley)
"Lightly smoky, this is an attractive, simple and fruity Chablis. It has apple and pear flavors balanced with soft acidity. Smooth and round, it's a wine for medium-term aging, so drink now–2018.",85,Domaine L. Chatelain 2012  Chablis
"A layered, somewhat delicate nose of rose petals, purple flowers, cola spice and raspberry-laced chocolate serves as the introduction to this bottling. Cherry, cranberry and raspberry emerge subtly on the sip, lifted by potpourri and sagebrush that fit into a chalky and tight structure. This will age very well.",92,Stephen Ross 2015 Bien Nacido Vineyards Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"This wine by winemaker and owner Dan Kessler offers a zesty nose of crushed boysenberry, black raspberry, scarlet rose petal, wild sage and a touch of violet. There is lots of fresh zip to the sip, where woody elderberries and black plum are lifted by mint and more lively violet character. The finish is laced with juniper.",93,Kessler-Haak 2012 Ohana Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Made from Pinot Noir, this blush is dry and low in alcohol, with a great burst of acidity. It's a fun wine, but the strawberry and watermelon flavors, unfortunately, are thin.",84,Tedeschi 2012 Rosé (Sonoma Coast)
"This is just the second time that this winery has released a Dolcetto, both sourced from the Dwelley vineyard. It's a very pretty wine, the color of Pinot Noir, and captures some of the feminine elegance of that grape as well. Scents of fresh crushed raspberries rise from the glass, lightly dusted with cocoa. Complex details of fresh herb add further interest.",90,Walla Walla Vintners 2011 Dolcetto (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Fans of Moscato will like this bubbly, semidry version. With a syrupy profile and aromas of artificial vanilla, it offers plenty of juicy fruit.",84,Allure NV Bubbly Moscato (California)
"A light salmon color, aromas like sliced peaches and watermelon, flavors like canteloupe and a smooth texture combine for a substantive rosé that's not just a light thirst quencher. It is more rich and less tart than many others.",86,Sanglier Cellars 2014 Sun Tusque Dry Rosé (Sonoma County)
"Butterscotch, vanilla, spiced apple and wood-grain aromas make up an intriguing bouquet. This has lemony acidity and weight to go with leesy lime and apple flavors that turn cidery on the finish.",88,Bodegas Muriel 2010 Viña Muriel Reserva Chardonnay (Rioja)
"Dark berry, rose petal, tilled soil, aromatic herb, leather and a whiff of game are just some of the aromas you'll find on this intense, full-bodied wine. The palate is still tight, showing wild cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, baking spice and tobacco alongside firm tannins that need time to unwind. It already has depth but will develop even more complexity over the next decade and more. Drink 2018–2027.",93,Cascina delle Rose 2012 Rio Sordo  (Barbaresco)
"A signature wine created by Domingos Soares Franco of J.M. da Fonseca to celebrate Portuguese blends, this is superb, a powerhouse of complex flavors, fresh, dark and elegant all at the same time. It is firm but not overpowering, finished by smooth toast, dark and powerful.",94,José Maria da Fonseca 2003 Hexagon Red (Terras do Sado)
"This shows wonderfully layered, complex flavors, in addition to great structure. Thoroughly dry, with rich, fine tannins, it flatters with red and black currant, red cherry, milk chocolate, licorice, root beer, vanilla, dusty spice and smoky oak flavors. Luscious now and through 2010.",93,Beringer 2004 Alluvium Red Table Wine Red (Knights Valley)
"Aromas of wild berry, violet, rose and Mediterranean herb lead the nose of this easy drinking, polished red. The juicy palate doles out blackberry, black cherry, white pepper and star anise while bright acidity and supple tannins offer support. Drink through 2017.",90,Poggio Scalette 2013  Chianti Classico
"Long Island Malbec occupies an unusual place in the spectrum of global wine, showing little resemblance to its cousins in Argentina or France. This one is deeply concentrated, with forward blackberry and cherry flavors—clearly showing its New World identity—yet grounded in acidity and a dark, savory mineral tone. It's a promising wine with light footed elegance.",89,Bedell 2013 Malbec (North Fork of Long Island)
"Floral, spicy plum aromas come with notes of lemon and chili pepper. This Tempranillo is rudimentary, with a creamy, pasty palate. Baked cherry and berry flavors end with almost syrupy thickness and a touch of chocolate flavor.",84,Montalvo Wilmot 2013 MW Quintos de la Tejera Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"With its zingy acidity and ripe raspberry and cherry flavors, this Pinot Noir has a sweet-and-sour quality that's reminiscent of Chinese sauce for pork or chicken. Drink now.",85,Shadowbox 2009 Anne Katherina Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"Aromas of tomato, spiced cherry, leather and fresh herbs are clean and appealing. A standard, balanced mouthfeel is medium in body, with dry, woody flavors of peppery plum and berry fruits. Minty and darker on the finish.",86,Bodegas Navarro López 2011 Pergolas Old Vines Crianza Tempranillo (Valdepeñas)
"Orange-marmalade aromas set the stage for a rather full-bodied, dry and flavorful wine. Floral and fruity elements are counter-balanced by a tangy texture and subtle mineral accents. A classic of the type, it has a lot of personality, a great presence on the palate and a lingering finish.",91,Dry Creek Vineyard 2016 Dry Chenin Blanc (Clarksburg)
"Juicy black and red cherry flavors enwrap classic cedar, graphite and peppercorn notes in this brawny, full-bodied wine. Accessible despite its bulk of tannin, its texture leans leathery, with clove scents lingering long on the finish.",92,Castello di Amorosa 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"The Reserva version of the popular Borba brand in Portugal is a dense, powerfully tannic wine. Its juicy black currant and blackberry fruits are suffused with tannins—its dry core surrounded by richness. Hints of dark chocolate and pepper come from the alcohol but certainly don't take away from the great fruitiness of the wine. Drink from 2019.",93,J. Portugal Ramos 2014 Marquês de Borba Reserva Red (Alentejo)
"A blend of several vineyards, this was aged for 17 months in French oak. The barrel influence is subtle, but the time in wood has helped to round out the tannins. The strawberry and raspberry fruit still has sharp edges and an herbal streak, bumping up against a smooth, chocolaty finish.",88,Torii Mor 2012 Deux Verres Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This inky, thick and well- extracted wine (made from Casavecchia grapes) offers very pretty aromas of dark chocolate, prune, exotic spice and black jammy fruit. The tannins are soft and polished and the wine performs even better after a few minutes in the glass.",90,Terre del Principe 2007 Centomoggia Casavecchia (Terre del Volturno)
"This fresh, young and fruity wine is made to be drunk young. It has soft tannins and intense acidity, mitigated by the ripe, red fruits and smoky aftertaste.",86,Domaine Rotier 2013 Esquisse Red (Gaillac)
"Aromas of pressed Spanish broom, oak, marzipan and citrus blend in the glass. The rich, medium-bodied palate offers candied nectarine zest, vanilla and toasted almond alongside bright acidity. Drink now or hold for a few more years.",88,Casalfarneto 2012 Crisio Riserva  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico)
"Blackberry and cherry notes are fresh and primary in this Merlot-based Bordeaux blend, but shaded with interesting notes of coffee and smoke. The palate is juicy and supple with soft, furry tannins that accentuate a velvety mouthfeel. It's a boldly structured wine, but elegantly framed and long on the finish.",87,Baiting Hollow Farm Vineyard 2010 Horse Rescue Mirage Red (North Fork of Long Island)
"Compost, rubber and stalky berry aromas come through the nose to the mouth. The palate is tight and tannic. The finish is narrow, hinting at stalky berry aromoas.",84,Pinuaga 2013 Nature Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"The aromas are bright and generous, with notes of honeysuckle and canned peach. The fruit is so sweet on the palate, it drinks almost off dry, with abundant stone-fruit and floral flavors that linger.",87,Martinez & Martinez 2015 Tudor Hills Vineyard Viognier (Yakima Valley)
"Lightly fruity and fresh, a wine that has some crisp acidity although without much definition. The aftertaste is clean, bringing out attractive citrus and red currant fruits. Screwcap.",84,Château d'Haurets 2012 Red (Bordeaux Rosé)
"While it has sufficient tannin, the wine also has a feeling of generous black currant and berry fruits. It's dry with considerable concentration, but it's future looks good, so keep for 5–6 years.",88,Château la Croix Saint-Pierre 2010 Grande Réserve  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"What a powerfully lovely, lilting and blockbuster of a wine this is. Seamless in baked rhubarb and a velvety texture it never stops impressing, allowing for nuanced explosions of black cherry and Asian spice to coat the palate and become more complex the longer each sip lingers. Deliciously drinkable now, the wine will take on additional wow factor over time.",95,Dehlinger 2013 Champ de Mars Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Well on the dry side of brut, this wine pushes acidity and the freshest citrus along with an apple-skin texture. It shows some bottle age toastiness, while offering a delicious bright finish.",90,J. Dumangin Fils NV Extra Brut Premier Cru  (Champagne)
"Made from 56% Pinot Noir and 44% Chardonnay and given multiple extra years in bottle, this wine offers a substantial body weight within crisp well-defined acidity. Apple skin, bread dough and a note of hazelnut combine to afford warm welcoming flavor. Zero sugar is added.",91,Longboard NV Late Disgorged Brut Zero Sparkling (Russian River Valley)
"An old vine field blend from the family-owned estate, this wine is dense with both tannin and ripe black fruit. Plum and blackberry flavors are balanced by acidity and chalky texture. Drink now.",92,Quinta Dona Matilde 2011 Red (Douro)
"Floral currant and plum aromas fall squarely into the red-fruit spectrum. While not overly deep or dense, this has some weight to go with flavors of cassis, berry and chocolaty oak. It finishes mildly, with soft oak and a light herbal note.",88,TintoNegro 2014 Malbec (Uco Valley)
"Quite an interesting Chardonnay, in an era when so many are too sweet and extracted. There's plenty of orange and apricot fruit flavor, but also a brilliant streak of minerality, like a lick of cold steel, and the overall taste is dry. Really easy to like, with lots of complexity to warrant repeated sipping.",92,Corvalle 2010 Weka Ranch Vineyard Chardonnay (Oak Knoll District)
"A Cabernet of strong olive, oak and cassis aromas, medium in weight with smoky overtones that tastes a bit hotter than it is.",84,Pavilion Crossing 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi)
"Big, bold, brawny yet strangely elegant, this Zin holds plenty of appeal. The vineyard is 96 years old, giving the wine unusual concentration and complexity. It's one of the winery's riper 2011 Zins, massive in wild raspberries, cherries and prunes, with spicy notes of black pepper and a nice touch of smoky oak.",92,Hartford Court 2011 Old Vine Dina's Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"The best Still Waters release right now, this presents a sophisticated nose of cherry chutney, black pepper, blueberry and burning sagebrush. On the palate, blueberry fruit gets dashed with more black sage and tobacco, and the acidity and tannins are just right.",93,Still Waters 2009 Reflections of Still Waters Estate Grown Red (Paso Robles)
"Now definitely mature, even drying up, this wine needs to be drunk now. It has developed a dry, tannic character, woody and stalky, although its balance is still there and the aftertaste has some juiciness.",84,Château Roullet 2007  Canon-Fronsac
"A perfumed wine with wood aging flavors over citrus. From the Vinho Verde region, it's a curious hybrid of a wine, neither crisp enough nor rich enough.",82,Casca Wines 2009 Monte Cascas Reserva Branco White (Minho)
"Bright, generous and intense, this offers shadings of spice and leather around dried berry and cola aromas. The overall effect is that of power, complexity and balance.",92,Negretti 2006  Barolo
"Very rich and oaky, with bigtime flavors of grilled pineapples and peaches, pears, buttered toast and oak spices. Only 250 cases produced.",87,Sunstone 2007 Reserve Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County)
"Rich, fruity and soft, this wine has a tang of orange peel along with ripe citrus and red fruits. Fresh and crisp at the end, it is ready to drink.",88,Yves Leccia 2015 Domaine D'E Croce Rosé (Patrimonio)
"A strong, insistent Chardonnay, brimming with oak, acidity and very ripe tangerine, pineapple, Asian pear, lime and honey flavors. It's dry and tart, with a mineral edge. Should develop for a few years.",90,Patz & Hall 2009 Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Feels hot and Porty in the mouth, although it's very dry, with bitter raisinskin and shriveled cherry flavors. The alcohol approaches 16%.",81,Gia Domella 2007 Reserve Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"This wine is crisp, taut and with a strong mineral texture. Spice and green-fruit flavors are shot through with acidity and have a steely edge. Hold the wine until late 2017 for it to soften.",85,Château la Verrière 2016  Bordeaux Blanc
"Dark for a rosé, and heavy in texture, with berry and cocoa flavors. Lacks charm, but at least it's dry.",82,Vinum 2009 Rosé of Cabernet Sauvignon Rosé (California)
"This blend of Syrah and Grenache bears ripe, forward flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, dried currant, anise and cedar. The tannins are massive, but ripe and sweet, and there is a green note that gives the wine some bitterness.",87,Epiphany 2010 Revelation Red (Santa Barbara County)
"Black as a cave and thick as jam, this wine offers a decadence of black licorice and chocolate truffle, aged entirely in new French oak for 30 months. Fruit plays a supporting part to the richness, making for a wine that's a dessert in itself.",92,On Q 2012 Appassionata Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville)
"A classic Napa Valley Bordeaux blend, dry, smooth, complex and elegant. Based on Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, it's an instant pleaser, from the dryness and mellow texture to the delicious blackberry, cassis, plum, dark chocolate and smoky oak flavors. It will provide wonderful drinking over many years.",95,Chimney Rock 2009 Elevage Red (Stags Leap District)
"The valley is in a remote, warm part of Napa County. The wine is quite good. Rich and softly opulent, it offers waves of red cherry, raspberry, chocolate, orange tea, anise and Asian spice flavors that go on and on. Not an ager, but delicious now and through 2011 or so.",91,Harrington 2006 Wild Horse Valley Pinot Noir (Napa County)
"Made with 90% Sangiovese and 10% Ciliegiolo, this opens with blackberry and Mediterranean brush aromas. The easygoing palate delivers red cherry and clove alongside chewy tannins. Enjoy soon.",87,Perazzeta 2014 Sara Red (Toscana)
"Delicate, subdued and feminine, here is a luminous sparkler with pretty floral tones and light shadings of stone fruit and melon. You'll love its delicate, creamy texture and long peachy finish.",86,Malibràn NV Gorio Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
"Grown on granite soil that is shot through with quartz, this is the epitome of a mineral, structured wine. On top of that texture, the wine has ripe lemon and green plum fruits that are full of juicy flavor. The wine is so fresh it could do with a few months aging. Drink from late 2016.",87,Rui Roboredo Madeira 2014 Beyra Reserva Quartz White (Beira Interior)
"This is Rochioli's basic Pinot Noir. It's a beautiful wine, marked by great structure and accessible fruit. Near-perfect acids and tannins lend it elegance, while the cherry and cola flavors have a rich touch of smoky oak. Drink now.",91,Rochioli 2009 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
Layers of new wood dominate the aromas and flavor of this wine. They smother the fruit leaving a question mark over its future.,84,Château Lavillotte 2011  Saint-Estèphe
"Aromas of plum, blackberry, violet and exotic spice jump out of the glass. The bright, polished palate offers black cherry, raspberry jam and black pepper alongside fresh acidity. It's made for immediate drinking pleasure so enjoy soon.",88,Conterno Fantino 2014 Vignota  (Barbera d'Alba)
"A lemon flavored wine that is soft and fruity. With its zesty, tight texture and really crisp acidity, the wine is lively and crisp. Drinkable now, it will be better from early 2017.",86,J. Portugal Ramos 2015 Vila Santa Lois White (Alentejano)
"There's a slight, lithe line of butterscotch on the nose of this bottling, with lots of lemon blossoms and Meyer lemon juice overshadowing the buttery aspect. The palate is tart in green apple and Anjou pear flavors, followed by honeydew and white peach.",90,Point & Line 2015 Sierra Madre Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"Stalky, gritty aromas of olive, eucalyptus and berry fruits are 100% Chilean. This feels big, wide and tannic. Flavors of roasted berry fruits are stalky and herbal, while this finishes with peppery, herbal overtones and gritty, chewy tannins. Drink through 2021.",90,Viña Tarapacá 2013 Gran Reserva Etiqueta Negra Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"This wine is a blend of Sangiovese (69%), Cabernet Sauvignon (17%) and Syrah. Dried raspberry, herb and cocoa aromas lead to reserved cranberry and cherry flavors that linger.",88,Brian Carter Cellars 2011 Tuttorosso Red (Yakima Valley)
"Produced from Henry Fessy's own cru vineyards, the wine is fruity and very accessible to drink young. Generous berry fruits and soft tannins make this an attractive wine. The aftertaste brings in light acidity. Drink now.",86,Henry Fessy 2015  Brouilly
"From 130-year-old vines, this is a densely layered, bigtime Zin. The flavor concentration is just tremendous, a critical mass of briary, wild blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate, licorice and fabulous Asian spice. True, the alcohol is on the high side, but the wine finishes balanced and dry. Will take up to 10 years of cellaring.",92,Sausal 2005 Century Vines Zinfandel (Alexander Valley)
"Delicate scents of blue flower, red berry and pressed powder float out of the glass. The palate shows good structure for the vintage, offering juicy wild cherry, anise and a hint of chopped herb accompanied by lithe tannins and bright acidity. Drink through 2017.",88,I Sodi 2014  Chianti Classico
"This bottling from a vineyard northwest of the Sta. Rita Hills opens with buttercream, lemon peel, lime spritz and toasted almond scents. The buttery quality extends to the full but energetic palate, where it's cut by lemon marmalade, savory smoke and toast notes. The finish is nutty.",91,Cebada 2013 Chardonnay (Santa Ynez Valley)
"This isn't a big, powerful, long-aging Pinot Noir. It doesn't have the flash and pizazz of more famous and expensive bottlings. What it is, is an awfully good wine that shows Pinot's silky, spicy fruit qualities in a modest way. Like a great supporting actor, it will be happy to let the food take center stage.",87,Clos du Bois 2006 Sonoma Reserve Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Lovely, dense aromas of dried flowers, herbs, cherries and chocolate immediately capture attention. This is a superbly elegant wine, with both precision and power. Orange-peel flavors highlight deep cherry compote, with tension, balance and length in abundance.",93,CedarCreek 2012 Block 2 Platinum Pinot Noir (Okanagan Valley)
"With no oak influence, this Cabernet Franc is chock full of pristine raspberry and cherry notes. It's quite concentrated on the palate with deep, ripe red-fruit flavor, but marked by tart cranberry acidity and a long, lingering finish and just a hint of leafy green notes.",89,Lamoreaux Landing 2010 Estate Bottled T23 Unoaked Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes)
"Pretty decent for a 10-spot, with slightly floral aromas, a hint of ginger and underripe pear fruit. It's medium bodied, with a dry, lightly textured, bitter finish. Drink now.",85,Oxford Landing 2016 Pinot Grigio (South Australia)
"Still tight and closed up, this wine has potential, offering ripe citrus and white fruits and nervy, tangy texture. Concentrated and dense, it's a wine for the long term; drink from 2020. Olivier is a large medieval hunting estate that, since the 19th century, has belonged to the Bethmann family. The 148 acres of vines and forests are managed environmentally.",93,Château Olivier 2013  Pessac-Léognan
"This rich wine has both open, ripe black fruits and the freshness of the vintage. On top, there is an extra layer of color and exuberance. It includes some Petit Verdot, rare in Saint-Émilion.",88,Château de Fonbel 2011  Saint-Émilion
"Medium-bodied, spicy and peppery, this offers dark plum and earthy leather, the fruit tasting quite ripe.",86,Taj 2008 Syrah (Los Carneros)
"This is a barrel selection, and as such, may be expected to show extra layers of concentration—more stuffing overall. It's a rich, smoky, lush wine, with a complex mix of red fruits ranging from rhubarb to raspberry to Bing cherries. Spicy highlights and a frame of orange peel also enter the picture. You might wish to give this another couple of years of bottle age before popping the cork. Drink 2018–2025.",92,Elk Cove 2014 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Impressively rich and ripe in fruit, offering waves of black cherries and chocolate. Feels soft and lush and luxurious in the mouth, with a sweet oak finish. Certainly dazzles with opulence, but the softness and sweetness makes you wonder about its ageability. So drink between now and 2013 for freshness.",91,Monticello Vineyards 2008 Tietjen Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"Dusty and still fairly fresh, but with that said this wine was certainly more in its prime six or eight months ago. Now it is slick but softening, with peach and citrus flavors doing their thing without much edge or kick.",86,Bodegas Faustino 2006 Faustino V Rosado Tempranillo (Rioja)
"Flower petal, mineral and blackberry aromas solidify the bouquet on this excellent Tempranillo. The palate is big and chewy, with fine balance and driving flavors of cherry, plum, vanilla and oak resin. With a finish that's bone dry and focused, this Ribera wine is ready to drink but can last another 5–8 years in a good cellar.",91,Protos 2006 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)
"This wine is lively and spicy, with cranberry and cherry flavors, juicy acidity and a strong impression of citrus. The tannins are firm and balanced, with a hint of stem showing through the finish.",89,Samuel Robert 2015 Vintner's Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Fruity and herbal in flavor and generous in texture, this is medium to full bodied and quite smooth in mouth feel. It smells like currants, black olives and dried herbs, and tastes a bit savory and complex along with the plummy fruit flavors.",86,HandCraft 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"This blend of 60% Pinot Noir and 40% Chardonnay from the Fess Parker team offers lemon blossom, baking soda and lime zest aromas on the light and flowery nose. Broad flavors of yellow apple and pear meet with a citrus twist on the finish.",90,Fesstivity 2014 Brut Cuvée Sparkling (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Here's a strongly flavored Merlot, made with ultraripe fruit. If it didn't have a good structure, the blackberry, currant, mocha and anise flavors alone would make it a fruit bomb. Fortunately, fine acidity and gorgeously thick tannins give it structure and backbone. Best for a year or two.",90,Crane Brothers 2005 Crane Ranch Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Ripe dark-skinned berry, French oak, espresso and coconut aromas emerge in the glass. Youthful and taut, the palate doles out Marasca cherry, crushed raspberry, truffle and vanilla flavors, set against a frame of tightly knit, refined tannins.",88,Talosa 2015  Rosso di Montepulciano
"Nothing like an Argentine Malbec, but not a bad wine. It's marked by high acidity that gives it a real bite, and exceptional dryness. Yet there's a good core of blackberry fruit. A rich steak will tease out the sweetness.",86,McManis 2010 Malbec (California)
"The 2015 version of this wine has scored big in New Zealand wine competitions, but this vintage is best consumed soon. It still retains a lovely, slightly creamy texture, but the aromas and flavors are trending toward sweet peas and green tomatoes. Drink up.",85,Starborough 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Made with organically farmed grapes, this opens with alluring scents of honeysuckle, hawthorn and white stone fruit. The silky palate delivers white peach, nectarine and green apple framed in bright acidity and a delicately foaming mousse.",90,Perlage 2016 Col di Manza Extra Dry  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Soft, smooth and forward, this tasty wine shows light and clean flavors of strawberry and raspberry, finishing with a lovely lick of caramel. It's immediately enjoyable, and should be consumed over the next two or three years.",88,Torii Mor 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Crunchy and somewhat bitter, this has tight citrus rind flavors and a whiff of vanilla. A small percentage of the blend spent a bit of time in neutral oak.",85,Yamhill Valley 2012 Pinot Blanc (McMinnville)
"A project of Master Sommelier Geoff Kruth with the assistance of winemaker Megan Glaab of Ryme Cellars, this is a light beguiling take on the famous appellation's most famous variety—one wrapped in crisp crunchy red fruit and floral aromatics of rose. Dried cherry highlights tight focused acidity and soft delicate layers of silky texture for a satisfying combination of elegance and quiet oak.",93,Lost and Found Winery 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Solid and powerful, it has a great mix of very ripe fruit with dense tannins. Blackberry fruits, laced with licorice and dark chocolate, contrast with a juicy, lightly herbal element. This mainly Merlot wine is destined for a fine future. Drink from 2017.",91,Château de Roquebrune 2010 Cuvée Reine  (Lalande de Pomerol)
"A stunning effort from Beckstoffer's famously gravelly site, this is a 100% varietal wine from one clone, made in a tiny amount. Exquisite aromas of blackberry and leather surround a velvety texture and spiky acidity, the tannins integrated and lengthy, with room to grow over time. Powerfully full bodied, this is a classic representation of the valley in expansive celebration of a ridiculously good vintage. Drink now through 2023.",94,Guarachi Family 2013 Beckstoffer Las Piedras Heritage Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
"Named after a parcel of vines, this youthful, fruity wine is on its way to being delicious. It has a proper steely character, shot through with acidity and minerality while the citrus character is strong and firm. Drink from 2015.",90,Michel Vattan 2012 Les L-O  (Sancerre)
"The spicy, evocative scent of Seville orange peel entices from the first sniff. The palate is dry, restrained and sylph-like but with time reveals tangerine and lemon zest. This is a feast, a celebration of citrus flavors, unfolding and shimmering at every moment. This is dry but faceted, taut but playful. Irresistible now but with a brilliant, aromatic and totally seductive future ahead. Drink 2016–2030.",95,Domaine Schoffit 2014 Rangen Grand Cru Clos Saint Théobald Riesling (Alsace)
"It's a shame more producers don't hold their Pinot Noirs back longer, for this bottling from Joe Davis reveals so much depth compared to current releases. Raspberry, rose petal, cola and cinnamon stick show on the nose, while the palate offers rounded flavors of dried strawberry, thyme and game. It's all intricately woven by time into something wonderful.",95,Arcadian 2009 Sierra Madre Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"This is a sweet, soft Port, with plenty of fruit. Sultana and orange jelly flavors are cut with some spirit. The wine leans much more towards fruit than wood, unusual for a 20-year old. The wine, like all aged tawnies, is ready to drink.",87,Messias NV 20 Anos Tawny  (Port)
"A return to pure, single vineyard Sauvignon Blanc. With alcohol at 12.5% this dry wine is quite European in style. Elegant, lively and fresh, with a cool mix of cucumber, melon and green apple fruit flavors.",88,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2010 Horse Heaven Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Horse Heaven Hills)
"There's a very likable umami character to the nose of this wine, its soy and black pepper touches playing well with the lilac and dark fruit aromas. A blend of 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Petit Verdot, 17% Malbec, 6% Cabernet Franc and 1% Merlot, it offers bright blackberry and black cherry flavors on the palate, which transition to soy and sarsaparilla notes on the finish.",88,Proximity Twenty Six 2013 Red (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Light, bright and with lively acidity, this is already a juicy, delicious wine. It offers good fruitiness, with pink grapefruit flavors and a tangy, zesty aftertaste. Drink now.",88,Château Merlet 2016  Bordeaux Blanc
"This wine shows an intriguing touch of flinty, fumé character as well as ample melon and fig fruit. It's reasonably full bodied and textured for a wine of its ilk.",89,Cape Mentelle 2012 Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Margaret River)
"A very juicy, fruity, light wine that shows spice and fresh black currant fruits. The acidity is a major element in this cool year wine.",87,Zull 2007 Zweigelt (Niederösterreich)
"There's a lot of individuality to this wine, just not all good. The nose has cigar box and over-the-top sweet and baked aromas, yet the palate has a grating, acidic feel but also spice and raisiny flavors. All of it makes you more confused than confident; it has its good traits but seems out of whack.",84,Indomita 2008 Duette Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère (Maipo Valley)
"The gold luster is eye grabbing, and the nose doesn't back off as it yields cream, vanilla and toast atop tropical fruit. The mouth is full, with creamy pear and apple fruit and lots of oak. It's on the plus side in terms of power and weight, but it's largely balanced and clean.",86,Porta 2000 Chardonnay (Cachapoal Valley)
"Cavallotto didn't make any Barolo in the 2014 vintage due to the cold rainy weather so the firm's best grapes went into this vibrant polished Nebbiolo. It opens with enticing scents of rose, perfumed berry, chopped herb and a whiff of tilled soil that follow through to the racy medium-bodied palate along with crushed raspberry, cherry, star anise and mineral. It's nicely balanced, with firm acidity and taut refined tannins. Drink through 2020.",90,Cavallotto 2014 Nebbiolo (Langhe)
"Apple and other white-fruit aromas are appealing. The palate on this well-priced wine is nice and juicy, with a typical blend of green apple, peach and citrus flavors. This is fresh, minerally and linear on the finish. Drink now.",88,Con un Par 2011 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Brooding notes of black, crunchy cherry along with wood smoke and fir rise from the glass. On the palate there is a vein of tart, lively freshness that draws earthy smoke and full fruit notes towards the core, leaving shadows of smoke and fir, cherry, blueberry and white pepper around the fringes. Freshness is far more of a defining factor than silky tannins. This is authentic, unforced and very fresh.",94,Gernot and Heike Heinrich 2013 Alter Berg Blaufränkisch (Burgenland)
"Cured meat, game and mentholated herbal aromas lead on the nose of this Shiraz-Grenache-Mourvèdre blend, backed by fruity notes of red currant, plum and cherry. Those fruit-based aromas carry through to the round, approachable palate, with soft tannins and a peppered-mocha flavor that lingers on the finish. Drink now.",88,Ken Forrester 2007 Renegade G-S-M (Stellenbosch)
"Old-style Carmenère with green bean, mocha and muddy berry aromas. Tight and more acidic than expected, with generic red berry, chocolate and mocha flavors along with a palpable wave of green. Finishes quick and crisp.",84,San Elias 2010 Carmenère (Central Valley)
"Grillo Parlante (“talking cricket”) is a pure expression of Grillo with slightly oxidized aromas of butterscotch and caramel. Fresh fruit comes through as melon, apricot and candied lemon.",83,Fondo Antico 2009 Grillo Parlante Grillo (Sicilia)
"Coming from five different Syrah vineyards across the Columbia Valley, this wine offers high quality and value. It conveys black olives, iron, an earthy funk, chocolate and floral accents. The coffee and earth flavors are rich while still showing exquisite restraint.",91,Two Vintners 2012 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A pretty, expressive nose of fresh flowers, citrus and kiwi gives this Assyrtico added appeal. On the palate, slightly sweet tropical fruit and flowers will appeal to fans of a less bracing style of white. Pair with poultry, fruit.",85,Greek Wine Cellars 2010 Assyrtico (Santorini)
"This wine is reduced and somewhat flat in tone, with simple, light-bodied ripeness and plum and raspberry flavors.",84,Rutherford Ranch 2014 Two Range Red (Napa Valley)
"A generous helping of spicy new oak aromas and flavors dominates the taste of this full-bodied, broadly textured wine. Beyond the baking spices, more subtle meaty flavors come out with a second sip.",87,Terra d'Oro 2012 Red (Amador County)
"A rather closed nose gives way to a very light-bodied, lime-zest scented and pure palate that boasts the slightest shimmer of pepperiness and enhances its light-footed, barely-there credentials with the tiniest hint of fizz. If you like it light, clean and yet flavorful, this is for you.",90,Weszeli 2015 Langenlois Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"This small-quantity selection from within the Charles Vineyard was fermented by native yeast, and neither fined nor filtered. It is quite aromatic, full bodied and moderately fruity, and has a nice rounded mouthfeel, generous red-cherry and spice flavors and good structure from acidity and mild tannins. Tart cherry lingers on the finish.",91,Foursight 2013 Charles Vineyard Clone 05 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Named after the cherry trees that edge this vineyard, the wine is rich and structured. It has concentrated butts and ripe black-cherry flavors. Full bodied and with an aging potential, this fine wine should be drunk from 2018.",92,Pascal Aufranc 2015 Les Cerisiers Vieilles Vignes  (Juliénas)
"Almost tropical overtones on the nose announce ample pure fruit. Russet pear has both a touch of fresh Amalfi lemon and luscious honey. Yet the palate is slender, taut and dry. A lovely evocation of the varietal richness of Pinot Gris, framed on very light feet with elegance and poise. Totally appetizing, dry and moreish.",92,Domaine Pfister 2015 Tradition Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Simple and jammy, with sharp flavors of raspberries, cherries, gingersnap cookies and spices. Tasty and sweet, but lacking the structure to contain all that richness.",84,Lava Cap 2007 Merlot (El Dorado)
"While initially subdued on the nose, this zesty citrus-kissed Riesling offers loads of lemon and lime vitality. It's crisp and light bodied with a finish that's dry and mineral.",89,Silver Thread 2015 STV Estate Vineyard Riesling (Seneca Lake)
"Finely balanced wine, showing the warmth of 2009 as well as keeping bright peach, pink grapefruit and red berry fruit flavors. The wine shows lively final acidity for a delicious aftertaste.",91,Château les Valentines 2009 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This cuvée is a barrel selection, fermented with whole berries and aged in 35% new oak. Simple strawberry and raspberry fruit seems almost weightless, and the quick finish carries a strong streak of bouillon.",86,Maison L'Envoyé 2015 The Attaché Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"A subtle note of caramel adds richness to the baked apple aromas on the nose. On the palate, hints of chamomile tisane add to the baked apple flavors. The body is taut and linear. Rounded hints of baked apple persist even on the dry, clean and fresh finish.",92,Jean-Baptiste Adam 2014 Kaefferkopf Grand Cru Vieilles Vignes Riesling (Alsace)
"What's so wonderful about this Pinot is the way it reconciles all sorts of opposites. It's dry but sweet in fruit, and delicate yet potent at the same time. It's totally accessible now, but enormously complex. Flavors of raspberries and cherries meld with pomegranates and persimmons, as well as mushrooms, tea and licorice. It's a joy to drink now, and should develop in the cellar for at least 10 years.",96,Merry Edwards 2011 Coopersmith Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Aromas seem advanced, with notes of cherry liqueur, leather, barrel spices and raisinated dark fruit. The dried-fruit flavors are full with chalky tannins. Drink now.",86,Dubindil 2012 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"Made with native grapes Ripoli, Fenile and Ginestra, this concentrated, lumbering wine opens with aromas of oak, citrus and dried apricot. The dense palate offers oak extract, candied lemon, toast, and dried stone fruit. It finishes on a sugary sweet note of rock candy and butterscotch.",87,Marisa Cuomo 2011 Fiorduva Furore Bianco White (Costa d'Amalfi)
"This 100% Lagrein opens with aromas of blackberry and exotic spice. The straightforward, juicy palate delivers black cherry and a hint of cocoa framed in smooth tannins. Enjoy soon.",89,Kössler 2015 Lagrein (Alto Adige)
"Cranberry, pomegranate and a touch of bramble are found in the nose. The palate reveals fresh fruit flavors of sour red cherry, cranberry and red plum with a pleasant acidic backbone. Drink now or hold through 2016.",90,Miloš 2006 Stagnum Plavac Mali (Peljesac)
"The variety is unmistakable on this wine, with its aromas of black currant, black cherry, dried herb and spice. The palate is fruit filled but well structured, with tart acids and a firm squeeze of tannin. Dark chocolate notes linger on the finish.",88,Disruption 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington)
"Perfectly good and pedestrian, which means it's solid but common and regular, with rubbery, sturdy berry aromas followed by medium-intensity plum flavors. With good texture and proper weight, this passes every inspection criteria but stirs little curiosity. Good wine; nothing more.",86,CVNE 2005 Cune Crianza  (Rioja)
"Sauvignon Blanc can vary in style from merely crisp and almost neutral to more herbaceous examples like this. It conveys an assertive, slightly heavy personality with plenty of herb and eucalyptus flavors, a rather soft texture for this variety and dry finish.",82,Brutocao 2013 Feliz Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino County)
"You can find aromas of purple flower, red berry and a hint of chopped herb on the nose. But the palate is thin and diluted, offering suggestions of sour cherry and a green note of powdered sage alongside fleeting tannins. It finishes on a bitter, acidic note.",84,Albatreti 2014  Rosso di Montalcino
"Outstanding concentration rides an impressive structure in this huge but well-balanced wine. Freshly picked blackberries and raspberries meet hints of chocolate, baking spices and black pepper while vivid tannins and firm acidity lift up all those flavors and carry them to a lingering finish. Compelling to drink now, it's also built to age well. Best after 2020.",93,Ruby Hill Winery 2013 Jewel Collection Series Estate Reserve Zinfandel (Livermore Valley)
"Not bad but fading. This Trebbiano-Chardonnay blend features apple aromas and flavors, and then some quince and orange around the edges. Soft, with some banana on the finish. Drink right away because it won't last much longer.",83,Los Cielos 2006 Trebbiano (Mendoza)
"Everything about this wine is singing in harmony. The nose is fresh and pure, with raspberry, plum, spice and youthful rubbery aromas. The palate is elegant and impeccably balanced, while flavors of vanilla and coconut announce ample oak, with toasty, peppery plum and raspberry flavors waiting in the wings. Power, precision and elegance are draped all over the finish. Best from 2017 through 2025.",94,Telmo Rodríguez 2010 M2 de Matallana  (Ribera del Duero)
"Taking its name from the Chevaliers d'Arce who guarded this land in the 12th and 13th centuries, the small property is now under the watchful eye of Sylviane Garcin-Cathiard. This wine is still young and just balancing out. Firm tannins are shot through with ripe berry fruits and with crisp acidity. It is a wine that is will mature well, so drink from 2019 and consider this property a rising star.",88,Château d'Arce 2014  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux
"A rich, earthy Syrah from a new Terre Rouge vineyard designate, this exhibits well-integrated dark red and blue fruit amidst tobacco and herb highlights.",89,Terre Rouge 2009 Jay Wilderotter Vineyard Syrah (Shenandoah Valley (CA))
"Bay Area biotech scientist-turned-vintner Kristie Tacey offers a solid wine with sandalwood, pomegranate and a slight bitterness on the nose. The palate also shows pomegranate along with rhubarb, backed up by graphite minerality and brown spice throughout.",92,Tessier Winery 2013 Saveria Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"With 100 g/L residual sugar, this is a pleasantly sweet Moscato, with opening aromas of rose water and jasmine that delve into sweet peach and apple on the palate. Light and soft, it will satisfy as an accompaniment to strong cheeses or salumi.",86,Enotria 2012 Moscato (Mendocino County)
"With a dash of Petite Sirah, this wine, made from century-old vineyards, is extraordinarily rich. It explodes with blackberry, cherry, raspberry, chocolate, anise, vanilla fudge, pepper and clove flavors. The wine is a little on the sweet side, but not too much.",86,Ironstone 2006 Old Vine Reserve Zinfandel (Lodi)
"Named after the matriarch of the Riboli wine family, who founded what may be the first tasting room in California, this shows light yellow fruits on the nose. The palate combines lemon and apple with a slight hue of brown spice, offering plump fruit with a tang.",87,Maddalena 2013 Chardonnay (Monterey)
"This gorgeous blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot offers beautiful intensity and impressive complexity. Aromas here include black cherry, exotic spice, leather, fine tobacco and loads of plush, ripe fruit. It's a smooth velvety wine but the tannic backbone gives it lift and staying power.",94,I Giusti e Zanza 2007 Dulcamara Red (Toscana)
"Milk chocolate, cherry and raspberry aromas lead to sweet, supple luscious fruit flavors. It keeps you coming back for more.",90,Novelty Hill 2012 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a very Douro blend for this wine from Lisboa region. It brings structure and minerality to fill out the dark-black fruits. With ripe tannins and bright acidity balancing the fruit, it is ready to drink.",88,DFJ Vinhos 2014 DFJ Touriga Nacional-Touriga Franca Red (Lisboa)
"A showy, exuberant wine, from the hot pink color to the fresh, jammy aromas to the just-sweet finish. However, it feels soft in texture and body, with mild cherry-candy and peach flavors.",86,Bliss 2013 Estate Bottled Rosé (Mendocino)
"Passion fruit, lime and feline aromas give the bouquet crispness and varietal snap. The palate is tangy, lean and somewhat dilute, with pithy grapefruit, lime and tarragon flavors. The finish shows modest cut but regular, weakly defined flavors.",85,Echeverria 2012 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"Citric on the nose, with cherry and bland earthy notes. The palate has an inoffensive feel and sweet flavors of black cherry and vanilla. That sweetness carries onto the finish, which is also candied. Generally decent but highly regular.",84,Viña el Aromo 2007 Winemaker's Selection Pinot Noir (Bío Bío Valley)
"A great example of Lodi Zin, at a great price. Shows real complexity in the blackberry, cherry, mulberry, molasses, cocoa and cola flavors, accented with exotic dusty spices. For all the richness, it's totally dry, and the alcohol level is refreshingly low.",88,Spellbound 2005 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi)
"Once again this designate amazes with a surfeit of beautifully integrated flavors. Mushrooms and baking spices adorn an explosion of strawberry pastries. There's plenty of ripe cherry fruit also, and a long, polished, lip-licking finish.",94,Adelsheim 2013 Winderlea Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"You'll love the brightness and liveliness of this wonderfully drinkable Cabernet. Sometimes these rich wines can be heavy, but this one combines tartness with its elaborate blackberry jam, anise and cedar wood flavors, which makes it sing. Perfect now with a great steak, and should age well for up to eight years.",93,Long Meadow Ranch 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Half Malbec and half Petit Verdot, the barrel notes of vanilla and pencil lead play off cherry and purple flowers with citrusy acidity and firm, dry tannins providing the frame.",88,Bunnell 2009 Petit Bec BDX Northridge Vineyard Red (Wahluke Slope)
"Stalky, slightly green aromas blend with generic berry scents to form a marginal bouquet. This is tannic and rough on the palate, with buttery oak flavors along with candied berry fruit notes.",82,Bodegas Navarro López 2011 Rojo Granrojo Tempranillo-Garnacha (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"A 60-30-10 blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Syrah, Carato is a vibrant, cheerful wine elegant aromas that recall the small berry fruit and blue flowers usually associated with Sangiovese. The wine has a clean and balanced delivery and ends with crisp acidity.",87,Erik Banti 2004 Carato Red (Toscana)
"A light fragrant blend of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Cão, the wine is soft with plenty of strawberry fruitiness and acidity. The aftertaste has a great lift of perfumed crispness.",86,Wines & Winemakers 2016 Companhia das Lezirias Tyto Alba Rosé (Tejo)
"Fresh, apple-flavored wine, full of white fruits and a tangy, bright acidity. The wine is deliciously fresh, with stone fruit acidity on the finish.",86,Adega Cooperativa do Cartaxo 2010 Xairel Branco White (Tejo)
"This is a classy bottle of bubbly from the light copper color to the lightly fruity, yeasty aromas to the crisp mouthfeel and satisfying spice and raspberry flavors. A sense of layered richness is balanced by good acidity for balance.",91,Scharffenberger NV Brut Rosé Excellence Sparkling (Mendocino)
"From several blocks planted to a mix of clones, this wine is defined almost entirely by its earthy, stemmy core of compost and tobacco, with a slight reductive quality on the palate. Smoky, toasted oak rounds out the richness.",86,Schug 2013 Schug Estate Pinot Noir (Carneros)
The mouthfeel of this wine is full and round despite lean flavors of tart tropical fruit and melon rind. The nose offers aromas of fresh herbs and green fruit that reappear on the finish. Drink now.,87,Warwick 2010 Professor Black Sauvignon Blanc (Stellenbosch)
"Aromas of raw oak, eucalyptus and gritty berry fruits are hot and leafy. This Tempranillo-based blend feels choppy with aggressive grating tannins. Flavors of baked roasted berry fruits are also herbal, green and leafy, while this finishes crisp, raw and tomatoey in flavor.",85,Marqués de Vargas 2007 Reserva Privada  (Rioja)
The wine is earthy and somewhat rustic. There is fruit but it is spoiled by a spicy pepper edge. Chill this drastically.,82,Mémoires 2015 Rosé (Coteaux Varois en Provence)
"Pure Cabernet sourced from a trio of Walla Walla vineyards, and finished at 14.9% alcohol. Supple and spicy, this displays a firm core of tart fruit, annotated with lead pencil, graphite and charcoal. Though it seems almost deceptively light alongside the Tulpen Merlot, this compact and layered wine is built to age over a decade or more.",92,Tulpen 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"As always, the historic winery produces a nuanced, restrained style, with a subdued nose of berries and balsamic reduction. It's light and bright on the palate, with chicory and woody tones and medium-ripe cherry fruit, a perfect partner to varied foods.",90,Tablas Creek 2012 Côtes de Tablas Estate Grown & Bottled Red (Paso Robles)
"Elegantly floral and classic in dried herb, cedar, black pepper and pencil lead, this wine offers complex components of flavor and intrigue around velvety black fruit and a long, grippy finish. It impresses in its ability to be both approachable and timeless.",93,Levendi 2012 Sweetwater Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak)
"Cherry and raspberry aromas are a little scratchy, with accents of toast, leather and roasted meat. The palate, on the other hand, is more lean, driving and citric than in riper years; it's crisp and fresh, with red plum, pie cherry and toasty oak flavors. Clean, lean and ready to drink.",88,Sierra Cantabria 2007 Crianza  (Rioja)
"Tight and spicy, it carries an underlying ripeness of apples and pears. A subtle Riesling, it shows breezy freshness and an acidity-spiked texture that makes it invigorating. The slighest suggestion of pineapple lingers on the finish.",89,Fritsch 2012 Kapuzinerberg Riesling (Niederösterreich)
"Red berry, rose and clove are some of the aromas you'll find on this bright, supple red. The smooth palate offers juicy black cherry, crushed strawberry and white pepper alongside fresh acidity.

"Bright and delicious, this starts with aromas of blue flower, red berries, mint and thyme together with a whiff of leather.

Drink now through 2016 to capture the fresh, crunchy berry character.",90,Castellinuzza e Piuca 2011  Chianti Classico

"Swathes of ripe fruit over a broad layer of wood, a generous, opulent character, ripe, the spice from wood giving a good, rich final character.",89,Jean Rijckaert 2008 Cray vers Vaux  (Mâcon-Lugny)
"You have to love the '07 vintage. This is drinking beautifully right now, though official release (September) is still a ways off. Rich and delicious, full-bodied and aromatic, with exotic barrel scents and a lovely mélange of chocolate, mocha, caramel and spice. But the fruit is the main story, and it's full, ripe and substantial—cherry and cassis, licorice and just a hint of leaf.",93,Quilceda Creek 2007 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"So sweet and rich in cherry, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors, what's not to like? It's dry, gentle in tannins and complex. Seems designed for easy pairing with a great steak.",90,Madrigal 2008 Cabernet Franc (Calistoga)
"A faint hint of pink shines on this sparkler named after the winery owners' dog. Aromas of fresh melon and slight peach lead to a faint cherry note upon sipping and creamy mouthfeel, followed by plum skin tartness and a yeasty, sour bitterness.",86,Clos La Chance 2010 Amber's Cuvee Sparkling (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Earth, leather and tomato are accents to the dry, lean bouquet. The wine is expectedly juicy and tight, with snappy raspberry and cherry flavors. It shows clean lines and an unbreakable personality; elegant, juicy and firm. Drink now–2009.",87,Bodegas Faustino 2002 Faustino V Reserva  (Rioja)
"The archetypal pear flavors of Grüner Veltliner come to the fore: fresh, flavorsome and crunchy green Conference pear in this case, with zesty acidity in a linear, refreshing and zesty frame. This is concentrated and totally refreshing.",91,Jäger 2013 Selection Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"Crisp in apricot, apple and mango, this is a lovely, easy-drinking white made from a vineyard and producer well-known for Pinot Noir. Refreshing and light, yet with complexity and aromatics to spare, it offers ample body, an attractive texture and sharp acidity, finishing with a note of spicy vanilla.",90,Keller Estate 2013 La Cruz Vineyard Pinot Gris (Sonoma Coast)
"A big, earthy type of wine with a ton of ripeness and heft. Smells like pure black olive, earth and smoked meat. The palate is tight but friendly as it delivers big doses of herb, tea, chocolate and black fruit flavors. About as deep and long in the mouth as this variety gets; proof that Maipo can produce the occasional excellent Carmenère.",90,De Martino 2009 Alto de Piedras Single Vineyard Carmenère (Maipo Valley)
"Jon Martinez, who arrived in Washington barely six years ago, is knocking the ball out of the park. Improving with each new release, he has locked in a stellar collection of vineyards, and made Rhône-style wines his focus. This is a revelation. Pure berries, cassis, rock, earth, licorice, and a hint of baking spices. Gorgeous.",95,Maison Bleue 2009 Upland Vineyard Gravière G.S.M. Red (Snipes Mountain)
"A youthful and appealing wine with notes of orange peel, citrus and crushed flowers. The palate brings abundant stone fruit flavors that taper off toward the finish.",88,Henry of Pelham 2012 Icewine Riesling (Short Hills Bench)
"Lovely notions of both ripe and green pear rise from the glass. There also is a more savory edge reminiscent of moss and yeast. This comes out even more on the fresh concentrated palate with a lovely salty peppery nuance that makes this very moreish and thrilling. The flavors, amply supported by zesty citrus, just last.",93,Jäger 2015 Achleiten Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"Held back and re-released in the spring of 2014, this is smooth and still fruity, the fruit rounding into secondary flavors. Not a big wine, it smoothes out quickly and seems to have a hint of leather, with the finish tailing into a vague fade.",87,Lenné Estate 2008 Pinot Noir
"This Sangiovese-based wine is redolent of smoked bacon, sweet barbecue sauce and campfire. Yet it goes down easy and smoothly thanks to the dense fruit flavors that enliven the palate.",86,Mocali 2005 I Piaggioni Sangiovese (Toscana)
"In keeping with the winery's other red wine releases, the Cedarosa matches tart berry fruits to lush barrel flavors of butter and toast. It's approachable and somewhat monolithic.",86,Lost River 2005 Cedarosa Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Winemaker Jesse Katz combines 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Franc in this blockbuster of a deal, a flavorful, well-crafted wine that impresses in its voluptuous body and spicy seasonings. Raspberry syrup, tar and a mix of cedar and sage accent a grip of tannin that softens in the glass.",91,Aperture 2013 Red (Alexander Valley)
"With some richness, this is a drink-now rosé. The initial fresh fruit has diminished, leaving a rounded, caramel-flavored wine without acidity.",83,Barton & Guestier 2009 Rosé Red (Côtes de Provence)
"Rough around the edges, this is a dry and tannic wine. It has mint, red currant fruit and a dry center. It needs a year or two, but is likely to remain rustic.",86,Vieux Château Gaubert 2011 Benjamin de Vieux Château Gaubert  (Graves)
Richly textured wine that oozes jammy red fruits and ripe tannins. It has a good dry core followed by sweet acidity and a juicy berry character. The wine has some power and aging potential.,89,Château de la Crée 2008 Clos du Château  (Santenay)
"A solid, chunky wine whose tannins are still dominant. It has ripe black fruit flavors and a hint ofspice from wood aging. This is a wine that will develop well over the next 3–5 years.",89,Quinta de Sant'Ana 2010 Tinto Red (Lisboa)
"This wine is crisp, floral and pretty in every way. It's classically structured and graceful, with tart apple notes and stony acidity. It allows the fruit to speak softly and subtly, its lower ripeness detracting from niether flavor nor complexity.",94,Small Vines 2014 TBH Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"Ripe notes of black cherry rise from the glass. The richness of the fruit is also apparent on the fleshy palate, where cherry notes fill out into red and black juiciness, with just a touch of the variety's telltale pepper. This wine is almost bouncy and reveals its firm grip and freshness only on the finish that echoes long.",91,Umathum 2015 Blaufränkisch (Burgenland)
"Aromas of blackberry, violet and a whiff of dark spice lead the nose while the juicy palate serves up raspberry, black cherry, clove and white pepper. It's fresh and lively, with firm but approachable tannins.",89,Castelfeder 2013 Rieder Lagrein (Alto Adige)
"They say the grapes come from Lake, Napa, Sonoma, and Mendocino counties. There are some pretty good black-currant and oak aromas, but the flavors are thin and sharp. It’s well made, as you’d expect. Still, the overall impression is lean and austere.",83,Robert Mondavi 1998 Coastal Cabernet Sauvignon (North Coast)
"Woodsy spice, clove and chocolate announce the oak that is the lead factor throughout the wine. The nose is creamy and resiny green, with vanilla yogurt, plum and berry flavors coming next. Solid in terms of acidity and feel, but a little bit lactic due to the wood treatment.",86,Dolce Stefania 2005 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza)
"This is a ripe, succulent white, dark golden in color, that's lush and expansive on the palate in fleshy tropical and stone fruit. Toasted oak comes forward on the finish, accentuating the wine's nearly full-bodied nature, never getting in the way of the minerality.",91,Black Kite 2014 Gap's Crown Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"Despite its age, this has the depth, concentration and structure to continue to age well through 2022. A blend of 74% Shiraz, 18% Grenache, 6% Cinsault and 2% Tinta Barocca, there's a pure character to the wine—herbal notes of minty fynbos, bark and freshly tilled soil are supported by vibrant plum, raspberry and cherry. There's a minerally graphite seam to the full-bodied palate, ending on lush notes of black pepper, bittersweet cocoa and espresso.",94,A.A. Badenhorst Family Wines 2010 Red (Swartland)
"Brisk acidity brightens the ripe raspberry and cherry fruit, giving it a clean, lively mouthfeel. There's a jacket of tannins, but it's fine and easy, and oak brings just the right touch of sweet toast flavor. Lovely to drink now, and it should develop bottle complexities over the next 8–10 years.",93,Williams Selyem 2010 Coastlands Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This intensely sweet and delicious wine has a bright gold color, aromas of buttered popcorn and ripe pear, and flavors like peach, yellow plum and honey. The texture is luscious and thick, but a good sub-current of acidity keeps it balanced.",92,Peju Province Winery 2013 Liana Orange Muscat (North Coast)
"There's lots of youthful, jammy fruit and rich tannins in this Syrah. But then it turns hot with alcohol, and the finish is overripe and raisiny. Your best bet is to drink it soon with stews and barbecue.",85,Bianchi 2010 Syrah (Paso Robles)
"L'Erpico is a dense and meaty expression of Sangiovese from Montecucco (coastal Tuscany) that opens with ripe cherry, blackberry and meaty tones of bacon and moist earth. There's an interesting juxtaposition in the mouth of sweet versus sour fruit flavors.",88,Piandibugnano 2006 L'Erpico  (Montecucco)
"Zesty aromas of tart pineapple and tangerine, slate and chalk contrast the luscious peach and red apple fruitiness of this off-dry Riesling. It's a refreshingly crisp and thirst-quenching wine for youthful consumption.",88,Dr. Nägler 2014 Rüdesheimer Feinherb Riesling (Rheingau)
"This soft, almost tasteless wine just hints at caramel and red fruits. It lacks character.",81,Wine with Spirit 2012 Bastardô! Rosé (Lisboa)
"A rich, spicy wine, this shows flavors of new wood and ripe yellow fruit. The concentrated palate reveals juicy pear and peach juice flavors and a tight, minerally structure. Dense vineyard planting and 35-year-old vines bring out extra intensity and complexity.",92,Roche de Bellene 2010 Les Chenevottes Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet)
"The Selezione Vigna La Casa is equally sweet and ripe as the estate's base Brunello from the same vintage. What distinguishes this wine, however, is the firmness of its structure and the grainy texture of its tannins.",87,Tenuta Caparzo 2003 Vigna La Casa  (Brunello di Montalcino)
The nose is not forthcoming and the palate only hints very subtly at white pepper and green pear. There is ample freshness on the light palate and the finish is one of pure lemon zest. It is weightlesseness and poise rather than power that convinces here.,91,Schloss Gobelsburg 2014 Ried Lamm Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"Vibrant and spicy, this savory red delivers aromas and flavors of ripe blackberry, black cherry, ground pepper and chopped Mediterranean herb. Firm, fine-grained tannins support the juicy flavors. An anise note backs up the finish.",90,Argiolas 2013 Costera  (Cannonau di Sardegna)
"This is a heavy-duty Cabernet, big in every way, with rich black cherry and cassis fruit, and dense, dark tannins. The long, slightly grainy finish reinforces the impression of raw power, yet the wine retains perfect proportion and is nicely differentiated from the other 2010s crafted by winemaker Chris Figgins.",95,Doubleback 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Opens with aromas of mustard and rye seed. The palate is soft, clunky and a bit cloying, with sweet, gummy, muddled apple and candied mango flavors. Finishes confected, with a tropical leaning. Not the best style for Cava.",83,Marques de Monistrol NV Selección Especial Semi Seco Sparkling (Cava)
"This proprietary blend of Zinfandel, Syrah, Grenache, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon delivers a deep and layered nose. Wild blackberry jam, pine pitch and white sage converge, like a walk through the California chaparral. The acidity is amazingly vibrant, with flavors of bright purple fruit, pepper and crushed herbs on the finish.",94,Lorenzi Estate 2009 The Catalyst Red (Temecula Valley)
"Ripe fruit meets butter and spice in this medium-bodied, smooth and integrated wine. It opens with Bosc pear and golden apple aromas, melding with vanilla and marzipan notes, its richness of flavor nicely buoyed up by acidity.",90,Bonterra 2015 Made With Organic Grapes Chardonnay (Mendocino County)
"Lemony oak sits atop a heady bouquet supported by woody, baked-berry aromas. This is fresh and fast-moving across the palate, with rooty, toasty flavors of baked black fruits. A peppery, toasty, chocolaty finish is solid, dense and layered. Drink through 2021.",92,Bodega Catena Zapata 2011 Nicolas Catena Zapata Red (Mendoza)
"A rich, creamy, sumptuous wine, with an impressive, decisive shaft of minerality and a stony, dense character. The name of the wine, referring to the granite and schist soil, is one of an extraordinary series reflecting different soil types made by Muscadet's top producer, Guy Bossard.",92,Domaine de l'Ecu 2006 Expression de Gneiss  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"Rounded and soft, this rich rosé is fruity while also perfumed. The blending of Syrah in the mix gives the wine a sense of power and concentration, making it an adquate partner at the dinner table.",91,Domaine du Grand Cros 2014 L'Esprit de Provence Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This lively, muscular, full-bodied wine ripples with smoky, meaty, peppery aromas. A thick, almost chewy texture partners with rowdy blackberry flavors and vivid tannins that will tame the rarest steak or wildest game.",91,Saxon Brown 2010 Parmelee-Hill Vineyard Owl Ridge Block Syrah (Sonoma Coast)
"Rustic earth gives way to bright, crisp red fruit and a hit of citrus providing freshness and life. Soft and full bodied, this wine has years to go in the cellar—through 2022—to let the tannins soften and integrate further with the fruit.",92,Merryvale 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
"This wine has an almost sweet aroma of ripe plums and cherries, followed by a vivid fruity flavor that's fresh, dry and accented with black pepper and clove. Showing great balance from fine tannins and good acidity and vibrant but not heavy flavor, it will be a versatile and crowd-pleasing pour.",90,La Follette 2013 Pinot Noir (North Coast)
"A bit sweet and rugged, with jammy blackberry, currant and pepper spice flavors wrapped into firm tannins. Shows Zin's briary, brambly character.",85,Peachy Canyon 2006 BFD Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"Very concentrated notes of zesty grapefruit peel mingle with punchy, peppery watercress on a rather concentrated palate. Freshly ground pepper intriguingly pops up here and there. This is a weighty wine that definitely belongs on the table.",92,Schloss Gobelsburg 2013 Renner Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"A touch of mushroomy unripeness undermines this Pinot Noir. That is a limiting factor, but the wine does show beautiful Pinot silkiness, and good enough raspberry and cola fruit.",84,Sonoma Hills 2011 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Dark strawberry fruit meets with rustic earthy aromas and light allspice notes on the nose of this wine from the late actor's family-owned winery. The palate shows boisterous and tart cranberry and black raspberry fruit, with pencil lead minerality and great energy, if not a ton of complexity.",90,Fess Parker 2013 Older Barrels Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Tropical and a bit briney on the nose. The palate is healthy in feel, with sweet white fruit flavors, a pinch of lemon and creamy oak. Finishes quick, with a nice feel and adequate acidity; will do best if well chilled.",85,Bodega Elena de Mendoza 2010 Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"This opens with classic Sangiovese aromas of blue flower, ripe berry, tilled earth and a whiff of leather. The palate delivers black cherry, savory herb, espresso and a hint of tobacco alongside bracing tannins. Drink 2016–2021.",90,Salcheto 2011  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano
"Rubbery black-fruit aromas are a bit fiery. This Malbec is tightly wound, with rubbery tannins and more than enough acidity. Spiced plum and berry flavors give way to a bold, forward finish with herbal, savory notes.",87,Nieto Senetiner 2016 Malbec (Luján de Cuyo)
"A promising start for Empire Estate's first bottling, this perfumed dry Riesling is marked by lifted aromas of orange blossom and citrus peel. Concentrated tangerine and honey flavors have an electric vibe, balancing a nervous edge of lemon-lime acidity against a honed, steely polish.",91,Empire Estate 2014 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"While the wine has plenty of the tannins typical of 2011 at this stage, it also has ripe fruit, full of blackberry and currant flavors. The balance is already there, giving a potentially rich, juicy and generous wine. Drink from 2017.",87,Château de Bensse 2011  Médoc
"This wine made from an aromatic indigenous Turkish grape offers a pleasing aroma of honeydew melon and freesia. It is soft on entry and remains smooth on the palate, with flavors of guava, pineapple and rose petal that meld into a soft floral finish.",87,Vinkara 2015 Narince (Ankara)
"Creamy yellow plum fruit and a flinty edge lead onto a full-fruited, brightly lit palate where all the fruit is pulled into zesty orange and lemon focus. Concentration and friendliness prove great assets here.",90,Netzl 2013 Chardonnay (Carnuntum)
"This is a remarkably affordable find, so good in its red-fruited, tangy acidity and spiciness on the palate. Dried herb and pencil lie beneath bigger, bolder swathes of blackberry and cherry. This wine has a large presence but shows structure and balance.",93,Stack House 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Despite initial yeasty, bready aromas, this benchmark mass-market fino has popping acidity that adds spine and zest to an otherwise oily feeling palate. Lightly buttery white-fruit flavors are mildly salty on the finish, sort of like saltines.",89,Tio Pepe NV Fino Muy Seco Palomino (Jerez)
"This fleshy, tropical wine offers a wealth of rich peach, pineapple and golden honey flavor in a medium-bodied frame. It finishes light and bright, with an undercurrent of toasted oak.",90,Frostwatch 2014 Chardonnay (Bennett Valley)
"There's a good array of purple-flower aromas, including lavender and potpourri, on the nose of this bottling, as well as light cola and plum skins. The sip is quite bitter and tarry though, with just a touch of riper black fruit.",86,Left Bend 2014 Cabernet Franc (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"The addition of 20% Roussanne to the blend seems to thicken the palate—which is not a bad thing at all. A scent of honeysuckle piles on top of the flavors of honey, chamomile tea, lemon, orange and pink grapefruit, creating a luscious wine with impressive length.",90,Novelty Hill 2011 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Heady aromas of honeysuckle, white peach and green apple carry through to the vibrant palate along with lemon zest. It boasts crisp acidity and a lively perlage that lead to a dry refreshing close.",88,Le Contesse NV Single Frementation  (Prosecco)
"This fresh, fragrant wine is buoyed by citrus acidity and green apples. It's all fruit—light and bright—finishing with a tangy lemon-zest character. Screwcap.",85,Strauss 2012 Strauss White White (Steiermark)
"With its sugary flavors of oranges, guavas and vanilla, this will appeal to those who favor sweet white wines. Brisk, clean acidity fortunately provides balance.",84,Bianchi 2011 Signature Selection Los Alamos Vineyard Pinot Grigio (Santa Barbara County)
"This comes down on the sweet side, with orange, apricot and peach jam flavors. But the acidity is bright and clean. If you don't like sweet California wines, this isn't for you.",86,Handley 2010 Pinot Gris (Anderson Valley)
"Wood aging does not help the richness of this wine. It brings out toast and covers the glorious sweet fruits. With acidity thrown in the balance is not there. Maybe several years will help, so don't drink before 2017.",89,Domaine Pichot 2009 Les Larmes de Bacchus  (Vouvray)
"This opens with aromas of prune, perfumed berry, baking spice, leather, a whiff of coconut and a balsamic note. The fresh palate offers wild cherry, crushed raspberry, lightly toasted oak, anise and espresso. It's still tightly tannic and astringent, but it should improve with a few more years in the bottle. Drink 2018–2028.",89,Cascina Luisin 2012 Rabajà  (Barbaresco)
"This wine presents itself initially as having a bold, big body, yet is actually light on its feet as it opens, revealing aromas of cherry liqueur, rhubarb joined with a funk of black licorice and sassafras.",88,Moshin 2012 Calliope Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Aromas of orange peel, flowers, blue fruit and smoked meat are followed by light, spritely fruit flavors. The tannins bring some grip.",89,Apex 2013 The Catalyst Red (Washington)
"This is a blush wine made primarily from the Spanish variety, Tempranillo. It's fairly dark for a rosé and quite full-bodied in cherry jam, pepper and vanilla flavors, while a splash of Albariño adds needed acidity and the bright taste of citrus.",86,Stevenot 2007 Rosado Rosé (Sierra Foothills)
"Lovely aromas of Spanish Broom, white cherry, peach and light spice emerge on this radiant, elegant wine. The crisp palate offers Kaiser pear, apple, nectarine zest, white pepper and a hint of ginger. Vibrant acidity carries the flavors while a pronounced mineral note energizes the finish.",90,Raccaro 2014 Malvasia (Collio)
"Earthy, beefy, almost metallic aromas, then beefy, tamarind-like flavors make an exotic but rustic profile for this fascinating medium-bodied wine. The texture is rather lean and a tasty sour-cherry character develops on the finish.",89,McCay Cellars 2013 Bechthold Vineyard Cinsault (Lodi)
"A fresh delicate style, the sweetness fleeting over the fruit, giving an orange marmalade character, but retaining lightness, lifted by a final acidity.",89,Schloss Gobelsburg 2007 Auslese Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"Sweet and oaky, with butterscotch, vanilla cream, pineapple crème brûlée and cinnamon spice flavors.",84,Clos La Chance 2007 Biagini Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Baked red plum, black cherry, sagebrush, graphite and budding hibiscus aromas show on the rich and minerally nose of this bottling. The palate is very inviting and lavish, with pungent dark red fruits of cherry and black plum enhanced by allspice, ginger and black pepper.",92,Talbott 2013 Diamond T Vineyard Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Monterey)
"From an emerging Mendocino appellation, an engaging, dry wine. Its mouth-cleansing acidity is fresh and clean, highlighting pretty flavors of lime and honeydew, and leads to a tart finish.",87,Lolonis 2001 Fumé Blanc (Redwood Valley)
"This wine is a unique blend of Malbec (60%), Syrah (20%), Merlot (15%) and Petit Verdot. It opens with brooding but alluring aromas of dark plum, asphalt, and a kiss of baking spice. The flavors are full bodied and palate coating, showing weight but also a sense of suppleness that charms the senses.",91,Reininger 2012 Mr. Owl's Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Named for the vineyard's address on Live Oak Road, this tasty blend holds 39% Syrah, 28% Grenache, 19% Counoise and 14% Mourvèdre. It delivers aromas of scarlet red rose petals, crushed clove and cherry pie. The fruit flavors are so deep they border on blueberry, set against a tannic backbone, yet proving quite light and drinkable.",91,Derby 2010 Fifteen 10 Red (Paso Robles)
"91-93. Barrel sample. Initially this is just a seductive effort; but then its intensity and structure emerge, creating a wine of great complexity. Its botrytis character adds considerable weight.",92,Château Suau 2011 Barrel Sample  (Barsac)
"There is certainly some of the Dão minerality in the texture of this wine. It's main thrust is berry fruit, which is filled out with some attractive tannins, spice from wood and final acidity.",89,Dão Sul 2008 Casa de Santar Red (Dão)
"From vineyards owned by the producer just across the river from its home base in Sancerre, this wine has the rich intensity that is proper to a Pouilly Fumé. It has bold ripe fruits and a toasty edge along with a strong minerality from the flinty soil. Drink this wine from 2018.",91,Henri Bourgeois 2014 La Demoiselle des Bourgeois  (Pouilly-Fumé)
"This outstanding Walla Walla boutique has established a track record for consistent improvement, and the white wines are best of show. Once again this 2006 blend is smooth, round and richly endowed with mixed stone fruits. Lovely aromas build a dense cloud of complex fruit, toast and caramel scents around the glass; once in the mouth the full-bodied fruit takes hold with lychee, peach and stone fruits. Immaculate and persistent, this stunning wine just keeps on coming.",92,Buty 2006 Sémillon-Sauvignon Blanc White (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The hot climate of the Cold Creek Vineyard sharpens up the contours of this Chardonnay, which shows more of a classic Washington character. Bright fruit, a mix of apples and peaches and pears, is shot through with streaks of butterscotch from fermentation in new French oak. It's been through 100% malolactic, yet retains some crispness. Polished and full-bodied.",89,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2005 Cold Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Smells and tastes a bit weedy or stalky, with slightly green blackberry and cherry flavors. The absence of fruit accentuates the tannins, making them feel harder than they really are. Drink now.",86,Robert Mondavi 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Substantial and muscular, still quite tight and unyielding, this grudgingly displays purple fruits in a mix of roasted coffee beans, clove and black olive. If past releases are any indication, this will continue to evolve and expand as it gets a bit more bottle time.",90,Dusted Valley 2009 Stained Tooth Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"There is a high-toned aspect to the otherwise neutral nose that just gives away lemony hints. The palate is sprightly and fresh and reveals a very creamy, fruity, almost tropical core which is cut very pleasantly by fresh, aromatic lemon—this is Chardonnay but not as you know it. A very fruity, rich but fresh number.",89,Hannes Reeh 2014 Rohstoff Chardonnay (Burgenland)
"It's bit harsh in texture and is minty, with wintergreen and pepper flavors that nudge into cherries and mocha. Good for barbecue and cheese plates.",84,Amador Foothill Winery 2006 Esola Vineyad Zinfandel (Shenandoah Valley (CA))
"Produced from Gamay in a small enclave of vines south of Sancerre, this is a cherry-blossom-perfumed wine, bright and crisp with red-cherry flavors. It is ready now.",86,Henri Bourgeois 2016 Les Amphores Rosé (Châteaumeillant)
"Dusted Valley is really rockin' it in 2010, with outstanding varietal releases of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and this yummy Malbec. A big entry brings blackberry and cassis into the palate, with peppery highlights. Nice details of herb and tobacco are found, as the wine seems to get more powerful the longer it lingers in the mouth.",92,Dusted Valley 2010 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This wine has flavors of wild blackberry, blueberry and mocha, with a rich vein of herb, tobacco and spice. However, it's hot in alcohol, and finishes with glyceriney sweetness—almost like a minor Port. Drink up.",86,Kuleto Estate 2009 Zinfandel (Napa Valley)
"Grapy and perfumed on the nose, this quaffable Garnacha is sound and fresh, albeit a bit acidic. Black-fruit flavors are common and show notes of earth and chocolate, while a grabby finish displays no glaring faults.",85,Beso de Vino 2014 Old Vine Garnacha (Cariñena)
"This wine is massively fruity and grandly structured without being heavy or overpowering, but it will need time for the firm tannins to mellow. It smells and tastes like pure, concentrated black cherry and feels full of fine-grained tannins and sour-cherry crispness. It will be best after 2020.",93,Spell 2013 Alder Springs Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino County)
"Funky and intriguing on the nose, this proffers scents of narcissus and farmyard, with touches of char and dark fruit. Medium bodied, this has an open texture, with integrated acids and malleable tannins. Flavors of tart blackberry candy, leather and Dr. Pepper surface on the palate.",85,Veramar 2008 Estate Bottled Norton (Shenandoah Valley)
"This wine is soft, simple, fruity and ready to drink. It has apple and apricot tones and light acidity to keep it fresh, with a bright and refreshing aftertaste.",85,Louis Chevallier 2014  Mâcon-Villages
"Instead of brawn and muscle, this ruby Ripasso offers elegance and finesse. The nose is redolent of polished black stone, Indian spice and loads of dried cassis and wild berry. There's a playful hint of sweet almond and cinnamon at the end.",88,Gamba 2007 Le Quare  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
"Leather, underbrush, moist soil and dark spice aromas carry over to the elegant palate along with dried plum, mature blackberry and licorice. Firm, velvety tannins and fresh acidity provide structure and a polished texture. Drink through 2023.",93,Basilisco 2013 Fontanelle  (Aglianico del Vulture)
"Plum, black cherry and anise lead the nose of this rich red. Flavor of vanilla, mint and cherry give it a somewhat medicinal; edge but the wine is overall balanced and offers an exotic edge.",87,Tsililis 2012 Theopetra Estate Red
"Here's a Rosso with aromas of blue flower, ripe berry and whiffs of balsamic herbs. The palate offers bright but rich cherry- raspberry flavors with hints of spice and licorice. Pair this with hearty pastas and Tuscan soups.",86,Renieri 2011  Rosso di Montalcino
"The wine starts lively, almost fresh. Only after a while in the mouth do you taste the intense richness underneath. The structure is of pear skins, with white fig and sweet dried apricot syrup. The botrytis, dry at the heart of the wine, gives the whole ensemble great balance.",92,Château Lafaurie-Peyraguey 2006  Sauternes
"A rich hint of apple crumble precedes tart notes of lemon freshness. The palate fizzes with frothy bubbles and gives the impression of lightness and ease. A very clean-cut, sprightly and refreshing finish almost hides the more serious autolytic backdrop of this elegant, fine-fruited Crémant.",89,Boeckel 2014 Blanc de Blancs Brut Auxerrois (Alsace)
"Yet another fruit-powered, lip-smacking Riesling from Trisaetum, this brings a basket of yellow apples, tart limes, pears and a slice of pink grapefruit into perfect harmony. Leesy, textural, long and utterly refreshing, it finishes with a nice kick of bracing acidity.",92,Trisaetum 2012 Coast Range Estate Dry Riesling
"Aromas of snap peas and freshly cut grass lead to tangy lemon and grapefruit flavors in this medium-bodied, crisply balanced wine. It's certainly lively and will cut through the thickest fettuccine Alfredo.",87,Geyser Peak 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (California)
"There is something floral and tender, even creamy on the nose. The palate on the one side has a creamy apricot and peach aspect, on the other a totally taut and brisk lemon-lime streak. This makes for tension and interest. This is concentrated and exciting, dry and very, very enjoyable. Drink now through 2025.",93,Domaine Jean Sipp 2013 Kirchberg de Ribeauvillé Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"Fairly full-bodied and lush, with berry fruit flavors balanced by darker notes of chocolate and coffee. The tannins are soft, making this wine immediately accessible.",87,Kangarilla Road 2008 Black St. Peters Zinfandel (McLaren Vale)
"Ultradry and tart in acidity, this is not a Chardonnay for those looking for richness. With citrus and mineral flavors, it's suggestive of a young, minor Chablis. Clean and vibrant. Drink now.",87,Trione 2007 River Road Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Made entirely from Chardonnay, this opens with yellow apple, Williams pear and white peach aromas that follow through to the palate. It's elegant and steeped in vanilla and hazelnut flavors, with fresh acidity that lifts its creamy texture.",90,Marchesi de' Frescobaldi 2015 Bianco Benefizio Riserva Chardonnay (Pomino)
"Tastes like a Chardonnay, with tropical fruit, peach and green apple flavors wrapped into buttercream and vanilla. Ripe and sweet, but balanced by crisp acidity. A nice, rich white wine for drinking now.",86,Valley of the Moon 2010 Pinot Blanc (Sonoma County)
"Red currant and fresh strawberry make for an enticing, inviting nose and carry on to the frothy, dry, slender palate. This is an easy, refreshing but wonderfully clean and fruity pink fizz.",89,Willm NV Rosé Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"With sugary blackberry and prune flavors, this tannic Zinfandel is pretty simple. It will pair well with burgers, tacos and barbecue.",82,Masterpiece 2012 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"Underbrush, menthol, dark berry and allspice aromas take shape in the glass. The simple palate, which has a slightly fizzy character, offers fleshy black cherry, overripe plum and soft acidity alongside buffed tannins.",85,Cantine Bellini 2011 Riserva  (Chianti)
"Martha Clara's Riesling is dry in style yet soft on the palate with sweet tones of honeyed apples and white peach. Fresh and juicy with a mouthwatering acidity, it finishes on a puckery lemonade note.",86,Martha Clara 2009 Riesling (North Fork of Long Island)
"This Brunello opens with a sweet nose of vanilla and cherry. The bouquet is straightforward, giving the wine a frank, no-nonsense personality. Flavors of spice, leather and tobacco appear later, rendering more depth. It feels youthful, soft and chewy on the close.",90,Villa I Cipressi 2007  Brunello di Montalcino
"Made from 100% Chardonnay, this shows lemon, apple and nectarine on the nose with hints of croisant. Spritely bubbles quickly fade, leaving honeydew, green apple, nectarine and a hint of pastry. The finish is fresh with lemon juice and tart apple.",87,Gruet 2011 Sauvage Sparkling (America)
"Better known for its table wines, Quinta do Crasto still retains an important Port program. This big, dry and smoky effort fully justifies that. It is firmly structured and tannic, with a strong black-pepper character that is balanced by the solid structure and concentration.  Age over many years.",91,Quinta do Crasto 2010 Vintage  (Port)
"Almost half of this wine's production of 1,800 cases came to the U.S., which should make this broad, mouthfilling white relatively easy to find. The largely neutral palate suggests pineapple, honey and cinnamon, with citrus and spice lingering on the finish. Drink now.",89,Alain Jaume et Fils 2006 Domaine Grand Veneur La Fontaine White (Châteauneuf-du-Pape)
"The aromas seem a bit disjointed on first pour, with notes of custard, citrus, mineral and spice. The palate is medium bodied, bringing some interest but not entirely pulling it all together.",87,Lauren Ashton Cellars 2015 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Aged only in stainless steel, this youthful Barbera d'Asti shows cheerful aromas of ripe fruit and sweet berries. The wine does a very nice job of balancing its naturally fresh acidity with the bright, pristine nature of its fruit.",86,CarlindePaolo 2009 Cursus Vitae  (Barbera d'Asti)
"A savory blend of 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc, this opens with aromas of scorched earth, meat juices, leather, black fruit and spices. The dense, low-acid palate delivers black currants and fleshy black cherry accented with black pepper and mocha alongside soft, round tannins. Drink now through 2017.",90,Tenuta Argentiera 2010 Argentiera  (Bolgheri Superiore)
"The acidity and fruit are the stars of this well-made Riesling. The wine is rich in citrus, honeysuckle, apricot and honey flavors that finish dry and clean.",87,Wente 2012 Riverbank Riesling (Arroyo Seco)
"This Cabernet from one of Spain's best-known producers is mature and structured. An attractive, complex nose offers berry, tobacco and leather aromas, while the wine is darkly fruited and a touch brown at the edge. Finishes long and dry, with some drying tannins. Drink now through 2006. Despite the tannins, sooner is preferable, as the fruit seems fully mature. —M.M.",87,Torres 1997 Gran Coronas Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Penedès)
"Delicious aromas of dark raspberries, Bing cherries, black pepper, pipe smoke, smoked meats, thyme and just enough dank mushroom greet the nose. This wine is very full on the ripe and juicy palate, showing more raspberry, rhubarb, dried strawberry and warm black licorice, all balanced by plum-skin bitterness and just enough tannic structure.",94,Boekenoogen 2012 Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"This blend of native grapes boasts an aromatic nose of fragrant white flower and yellow stone fruit. The crisp palate offers apricot, lemon zest and hint of nut alongside bright acidity.",87,Cantine Europa 2015 Eughenes Grillo-Zibibbo White (Terre Siciliane)
"This Petite Sirah is soft and very dry, a wine to drink now and for the next few years. With its easy tannins, it shows baked fruit tart flavors of blackberries and currants, with an edge of crushed peppercorn.",87,Everett Ridge 2006 Estate Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley)
"This producer, based in the western Loire, has been able to take advantage of the cool ocean climate to produce a crisp, fruity Chardonnay. It is all fruit, citrus and white-plum flavored, with a soft, fresh aftertaste. Drink now.",86,Vignoble Malidain 2015 Le Demi-Boeuf Chardonnay (Val de Loire)
"This wine has that warm, spicy, friendly feel of new oak that is well integrated with the fruit flavors, and a velvety texture to match. It smells like toasted baguette, nutmeg and vanilla and tastes almost as rich as blackberry jam, but stays dry and full-bodied. It's so easy to enjoy.",91,Fiddletown Cellars 2013 Reserve Barbera (Amador County)
"Sparkling Vouvray, full of rich fruit, with layers of almonds, toasted bread and intense acidity. It is a tangy wine, with an apple skin texture over a light creamy mousse.",89,Domaine Vincent Carême 2008 Cuvée T Brut  (Vouvray)
"This light-bodied wine has aromas like strawberries and maple syrup, and flavors that taste almost sweet. It makes a tempting, light and airy drink that's good for casual occasions.",84,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi 2013 Zinfandel (California)
"Marion produces some of the best Amarone available today, but this expression from the 2007 shows a touch of green fruit on the nose. Notes of dried sage and olive segue to a sweeter, plusher sensation in the mouth. In fact, the finish is extremely chewy and long.",88,Marion 2007  Amarone della Valpolicella
"Stalky, gritty, earthy plum aromas are minimally ripe. This feels firm, grabby, chunky and rough all in one. Gritty, unusually-bready berry flavors finish herbal and dry.",85,Bodegas Paniza 2012 Viñas Viejas de Paniza Garnacha (Cariñena)
"Exotic fruit and herbaceous aromas lift out of the glass. On the bright, simple palate, zesty acidity underscores juicy pineapple and grapefruit notes.",85,Andrero 2016 Grillo (Terre Siciliane)

"This opens with funky aromas of game, cured meat and wet animal fur. Rustic and lean, the astringent palate offers a suggestion of powdered sage and a balsamic note but lacks fruit.",83,Tenuta L'Illuminata 2012 Tebavio  (Barolo)
"Ripe plum and berry aromas with a note of vanilla are highly encouraging. Hailing from a warm vintage, this 10-year-old Bierzo beauty offers a blend of pulpy ripeness with bracing acidity. Loamy plum, oak and vanilla flavors end with length and elegance. Drink through 2020.",93,Estefania 2006 Tilenus Pagos de Posada Mencía (Bierzo)
"The assertive barrel flavors are still being integrated into the wine, but there is so much else to taste that it seems certain to knit itself together in the near term. Pretty blueberry and ripe cherry flavors are set in firm, toasty tannins.",91,Kontos 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Plump but sour cranberry fruit aromas meet with sweet sandalwood, clove and forest floor on the nose of this San Francisco-made bottling from the historic property. Sanguine touches on the palate lead to raspberry, cherry, cinnamon and juniper flavors, ending in a menthol finish.",93,Sandler 2015 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"With partial aging in wood, this is a spicy, smoky wine that is also full of ripe red fruits. Its well-integrated tannins give shape to this wine. A crisp finish and the wine is ready to drink.",86,Casa Santos Lima 2014 Credencial Red (Lisboa)
"This tasty, well-built wine is light in color, moderate in fruit flavor and has interesting spicy accents. The mouthfeel is broad and generous but also nicely supported by a light lacing of tannin.",89,Lava Cap 2014 Estate Bottled Grenache (El Dorado)
"Savory whiffs of pressed apple and pear open to brighter, juicier flavors of yellow peach, watermelon and berry in this unusually rose-tinted Viognier. It's quite fruity on the palate with sunny acidity and a brisk citrusy finish.",87,Sannino 2016 Viognier (North Fork of Long Island)
"Portugal's popular brand is a lively, fresh, spice- and dried fruit-flavored wine. There are flavors of pound cake and nutmeg surrounding a core of solid, firm tannins. Great with food, this is not for aging.",87,J. Portugal Ramos 2007 Marquês de Borba Red (Alentejo)
"In Cahors Tradition means a wine that doesn't go into barrels for aging. That keeps the fruit vibrant and crisp, as it is here. The wine is ripe, full in the mouth with fruit tannins and black-currant acidity. It is a year away from maturity, so drink from 2017.",88,Château Eugénie 2014 Tradition Malbec-Merlot (Cahors)
"A wine that starts out all tannins. The fruit takes a while to show through and then produces juicy red cherry flavors and considerable acidity, the wood aging rounding the corners. This is for medium-term aging.",89,Rozes 2008 Quinta do Grifo Grande Reserva Red (Douro)
"A ripe and structured wine, this has bold black fruits and balanced tannins that still need to soften. It has good potential with rich fruits and a tight mineral texture. Drink from 2018.",90,Sobredos 2012 Aneto Tinto Red (Douro)
"Full-bodied, tannic, juicy-fruity and dry, this red blend has flavors of blackberries, plums, dark chocolate and anise, with spicy, earthy notes of tobacco. Made from Primitivo, Zinfandel and Teroldego.",86,Viansa 2006 Prindelo Red (Sonoma County)
"Fresh tangerine skins scent this zesty dry Riesling. Restrained on the palate with flavors of pressed apple and pear, it's not a deeply concentrated wine but refreshing and brisk.",86,Fulkerson 2012 Reserve Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Heady with aromas of rose petals, this wine has a thin, light-bodied texture and tastes of black licorice and black cherry. With a surprising ripeness of fruit, it ends without tension or nuance.",88,Sonoma Collection 2013 District 3 Growers Reserve Pinot Noir (Sonoma County)
"Very dry, very tannic and austere, this southern Rhône-style blend isn't offering much now beyond the astringency. Airing coaxes out some modest cherry, Dr. Pepper cola and leather flavors, but it will always remain a tough, harsh wine.",84,Sunstone 2006 Rapsodie Du Soleil Red (Santa Barbara County)
"Rich, dry and pretty full-bodied for a Pinot Noir, this is stuffed with flavors of cherry pie and cola, made brisk by acidity. A little heavy, but sound and complex.",88,Babcock 2010 Microcosm Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Light, fruity, packed with strawberries, this is an attractive Pinot Noir. The only spoiler is the over-excited use of wood which is masking the fruit and will always be an important factor.",86,René Muré 2011 Clos Saint Landelain Pinot Noir (Alsace)
"There is plenty of wood here, quite a dominant feature. The fruit comes behind, showing bright ripe white fruits and a hint of apricot. The wood spice, though, has the last word.",88,Morey-Blanc 2007  Auxey-Duresses
"Full-bodied and refined, this opens with aromas of mature, spiced plum, violet, tilled soil and truffle. The firm palate offers up crushed black cherry, raspberry, ground black pepper and anise alongside a backbone of fresh acidity and firm tannins. A note of Mediterranean herb signals the close. It already has nice depth but hold for more complexity. Drink 2017–2025.",93,Fattoria di Corsignano 2010 L'Imperatrice Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico)
"The blend is 50-50 Viognier and Roussanne, sourced from Gamache Vineyards. Scents and flavors suggest orange candy, with a slightly grainy, baby aspirin quality. Lemony and forward; a good quaffer.",87,Market Vineyards 2010 Liquidity White White (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A rush of zippy, fresh fruit and spice aromas recommends this white from New York, offering the kind of clean fruit flavors and minerality that makes this region unique. The wine lacks real complexity and tends toward the austere but the beguiling spice saves the day.",84,Heron Hill 2004 Ingle Vineyard Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"The Grisant Pinot Gris is more full and fleshy than the winery's LEHM bottling, but still a bit one dimensional. Pleasant flavors of pear fruit, skin phenolics and light suggestions of cinnamon.",86,Vin du Lac 2008 Grisant! Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This wine shows finesse, driven by its seamless mix of citrus, melon, peach and pear fruits. Immediately delicious, it actually improves by the second day, showing its perfect acid-to-fruit balance. Give it a light chill—not too much—and it's a perfect autumnal sipper.",91,Owen Roe 2014 Crawford-Beck Vineyard Pinot Gris (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Sunny berry aromas give way to focused black cherry and dark-chocolate flavors that ride a richly tannic texture in this full-bodied wine. Made from a blend based on Zinfandel and Carignane grapes, it delivers ample complexity and depth.",91,Trinitas 2014 Mysteriama Red (California)
"Peach and pear fruit come together in this simple, fruity, but satisfying Chardonnay from Western Australia. It's moderately rich and full in body, but nicely silky in texture.",88,Mad Fish 2015 Chardonnay (Western Australia)
Some wood aging gives the fruitiness of the wine an added spice. Tannins support the bitter cherry flavors and add firmness to the juicy acidity. Drink from the end of 2015.,86,Domaine du Haut-Poncié 2013 Roche Grès  (Moulin-à-Vent)
"Soft and middle-aged, it offers a serious bite on the finish that veers slightly into sour cherry and mushroom territory, the end result a bit dull.",84,Hansen/Grunner 2009 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County)
"Here's a thin, almost transparent Grillo with forward tones of almond skin and mature pear. It has a clean, zesty delivery on the palate and ends with spicy, fresh accents.",84,Principi di Spadafora 2007 Schietto Grillo (Sicilia)
"Although Cullen's latest red wines haven't always impressed, the quality of the Chardonnay seems to go from great to even greater. This is plump enough to be appealing now, yet with a strong frame of acidity to hold it together for the next 10 or more years. Toasted nuts and fresh pineapple aromas and flavors are exotic upfront, while the lemony finish is long and mouthwatering.",94,Cullen 2012 Kevin John Chardonnay (Margaret River)
"Jammy blueberry aromas come with overt oakiness. This feels dense but on the flat side. Baked berry flavors and herbal plum notes sprinkle in a mild sweet and green accent, while this feels full and a bit syrupy on the finish.",86,Don Miguel Gascón 2015 Malbec (Mendoza)
"A ripe yeasty wine in a variation of a classic Provencal skittle bottle, with red fruits and a nutty character. It is fat, full with plenty of citrus fruitiness. With a crisp aftertaste, it is bright at the end.",86,Château Sainte Roseline 2016 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Sweet and fragrant, floral and fruity, this Prosecco Extra Dry (with 10% Pinot Bianco) has a feminine, creamy disposition and excellent harmony of aromas and effervescence. It's very filling in the mouth with generous accents of stone fruit and honey; “47” marks the year the winery was founded.",88,Bortolotti NV Extra Dry 47  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
"A rich, round and silky texture provide pure pleasure in this exotically perfumed vineyard-designate that's full bodied and exuberant in baked plum, black pepper and anise. Well integrated and complex, it traffics in deeper, darker plumes of smoke and tobacco toward the lengthy finish.",93,Trinchero 2012 Haystack Vineyard Malbec (Atlas Peak)
"Good price for a sophisticated Cab you can substitute for more expensive bottlings without apologizing. The wine is rich in black currants, blackberry jam and spicy oak, accented by savory herbs and spices.",87,Christine Andrew 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi)
"Aromas of white peach and honeysuckle yield to flavors of grapefruit, peach, jasmine and orange blossom. This wine is smooth in the mouth and the zesty finish is characterized by lingering floral flavors.",88,Ouled Thaleb 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Zenata)
"Hay, tomato leaf and stone fruit aromas waft out of the glass. The elegant palate is a bit more reserved than the nose, offering yellow peach and chopped herb. Crisp acidity brightens the flavors while a graphite note closes the finish.",90,Mario Schiopetto 2013 Sauvignon (Collio)
"Pisca vineyard is a recent purchase by Niepoort, although the company has bought fruit there for many years. This is a first as a single quinta wine, softer than the Niepoort vintage, immediately attractive, finely balanced. It has structure and sweet fruit.",92,Niepoort 2007 Pisca Vintage  (Port)
"Black cherry fruit gets serious with elements of slate, eucalyptus, tar and wild mint on this wine from the Corralitos area at the southern coastal edge of the appellation. It's soft at first on the palate, then reveals a wash of acidity, with sour cherry fruit and black tea tannins.",90,Big Basin 2012 Alfaro Family Vineyards Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Dark in color, deep in aroma, quietly intense in flavor and so mouthcoating in texture—this Cabernet demands to be noticed. Yet all of those bold elements are wrapped in a tightly woven and softly finished texture. The flavors are like dark chocolate and ripe blackberries, the mouthfeel is fine and it's not overly tannic or too full-bodied.",90,Carnivor 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Bricco Barone is a smokey, meaty expression of Nebbiolo with bold aromas of black fruit, prune, dried tobacco leaf and finely milled white pepper. This pretty wine ends with a masculine blast of earthy, dusty tones.",89,Marziano Abbona 2008 Bricco Barone  (Nebbiolo d'Alba)
"Given time to settle in both used French oak and stainless steel, this is a nice effort from a well-respected vineyard that's big and juicy in grapefruit and melon. Made in a lighter style, it offers a bite of oak on the finish, leaving a substantial impression.",87,Apsara 2015 Kick Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County)
"This is a deliciously ripe, full-bodied wine with all the red berry fruits, orange zest and acidity that you could want. It's finely made with a creamy mousse and a fresh and fruity aftertaste.",90,Willm NV Blanc de Noirs Brut Pinot Noir (Crémant d'Alsace)
"94–96. Barrel sample. This is a beautifully crafted wine with red fruits, a touch of black currant, great acidity and dense structure. A blend of half-and-half Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, it shows both weight and a great lift.",95,Château Palmer 2012 Barrel Sample  (Margaux)
"The perfumes are slightly unbalanced, tasting confected. The fruit seems to be missing.",82,Domaine Bott-Geyl 2010 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"This outstanding effort offers a vanilla wrap around solid fruit flavors of white peach, yellow plum and nectarine. The texture and detail are delightful, as the wine generously fills in the finish with a hint of marzipan.",92,Ponzi 2014 Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley)
"This is a successful Pinot Noir in terms of its lighter style, silkiness and generosity, showing real finesse and delicacy. It's a tartly acidic wine with delicious flavors of cola and sour cherry candy. Try pairing it with mushroom risotto speckled with crumbled bacon.",88,Wine Spots 2010 Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"A good, solid California Chardonnay at a fair price. It's creamy and crisp, with palate-satisfying flavors of pineapples, pears and green apples.",84,Greg Norman California Estates 2007 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County)
"Excessive tartness is the chief fault of this wine. The tannins are faultlessly beautiful, and the flavors, of crushed summer blackberries, teriaki beef, green tea and black pepper, are complex. But that cut of acidity is severe.",85,Rancho Sisquoc 2011 Flood Family Vineyards Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"Full in the mouth, this ripe, spicy wine offers a fruit salad of flavors that are topped with some wood-aging flavors. Drink from 2016 for the wood to be fully integrated into the fruit. After the Jonck family's 350 years in South Africa's Western Cape, vineyard owner Johan Jonck and family decamped to Bordeaux in 2011. Consulting enologist is Eric Bardon.",90,Château Espérance 2014 Instinct  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"This stylish wine is tight, crisp and with fine intense acidity. Its apple fruitiness is bright, delicious and refreshing. With its lively aftertaste, this is ready to drink now.",87,Château Gaudrelle NV Vigneau Brut  (Vouvray)
"Starts with some odd aromas of burnt rubber, charred plum and scorched marshmallow, then delivers slightly sweet, caramelly flavors. It's thick and viscous in texture yet without much in the way of tannin.",81,Patritti 2007 Shiraz (South Australia)
"A bright, fruity style that shows red berry fruits along with attractive perfumed tannins. This is already an approachable wine, just structured enough to give the juicy fruit a backbone.",88,Domaine de la Noblaie 2010 Les Chiens-Chiens  (Chinon)
"At 70% Garnacha and 30% Tempranillo, this hold-over from the sketchy 2002 harvest starts with an odd blend of clove and shaved wood notes, while the palate pushes basic cherry and tangy raspberry flavors.",83,Valle Rojo 2002 Crianza Grenache-Tempranillo Red (Cariñena)
"Poised and poetic, this wine starts with a lovely floral nose of violet and unfolds in the mouth with smooth but structured elegance. Overall spiced wood and pepper flavors are meaty but soft.",88,The Williamsburg Winery 2005 Gabriel Archer Reserve Red (Virginia)
"Darkly tannic, this wine has a dense structure that needs time. It is firm, dry and concentrated. The fruit potential is still developing so keep this wine until 2017. Enologist Sebastien and vineyard manager Nicolas are the latest generation managing the Carreau family estates.",86,Château Clairac 2012 Grande Réserve  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"This is a Tuscan blend with character. The nose is full of cinnamon, mint, cloves and spice, while on the palate, an enticing blend of cherry, raspberry, mocha, mint and spice makes it a great solo sip. A solid wine with an overall likeable personality.",85,Chaddsford 2006 25th Vintage Rubino Super-Tuscan Style Blend Red (Pennsylvania)
"Leathery and earthy, with hints of cranberries and chocolate. It's medium bodied and supple enough to drink now, turning a bit tart on the finish.",84,Lucas Carton 2005 Red (Côtes du Rhône)
"Spiced meats, cherry and pepper give this plucky red a food-friendly edge. On the palate, it's spicy and slightly tart, with cranberry, blueberry and crushed herbs. Earthy and dry, the wine will pair well with spiced meat and pastas.",83,Vivác Winery 2006 Divino Red (New Mexico)
"Lemony and sort of chemical smelling, with green herbs, graphite and berry aromas. Feels compact, without much layering or body. Tastes herbal, with red currant and berry fruit in the background. Minty and resiny on the finish.",83,Ventisquero 2010 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"Mild apple, pear and almond aromas give way to a plump but bland palate. Melon and papaya flavors are fair, while the finish is clean but light. This Verdejo-SB blend is a straightforward quaffer.",85,Yuntero 2013 Mundo de Yuntero Bio Verdejo-Sauvignon Blanc White (La Mancha)
"Rose petal perfume accents sweet peach and apricots in this luscious, varietally classic Gewürztraminer. It's rich and round on the palate, plump with stone fruit and lychee flavors and finishes elegantly on an astringent black-tea note. Off dry in style, it's balanced and composed in alcohol and acidity.",89,Keuka Spring 2014 Gewurztraminer (Finger Lakes)
"As its name suggests this is a selection of barrels of Syrah and Touriga Nacional. It is rich, smooth and full of ripe fruit. The dusty tannins are in suspension, backing up the black plum and blueberry fruit flavors. Along with the juicy acidity, this is a wine to age. Drink from 2017.",92,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2013 Lagoalva Barrel Selection Tinto Red (Tejo)
"This full-bodied red opens with aromas of mature plum, hay, underbrush and scorched earth. The ripe, juicy palate doles out layers of black cherry, strawberry, tobacco and cinnamon alongside chewy tannins. It's already enjoyable but will also age well for several years. Enjoy through 2019.",90,Lunadoro 2011 Tradizionale  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano)
"Crafted from 12 different clones planted throughout the estate vineyard, farmed to perfection, this is a delicious and exuberant expression of blueberry crumble that's succulent and inviting in every way. Full bodied, it retains enough acidity to remain mouthwatering and yet complex, a subtlety of white pepper and cardamom biting at the its heels. Drink now through 2024.",95,Wayfarer 2014 Wayfarer Vineyard Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview)
"Hot saucy plum and berry aromas set up an abrasive tannic palate that's choppy and short. Dark plum and berry aromas finish with jagged, hard tannins and bright acidity.",86,Lidio Carraro 2014 Agnus Tannat (Serra Gaúcha)
"One of the winery's upper-end bottlings, this shows strawberries, dried fennel stalks and an earthy minerality on the nose. The flavors prove a bit cooked, with stewed berries, char, dark tobacco, dark chocolate and black pepper.",88,Peachy Canyon 2012 Vortex Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"McCay's Westside Zin, Trulux, opens with a strong bouquet of red and black fruit along with a suggestion of anise. Inviting, it's structured and smooth in tannins, with a bite of oak on the finish. Earthy and with great acidity throughout, it makes for a great food wine.",90,McCay Cellars 2010 Trulux Zinfandel (Lodi)
"Structured, complex wine that is only just beginning to hint at considerable depth of powerful, rich flavors. The structure is dry, a little lean, but with dense tannins. The fruit, rich plums and stone fruits is just coming through. Age for 10 years.",91,Fonseca 2005 Quinta do Panascal  (Port)
"This medium-bodied blend of 70% Sangiovese, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot offers mature berry and baking spice aromas. On the palate, round tannins temper the ripe black cherry, vanilla and coffee flavors. Drink through 2018.",88,Il Sassolo 2011 Santa Cristina a Mezzana  (Carmignano)
"Richly soft, round and concentrated, this wine is exuberant in apple flavor, with a touch of stone fruit and papaya. It has a pleasing succulence that should broadly appeal.",90,Landmark 2015 Overlook Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"Sashi Moorman and Rajat Parr love to pick early, and it shows with aromas of stewed tomatoes, green olives, green cardamom and Eastern European spices. It's very savory and wakes up the palate with vinegar-laden flavors reminiscent of North African tagines, and would make an excellent extra-spice accompaniment to a wide variety of foods. Expect this wine to grow in complexity and approachability 2018–2024.",92,Domaine de la Cote 2012 la Cote Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Flat aromas of coconut and toasted oak give way to smoky chocolate mocha, red currant and black pepper. A touch soft on the finish, it otherwise drinks full-bodied and powerful.",88,Corner 103 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley)
"Mont-Redon's Lirac is a medium-bodied, supple blend of 70% Grenache, 20% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre. Cherry, cinnamon and leather notes all make appearances, backed by nearly creamy-textured tannins. It's a smooth, easy-drinking red for drinking now–2017.",88,Château Mont-Redon 2011 Red (Lirac)
"Berry, menthol and a hint of espresso aromas lead the way while the straightforward palate shows mature black-skinned berry, coffee and a hint of licorice. It's already approachable. Drink through 2020.",87,Borgogno F.lli Serio e Battista 2012  Barolo
"Vines around 25 years old on this family domaine yield this soft and creamy wine. It has attractive, crisp acidity and a bright texture that brings in apples and lemon flavors. The wine is ready to drink.",88,Domaine Fourrey 2014  Chablis
"This classic vineyard delivers the goodies—ripe, round and quite pretty flavors of raspberry and cherry fruit, with orange peel highlights. The tangy acidity keeps it lively and the length suggests that it will drink well through the mid-2020s.",92,Roco 2014 Knudsen Vineyards Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Blackberry candies, purple flowers, black tea and hints of shaved dark chocolate show on the nose of this blend of 65% Syrah, 25% Mourvèdre and 10% Grenache. A zesty acidity kicks off the sip, then a tannic structure emerges, with thoroughly integrated flavors of pressed violet, dense blueberry jelly, tart olallieberry and a burned-caramel edge.",90,Chronic Cellars 2013 Ricardo Grande Red (Paso Robles)
"Certified organic by Ecocert, this estate straddles the communes of Sablet, Plan de Dieu and Gigondas. This entry-level blend of 75% Grenache and 25% Syrah is beautifully floral and herbal, yet backed by appealing red and purple fruit. Medium to full in body, it's firm but ripe, framed by dusty tannins. Drink now–2020.",90,Domaine des Pasquiers 2013 Red (Côtes du Rhône)
"Gritty, uric, green aromas come in front of a round palate with little cut. Vegetal, bitter flavors of bell pepper and grapefruit finish with another wave of bitterness.",82,François Lurton 2015 Hacienda Araucano Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Lolol Valley)
"John Kinney is doing great things with Livermore Valley fruit, most especially with many of his whites, including this classically oaked Fumé Blanc, the grapes barrel-fermented in 100% French oak (Seguin Moreau and Taransaud) and left sur lie for six months, Montrachet style. Creamy but bright with aromatics of caramel and vanilla, but only 50 cases were made.",90,Occasio 2010 Del Arroyo Vineyard Fumé Blanc (Livermore Valley)
"From an 850-foot-elevation site four miles from the ocean, this offers a depth of dark cherry and Asian spice, lightly bodied and textured. It delivers a hit of bittersweet chocolate on the tangy finish, with an intriguing streak of charcuterie that's hard to shake.",91,Whistler 2013 Corvus Whistler Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This is from a fantastic vineyard site in the Laguna Hills neighborhood of the appellation, and the second vintage of this particular selection from this producer. Generous lemony oak meets toast within a robust body of complex layers and salty caramel.",92,MacPhail 2014 Pratt Vineyard Vine Hill Road Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Peppery iron-oxide notes dance alongside notions of blueberry and cherry. The colour is dark but the fruit is crunchy and fresh. There is drive and vividness at the core of this rustic, appetizing red. Tannins are present and give a pleasant but light grip. Fresh acidity provides even more focus. With food this will shine. Drink soon to enjoy its vividness.",89,Gunter Triebaumer 2014 Trie Rot Red (Burgenland)
"Yellow in color, with a peachy, baked set of aromas. The palate hits with a blast of acidity but not much else, while the flavors are brash and lean toward green apple and green plum. Rounder and softer on the finish, but also short.",86,Huguet de Can Feixes 2009 Blanc Selecció White (Penedès)
"Just barely drinkable. It's not dirty or anything, but watery and very fruity.",80,Inkling 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"It was fascinating to compare this to Two Paddocks' regular bottling. The Last Chance is slightly richer, but otherwise features many of the same elements: smoke, tart cherries and delicate herbal notes. Despite the extra concentration, it's still supple and approachable now.",90,Two Paddocks 2012 The Last Chance Earnscleugh Vineyard Pinot Noir (Central Otago)
"Clean and fresh, with light citrus and apple flavors. A pleasant, somewhat beery flavor.",84,Stonecap 2009 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Citrus blossom and tropical aromas are light and easy. The palate is melony and not too acidic, with standard Asian pear, lychee and citrus flavors. Lively on the finish, and solid overall for under $10.",85,Acordeón 2010 Torrontés (Cafayate)
"Longoria has worked with this finicky Spanish grape variety for years, with mixed results. This 2010 is lower in alcohol than the wine has been in a long time, which gives it a delicate mouthfeel. It's dense in cherries, currants, bacon and licorice, but finishes dry. Easy to like for its soft deliciousness.",88,Longoria 2010 Tempranillo (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Pure, focused fruit flavors like raspberry and red cherry light up this medium-bodied wine. A lively texture of crisp acidity and light tannins adds great balance to the effusive fruitiness. For such a friendly price, what else could one ask for?",87,Twisted 2013 Old Vine Zinfandel (California)
"Pretty basic, a dryly tannic red wine with cherry and herb flavors. Feels hard and sharp in the mouth, with astringent tannins and acids. Could age out.",84,Viansa 2007 Athena Dolcetto (Sonoma County)
"Recently implemented winemaker and cellar changes make this one of the best Sassicaias ever. This Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc blend delivers thick concentration and sun-kissed aromas of black fruit, prune, dried bay leaf, black olive and tobacco. The thick, fertile soils that characterize the magical strip of coastal Tuscany at Bol-gheri help shape amazing richness and intensity.",97,Tenuta San Guido 2008 Sassicaia  (Bolgheri Sassicaia)
"This is a woody, oak-dominated Malbec, but it's also ripe and well made. Aromas of sawdust, vanilla and toast support raw berry essence. In the mouth, tartaric notes stick out amid the richness, while flavors of oak, toast, vanilla and berry fruits finish woody but with wayward acidity.",90,Finca la Celia 2011 Heritage Single Vineyard Malbec (Uco Valley)
"Tin House has been producing good Pinot Noirs that have been pushing the possibilities for Edna Valley, although the prices are going up every year. This bottling shows pure, ripe cherry, currant and cocoa flavors and rich, sweet oak, with the acidity that characterizes everything from this cool part of the Central Coast. Drink now through 2010.",88,Tin House 2005 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)
"Easy to drink, this has enough sophistication to pair with rich scallop, tuna and lobster dishes. It's dry, although there's a lot of sweetly ripe orange, apricot and buttercream flavors, as well as caramelized oak. Brisk acidity fortunately brings a crisp, balanced edge.",90,Jordan 2010 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"A good effort in a cool vintage, the winery's top cuvée brings tart cranberry and cherry fruit, racy and fresh, along with flavors of stem and herb. The wine spent 11 months in barrel, but shows no significant oak flavors.",90,The Four Graces 2011 Black Family Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Fleshy blueberries are met with soft vanilla notes on this full-fruited yet light-footed red. On the palate the bursting blueberry notes are even more appetizing and joined by pleasant pepper with just a hint of tobacco. There is something rather seductive about these fruit-driven reds that deliver more than simple fruit. Utterly delicious, very elegant and dangerously drinkable.",92,Nittnaus Anita und Hans 2013 Heideboden Red (Burgenland)
"Made from certified organically grown grapes, this wisp of a wine is made in a quiet style from a cool year and a relatively cool area of the Napa Valley. Pencil lead, peppercorn and cedar come to mind first and foremost, followed by light, juicy notes of classic cassis. Not overly oaked, the finish suggests chocolate.",88,Ackerman 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville)
"This aromatic wine brings a potpourri of freshly rubbed sage, Dimetapp, bay leaf and sweet tobacco. It's broad yet light in feel with a pretty sense of elegance and restraint.",88,Robert Ramsay 2012 Upland Vineyards Grenache (Snipes Mountain)
"This very fruity wine oozes fresh apricot and elegant peach flavors. It's crisp and fragrant, a fine, ready-to-drink blend of Antão Vaz, Roupeiro and Arinto.",86,Quinta do Quetzal 2011 Guadalupe Branco White (Alentejano)
"This appellation blend is rich and lush with baked black-cherry aromas, touches of black cardamom and clove spice, and earthy rhubarb and beet notes. The palate packs a lot of forest-floor flavors, from loam to pine needles, into dark cranberry and tight raspberry fruit, leveled by pepper and pencil lead.",89,Ken Brown 2013 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"This is solidly anchored in its ripe cherry fruit, a rich mouthful that represents the best of the winery's 2012 lineup of reserve bottlings. Highlights of citrus fruits elevate the acids, and there is a pleasing hint of toast across the full midpalate.",90,Walnut City WineWorks 2012 Carlton Hill Vineyard Reserve Pinot Noir
"Nero d'Avola and Merlot are blended to produce a ripe, chewy wine with mature fruit flavors. The nose is a bit muddled and dense but the wine offers good succulence and depth.",86,Abbazia Santa Anastasia 2005 Passomaggio Red (Sicilia)
"Beginning with a velvety texture and inviting bouquet of strawberry and rose, this classic blend of 82% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Cabernet Franc, 8% Petit Verdot and 2% Merlot is grown on the winery's 845-acre estate atop Spring Mountain. Kirsch, black pepper and chocolate combine atop a smooth, integrated palate that's elegant from start to finish, the oak tempered to good effect. Drink now through 2027.",94,Spring Mountain Vineyard 2012 Elivette Red (Napa Valley)
"The perfumed character of this pure Vermentino is right up front. It gives the wine its ripe character and fine orange blossom aromas. The wine is crisp, juicy and with a refreshing aftertaste.",87,Clos Teddi 2015 Vermentino (Patrimonio)
"Marked by powerful oak influences and sur-lie aging, this Kunde offering features strong, forward aromas of the ripest pears and apples, but maintains a light quality on the palate.",88,Kunde 1998 Wildwood Vineyard Chardonnay (California)
"Bright raspberry, cherry and rose petal aromas meet cola spice on the pretty, delicate nose of this bottling—a solid example of the surge in quality of Central Coast Grenache. There is a tense tannic structure to the palate despite its light nature, with great acidity presenting tangy red and purple fruit flavors, with more rose petal accents.",93,Margerum 2014 Grenache (Santa Barbara County)
"Vigna del Mandorlo Dolcetto d'Alba opens with bright freshness and loads of cherry, blueberry, raspberry and toasted almond. The wine shows freshness that is balanced by smooth, velvety tannins.",87,Azienda Agricola Cogno 2009 Vigna del Mandorlo  (Dolcetto d'Alba)
"Rounded and soft, with gentle tannins. Packed with black cherry fruits, a herbal edge and sweetness, this is already an approachable wine, fruity and generous.",88,Joseph Drouhin 2009  Santenay
"There's a soft, candied appeal to the cherry, strawberry and blackberry flavors in this dry, young wine. With a sweet oak jacket, it's clean and pleasant to drink now.",86,Alexander Valley Vineyards 2009 Wetzel Family Estate Syrah (Alexander Valley)
"To call this wine huge is an understatement. Blended from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Petit Verdot, Syrah and Carmenère, its most notable feature is tannins. It's hard, dry and astringent, making it difficult to appreciate now. But there's a gigantic core of blackberries and black currants. With richness like this, it should age and improve through 2020 at least.",91,Chalk Hill 2010 Estate Red (Chalk Hill)
"A soft, creamy texture houses buttery flavors of blackberry jam and mocha in this Cab, which has a drop of Merlot. It's flashy and opulent, in the modern Napa style, with relatively high alcohol that gives a bite of heat. Drink it over the next six years.",89,Robinson Family Vineyards 2010 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District)
"Although this is a soft wine without great definition, it conveys a pleasant, refreshing mix of melon and lime flavors. It's a young wine that is ready to drink.",85,Quinta de Sant'Ana 2012 Verdelho (Lisboa)
"Part of the select group of impressive wines from this year, this wine is ripe, rich and firmly structured. Black-currant fruitiness forms the base for solid tannins and a concentrated texture. The hints of wood-aging need to soften. Drink from 2022.",93,Château Léoville Barton 2013  Saint-Julien
"A mix of strawberry-rhubarb compote, mocha-chocolate and chalky tannins are featured in this 80% Cabernet with smaller amounts of other Bordeaux varieties blended in. Dense and meaty, a powerful jolt of cassis rears its head on the finish.",89,Terra Valentine 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Bright and supple, this wine is vibrantly awash in red cherry, raspberry and whisps of vanilla, finishing lean and with plenty of versatility.",88,Borrellie 2014 Reserve Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"With almost zero dosage, this is dry but it doesn't feel at all unbalanced because of the ripe, fragrant fruitiness. The wine is full in the mouth, with lively acidity. It is ready to drink, particularly with food.",90,Vincent Couche NV Brut Nature  (Champagne)
"Creamy, almost mellow notes of ripe yellow apple constitute the nose. The palate intensifies that creaminess with hints of vanilla and burnt sugar as well as with a finely fizzing, creamy mousse. All this is countered and balanced by sprightly freshness. Overall it conveys an opulent, hedonistic style, with an expressive and long finish reminiscent of salted caramel.",93,Arndorfer 2012 die Leidenschaft Sparkling (Niederösterreich)
"With a name like this, it should come as no surprise that this is 85% Carmenère (with 15% Malbec and Syrah). This smells like pencil lead, plastic and blueberry. In the mouth, it's chunky but flat, with flavors of plastic, lactic oak and herbal berry fruits. A minty, green finish is oaky and adequate.",85,Car Men Air 2011 Red (Maule Valley)
"Soft and relatively open in style, with captivating aromas of wet mossy stones and ripe melon and hints of pear and lychee on the palate. Very approachable now for a young Prüm.",91,Joh. Jos. Prüm 2009 Graacher Himmelreich Auslese Riesling (Mosel)
"Aromas of oak, toast, espresso, peppermint and a whiff of blue flower lead the nose. The firm palate offers dark cherry, cake spice, grilled herb and anise alongside tightly wound, assertive tannins and bright acidity.",91,Alberto Voerzio 2011 La Serra  (Barolo)
"This 100% Sangiovese Chianti opens with iris, new leather and vanilla aromas. Structured and savory, the palate delivers black cherry, tobacco and licorice flavors, while chewy tannins lend structure. Enjoy through 2021.",90,Castello di Radda 2012 Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico)
"The lightest of the dessert wines made by Claude Loustalot, this is fruity, fragrant and medium sweet, with refreshing acidity. The crisp texture combines hints of honey and apricot jam. Drink now.",88,Domaine Bru-Baché 2010  Jurançon
"There's a layered complexity to this interesting blend of 47% Viognier, 32% Chenin Blanc, 18% Roussanne and 3% Grenache Blanc, with a beautiful interplay between the fruity notes of citrus peel, tart melon, green apple and plum and the earthy tones of fynbos, almond skin and sweet baking spice. The plush texture is countered by ample acidity, leading into a clean finish that's laced with toasty accents. Drink now–2018.",89,Fairview 2013 Nurok White (Paarl)
"Delicious flavors of cola, cherries, raspberries, rose tea, orange peel, vanilla and smoky sandalwood merge in this single-vineyard Pinot Noir, and it's nicely dry, with a silky-smooth texture. Give it a good decant before serving, as it gets better as it breathes.",90,Peters Family 2006 Sonoma Stage Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This wine is appealing for its smooth mouth-feel, mildly spicy aromas and dried-fruit flavors. Medium to full bodied, it also tastes mellow and mature, with no rough edges poking out.",85,Red 7 2010 Proprietary Red (North Coast)
"Aromas of berry, coffee, herbs and smoke lead to dark fruit flavors with a layered, supple feel. It's a good find at this price.",90,Purple Star 2012 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A strong pineapple and mango imprint persists throughout this Chardonnay, along with bright acidity and a floral finish.",84,un4seen 2011 Chardonnay (Lodi)
"A simple, everyday Chardonnay that's refreshingly crisp, with sweet lime, orange, pear and vanilla flavors.",83,Pepi 2011 Chardonnay (California)
This is vinified in cement vats to retain the purity of fruit and easy crispness. You will also notice slight dusty tones of crushed mineral and vitamin on the finish.,84,Piazzano 2011  Chianti
"There's a meaty, smoked element to the nose of this Brunello that recalls beef jerky or sizzling bacon. Those hearty aromas are followed by delicate layers of blackberry, cherry and spice. The wine is bright and acidic in the mouth, which makes for an excellent balance.",89,La Colombina 2005  Brunello di Montalcino
"Tight, dark and oaky on the nose, this has woody power, cedary complexity and lots of staunch berry character. It is full, grabby and tannic, showing a firm spine to support toasty, oaky, clove-influenced flavors. Dark, tight and toasty on the finish; drink now–2019.",92,Matarromera 2006 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)
"A rustic Chardonnay, with a sweet-and-sour orange sauce flavor and a creamy texture.",82,Lucas & Lewellen 2007 Goodchild Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County)
"A wine that delivers great freshness, a bright lemon and grapefruit character, tautly mineral in character, almost steely, with a pure line of green fruits. Age for 2–3 years.",92,Joseph Drouhin 2008 Domaine Drouhin-Vaudon Montmains Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"This is a very mineral-driven pink wine, with aromas of wet rocks, chalk and even steel giving way to the slightest hints of orange and strawberry. The flavors are very delicate and refreshing on the palate, with melon and red pear, rounded out by a key lime acidity.",89,Robert Renzoni 2016 Lyric Rose of Syrah (Temecula Valley)
"This Columbia Valley Syrah boasts strong varietal aromatics. It seems to have a spine of iron and a streak of garrigue-like dried herb, with lovely flavors of pomegranate and wild berry.",91,Novelty Hill 2009 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Aromas of smoke, char and spice entice the nose of this zippy, medium-bodied Lemberger. The palate is crisp, offering tart black cherry and blackberry flavors fringed delicately with tannins. Finishes long, with a delicate floral note.",88,Hosmer 2010 Lemberger (Cayuga Lake)
"This first wine of the vintage, a blend of Pinot Noir, Grenache, and Valdigue, is largely the result of carbonic maceration, a winemaking technique that creates the freshest, sharpest, zingiest aromas and flavors imaginable. ItÕs vibrant and juicy, like Beaujolais. The gorgeous ripeness of the fruit bodes well for the 2001 vintage. Great value.",86,Beringer 2001 Nouveau Red (California)
"The Ulysses red has been the main calling card for this winery, and it is a distinctive wine that expresses the complexity—with no herbs barred—of Yakima Valley grapes. Woven into the heart of the wine are threads of herb, olive, pea vine and other green notes, but there are also black cherry and cassis flavors. It's balanced and proportionate, closer to a true Bordeaux-style blend than most Washington efforts.",91,O•S Winery 2008 Sheridan Vineyard Ulysses Red Red (Yakima Valley)
This edition of Pian di Nova from the Ferragamo-owned Il Borro estate in Tuscany shows ripe notes of raspberry and black cherry with slight shadings of bitter chocolate and spice.,88,Il Borro 2006 Pian di Nova Red (Toscana)
"Tastes young and jammy now, with perky, tartly sweet flavors of blackberries, cherries and currants. Oak adds smoky complexities that bring to mind mocha, vanilla and buttered toast, with a sprinkle of cinnamon. Somewhat lacking in nuance, with plenty of flash, this Cab should develop over the next 6–8 years.",91,Martin Estate 2006 Collector's Reserve Puerta Dorada Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"Aromas of toast, espresso and meat juices lead the nose. The palate offers oak, cured meat, grilled herb and dried red fruit alongside firm but fine-grained tannins. Drink 2016–2022.",88,Podere La Vigna 2010  Brunello di Montalcino
"Surprisingly smoky and toasty upfront, but balanced by ample apricot fruit and hints of honey, pineapple and citrus zest. Despite its ripe, oaky nature, there's plenty of crisp acidity to provide structure and prolong the finish. Drink now–2016.",92,Gilles Flacher 2011 Les Rouelles  (Condrieu)
"From a vintage not known for its supersweet selections, this wine is a revelation. Honey and bergamot notes mingle easily on the nose, while the palate unfolds to reveal layers of honey, dried apricots and orange marmalade. It's rich, viscous and concentrated without any heaviness, with a finish that's sweet and lingering. This should age through 2040 easily.",96,St. Urbans-Hof 2008 Leiwener Laurentiuslay Beerenauslese Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer)
"This wine is a blend of fruit from Summit View, Klipsun and Doval vineyards. Aromas of wood spice, purple fruit, vanilla and exotic spice are followed by tart cranberry and cherry flavors, with the midpalate dipping in concentration. The tannins bring quite a bit of grip.",87,Browne Family Vineyards 2013 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Castle Rock does a fine job with this value Cabernet Sauvignon. Smooth and supple, the very pretty fruit flavors range from cranberry to black cherry. Delicate suggestions of mushroom, cocoa and dusty earth add welcome complexity.",89,Castle Rock 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The nose is fruity, with hints of vanilla bean. In the mouth, peach and lemon flavors carry a note of cinnamon spice, although the finish veers toward asparagus and green beans. Acidity and balance; are both on the money. Best Buy.",86,Concha y Toro 2001 Casillero del Diablo Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)
"Named after the Pontac family which in the 18th century owned large swathes of Bordeaux and its vineyards, this estate is based around a former hunting lodge. The wine is ripe and full, finely structured and with tight still-young acidity. Drink from 2022.",92,Château Pontac Monplaisir 2014  Pessac-Léognan
"Darkly charred wood mingles with scents of coconut, dill and sweet spice on this heavily-oaked Chardonnay. Hints of smoke and hazelnuts seep into the palate as well, but serve to highlight fresh, fruity flavors of pear, lemon and orange rind. This finishes on a slightly-bitter wood note.",85,Truro 2010 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (America)
"Coming in at 47g/L residual sugar, this is quite ripe and aromatic with notes of peach and flowers but doesn't have the acid to hold it together.",85,Hyatt 2012 Riesling (Rattlesnake Hills)
"Earthy notes of white mushroom, shaved truffle or oak barrel open the nose of this Riserva Barbaresco and are soon followed by toasted hazelnuts and dark chocolate. The fruit element is minimal but the wine shows nice tightness and firmness on the finish.",88,Fratelli Casetta 2006 Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"Fresh, superripe as well as candied pineapple combine to give utter opulence to this rich and viscous wine. The longer you taste, the more intense—almost heady—these tropical flavors become. What is more, as an ice wine untainted by any botrytis, this shines with purity and drive, and has astonishing acidity that keeps this just on the right side of paradise.",94,Stift Klosterneuburg 2011 Eiswein Jungherrn Chardonnay (Vienna)
"This winery has shown a knack with Malbec and it continues on its young estate project. Aromas of herbs, tobacco, red plum and clove are fresh and appealing. The palate is lush, textured, concentrated and flavorful with a spice-filled finish that keeps you coming back for more. Expect this wine to drink well through 2030.",92,àMaurice 2010 Amparo Estate Malbec (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Produced from old vines on schist soils, this is an intensely structured wine. While it has power, it is the texture and the firm fruit that give it character. Black fruits combine with dark tannins to create a dry, solid aftertaste.",90,Adega Cooperativa de Borba 2007 Montes Claros Garrafeira Red (Alentejo)
"Smooth to the edge of silky, this barrel-fermented wine spent 14 months in French oak. Green apple and butter flavors are foremost, with a light suggestion of fresh herb.",87,Soléna 2013 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
"Lightly herbaceous, this is a fresh, obviously youthful wine. It is only lightly textured, the main character coming from yellow fruits and pear juice flavors. Drink now, although it will age and improve until 2016.",84,Château Moulin de Vignolle 2014  Bordeaux Blanc
"Dark in color, this is a powerful, classic wine, with dense tannins. It has rich black-fruit flavors, and notes of wood and herb that are packed into its concentrated, dry structure. This is a great Douro for aging.",95,Niepoort 2009 Batuta Red (Douro)
"Roasted hazelnut with grilled pineapple and peach carry the aromas and palate of this vineyard-designate Chardonnay. Having spent 11 months in French oak (33% new), the wine shows barrel tones, however a bright acidity helps keep things alive and fresh.",88,Michael Shaps 2013 Wild Meadow Vineyard Chardonnay (Virginia)
"Much lighter in weight than many Pinot Gris on the market, this is a pretty, fruit-driven rendering of the variety, blending tropical fruit with ripe apples and hints of pink grapefruit. It's crisp and clean on the finish.",85,Dr. Wehrheim 2005 Grauer Burgunder Kabinett Trocken Pinot Gris (Pfalz)
"Fairly aromatic, it conveys notes of red and black fruit, savory herbs, toffee and barrel spices. Lighter in style, it shows abundant vanilla flavors while still bringing a lovely sense of texture and overall balance.",89,Silvan Ridge 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rogue Valley)
"There's a lot to like in this affordable Syrah. It's rich and smoky, with blackberry and bacon flavors wrapped in a smooth texture. With 17,000 cases produced, this should be relatively easy to find.",87,Sterling 2009 Vintner's Collection Syrah (Central Coast)
"Although this is the winery's reserve-level blend, it doesn't work well in this vintage. Vague and muted, the mix of grapes lacks focus, offering just a thin, generic red wine with a chalky aftertaste.",83,Weisinger 2011 Petit Pompadour Red (Rogue Valley)
"Coming from a new vineyard near the town of Los Olivos, this bottling starts with steely aromas of dried lime rind, baking soda, gunmetal and quince on the nose. It's very tightly wound on the palate, where an intriguing texture reveals lemongrass, kaffir-lime leaf, aromatic cider apple and metallic minerality.",91,Solminer 2015 Delanda Vineyard Grüner Veltliner (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Ah, Tignanello, the father of all super Tuscans. A tried and true favorite, it is a Sangiovese-based wine cut with a small component of Cabernet for rich aromas of red fruit and spice. It is elegant, harmonious and long-lasting on the finish; drink after 2012.",95,Marchesi Antinori 2004 Tignanello Red (Toscana)
"An interesting note of sweet smoke graces the nose of this Merlot, adding another layer to the otherwise traditional characteristics of rich black berry and dark plum guts. Round and satisfying in the mouth with approachable tannins and a medium finish.",85,Indaba 2010 Merlot (Western Cape)
"Pali's multi-vineyard Summit blend has come from various appellations over the years. The 2010 shows the ripe cherry-berry flavors and fine acidity of the Santa Rita Hills. It's good, but a bit warm, sweet and simple.",86,Pali 2010 Summit Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"An oily bouquet lacks freshness while smelling a bit oxidized and like mushrooms. This has a chunky palate with oxidized, somewhat bitter flavors of papaya and citrus fruits. A pithy mildly bitter finish struggles to show its virtues.",84,Vieira de Plata 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Fully mature, oxidized aromas include a heavy note of popcorn and oak along with aged pear and apple. This wine is ripping with acidity, while flavors lean towards salty, lightly baked apple. A finish based mostly on acid means this should stay vital for years to come.",87,Portal del Montsant 2011 Santbru White (Montsant)
"A blend of 45% Carignan, 30% Grenache, 20% Mourvèdre and 5% Syrah, this is a beautifully expressive, well-balanced Corbières-Boutenac red. Initial aromas of dense red plum, raspberry, and strawberry give way to secondary scents of rose, lavender and thyme. The medium-weight palate shows more fresh fruit character, with fine yet structured tannins lending grip through the close.",90,Château Ollieux Romanis 2013 Atal Sia Red (Corbières-Boutenac)
"Young vines, the first release from estate-grown fruit. The vanilla flavors of the barrels are front and center at the moment, though there are darker fruits in the background, along with smoke, licorice and a hint of tar. Good long-term potential.",86,Folin Cellars 2008 Petite Sirah (Rogue Valley)
"This fresh, pure value red cranks out raspberry and boysenberry aromas in front of a crisp, tight palate. Ripe, quick-hitting flavors of red-berry fruits and toasty smoke finish zesty, with a lasting note of pie cherry.",90,Encanto 2011 Roble Mencía (Bierzo)
"Fleshy, unfocused aromas of apple and peach are a touch oxidized. This Chardonnay feels bland. Flavors of melon and peach lack tension and character, while there's not much flavor to the finish other than mild apple and some bitterness.",84,Bodegas San Valero 2014 Particular Chardonnay (Cariñena)
"There's a nice intensity of pineapple, guava and hoppy, floral aromas on the nose of this estate-grown Riesling. Racy and linear on the light-bodied palate, tart tropical fruits meet a chalky midpalate and carry to a brisk citrus finish.",87,Brengman Brothers 2013 Estate Grown Crain Hill Vineyards Trocken Riesling (Leelanau Peninsula)
"Ripasso Le Quare shows very nice integration of bright fruit tones such as cherry and cassis set against smoky notes of spice and chocolate derived from careful oak aging. The wine also shows freshness with a pleasant, medium mouthfeel that is never over the top.",88,Gamba 2008 Le Quare  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
"Tormaresca delivers a beautiful expression of Negroamaro. Quality aromas of blackberry and cherry liqueur emerge on the bouquet, and oak-driven tones of almond and chocolate follow through on the finish. It's soft, plush and bold.",91,Tormaresca 2007 Masseria Maìme Negroamaro (Salento)
"A spicy, fruity wine, the structure relatively light but firmly dry, with a strong seasoning of black currant fruits. It is fresh, the fruit juicy and vibrant, with an edge of firm wood.",88,Château Lafon-Rochet 2007  Saint-Estèphe
"There is not a lot by way of scent, the palate, however, delivers the freshness of sliced lemon and yellow grapefruit. The body is light but wonderfully clean and refreshing.",89,Tegernseerhof 2014 Ried Kellerberg Smaragd Riesling (Wachau)
"Mint aromas speak of new wood as part of the aging process in this wine from Bordeaux Vineam. It has plenty of spice, while also having fine red-fruit flavors and acidity. Drink from 2018.",87,Château Rocher Bellevue 2014 Les Cerisiers  (Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux)
"A disappointing wine, not one of Adelaida's best. The problem isn't just excessive softness, sweetness and heat from high alcohol, it's a vegetative note that mars the blackberries and cherries.",84,Adelaida 2010 Viking Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Here's an easygoing blend of 70% Sangiovese and 30% Merlot that offers blue flowers and red berry aromas that carry over to the palate along with a hint of white pepper. Supple tannins support the bright, juicy flavors. Drink through 2016.",87,Castello di Meleto 2012 Borgaio Red (Toscana)
"Morgan's Hat Trick Chardonnay, from his own vineyard, was a hit right out of the block. Now, so is his Pinot Noir. It's elaborately flavored, a fairly soft, full-bodied wine that's stuffed with pastry-filling cherries, blackberries, currants and raspberries, with exotic additions of kumquats, cola, red licorice and vanilla. This extraordinarily complex wine should change in interesting ways over at least the next six years.",94,Morgan 2006 Hat Trick Double L Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"From a selected parcel of vines at Brumont's Château Montus, this wine is obviously dense and powerful. Its alcohol does give it too much weight and a peppery character, although the wine is also impressively fresh. It has concentrated black-plum and damson fruits, strong tannins and a dry chocolaty aftertaste. Drink from 2020.",90,Vignobles Brumont 2011 Segondine Haut Lieu Tannat-Cabernet Franc (Madiran)
"With its firmness and juicy red-fruit flavor, this wine is delicious to drink now, but it will also age for at least six years. This bottling demonstrates the structure and generosity of one of Beaune's most famous premier crus.",92,Joseph Drouhin 2010 Beaune Grèves Premier Cru  (Beaune)
"This single-vineyard 100% Cabernet Franc is firm, juicy and focused. It has a phenolic bite at the back end, along with lemony acids. The concentration of fruit and herb flavors is excellent, which makes it a fine steak wine and also a bottle to stow away for a few more years.",90,Arbor Crest 2010 Conner Lee Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Young and unintegrated, this Cab is nowhere near ready to drink. The sweet oak sticks out, overpowering the ripe blackberry, currant and herb flavors. Needs time. Give it until after 2009, at the earliest.",89,Corley 2005 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A blend of 90% Sangiovese, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot, this opens with earthy aromas of truffle, scorched earth, violet and a touch of dark spice. The palate offers dried black cherry and ground pepper alongside fine-grained tannins. It also shows the heat of the vintage, so drink soon.",88,La Castellina 2011 Squarcialupi Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"This affordable wine impresses in smoky, charred oak and a full, robust profile that it embraces completely. Leather, blackberry and black pepper combine on the palate for power and a lengthy, lasting impression on the finish.",91,Once and It's Gone 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Ripe, rich and velvety, this wine shows no lack of restraint. The black cherry, herb and mushroom shadings aren't shy at all, and this full-bodied wine finishes long and warm. Drink now–2018.",91,Neudorf 2010 Moutere Pinot Noir (Nelson)
"Cherry cough drops in a pleasant way on the nose, and then a medium-berry mouth, spice, light cedar and raspberries—there's a whole lot going on here. Not heavy on the complexity; rather it delivers clean fruit and simple spice.",91,Jessup Cellars 1997 Lauer Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"From a fine vineyard site, this wine impresses in voluptuous texture and its lovely layers of lemon and apple. Floral on the nose in apple blossom and jasmine, it offers a slight twist of more spiced citrus, like an orange dotted in clove. It spent nine months in French oak, 40% of it new, which adds complexity and notes of toasted oak.",90,Francis Coppola 2014 Dutton Ranch Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Notes of hay, pollen and beeswax add a savory, honeyed tone to this exquisitely dainty Riesling. The palate is intensely packed with sweet citrus fruit, but it's balanced with striking acidity and a shower of minerality on the finish.",91,Maximin Grünhäuser 2010 Herrenberg Auslese 21 Riesling (Mosel)
"This is undeniably an oaky wine with a prominent layer of buttered toast and butterscotch, but the underlying orange, guava and lime flavors are pristine.",86,Frank Family 2011 Lewis Vineyard Reserve Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Ripe, opulent black currants and violets, melted into liquid and bathed in toasty oak, are the flavors of this 100% Cabernet. Alcohol brings subtle heat and sweet glycerine, but the finish is dry and long. It's a beautiful evocation of St. Helena terroir, but needs aging. Give it a try in 2018, and it should have no trouble gliding well into the 2020s.",94,Corley 2010 Yewell Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
"The nose is secretive but the palate shows structure and poise. There is freshness and brisk, tart redcurrant fruit with some concentration, plesantly unexpected grip and lovely firmness. It's a light but impressive Pinot.",89,Domaine Charles Frey 2013 Quintessence Pinot Noir (Alsace)
"Elegant and finely structured, this creamy fragrant white opens with heady scents of jasmine, honeysuckle and white stone fruit. The smooth delicious palate delivers green melon, white peach, cantaloupe, grapefruit and orange zest while a saline note lifts the lingering finish.",93,Villa Russiz 2015 De La Tour Sauvignon (Collio)
"A blackened wine, with piercing, dense aromas of shoe polish, charred oak, dark spice and black fruit. It feels solid and juicy, with black-tasting flavors that focus on espresso and dark spice. The finish is a bit short on fruit.",86,Verum 2010 Malbec (Alto Valle del Río Negro)
"Fresh earth and gloriously ripe stone fruit make for a convincing opening on the nose. The palate swings with this sonorous, earthy edge and frames rich, ripe and rounded pear and yellow plum fruit. Overall, there is zesty fresh citrus that gathers everything together and presents a concentrated wine with drive and personality. The finish is long, clean and convincing. Drink 2020–2040.",94,Pichler-Krutzler 2015 Loibenberg Riesling (Wachau)
"Fleshy cherry and a broad palate characterize this wine. There is palpable warmth and easy fruit, but they're underneath a tight and sound structure. Understated, but true Pinot-pleasure is in the glass.",87,Markowitsch 2011 Pinot Noir (Carnuntum)
"Struck flint, fig and melon aromas lead the way, followed by similar flavors, plus a strong backbone of mixed citrus. It's pleasantly light in weight, with a long, crisp, citrusy finish.",90,Lake Chalice 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Hints of dusty mineral and hazelnut lend a slightly earthy tone to this otherwise bright, lemony Gewürztraminer. Delicately sweet, it offers easygoing citrus refreshment with a brisk finish. Drink now.",87,St. Christopher 2015 Gewürztraminer (Nahe)
"This opens with aromas of oak, toast, licorice, coconut and sugared plum. The taut palate offers dried cherry, star anise and a green note of powdered sage but not a lot of fruit richness. Raspy tannins leave a tongue-drying finish.",87,Argiano 2010 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Smells like fresh berries and perfume, which is good. In the mouth, it's weighty and sticky, with just enough acidity to keep it pumping. Tastes cranked up and wild, with plum and nectarine flavors leading the charge. Sugary on the finish, with a slightly cloying feel.",84,Tapiz 2011 Malbec Rosé (Mendoza)
"Pure strawberry and red cherry fruits with a twist of acidity make this a wine that is already delicious. Just under the surface is a firm wood-and-tannin character and a dense, if juicy, structure. Age for 4–5 years.",93,Louis Jadot 2009 Beaune Bressandes Premier Cru  (Beaune)
"The bouquet starts off with moderately intense scents of plum, cherry and blackberry, with a cured-meat accent in the background. Glimmers of black pepper and bark add depth to the palate, while the medium-full mouthfeel boasts moderate tannins followed by a clean finish.",88,Carmel 2009 Kayoumi Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Galilee)
"The nose and palate are smoky and waxy, with a shimmer of petrol. The palate is brisk and lemony, with hints of citrus peel, nut oil and nut skin that linger on the long finish. This dry, savory Riesling is already showing signs of bottle age. Drink now.",87,Heron Hill 2010 Ingle Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Classic aromas of cinnamon, raisin, prune and spice rise from the glass, while flavors of pure caramel, baked apple, chocolate and cinnamon take over. This is thick stuff, but with game acidity it stops short of being syrupy. And it's forever long on the finish. Sweet, rich and balanced. What P.X. ought to be.",91,Alvear 2005 Anada Pedro Ximénez (Montilla-Moriles)
"This is wonderfully rich and dense, with dry and dusty tannins that float in the depths of the powerful black fruits, well integrated with the wood. This is impressive Malbec, showing its juicy qualities allied with its huge tannins. It could do with 3–4 years' aging.",91,Clos Troteligotte 2005 K Lys Malbec (Cahors)
"A very rich, ripe, opulent Cabernet, fulsome in blackberries, blueberries, currants and licorice, nicely framed in sweet, smoky oak. Easy to drink now for its soft tannins.",89,Kirkland Signature 2008 Mountain Cuvée Cabernet (Napa Valley)
"Strong scents of cola and chocolate come up quickly from the glass, and those flavors notes override the light strawberry and cherry fruit. With a bit of breathing time they all combine gracefully, crafting a full forward wine with a pleasing creamy texture.",88,Gersing 2015 Madrona Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"Schist, cola, cassis, berry and tobacco aroma cover all the bases in this wine. It's grippy and chewy but complete. Dark, earthy mulled berry flavors precede a tannic, pulpy finish with lasting plum and cassis notes. Drink through 2021.",90,Vall Llach 2014 Embruix Red (Priorat)
"Made from the native Pecorino grape that is being revived in central Italy, this wine offers aromas of white and yellow flowers accompanied by citrus notes. The palate delivers flavors of pineapple, tangerine peel, lemon zest and a hint of butterscotch.",86,Cantina Novelli 2012 Pecorino (Umbria)
"From vines planted to the west of Chablis, this is a soft, ripe and fruity wine. It has some tension from the minerality while keeping the white fruit flavors to the fore. Drink now or, better, from late 2016.",88,Domaine Céline et Frédéric Gueguen 2014  Bourgogne Côtes d’Auxerre
"Not yielding much now beyond hard tannins and primary fruit flavors of black currants that verge on raisins. But then, it's Petite Sirah, a known ager, and the acid-tannin balance suggests just that. Give it until 2012, at least.",88,Twisted Oak 2006 Petite Sirah (Calaveras County)
"The Brunate cru, with denser soils, is known for meatier, more structured wines. This Barolo offers elegance, power and complexity with lingering aromas of exotic spice, black fruit and root beer. It's also exceptionally bright and lively in the mouth and would pair with a hearty wintery dish such as beef Bourguignon.",91,Francesco Rinaldi 2006 Le Brunate  (Barolo)
"Made from Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc grown in the warm Happy Canyon region of the valley, this shows the greatness of the 2007 vintage. It's ready to drink, bearing soft, gentle tannins that frame flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, chocolate, vanilla and sweet, smoky oak.",92,Happy Canyon Vineyard 2007 Barrack Brand Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Aromas of leafy underbrush, toast and menthol lead the nose. On the palate, notes of licorice and grilled herb accent the core of dried red berry. Assertive tannins provide the backbone but still need to unwind. Drink after 2018.",88,Marchesato degli Aleramici 2010  Brunello di Montalcino
"With its strong initial impression of dryness, this is obviously a structured wine. It is dense, rich and concentrated with fine tannins, spice and a strong orange-zest character. Refreshing acidity gives a lift to this ripe, full wine. Drink from 2019.",93,Clos Haut-Peyraguey 2011  Sauternes
"Here's an easy-drinking, inexpensive rosé that's perfect for summer occasions. Made from an unusual blend of Sangiovese, Zinfandel, Carignan and Grenache, it's dryish, crisp and clean, with berry and spice flavors.",85,Bonterra 2009 Rosé (Mendocino County)
"Very rich, one of the more exotic Pinot Grigios on the market. Shows the variety's crispness and citrus, pear, floral, and spice flavors, with the honeyed creaminess of a barrel-fermented Chardonnay.",88,Terlato 2008 Pinot Grigio (Russian River Valley)
"Savory aromas of cumin, leather and oak mix well with floral berry scents. Tannic and firm in the mouth, this delivers earthy blackberry, leather and baked flavors. This is calm and dense on the finish, with integrated but grabby tannins. Drink through 2022.",91,Pingón 2011 Altamimbre  (Ribera del Duero)
"Spicy saffron and pollen notes add a savory warmth to sweet honey and lemon aromas on this gorgeously complex auslese. It's gingerly and bright on the palate, with tangerine acidity that highlights flavors of sweet peach preserves and jasmine tea. The finish lingers on and on and on.",94,August Kesseler 2011 Lorcher Schlossberg Auslese Goldkapsel Riesling (Rheingau)

"Rich, tannic and full bodied, with black cherry jam, red currant, raisin and spice flavors that are penetrating and long. It's a heady wine that's high in alcohol—drink now with grilled beef or chicken slathered in barbecue sauce.",88,De Loach 2010 OFS Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"Another new Rosenblum release and as usual, there is a sweet, sugary edge to the cherries, blackberries and chocolate, although very high acidity helps keep the mouthfeel lively. The official alcohol is 14.8%, but there is something ruby Porty going on.",86,Rosenblum 2005 Maggie's Reserve Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley)
"Ripe in color and aromas, this chunky wine delivers heavy baked-berry and raisin aromas in front of a jammy, extracted palate. Raisin and cooked berry flavors finish plump, with earthy notes.",85,Balduzzi 2012 Reserva Merlot (Maule Valley)
"The notes of orange peel, white pepper and seaweed come off as disjointed, though the flavors are light and tart.",83,Spangler 2010 Syrah (Southern Oregon)
"This wine opens with a lovely fragrance of violet, iris, wild berry, licorice and a whiff of leather. The smooth palate doles out ripe wild cherry, cinnamon, clove, white pepper, tobacco and anise. It's impeccably balanced, with glossy tannins and fresh acidity. Already drinking beautifully, it will also age well for several years.",93,Albino Rocca 2012 Ovello Vigna Loreto  (Barbaresco)
"Red fruit, sucking candy and milk chocolate cover the bouquet, but the palate is sharp and raw, with spiky, semisour raspberry and cherry flavors. There isn't much to this wine. It's sharp, edgy, elastic and lean. On the plus side, it's clean.",82,Tempra Tantrum 2006 See Red Tempranillo-Shiraz (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"Thin for Cabernet fruit, yet forceful as far as its tannins are concerned, this stiff and chalky wine will show better with hearty food, such as a beef stew. You'll find flavors of cherry candy and espresso grounds, along with a light touch of chocolate-covered orange peel, but a green edge to the tannins is the final impression.",86,Silvan Ridge 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rogue Valley)
"Fresh, tangy and medium bodied, this wine has crisp apple and peach flavors and a mouthcleansing texture.",86,Fount NV Batch No 01 Rosé (California)
"Smoky, dark, bold and full of black fruit aromas along with barrel notes and a lemony accent. For Prieto Picudo, this is clean, decidedly not funky and lush, with blackberry, spice and barrel resin. Finishes bacony and rich, but not fat or heavy; drink this year and next.",89,Dominio Dostares 2008 Estay Prieto Picudo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)
"While this foamy rosé is not elevated, it should appeal to those who like sweet Moscato bubblies. Candied flavors of raspberry, lychee and dried mango finish with a note of pineapple syrup.",85,Tussock Jumper 2013 Moscato Rosé (Valencia)
"Concentrated fruit aromas, deep fruit flavors and a supportive, nicely astringent mouthfeel give this wine a great sense of structure and depth. It balances generosity with a bit of reserve in a traditional way that's very appealing. Best through 2020.",91,Borjón 2013 Complejo Barbera (Amador County)
"The private wine label of consulting enologist Stefano Chioccioli, Altadonna is a relatively new line. This expression is redolent of lemon, lime, green apple and honeydew.",87,Altadonna 2011 Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie)
"Textured and mineral, this crisp wine has some lively acidity as well as raspberry fruitiness. It's totally ready for the summer.",85,Quinta do Casal Branco 2013 Terra de Lobos Rosé (Tejo)
"Sourced from vines planted 45 years ago, this ripe and floral wine offers classically varietal scents of flowers, while flavors recall pear and peach. The length and detail are excellent.",90,Pacific Rim 2013 Hahn Hill Vineyard Chenin Blanc (Yakima Valley)
"Heavy aromas of raisin, oak and chocolate are copied on the palate that tastes of oak, vanilla and raisiny fruit. It has a woody finish.",85,Bodegas Riojanas 2014 Viña Albina Crianza  (Rioja)
"This begins with earthy, meaty, slightly smoky aromas. Moderate plum and pepper flavors convey a savory character rather than a fruity one, and the wine has a smooth texture. It starts out interesting and complex, and then closes down on the palate and finish.",83,Matchbook 2011 Syrah (Dunnigan Hills)
"This is a delicate, aromatic wine that's light as a feather. It has crisp citrus flavors along with notes of apricot and berries, along with a pure line in acidity. The aftertaste is pure refreshment.",86,Domaine François Schmitt 2012 Riesling (Alsace)
"The cool Sonoma Coast appellation is not known for Bordeaux blends, especially in cool vintages like 2010. This blend of Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon is ripe with raspberries and oak, but there's a tart bit of acidity. Its taut and elegant in style, but lacks generosity. Drink now.",87,Kastania 2010 Proprietor's Blend Red (Sonoma Coast)
"Accented with lime notes, this tart, young Pinot is dry and complex. Flavors of sour-cherry candy, pomegranate and persimmon are deliciously ripe, yet marked with acidity. Astringent tannins suggest two or three years in the cellar.",88,Kastania 2010 Proprietor's Reserve Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This has restrained aromas of char, cassis, spice and asparagus. It's light to medium in body, and it bears fine, polished tannins. A note of cherry marks the warm finish.",83,Vivác Winery 2008 Diavolo Red (New Mexico)
"A pretty good wine, with blackberry, cherry and currant flavors, and some smoky oak. Nice and dry, with smooth tannins, it's a decent sipper.",84,Arrow Creek 2008 Coastal Series Meritage (California)
"Classic aromas of rose, red berry and a balsamic note lead the way. The structured, savory palate offers up sour cherry, chopped herb, white pepper and clove framed in youthfully assertive but refined tannins that need to unwind. Drink 2017–2027.",90,Carlo Giacosa 2012 Montefico  (Barbaresco)
"Petit Manseng, found in the deep southwest, lends itself so beautifully to sweet botrytized wines. With its beautiful apricot and mango flavors, filled with honey and spice, this is a wine that is both light and rich. The acidity gives the wine a lift at the end.",91,Vignobles Brumont 2009 Château Bouscassé Vendemiaire  (Pacherenc du Vic Bilh)
"Here's an easygoing red wine from Puglia with sharp tones of forest berry and bramble backed by red apple, raisins and a touch of cinnamon. The wine is nervous and slightly bitter in the mouth with flavors that recall sour cherries.",85,L'Astore Masseria 2008 Filimei Negroamaro (Salento)
"A pure citrus-flavored wine, this is refreshing and light. Its crispness will soften over the next few months, but drink now for the forward fruitiness.",84,Vignerons de Tutiac 2016 Carrelet d'Estuaire  (Bordeaux Blanc)
"Fruity in blackberry and dark cherry with a meaty undercurrent, Heritage blends 47% Barbera with 22% Petite Sirah, 18% Alicante Bouschet and 13% Carignane. Meaty and brisk in acidity, it has a brightness to it traditionally inspired field blends don't often have, amidst a core of power and follow-through. This is a great Lodi wine.",89,Borra 2010 Heritage Field Blend Red (Lodi)
"Richness and ripeness combine with a multilayered and tannic texture that frames the flavors, massages the palate and carries the expressive fruit character through a lingering finish. Ripe blackberries and raspberries accompany a subtle vein of spice and mineral flavors that add complexity.",90,Borjón 2012 Reposado Barbera (Amador County)
"Tight blueberry, hot blacktop and a flash of purple flowers combine for an earth-driven nose on this wine from a hot region in southern Monterey County. The flavors are quite distinctive, with barely ripe mulberries, cedar-edged blackberries, sandalwood shavings and a touch of graphite.",92,Quinta Cruz 2012 Pierce Ranch Tempranillo (San Antonio Valley)
"Although light, this well-balanced wine has good depth. A dry core of tannins backs up the bright red berry and black currant fruits. Acidity and the tannins promise some aging, although the wine is drinkable now.",87,Producta Vignobles 2011 Mission St Vincent Réserve  (Bordeaux)
"Winemaker Sabrine Rodems lays on exciting aromas of light pomegranate juice decorated by toasted sagebrush, charred fennel, pan-toasted peppercorns, graphite and pine ash. The herb-driven, very fragrant chaparral-like flavors show pine needles, rosemary, chemise and bay leaf against a cranberry juice background.",93,Wrath 2012 Tondre Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Ruby red in the glass, this bottling shows bright cranberry and boysenberry on the nose with a hint of rose petals. There is decent tension to the sip, where tart plum skins meet with graphite flavors.",87,Kessler-Haak 2016 Rose of Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills)

"Delicate and pretty hints of lemongrass, light cement and lime rinds show on the nose of this bottling.

"A blend of Cabernet Franc (35%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (18%) with the rest equal parts Merlot and Petit Verdot, this wine offers brooding notes of herbs, black currant, mineral and flowers. The lighter color belies its rich structure of firm tannins and tart, lively acids that merit time in the cellar to be fully appreciated. Best after 2018 but will be well worth the wait.",93,Cadence 2011 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red (Red Mountain)
"Dry and succulent, this brings tangy flavors of rhubarb and raspberry into focus. It's made for picnic foods—could anything be better with fried chicken? This is widely available and scores a bullseye if your target is a summer sipper.",89,Acrobat 2016 Rosé of Rosé (Oregon)
"This fragrant, foaming dessert wine opens with aromas of yellow stone fruit, chopped herb and a floral note of jasmine. The rich, bright palate doles out apricot, yellow peach, grilled sage and candied nectarine zest alongside a delicate mousse and fresh acidity.",89,Michele Chiarlo 2015  Moscato d'Asti
"Dry and elegant, this Pinot has a Central Coast feeling, with a pale color and brisk acidity. The cherry, cola, spice and oak flavors seem a little simple now, but that could be deceiving, as years in the cellar might benefit.",87,Williams Selyem 2005 Vista Verde Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Benito County)
"Plummy and chocolaty in profile, this medium- to full-bodied sparkling Shiraz remains surprisingly refreshing on the long, dusty finish. It makes for a crowd-pleasing introduction to the style.",89,The Black Chook NV The Chook Sparkling Shiraz (South Australia)
"The new oak on this Pinot Noir dominates now with aromas and flavors of buttered toast and caramel. But underneath all that is a wine rich with raspberries, cherries, red licorice and mocha, and balanced with vital acidity. Give it a few years to let everything integrate.",91,Black Kite 2011 Soberanes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"There's an almost effervescent feel to this Sangiovese-based wine, which has small percentages of Merlot and Colorino in the blend. It is redolent of cherry cola, almond paste, raspberry and toasted nut.",86,L'Oca Ciuca 2009  Chianti
"The nose is rather closed but reveals whiffs of dark-skinned fruit. The diluted palate offers raw, red cherry alongside fleeting tannins.",83,Feudi del Pisciotto 2012 Giambattista Valli  (Cerasuolo di Vittoria)
"Screams Carneros. Fleshy, jammy fruit flavors of cherries, strawberries and raspberries are highlighted by good acidity and drink very dry, with soft but complex tannins. It's not a simple wine, and has enough stuffing to cellar for a few years.",89,Signorello 2000 Las Amigas Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"The term Vintner's Select, which is unregulated, can be abused. Here it really means something, as this is the winery's top cuvée—an excellent effort that spent 18 months in oak. There's extra depth in the cherry and cassis fruit, packing a powerful, compact punch all the way through a long, polished finish.",94,Arbor Brook 2014 Vintner's Select Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"The top range of wines from this highly rated cooperative is called Sanet Valentin, after the patron saint of lovers. This Sauvignon is crisp, herbaceous and very fresh, with light layers of mouth-watering acidity.",87,San Michele Eppan 2002 Sanct Valentin Sauvignon Blanc (Alto Adige)
"This Syrah is just too high in alcohol. Nearing 16% abv, it's as hot as a chili pepper. Some wines can handle that. As it's slender in flavor, it can't handle the heat. The addition of some Monterey County fruit adds acidity and freshness.",82,Hug 2010 el Chico Syrah (Central Coast)
"Aromas of blackberry jam, stewed plum, raisin, roasted coffee bean and fig carry over to the palate along with a note of clove and orange zest. Fine-grained tannins and zesty acidity provide a firm elegant structure. Drink 2018–2024.",90,Dirupi 2014  Sforzato di Valtellina
"An impressive and concentrated wine that brings out tannins as well as the fine perfumes that lie at the heart of a Touriga Nacional. It is certainly dense with blackberry and black plum fruits giving a juicy side to the young tannins. As it develops, the wine will show elegance while remaining super-rich and opulent. Drink from 2018.",90,Adega Mãe 2013 Touriga Nacional (Lisboa)

"Firmly smoky, strong wood-aged texture gives a solid structure. However, the wine has some juicy acidity that allows a fresher side to show through. At the end, though, the firm tannins dominate. Give this wine time and drink from 2020.",89,Château le Pape 2012  Pessac-Léognan
"Delicious notions of ripe greengages haunt the nose, alongside fragrant orange peel. The palate is still taut and tight, sprightly and streamlined, as if powered and propelled forward by invisible citrus force. There is such drive and precision here, you almost feel movement and speed. The finish is clean but clearly this is for the longer run. It will take bottle age for this to reveal its scented, fruit-laden core. Drink 2022–2040.",95,Bründlmayer 2015 Steinmassel Reserve Riesling (Kamptal)
"This is a robust, full-bodied and sultry wine, one within the producer's single-vineyard series, from a well-known and respected site.

"Hints of fresh mint leaves highlight the brooding black currant and dark fruit aromas. The balance of Cabernet and Merlot has been successfully achieved, as the wine is beautifully structured with a firm backbone of ample tannins and a rich, supple mouthfeel.",86,Barons Edmund Benjamin de Rothschild 2003 Kosher  (Haut-Médoc)
"A very creamy nose hovers over a herb-spiced apple palate, the nutty oak flavors are still obvious and will take a little time to become subdued, but the fruity, savory core of this wine is built to last and presents an unusual but dependable, friendly and durable counterpoint to all manner of foods. Don't miss this individualistic treat which was fermented on its skins.",93,Ingrid Groiss 2013 Gemischter Satz Herr Bernhardt White (Niederösterreich)
"The tartness in this wine veers slightly sour, with the acidity dialed perhaps a notch too high. Herb and salt intermix to give a more savory character, with a freshness to the finish.",84,Uptick Vineyards 2011 Estate Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Deemed “The Imaginary One,” this bottling shows a combination of spice and fruit on the nose, with gingersnap, red berry and strawberry aromas. There's woody complexity on the crisp and clean palate, with cedar, incense, sandalwood, star anise and clove set against a red berry and fruit-punch frame.",90,Vie Winery 2012 L'Imaginaire Grenache (Santa Barbara County)
"Lemony lightness, coupled with zesty spritz on the palate make this a refreshing white with lots of focus, linearity and whistle-clean length. Floral notes around the edges add to the intrigue.",92,Salomon-Undhof 2013 Steinterrassen Riesling (Kremstal)
"Not showing well now due to tough, gritty tannins and unintegrated fruit and oak flavors that taste jammy sweet in raspberries, cherries and mocha, like a little fruit pastry. All the parts seem to be there to age. Try towards 2011.",87,Stolpman 2007 Estate Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)
"A bit sharp and green in tannins, this nevertheless provides plenty of cherry, blackberry, black pepper and baking spice flavors to pair with barbecue. The blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Zinfandel.",85,Kendall-Jackson 2009 Summation Red (California)
"Earthy aromas of dried plum, baking spices, chocolate and cassis are impressive. A crisp, snappy, almost tomatoey palate with lightly herbal flavors of tomato sauce, vanilla and spicy red plum make sense for a Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah blend. A steady finish offers no drastic detours. Drink through 2019.",90,Finca La Estacada 2011 Secua Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"This expresses the greatness of its vintage and vineyard, offering wave after wave of raspberry and cherry pie flavors, plus notes of red currant, sweet licorice, spicy Dr. Pepper and smoky sandalwood. There's also something exotically briary and wild that intrigues. Even more remarkable is the texture, an amalgam of acids and tannins that rivals any Pinot Noir ever produced in California. It should age for up to 20 years.",99,Williams Selyem 2010 Hirsch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This is an easy-drinking style, attractive in aromas of peach, pineapple, pressed yellow flowers, and butter that flow right into a light- to medium-weighted palate. A slightly chalky texture with more tropical fruit flavors carry to a spicy, vegetal finish. Drink now.",89,Shoofly 2015 Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)

"Aromas of apricot and nectarine carry over to the palate along with lemon drop, yellow peach and pineapple. It's round and ripe with a slightly sweet midpalate, but fresh acidity gives a clean, fresh finish.",86,Tommasi 2013 Poggio al Tufo Vermentino (Toscana)
"If you know San Pedro's Elqui Syrahs, then this should seem familiar. Particular aromas of tea, herbs, grilled meat, stewed plum and horse are what we've come to expect from this wine. Flavors of herbal stewy plum and cured meat finish heavy, creamy and warm.",87,San Pedro 2012 1865 Limited Edition Syrah (Elqui Valley)

Gravenstein apple and pear dominate in flavor, adding to the overall succulence and success of this wine.",91,Foppiano 2015 Della's Block Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Fleshy red cherry fruit bursts from the glass. The palate has corralled the abundant fruit into an easy, fresh and appetizing package, with a medium body and smooth texture.",89,Esterházy 2015 Zweigelt (Burgenland)
"This is an attractively fruity wine, crisp, full of red currant flavors and with a tight, tannic edge. Still young, it is dominated by acidity that needs to calm down. Give the wine until mid- or late 2015.",84,Louis Tête 2013  Coteaux Bourguignons
"There's a strong fruit component to this Brunello that adds to the general softness and plushness of its cheerful personality. Blueberry, raspberry and fresh cherry are backed by subtle touches of smoke and moist pipe tobacco. Espresso and chocolate appear on the close and the acidity is not too sharp.",90,Villa I Cipressi 2008  Brunello di Montalcino
"This opens with aromas of leather, black fruit, spice and balsamic herbs along with earthy notes. The palate delivers black cherry flavors accented with notes of vanilla, cinnamon. espresso and a hint of grilled herbs. However, it's evolved with a short finish, so enjoy soon.",87,Renieri 2009  Brunello di Montalcino

"From older vines on the producer's estate, this wine has a depth of richness to the nose and is intensely powerful in gingerbread and Meyer lemon on the medium-bodied palate. Lemony acidity rounds out the finish, flecked in butter.",90,Kunde 2014 Reserve Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley)

"After many years of singing the praises of Muga's rosé, this vintage seems lacking and sour. The nose is short and quiet, while the palate delivers lean, citric flavors and a sharp, scouring finish. Whets the whistle, but doesn't put a smile on your face.",83,Muga 2008 Rosé (Rioja)
"This wine comes from three vineyards that sit atop a dry, ancient riverbed. The nose mixes sour cherry and toasted vanilla bean with scents of ginger and turned earth, while a soft mouthfeel frames flavors of cherry cola and beet juice.",92,Mercy 2012 Riverbed Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco)

That's backed up by ample weight and more stoniness on the palate and a long, mouthwatering finish featuring hints of ginger and white pepper.",91,Famille Perrin 2013 Château de Beaucastel White (Châteauneuf-du-Pape)
"Creamy, herbal freshness reminiscent of fern and fig leaf rises from the glass in this wine. That same combination of creaminess and verve pervades the concentrated palate. It's dry, sophisticated and wonderfully compact.",91,Laurenz V. 2015 Friendly Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"A round, fruit-powered, appealing mix of delicious citrus, berry and plum flavors. Highlights of orange peel and baking spices are underscored by bracing acidity. Sourced entirely from the Clawson Creek estate vineyard.",90,Clawson Creek 2009 Angela Pinot Noir

"Made from 98% Cabernet Sauvignon, with no Merlot or Cabernet Franc for the first time, the '05 Rubicon tastes bigger and more impenetrable than any previous vintage. It's thick and heavy at this time, with furry tannins and undeniably ripe flavors of blackberries, black currants, cherries, violets, chocolate and cedar, and a tang of melted minerals. Desperately needs time in the cellar. Nowhere near ready for at least four years, and that may be conservative. Tasted three times, and better each time, a seriously good sign, and potentially a perfect wine.",96,Rubicon Estate 2005 Rubicon Red (Rutherford)
"Consulting winemaker Michel Rolland oversees this bottling in the Long Shadows series. Fans of his forward, sometimes voluptuous style may find this vintage a bit thin. The fruit is peppery and the tannins chewy, while the barrel flavors of chocolaty oak have not quite assimilated. Further bottle age might improve the wine.",89,Pedestal 2011 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Sweet and mildly candied on the bouquet, and then it clamps down firmly in the mouth with hard Cabernet tannins and lightly herbal, candied flavors of medicinal black cherry. Decent but not special; finishes sticky and candied.",84,Bodegas Navarro López 2009 Rojo Granrojo Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"A blend of fruit from Weinbau, Ciel du Cheval, Lady Hawk, Champoux and Obelisco vineyards, this is clearly Cabernet with its aromas of milk chocolate, herbs, vanilla, dark coffee and cherry. Flavors are rich yet supple, with a finish that lingers.",90,Januik 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Seems like its best days are behind it. That said, there's still some fire in the hole and kick to this South American PG. Pineapple is the lead aroma and flavor, with pink grapefruit and passion fruit sitting in reserve. Has flow but is starting to fall apart.",83,Tango Sur 2006 Pinot Grigio (Mendoza)
"You can taste the chilliness of the vintage in two ways in this elegant, dry wine. It's very acidic, and it's also a little green, with a minty edge to the strawberries and raspberries. Drink up.",86,Dunstan 2010 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Soft, dainty scents of pressed sweet pea, white raspberry and cherry dance in the bouquet, while pithy citrus and cherry-skin flavors unfold on the palate. The midpalate shows a touch of roundness, but brisk acidity and a slight bitterness lifts the close. Drink now.",86,Villa des Anges 2014 Old Vines Rosé (Pays d'Oc)
"Distant aromas of melon, lemon and apricot are subtle and fail to stir the pot. This feels weighty, with pithy flavors of peach, papaya and melon. On the finish, flavors of white pepper and bitterness take over.",84,Bodegas Fariña 2011 Third Generation Dama de Toro Malvasia (Toro)
"This stunning wine opens with classic Nebbiolo aromas of underbrush, new leather, blue flower and dark berry along with a whiff of menthol. The radiant savory palate delivers juicy Marasca cherry, crushed raspberry, clove and star anise framed in noble tannins and bright acidity. It's tempting now but will continue to unwind and develop complexity for years to come. Drink 2023–2043.",95,Pio Cesare 2013  Barolo
"This dry, spicy, solidly tannic wine is still young. Its fruit, still hidden behind the structure, promises ripe plums and berries. For now, it's impressively powerful, with layer upon layer of chocolate and coffee marked with bright acidity on the finish. Drink from 2016.",92,Fiuza 2011 Premium Touriga Nacional-Cabernet Sauvignon (Tejo)
"Structured and sophisticated, it offers creamy green apple, pear, citrus and white peach sensations. The juicy fruit palate is restrained by subtle notes of white pepper and mineral alongside fresh acidity that leaves a focused, lingering finish.",90,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano 2012 Anger Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige)
"Soupy, gritty aromas of herbal blackberry and olive show a touch of brandied cherry. The palate on this warm-vintage Syrah feels chunky and a touch stewed, while ripe, jammy dark-berry flavors hold onto an herbal, stewy note of tomato and oregano. Other than showing heat, the finish is in tune.",86,Viña Casablanca 2012 Nimbus Single Vineyard Syrah (Casablanca Valley)
Spun sugar scents lead into a wine with modest fruit flavors. The mouthfeel and finish are a touch dilute.,82,Valley View 2006 Anna Maria Cabernet Sauvignon (Applegate Valley)
"Made entirely with the native grape Bombino Nero, this informal light-bodied wine has subdued aromas of wild cherry and a hint of crushed herb. The aromas carry over to the über-simple palate along with a hint of pink grapefruit.",84,Rivera 2016 Rosé (Castel del Monte)
"Coffee, purple fruit and barrel-spice aromas lead to full-feeling blueberry and huckleberry-pie flavors. This wine offers a lot of immediate appeal.",88,Murray 2013 Syrah (Red Mountain)
"Very powerful, very strong, almost overwhelming in the sheer wealth of fruit and oak, but balanced with acidity. Winemaker Bob Cabral himself calls it “concentrated.” It detonates on the palate with an almost dessert wine quality of lemons, pineapples, honey, vanilla and minerals, but it's totally dry. Will hold for perhaps six years.",95,Williams Selyem 2007 Hawk Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"An appealing ripe strawberry nose leads on this flirty, easy-drinking sparkling wine from South Africa. Freshness and a touch of delicate minerality in the aromas, followed by light, elegant flavors of strawberry and yeast, make it a lovely wine for a summer day or to pair with myriad dishes. Creamy but fresh on the tongue, the wine has good body for a rosé. Imported by GBW, LLC.",87,Graham Beck 2005 Brut Rosé  (Western Cape)
"Sharp in raisin skin bitterness, this dry, dull wine has overripe cherry flavors, and is quite tannic. Lacks opulence and interest.",81,Fenestra 2007 Estate Mourvèdre (Livermore Valley)
"A delicious Sauvignon Blanc, really fine. It showcases how well this cool little corner of Monterey County, with its stony soils, ripens white wines. Brisk in acidity and laden with minerals, it offers rich flavors of citrus fruits, white flowers, white currants and spices.",90,Deep Sea 2009 Coquina Sauvignon Blanc (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"Give this young Pinot 3–4 years to begin to develop, and possibly far longer before the fruit fades away. Right now, it's tannic and closed, despite sweet, ripe cherry, raspberry and cola flavors. It shows firm acidity and a fine jacket of oak that has not yet been integrated with the fruit. So intense and powerful, it's hard to believe the alcohol is a low 13.2% by volume.",92,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2010 Great Oak Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Los Gatos-based Testarossa is building a powerful reputation as a single-vineyard specialist, but this more accessibly priced cuvée from Monterey County rivals their best efforts. There is nuttiness, brioche and slightly sour orange on the nose, followed by a very soft mouthfeel, with flavors of pound cake, vanilla cookie, peach cobbler and candied grapefruit.",92,Testarossa 2012 Cuvée Los Gatos Chardonnay (Monterey County)
"This is tasty in a ripe, extravagantly fruity way. Raspberry and strawberry aromas seem as sweet as syrup. The full body and alcoholic strength give it a strong texture, but without too much tannic grip. Barbecued ribs or a cheese plate could be great matches.",90,Four Vines 2012 Maverick Zinfandel (Amador County)
"This ripe, deliciously fruity wine has red plum and black currant fruits along with fragrant acidity and a gently tannic structure. It will be ready to drink from 2017. Canadian David Curl purchased Moya in 2008; Damien Landouar is the winery director. The vineyard was certified organic in 2013.",87,Château Moya 2012  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux
"Dark red in color, there's an intense—for lack of a better word—grapy quality to this rustic wine. Kirsch and orange highlight the experience, before a faint structure falls short on the finish.",84,Corkscrew 2013 Rosé of Syrah (Sonoma Coast)
"A pleasing shade of pale pink, this is a very austere bottling, with just faint touches of raspberry and tangerine on the nose. There is more light-red fruit and a hint of bubblegum on the palate, which offers decent tannic tension.",86,Ponte 2016 Pas Doux Rosé (Temecula)
"Tart lemon and green apple make this a refreshing quaff, followed by creamy, weightier overtones of papaya and pear. Well-integrated and enjoyable, it has tannin presence and structure, finishing with a backbeat of fennel.",88,Rutherford Hill 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Toasted oak, roasted coffee bean, dill and espresso aromas lead the nose on this Tuscan red. On the palate, notes of exotic spice accent the core of dried black cherry alongside drying but fleeting tannins. It lacks fruit richness and is shy on freshness so drink sooner rather than later.",86,Baldetti Alfonso 2011 Crano Syrah (Cortona)
"A superbly rich wine, with its acidity well integrated into the concentrated and rounded fruit. It has great texture and fruit that bursts from the glass. It is generous, warm and toasty, while also preserving the steeliness that is hallmark of the Les Clos vineyard. Age for at least five years.",95,Domaine Christian Moreau Père et Fils 2009 Clos des Hospices Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis)
The wine is concentrated with tannins that come from both the firm fruit and the wood aging. It is packed with blackberry flavors that come through the structure strongly. The velvet texture (that is just a hint at the moment) is going to bring out the richness of this wine produced with consultation from Michel Rolland. Drink from 2024.,94,Château Léoville Poyferré 2014  Saint-Julien
"Vines planted between 900 and 1,200 feet above sea level give this cool interpretation of Pinot Noir. The wine is crisp, lightly structured with some tannins and with a delicate cherry and red-berry fruitiness. It will be ready to drink from 2017.",87,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2014  Hautes Côtes de Nuits
"While the wine is fresh, it also has a bitter, cheesy character that is more funky than fruity. The acidity is very present, giving a crisp edge. Drink now.",83,Domaine Pral 2014 Les Pays de Pierres Dorées  (Beaujolais Blanc)
"A fascinating blend of five varieties, this solid, black wine shows structure, dense tannins, an enticing perfume and big, ripe fruits. The finish has acidity, but also those powerful tannins. Age for 4–5 years.",92,Campolargo 2008 Rol de Coisas Antigas Red (Bairrada)
"This Sauvignon Blanc is neutral on the nose except for a smack of lime. Mild on the palate, this tastes of briny, salty citrus fruits and peels. A fresh finish confirms that this is straightforward but enjoyable.",85,Santa Rita 2016 120 Reserva Especial Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley)
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot is soft, with berry, cocoa and spice flavors. Drink it with summer barbecue and enjoy.",85,Tower 15 2009 The Swell Red (Paso Robles)
"Pretty aromas suggest violet, rose, strawberry and mint. The vibrant palate offers red cherry, crushed raspberry and cinnamon alongside supple tannins and bright acidity. Enjoy through 2017.",89,Ca' del Baio 2012 Nebbiolo (Langhe)
"Pieropan's basic Soave Classico offers refreshing aromas of stone fruit, honeysuckle, grapefruit and lime. The wine is light and crisp with tonic acidity on the close and an easy, direct approach.",87,Pieropan 2007  Soave Classico
"This offers a surprisingly savory look at this sun-drenched appellation, with aromas of smoke, mineral and Kalamata olives. The cherry flavors are full bodied with a palate-coating, slightly tacky feel that smooths out over time.",91,Efeste 2012 Ceidleigh Syrah (Red Mountain)
"This is a tight and compact expression of Barolo with some meaty, earthy aromas at the back of berry fruit, cola and dried herbs. There is a lighter, more feminine side to the bouquet that is successfully contrasted against the bolder, thicker feel this wine imparts in the mouth.",91,Ciabot Berton 2007 Roggeri  (Barolo)
"This stands out for its overall richness and generosity. It reveals layers of jammy fruit, blackberry, spice, teriyaki sauce, ginger and dried herb. There's a cheerful touch of sweetness that is buffered by the wine's natural thickness and intensity.",92,Castellani Michele & Figli 2008 Colle Christi Collezione Ca' del Pipa  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"From Familia Bressia, this Brut Nature smells like a cross between a frosted doughnut and dried tropical fruits. In the mouth, this is citric in feel, with tart, almost sour flavors of orange along with the peel. A tangy citric finish ends with lingering grapefruit and orange notes.",87,Sylvestra 2015 Brut Nature Rosé  (Mendoza)
"This wine is spicy, ripe and ready to drink. Ripe white stone fruits are laced with citrus acidity to give a lively wine with good fruit intensity. Drink this wine now for instant pleasure.",88,Château Pilet 2016  Bordeaux Blanc
"There's a ripe and opulent quality that gives the wine loads of intensity and consistency. The purity of the fruit is excellent, and the finish reveals nicely integrated acidity.",89,Feudo Montoni 2010 Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"Sugary sweet and simple, like an apricot, orange and mango fruit juice drink. The alcohol lends body and warmth.",85,Francis Coppola 2011 Diamond Collection Pinot Grigio (California)
"Floral aromas lead into a rich, not quite dry wine that is beautifully ripe and perfumed. It is rounded and opulent while preserving the steely, mineral texture. Still young, it demands aging. Drink from 2017.",92,Domaine Zinck 2011 Pfersigberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"Heavy and seemingly sweet, this has the taste of black raspberry syrup and melted red licorice.",85,Testarossa 2010 Cuvée 107 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
"Made entirely from Grenache, this wine is a pretty pale-salmon color. It drinks off dry, with strawberry flavors and well-balanced acidity, showing some warmth on the finish.",87,Mercer 2014 Spice Cabinet Vineyard Rosé (Horse Heaven Hills)
"This opulent wine opens with a blast of buttered toast and tropical fruit aromas. The flavors are complex, with swirls of pineapple, pear, yeast, toast and cinnamon. Drink now–2015.",92,Martinelli 2009 Charles Ranch Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"This blend of 42% Syrah, 31% Petite Sirah, 20% Zinfandel and 7% Grenache from the Templeton Gap area shows aromas of grape soda, pencil lead, sweet violets and effervescent cola, all fun yet elegantly restrained. Blueberry, black pepper and fresh purple fruit combine for a very lively wine, with strong acidity on the palate.",91,Guyomar 2011 Laity Red (Paso Robles)
"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this stunning elegant wine is initially closed but then blooms in the glass to reveal red berry, iron, blue flower, underbrush and dark spice. The focused, radiant palate delivers bright cherry, star anise, white pepper and mineral alongside vibrant acidity and polished tannins. A hint of orange zest graces the lingering finish. Hold for more complexity. Drink 2018–2028.",95,Fontodi 2013 Dino Sangiovese (Colli della Toscana Centrale)
"This is a 50-50 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah from Coombsville. It's dense with tannins, but they're very finely woven, and the wine has a gentle grace. The flavors of blackberries are pristine and ripe, and accompanied by a new oak smokiness. Good as it is now, it will develop bottle complexity after 2016.",92,Black Cat 2010 Family Cuvée Red (Napa Valley)
"Rum-raisin cake comes to mind when smelling this robust, ripe wine that wears its intensity well. Fruit-forward with cherry and berry flavors, its texture is soft and luxuriously simple.",88,De Loach 2014 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"Earthy, loamy cherry and berry aromas are slightly oxidized. This has a regular, soda-like mouthfeel and not a lot of body. Dry, briny flavors of plum and cherry finish juicy and long.",87,Canals Canals NV Rosat Reserva Sparkling (Cava)
"Very ripe, dense and concentrated. Although it's totally dry, the wine shows massive, sweet flavors of blackberry and cherry fruit. Impresses for sheer power, as well as the length of finish. Cellar this youthful beauty for 6–7 years and see what it does.",94,Bennett Lane 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Smoky and crusty on the nose, but not that deep or dark in the mouth. The emphasis is on red fruits, freshness and pop, while the flavors are zesty and lean toward red cherry and red plum, with a spicy accent. Pepper and more spice work the finish.",88,Undurraga 2007 Sibaris Reserva Especial Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"Joe Dobbes was the winemaker for this Riesling, fashioning an intense and focused wine, with a bit of sweetness but ample acidity to balance it out. It's a deft combination of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon oil and a hint of mint, with impressive length and penetration.",93,South Stage 2013 Riesling (Rogue Valley)
"Everything about this stately Ribera heavyweight impresses. The nose is outright oaky, so expect derivative aromas of toast, clove, cinnamon and spice to go with black-fruit scents. This remains firm, tannic and tightly wrapped, with massive blackberry, chocolate and toast flavors. Peppery spice, brooding mixed-berry flavors and mouth-coating tannins endow a finish that signals that this has many good years ahead of it. Drink from 2018–2032.",96,García Figuero 2011 Tinus  (Ribera del Duero)
A young firmly tannic wine still influenced by its wood aging. The berry fruits are ripe and chunky with a licorice and nutmeg character. It needs aging over several years.,89,Borges 2009 Quinta da Soalheira Red (Douro)
"Lightly smoked stone fruit and apple blossoms greet the nose on this bottling of 50% Marsanne and 50% Grenache Blanc. The palate is much more interesting, with lemon sorbet and ripe apples clinging to a steely centerline that shows flashes of flint and gunmetal.",89,Two Moons 2013 Aporia White (Paso Robles)
"This smooth, creamy textured wine combines bright acidity with ripe apricot and pear flavors. It is already attractive in its freshness while also having a rounder character. Drink now.",86,Domaine Uby 2014 No. 3 Colombard-Ugni Blanc Colombard-Ugni Blanc (Côtes de Gascogne)
"Colorful and pretty to look at, but a little sweet. The nose has a sweet, maple syrup element along with dry berry fruit aromas. It's healthy and fresh in the mouth, with citrus, cranberry and raspberry flavors. Simple and nice for easy drinking.",86,Codorníu NV Anna de Codorniu Brut Rosé Sparkling (Cava)
"Textbook Russian River Pinot Noir, this is bone dry, elegant and lightly silky, with complex flavors of sour cherry candy, cola and sandalwood. Drink now–2015.",91,Windsor Oaks 2008 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This blend of 60% Petite Sirah, 21% Syrah, 7% Grenache, 6% Petit Verdot, 5% Tannat and 1% Viognier is tightly wound but likely to improve with time. Opened now, it offers elderberry, black currant, pencil lead and loam on the nose, with lava rock, crème de cassis and kirsch flavors slowing emerging on the palate.",90,MCV 2014 1105 Red (Paso Robles)
"This widely available Oregon Pinot Noir has lovely aromas of berry, cherry and rose petals. Ripe but not sweet, its tart, juicy fruit is wrapped in plenty of acid and punctuated with fresh herb, resin and peppery spice. Nicely blended and balanced, it's a quintessential food wine.",88,King Estate 2006 Signature Collection Pinot Noir (Oregon)
"For a lower-priced bottling, this is a fantastic wine, showing elderberry, black peppercorns and incense on a classic nose. Touches of asphalt, lavender, thyme and sagebrush show on the palate, spicing a core of elderberry and black cassis. Hints of white pepper complete the experience.",91,Larner 2014 Transverse Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"This is great fruit, sappy and loaded with bright, concise flavors of raspberry and pomegranate. Intense and juicy, this spicy and crisply defined wine shows great balance and detail, with just a hint of chocolate adorning the finish.",90,Saviah 2006 Syrah (Red Mountain)
"A very mineral, textured wine that has a dark fruit character. Acidity, spice, black plum skins and a solid structure all point to a wine that needs to age a few more months. Drink from 2014.",90,Campolargo 2010 Red (Dão)
"Slightly reduced, this wine offers a chalky, tannic backbone to an otherwise juicy explosion of rich black cherry, the whole accented throughout by firm oak and cigar box.",87,Louis M. Martini 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Very light in the glass, this bottling shows peach, melon, apple and key lime pith, which cuts through the riper elements. A simmering acidity is ever present on the sip, hewing the tropical guava flavors and providing a refreshing tension.",89,Rideau 2016 Viognier (Santa Ynez Valley)
"White blossoms and wet stone softly caress on the nose. The flavors are layered and compelling, starting on crisp green apple, honeydew melon and peach, folding into complexities of crushed stone, fennel and pollen. Well-balanced, fresh acidity and ample body lend to a long, evolving finish.",88,Barboursville Vineyards 2015 Reserve Viognier (Virginia)
"This easy wine will pair nicely with slightly sweet fare, such as sausage risotto, Chinese pork and chicken dishes, or a ham sandwich with Dijon mustard. It's crisp in acidity, with flavors of honey, apricots, lemons and limes.",86,Pech Merle 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley)
"This wine conveys a powerful sense of extraction and nuttiness, with aromas of caramelized nuts, marzipan, honey, toasted oak and even some marshmallow. It's quite quaffable on the palate—rich, nutty and honey-like, but with zesty acidity that wraps it all together.",90,Pali 2014 Huber Vineyard Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"An interesting, even eccentric Syrah that's really quite different from anything else out there. No mere fruit bomb, it's a meaty wine, in the sense of being chewy, but also in the aromas and flavors of both roasted and raw beef. That's not to mention the extraordinary blackberries and currants, dusted with a blast of freshly ground black pepper. First-class and unique.",94,Zepaltas 2006 Rosella's Vineyard Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"This is a fine, juicy and fruity wine. It has some firm, smoky tannins that are in the background. With its fruitiness, it is likely to be a wine that is ready to drink soon, certainly by 2017.",87,Château Donjon de Bruignac 2014  Bordeaux
"Too oaky, with dominating tastes of buttered toast that swamp the pineapple and orange fruit. The oak follows through in a sweet, caramelized finish.",83,Ca' Momi 2010 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"A wine that is hard right through, missing out on the fruit. It has a bitter extracted taste that brings out dark chocolate flavors. It's unlikely to soften much.",83,Château L'Argilus du Roi 2011  Saint-Estèphe
"Hot in high alcohol, with Port-like flavors of superripe currants and dark chocolate, finished with a raisinskin bitterness.",83,Wilson 2007 Carl's Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"This is rich, soft and vibrant in blackberry, blueberry jam and mocha flavors, which are wrapped into complex tannins, finishing dry and spicy. This shows superior pedigree.",92,Spring Mountain Vineyard 2009 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Light strawberry fruit carries an undertone of dried grass. It turns a little sour in the mouth, but it's fine for the price.",85,Rascal 2014 Pinot Noir (Oregon)
The wine is very fresh and fruity with lively red-berry flavors balanced delicately with light tannins and acidity. It's refreshing with a red currant aftertaste.,85,Domaine de Sulauze 2012 Liane Red (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence)
"Crisp lemon, apple and pear abound in this richly textured yet pertly balanced Pinot Blanc. It's an easy quaffing, elegant wine with hints of nut and toast that extend elegantly on the finish. Drink now through 2020.",88,Heron Hill 2015 Reserve Morris Vineyard Pinot Blanc (Finger Lakes)
"Ripe plum, coconut, vanilla and French oak aromas lead the nose. Youthfully assertive and austere, the palate offers toasted oak, licorice and espresso notes, set against a backdrop of bracing tannins that grip the finish. That structure should mellow and integrate with a few more years of bottle age.",90,Avignonesi 2012 Grandi Annate  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano)
"This is a dark, concentrated blend with minty oak, lactic aromas, boysenberry and blackberry on the bouquet. The palate is muscular and clampy, with resiny, oak-based grab to go with full tannins. Flavors of boyseberry, chocolate, toast and oak end in a warm, oaky finish. Drink now through 2016.",89,Ninquén 2011 Antu Mountain Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"Rose petal, violet, red berry, white pepper and eucalyptus scents meld together on this bright, structured expression of Nebbiolo. The linear, elegant palate doles out juicy red cherry, mint, aromatic herb and star anise while firm, polished tannins and fresh acidity provide the framework. It's already accessible but will also age gracefully over the next several years. Drink through 2024.",91,Cornarea 2012  Roero
"Here's a useful Syrah to generate some interest around a grilled steak or chop. It's rich in tannins and forwardly sweet in black cherry, blackberry, tobacco, leather, cinnamon and pepper flavors, and should develop for a few years.",87,Olson Ogden 2006 Unti Vineyard Syrah (Dry Creek Valley)
"A pale-pink color, this Syrah rosé brings aromas that start out a bit reduced. This is followed by notes of strawberry, apple, melon and herb. It drinks a hair off dry, with plentiful strawberry and cherry flavors. What it lacks in complexity it makes up for with easy-drinking appeal.",88,14 Hands 2016 Rosé (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Subdued aromas of red apple and melon are followed by a dry, medium-bodied palate with a tart, drawn-out finish.",86,Hogue 2014 Pinot Grigio (Columbia Valley (WA))
Light aromas of plum and spice are followed by cherry flavors that show pleasing purity. This is a delightful example of the variety.,90,William Grassie 2012 Petit Colline Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Black pepper dominates the aroma of this wine, along with black currants, grilled meat and something sweetly spicy and exotic, like a teriyaki dressing. In the mouth, it turns softly sweet and candied. Drink now.",85,Ortman Family 2005 Syrah (Paso Robles)
"Coming from one of the state's most esteemed Syrah vineyards, this wine opens with nuanced aromas of bacon fat, smoke and berry. The palate is rich and sumptuous, with fruit and savory flavors lingering on the finish.",89,Damsel 2014 Boushey Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This deliciously full-bodied and rich Chardonnay is unabashedly New World in style. From its caramel and tropical fruit aromas through its flavors of Golden Delicious apples, mango, vanilla and baking spices, it screams “Australia.” Best Buy.",90,Rothbury Estate 2001 Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia)
"Light in color and body, this is a silky Pinot Noir for everyday fare. It shows cola, cherry jam, persimmon and Asian spice flavors, with a coating of toasty oak.",86,Judd's Hill 2006 Estate Pinot Noir (Napa Valley)
"Clean and zesty, this is a nice cocktail sipper, with rich flavors of green apples, pineapples, peaches, apricots, vanilla and spice. The honeyed finish is brightened with crisp acidity.",85,Fetzer 2006 Pinot Grigio (California)
"As per usual, Purple Angel is a full-force experience. Hailing from a warm year, this is dense and purple in color, as it should be. Aromas of graphite, oak, tobacco and black fruit set up a jammy, full palate with saturated flavors of spice-laden blueberry and boysenberry. Finishing notes of tobacco, herb and oak cement this big-boned wine's ripe, beefy status. Drink through 2018.",92,Montes 2012 Purple Angel Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"This is a fleshy, voluptuous white, offering smooth, creamy texture around well-defined characteristics of melon, honeysuckle and peach.",88,Markham 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"While dry in style, this wine is chock full of ripe, rich yellow peach flavor accented with hints of dusty, floral potpourri and mineral tones. Its bold, expansive mouthfeel is penetrating on the palate, but cut with a line of lime acidity that lingers long on the finish. Delicious now, but its sharp edges and dark mineral tones should meld beautifully from 2019–2021.",91,Hermann J. Wiemer 2012 Reserve Dry Estate Bottled and Grown Riesling (Seneca Lake)
"Even grapier than the Cabernet Sauvignon, this forward, light, candied, confected wine has a hole in the middle. The tannins turn quite astringent, a marked contrast to the sweetness of the fruit.",84,Gilbert Cellars 2007 Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope)
"This Barbaresco opens with aromas of French oak, coconut, dark fruit and a dash of exotic spices. The firm palate offers cranberry, roasted coffee bean and oak-driven spice alongside bracing tannins that tightly grip the finish.",88,Ceretto 2013  Barbaresco
"A blast of rubber is the aromatic greeting, followed by herbal notes and leather. A sharp, tight, acidic palate proves difficult to penetrate, while crisp, herbal red-plum flavors finish green.",83,Emiliana 2011 Natura Merlot (Rapel Valley)
"Beautiful aromas of ripe red cherry and cherry blossoms mix with rose-laced potpourri, dust, cola and vanilla on the nose of this best-barrel bottling by Jim Clendenen, named after his daughter. Bright and zesty acidity grabs the palate's immediate attention, making the mouth water as flavors of tart cherry, rust, marinated olive and fig come forth, finishing in a very earthy way.",95,Au Bon Climat 2013 Isabelle Pinot Noir (California)
"A fine trio of vineyards—Boushey, Cold Creek and Sagemoor—comprise the blend here. The fruit runs the table from cherry to blackberry to cassis, threaded throughout with fresh herbs and clean earth. Good balance with no heat from the 14.7% alcohol; the tannins are polished and drying, and the finish has a soft, leathery smoothness.",91,Lachini 2007 Spur Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Here's a full and generous Barbaresco with tones of bold fruit, cola, leather, tobacco and cured meat. The alcohol adds to the overall muscle of this wine.",90,Vigin 2009 NonnOrlando  (Barbaresco)
"This is an upright, firm wine that's solidly based around dense tannins as well as ripe red fruits. It has a very dry core giving a concentrated texture that means the wine needs to age. Give it 4–5 years.",88,Manuel Olivier 2010  Pommard
"The third vintage of Mith is the best yet, composed of fruit from three top-notch Walla Walla vineyards. It's two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon and one third Syrah. The wine opens seductively with luscious blueberry, blackberry and black cherry fruit, wrapped in sexy layers of earth and herb. Whiffs of smoke lead into a silky smooth, chocolaty finish.",91,Balboa 2005 Mith Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Sweet cherry and baking vanilla aromas are followed by layers of plum, raspberry and spice in this kosher Bordeaux blend from Israel. The wine offers firm tannins and a lingering finish.",84,Agur 2007 Kessem Red (Judean Hills)
"This wine comes from the Guedes family's Carvalhais estate in the heart of the Dão. Only made in better vintages, this latest release is almost at its peak. It has smooth, ripe tannins with leather, spice and acidity rather than the primary fruits. That makes for a sophisticated, complex wine that will be ready to drink from late 2016.",94,Sogrape 2010 Quinta dos Carvalhais Reserva Red (Dão)
"Hints of black coffee, dried lavender and herb add punch to the lean plum and cherry flavors of this medium-bodied Cabernet Franc blend. Brisk on the palate, with an herbaceous, green note that persists, it finishes firm, with a chalky coating of tannins.",85,McGregor 2007 Rob Roy Red Red (Finger Lakes)
"Yellow flower, tropical fruit and an herbal note are delicate but still take center stage. Racy acidity supports the crisp apple, grapefruit and bitter almond flavors while the finish is crisp and clean.",87,Palagetto 2014  Vernaccia di San Gimignano
"A lovely wine whose most memorable and distinctive attributes are its dryness and high acidity, not to mention relatively low alcohol. These make it extremely food-friendly, and the citrus, wildflower and vanilla flavors will pair nicely with everything from pâté to a pear, and bitter green salad to pizza.",87,Greenwood Ridge 2007 Pinot Gris (Anderson Valley)
"Offers varietally correct flavors of black currants and hints of tobacco, but where's the structure and depth? A simple, fruity red for early drinking that would make a decent picnic wine or bar pour.",83,Concha y Toro 1999 Xplorador Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"This wine is somewhat flat and sweetly tropical, aged for six months in both neutral French oak and stainless steel. With 5% Viognier added to the blend, it lacks precision.",83,Zoetic Wines 2014 Grazioso Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley)
"A still closed note holds everything back; just a little earthiness shines through with the promise of ripe fruit. This is not about simple fruit, but texture and personality. Lemon zestiness plays on the lees-cushioned palate—and something tells me that this will not show its true but fascinating colors until at least 2017. Light-footed echoes of flavor are very promising.",93,Nikolaihof 2014 Im Weingebirge Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"There are edges of cocoa, pepper and curing spice to the dense red plum and cherry core of this attractive Syrah. Just a touch of gamy character throughout adds depth and intrigue. The rich fruit flavors continue on to the palate, with a texture like crushed satin and lingering notes of coffee, bittersweet chocolate and sweet spice.",88,Maison Nicolas Perrin 2014 Syrah (Vin de France)
"Rich wine, a blend dominated by the rare Rotgipfler and Zierfandler, with great ripe layers of tropical fruits, peach and spice, perfectly balanced with full acidity. Fred Loimer of the Kamptal also produces this Schellmann brand in the Thermenregion, with concentrated dense and deliciously ripe wines. Screw cap.",92,Loimer 2008 Schelllmann Gumpoldskirchen Cuvée White (Thermenregion)
"This robust, richly layered wine shows lemon chiffon and vanilla characteristics balanced by golden apple and pear undertones.",90,Materra Cunat Family Vineyards 2015 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Oak Knoll District)
"Full bodied and ripe, this Chardonnay is packed with yellow fruit and pear flavors, and it shows the steely, minerally character typical of Chablis. It has a youthful brightness on the finish, and it will fill out over the next few months.",89,Domaine Vrignaud 2011 Vieilles Vignes Fourchaume Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"This is stunningly rich in mouthfeel, texture and overall weight. Buttered, toasted nuts and creamy fruits coat the mouth. Oranges, apples and pears roll smoothly and seamlessly along the palate, with a juicy kick to the finish.",92,Roco 2014 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
"Oak, yellow apple and butterscotch aromas open on the nose. The structured palate offers toast, mineral, oak-driven spice and a confectionary note but it's shy on fruit richness. You'll also detect the warmth of alcohol on the close.",87,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano 2013 Sanct Valentin Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige)
"A unique dessert wine made from botrytized Sémillon that's then fortified and aged for an average of eight years in barrel, this is a dark, coffee-brown wine, with a hint of green to its rim. Aromas are slightly nutty and molasses-like, with raisiny, almost Muscat-like flavors. Full-bodied and rich, it finishes long and sticky.",90,De Bortoli NV Black Noble White (Australia)
"Currant, cola, spice and cherry lead this layered Cab from Delfosse. It's an approachable style but with added character: cinnamon spice, tobacco and black cherry on the palate is integrated and smooth. An elegant wine with ageable chops.",86,Delfosse 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Monticello)
"Light and chocolaty, this carries a strong and distinctive scent and flavor of cinnamon spice. On the palate, the flavors suggest strawberries, with a quick-to-fade finish.",85,Valley View 2008 Anna Maria Tempranillo (Applegate Valley)
"Named after the wife of the previous owner, this top cuvée from Château de Cénac is powered by its structure and dark tannins. The rich black berries and plums are still working through the dense texture. It's a complex wine, still showing its wood aging. Drink from 2017.",93,Château de Cénac 2012 Eulalie Malbec (Cahors)
"This has quite a bite with acidity and a strong cut of spirit. Flavors of dried raisins and sultana put it on the dry side of aged tawny. At the end, spice and the wood aging dominate this austere wine.",88,Ramos-Pinto NV RP 10 Quinta da Ervamoira 10-Years-Old Tawny  (Port)
"This is loaded with succulent black cherry, almond, tobacco and black pepper flavors. The dense fruit and round structure are balanced by vibrant acidity, making this perfect to pair with everything from cured meats to risotto.",89,Corteforte 2010 Podere Bertarole  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
"A ripe, golden selection, glowing with a just-ready-to-drink feeling. From a fine vintage, this is structured and complex, layering acidity with sweet, juicy fruits and an attractive touch of toast.",92,Gaston Chiquet 2004 Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne)
"A waft of smoky char and toasty oak provide a rich foundation and compelling entry into this one-acre vineyard-designate from the historic grower, before unleashing, slowly, a torrent of melon and fresh-cut apple with a length of intriguing nutmeg and cardamom. Medium-bodied and lush, it will remain on your palate memory a long time.",96,Rochioli 2014 Sweetwater Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Produced from Cabernet Sauvignon, this aromatic, crisp rosé has refreshing red-currant acidity and a light, lively character. Screwcap.",85,Château Suau 2011 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
"It's high in alcohol, but without it, this Zin just wouldn't be as good as it is. It's bone dry and full bodied, and the crushed black peppercorn, blackberry and licorice flavors have a roasty, toasty edge that makes the wine particularly savory.",90,Triumph Cellars 2011 Zinfandel (Napa Valley)
"Named for the Servite convent in the town of Borba, this fresh, crisp and tangy wine is citric, with almond and apple overtones. It's young, fruity and made for immediate consumption.",85,Adega Cooperativa de Borba 2015 Convento da Vila Branco White (Alentejano)
"Zesty on the nose and pulsing with white-fruit aromas, and that opening is backed by a spritzy, lively body that brings lemon-lime and soda-like flavors. Melony and green on the finish, and good overall in a simple, tropical sort of way.",85,Bodegas Fontana 2009 Mesta Macabeo-Moscatel (Uclés)
"Sumptuous notes of fresh, aromatic red cherries are central to this wine. They are joined by a sonorous, soft and mellow oak spice and texture and sprays of fresh white pepper. There are hints of iron oxide and an intensely brooding flavor of pure, black cherry at the very core. This draws you in and just makes you want to savor. Lovely now, this will come out of its shell with some bottle age. Drink 2016–2020.",93,Johanneshof Reinisch 2013 Frauenfeld St. Laurent (Thermenregion)
"Sourced largely from the Martin Stelling Vineyard, this is a supple, soft wine, with refined tannins. A zippy nose of rose and spice scents paves the way for more powerful leather saddle, cedar and black tea elements. Its fruit is wild and brambly, recalling blackberry and dark cherry with enviable succulence.",94,Far Niente 2014 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"The Cowgirl Cab, a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is DaMa's most popular offering. Loaded with bright, brambly berry fruits, licorice and loam, it's notable also for smooth, silky tannins.",90,DaMa 2007 Cowgirl Cab Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This opens with aromas of toasted oak, coffee, ripe berry, sage and a whiff of citrus zest. On the palate, white pepper and coconut back up the core of dried cherry alongside astringent tannins, but it lacks fruit richness.",86,Dante Rivetti 2010 Bricco di Neive Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"A wonderfully balanced wine, rich, rounded but showing off the crispness, the tightness of great Muscadet. There is a yeasty, creamy element here, from its 30 month's aging on the lees before bottling, but this just makes the crispness even more exciting.",93,Domaine Luneau-Papin 2001 Clos des Noëlles Excelsior  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"What a disappointment. This isn't the Artist Series it used to be. It's okay for an everyday Cab, but is simple, with watered-down blackberry and cherry jam flavors. Not ageable, so drink up.",85,Kenwood 2007 Artist Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"Auxerrois, a grape variety rarely seen in the United States, shows it's fresh white grapefruit and pear flavors well in this brisk, revitalizing wine. Dry in style, it's a zesty, straightforward wine intended for early consumption.",87,Frieden-Berg 2013 Nitteler Rochusfels Trocken Auxerrois (Mosel)
"On the nose, this smells a touch yeasty and bready, similar to Saltine crackers. The mouthfeel on this sparkling wine is crisp and right on. Slightly bitter white-fruit flavors come with a dusting of white pepper and a lingering lime note on the dry finish.",90,Castellroig 2011 Gran Reserva Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava)
"Raisin, kirsch and leather aromas define the nose on this crianza. The palate is properly dry, with good acidity and clampy tannins. Flavors of dry oak, herbal notes, raspberry and raisin end in a solid but slightly rough finish. This will go better with food than on its own.",88,Bodegas Valdemar 2007 Finca del Marquesado Crianza  (Rioja)
"Structure defines this wine. It has a great architecture of tannins, acids and oak, with a firm, dry finish. That stands it in stark relief to today's modern cult style of fruity softness, and to the wine's credit. It's Bordeaux-like, with cherry, currant, herb and cedar flavors, and should develop over the next decade. A winery to watch.",92,Alpha Omega 2005 Proprietary Red Wine Red (Napa Valley)
"Bland peach and melon aromas come in front of a flabby, creamy palate. Basic melon and papaya flavors are limited, with a slight bitterness lingering on a soft, fleshy finish.",83,Santa Alba 2013 Reserve Chardonnay (Maule Valley)
The floral aromas in this animated wine give way to fragrant fruit salad flavors that range from orange to pineapple to apple. It has a nicely tart texture and lingering fruity finish.,86,Enotria 2014 Uvaggio Isabella Arneis (Mendocino County)
"A shallot-skin-colored wine, this has ripe red berry fruits and a soft texture. It is attractively on the way to maturity, with hints of toast coming through the acidity and rounded character at the end. The wine is ready to drink.",89,Joseph Perrier 2005 Brut Rosé Vintage  (Champagne)
"Drinkable with just about anything that calls for red wine, it has currant, licorice and oak flavors.",83,Fog Head 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Four-plus years haven't helped to soften or sweeten this tough, herbal Cab. It's bone dry and lean, even austere in flavor, leaving the alcohol and powerful tannins to dominate.",83,Wellington 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"Rounded and ripe, this has yellow fruits along with a fresher, sliced apple character. The wine is fruity, perfumed and just touched by a more mineral texture, with crisp acidity that gives a ripe fruitiness. Drink from 2017.",88,Louis Latour 2013  Meursault
"Rich, spicy and deliciously fruity, it has tannins well cushioned by the ample blackberry flavors. Acidity preserves the wine's easy freshness, while it also has a dense texture. Drink now, but the wine will be richer in late 2014.",90,DFJ Vinhos 2012 Paxis Red (Lisboa)
"This barrel-fermented wine is a most pleasant quaffer. A mix of yellow apple and pink grapefruit flavors, along with some skin phenolics, power on through. It was fermented in 10% new oak, and a hint of that pops up in the finish, an impression of candied orange peel. Drink now through 2022.",88,Raptor Ridge 2015 Gran Moraine Vineyard Chardonnay
"This Barbera shows elegance and harmony with ripe berry notes that are offset by wood spice and mineral notes. The extraction is thick and dense and the wine yields a plush, smooth texture in the mouth with bitter berry nuances on the close.",91,Araldica 2007 Rive  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore)
"Minty, creamy and as oaky as can be. Coconut, sawdust, carob and other barrel-based aromas steal the nose, with secondary black fruit and thick tannins composing the palate. This is a ripped, high-alcohol, almost soupy Syrah that in some people's eye may seem overdone and too woody. But the fruit is of unquestionable high quality, and if you give it time to air out you'll get the best results.",90,Montes 2005 Folly Syrah (Apalta)
"Starts out with proprietary aromas of clove, spice and cinnamon, and in the mouth it's a tannic grabber with forcefulness as well as ripe, sweet, menthol-infused berry flavors. Falls off somewhat on the finish, where butter and candy come in. Heavy and dark but still good for a New World Syrah.",87,Viña La Rosa 2008 La Capitana Barrel Reserve Shiraz (Cachapoal Valley)
"Bright grapefruit and citric flavors give the wine a bright, floral character, punctuated by tight acidity. The wine has extreme mouthwatering freshness and a crisp aftertaste.",86,Quinta de Chocapalha 2008 Arinto (Estremadura)
"Structured and dark-hued, this powerful wine is dense with tannins as well as black cherry fruits. It is initially tough, but behind the solid exterior lies a warmer wine, full of delicious fruit waiting to come out. Drink from 2018.",90,Domaine de Bellene 2012 Vieilles Vignes  (Nuits-St.-Georges)
"Soft and ripe, this is an easy, fruity wine. It has red berries, gentle tannins and attractive acidity. It is just as enjoyable as an apéritif as with food and ready to drink now.",85,Château Cru de Verdun 2009  Médoc
"A mix of small lot-fermented, Horse Heaven Hills Cabernet Sauvignon, some from Champoux, it's fine-tuned, varietal, loaded with cassis and plum, light toast, and ground coffee. Elegant, proportionate, and a fine expression of a great vintage.",93,Reasons 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Here's a simple, brambly expression of Sangiovese Grosso, with bright acidity and lively notes of forest berry and moist earth. This wine has a smoky touch of toasted almond on the close.",85,Podere La Vigna 2009  Rosso di Montalcino
Sweet peach nectar and fragrant white flower open the nose of this lush Gewürztraminer. The wine feels slightly sweet and sticky on the palate with rich density and a waxy finish.,88,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano 2011 Sanct Valentin Gewürztraminer (Alto Adige)
"A dry, soft wine that depends on richness to get by, at the expense of structure. Raspberries, cherries, mocha, cinnamon and pepper are the flavors of this blend of Grenache, Syrah, Counoise and Mourvèdre.",86,Tablas Creek 2009 Cotes de Tablas Rouge Red (Paso Robles)
"Made from Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah, with slightly more of the former. It hinges on large swathes of barbecue smokiness and heaping grilled meat, with a baseline of licorice and vanilla-laced tannin that can sometimes overwhelm.",85,Ninety+ 2013 Super Cuvee Lot 95 Red (Napa Valley)
"A bit harsh in the mouth and soft, which emphasizes the extracted fruit and makes the wine taste syrupy in blackberries and licorice.",82,Clif Family 2006 The Climber Red (California)
"Lemony and strange at first, with gamy notes, leather and incense. The palate feels chunky and medicinal, with herbal, sweet, jumbled flavors of candied blackberry. Finishes flat and quick, leaving medicinal sweetness.",86,La Posta 2009 Angel Paulucci Vineyard Malbec (Mendoza)
"This pitch-dark, fully extracted Malbec from La Consulta in Mendoza's Uco Valley delivers blackberry, black pepper and brushy herbal aromas on what amounts to a massive, spot-on bouquet. Big, chewy and tannic on the palate, with earthy, roasted flavors of blackberry, prune, savory spices and raw oak, this finishes meaty, slightly salty and strong, with wild herb and black-fruit flavors. Drink through 2022.",94,Zuccardi 2012 Aluvional Malbec (La Consulta)
"Aube-based Jean Josselin specializes in Pinot Noir. This bottling has juicy raspberry flavor, bright acidity and a candied fruit aftertaste. Drink now.",84,Jean Josselin NV Audace Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Champagne)
"Riper notions of yellow plum and melon mingle with Grüner's attractive freshness, here expressed by lemon and lime zest flavors. The palate adds extra verve with a pleasantly bitter phenolic edge. This is a taut, clean, super-fruited textbook example of freshness with tons of verve.",92,Stift Göttweig 2015 Goettweiger Berg Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"A blend of 50% Malbec with Cabernet, Syrah and Merlot that's lightly minty and full of tobacco, pepper and spicy aromas. Feels a bit clampy and tannic, with oaky, herbal flavors of plum and sweet berry. Shows a hint of green and drying tannins on the finish.",89,Algodon 2008 Estate Blend Gran Reserva Red
"Produced from 52 acres of vines close to Cadillac, the wine is ripe, just hinting at a herbal character. Fresh lemon and apple fruit is crisp and light. It is a fruity wine that is ready to drink.",85,Château Haut Maurin 2015  Bordeaux Blanc
"The blend of this rich wine is dominated by Alvarinho, some of it from old vines. With its wonderful ripe fruit and layers of apricot and pear flavors, this is like no other Vinho Verde. That is except for that zingy acidity that gives the wine is refreshing fruitiness at the end. Drink now.",92,Casa do Valle 2015 Reserva Special Edition White (Vinho Verde)
"Made with Nero d'Avola and other grapes, all bush-trained, this opens with subdued aromas of dark berry and toast. The dense palate offers dried blackberry, oak-driven spice and a chocolate note alongside firm tannins. Drink sooner rather than later to capture the fruit flavors.",88,Zisola 2011 Doppiozeta Red (Noto)
"This 100% varietal wine is sourced from a certified sustainable and Biodynamic vineyard. It shines in its simplicity of bright strawberry, red licorice and farm dirt scents, imparting crisp acidity throughout.",90,Ampelos 2012 Ampelos Vineyard Delta Grenache (Sta. Rita Hills)
"A rounded wine, this has an attractive red-jelly flavor and light acidity. It is full and rich, with fine acids on the finish. Keep for six months.",86,Trenel Fils 2011  Côte de Brouilly
"Vigorous bubbles present a Pinot Noir-like nose of crushed rocks, Indian spice and sour earth on one of the best Central Coast sparklers of the vintage. The intriguing flavors center on pluot and nectarine flesh, with fringes of salinity, lemon juice, cardamom and even dashes of curry.",93,Goat Bubbles 2011 Sierra Madre Vineyard Crémant Sparkling (Santa Maria Valley)
"Tight and stalky wine, the black currant, spice and tobacco characters all pushed to the front. It has a severe, more mineral style that shows acidity as well as lean fruit.",85,Château Roubine 2011 Red (Côtes de Provence)
"An easy, gentle wine, soft and velvety in texture, offering jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries and oak. Earns extra points for dryness and a richly tannic structure.",88,Lyeth 2010 Meritage (Sonoma County)
"This is the most intractable of the winery's 2008 Pinot Noirs, holding back in the glass and showing plenty of grip and tannin. Tight and compact, with a distinctive black pepper scent, this wine needs more bottle age. With time, the score could certainly improve.",89,David Hill 2008 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Corbaia is a super Tuscan blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon that opens with intensity and bright fruit flavors. It boasts a soft, silky feel with a firm tannic bite followed by cassis, earth and wild mushroom. Very nice.",93,Castello di Bossi 2007 Corbaia Red (Toscana)
"Petite Sirah remains a curiosity in Oregon, and at such a low level of ripeness, this turns generic. Tart cranberry fruit remains herbal and thin as it hits a quick finish. The wine is well made, but lacks varietal punch and authenticity.",86,Folin Cellars 2011 Petite Sirah (Rogue Valley)
"This offers aromas of oak, coconut and roasted coffee bean that carry over to the palate along with a hint of dried black cherry and a confectionary note. It lacks the fruit richness needed to stand up to the oak while raspy tannins give it an astringent finish.",87,Alessandro Veglio 2011 Gattera  (Barolo)
"This wine is structured with red fruits. It has a thin texture, a metallic character that is less pleasant. It needs more weight and richness.",85,Domaine Pierre Guillemot 2014 Aux Gravains Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune)
"Under the same ownership as Château la Dominique in Saint-Émilion, Clément-Pichon has produced a richly juicy 2012. Firm structure underlies the generous fruits, while the acidity and the dry core of tannins promise good aging. Drink from 2017.",89,Château Clément-Pichon 2012  Haut-Médoc
"This new project by a former White House videographer recently enlisted Paul Hobbs as a consultant. The promise is already apparent in this wine, with aromas of cedar, cherry extract and pleasant green-pepper elements. Spicy black pepper leads the palate, which finds ripeness in black cherry and balance with leather and coffee.",91,Brave & Maiden 2011 Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Packaged in a very heavy glass bottle, this bright Ripasso opens with mature aromas of prune, raspberry, cherry and cassis. Tones of leather and tobacco fill in the rear and the wine is compact on the close with a touch of bitter almond.",87,Tinazzi 2008 Monterè Cà de' Rocchi  (Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso)
"Pinot Noir from Canada can often be quite delicate, but this is a full-bodied, even muscular effort. Toasty and tasty, it puts a pleasant roasted character upon ripe strawberry and cherry fruit. Tannins are substantial, along with some barrel flavors from nine months in French oak.",88,Mission Hill 2014 Reserve Pinot Noir (Okanagan Valley)
"This is a rich wine that is full of spicy aromatic fruit. It is classy and elegant while having some weight. Red fruits and orange zest are given a perfumed herbal edge from the Mourvèdre in the blend. This is real food wine, ready to drink.",91,Ravoire et Fils 2016 Domaine Mas Thérèse Rosé (Bandol)
"The aromas pop with notes of wet gravel, mineral, funk, olive tapenade and high-toned flowers. The flavors are palate coating yet light and restrained, with generous savory and umami flavors that draw out on the finish. It has a very pretty sense of texture and precision—all about elegance.",92,Reynvaan Family Vineyards 2013 In the Rocks Vineyard Estate Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"The scents of humus, spiced blackberry and char are deep, delineated and balanced. Fine-grained tannins and lifting acids unfurl across the poised palate, and the long finish concludes with black raspberry and vanilla notes.",88,North Gate 2011 Merlot (Virginia)
"Impressive for a $12 Old Vine Zin, this wine is spicy and full of pepper, much more savory than sweet with plenty of texture midpalate and decent length. Definitely full-bodied, it'll stand up to a plethora of rich foods and even age another couple of years.",88,Sobon Estate 2009 Old Vines Zinfandel (Amador County)
"A full wine with smoked meat, licorice and black-fruit jam aromas. The palate is healthy, snappy and tannic, with earthy, full-blast berry flavors that veer toward sweet raisin and syrup but then pull back before falling off the cliff. Saturated, dense and raisiny, but still very rich, real and rewarding.",89,Argie 2007 Andes Bonarda (Mendoza)
"Here's a good, sound Merlot that's fancy enough to serve with special fare. It's dry and rich in tannins, with oak-inspired black cherry, currant and pepper flavors. Easy to find, with 29,000 cases produced. The alcohol measures 16%.",87,Robert Mondavi 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"This blend of Garnacha, Marsellan and Syrah opens with a dark, inky, smoky nose that's full of lemony oak along with black-fruit aromas. It's hard as nails on the palate, with drilling tannins. Rubbery, herbal blackberry flavors end with burnt toast, rubbery accents and a briny aftertaste. Best from 2017–2022.",89,Angosto 2013 Almendros Red (Valencia)
"The wonderfully earthy touch of russet pear peel and the freshness of lemon and green apple all appear on the nose. On the beautifully dry incisive palate, the lemon shines through and takes over. This is bright, vivid and fresh but comes with a lovely earthy texture that grounds the soaring lemon freshness. The long finish once again features ripe but tart apple and green pear, but ends in lip-smacking pure lemon zest. Drink 2017–2030 at least.",94,Boeckel 2014 Wiebelsberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"Aromas of cherry, baking spices, cocoa and herbs are followed by dark fruit and vanilla flavors with a creamy feel. It's a bit oak-driven but overall it works.",88,Lone Birch 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley)
"Concentrated olallieberry and black plum meld with leather and lilac scents on the nose of this blend of 50% Mourvèdre, 33% Grenache and 17% Syrah. Round and ripe blueberry, black currant and kirsch-like fruits show on the palate, but floral aspects, grippy texture, peppery spice and vibrant acidity take it to the next level.",93,Jaffurs 2013 High Tide Red (Santa Barbara County)
"The nose is rather shy but eventually reveals aromas suggesting wet underbrush, wild herb, new leather and a hint of woodland berry. The slender palate is rather raw and diluted, offering hints of tart sour cherry and star anise alongside brisk acidity and angular tannins.",86,Fattoria dei Barbi 2014  Rosso di Montalcino
"Baked strawberries and red cherries pair deliciously with shaved nutmeg, vanilla and black tea leaves on the nose of this bottling. There is a strong black plum tang to the sip, which is decorated lavishly with thyme, bay leaf, rust and gravel—a very elegant expression overall.",93,Black Ridge 2013 Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Dominated by Touriga Nacional (70%), this is a dark-hued, beautifully perfumed wine. Still young and dense with tannins and very fresh black currant fruits, it is a wine that will develop slowly. The oak aging has smoothed the corners of the fruit, bringing out spice and enhancing the firm texture. Drink from 2018.",91,Rui Roboredo Madeira 2013 Quinta do Côa Reserva Red (Douro)
"Briny notes of oyster shell blend with spicy barrel notes and core apple aromas on the bouquet of this crisp, pure, minerally Chardonnay. Flavors of apple, quince, orange marmalade and minerals finish sturdy and secure.",89,Valentin Bianchi 2015 Famiglia Bianchi Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"Tart and snappy, the flavors of lime flesh and rind dominate. Some green pineapple pokes through, with crisp acidity underscoring the flavors. The wine was all stainless-steel fermented.",87,Rainstorm 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"Juicy white grapefruit and lime flavors penetrate throughout this juicy, off-dry Riesling. It's refreshing and quaffable yet elegantly structured, finishing moderately long on a lingering lime-pith note.",89,Louis Guntrum 2012 Nierstein Bergkirche Kabinett Riesling (Rheinhessen)
"A solid example of Coonawarra Cabernet, the 2008 Terra Rossa features a charming combination of cherry-cassis fruit and eucalypt with cigar box and vanilla. It's medium to full in body, with fine balance and a long finish. Drink now–2016.",88,Parker 2008 Coonawarra Estate Terra Rossa Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra)
"This is an immediately attractive and fruity wine. Bright acidity is rounded out by warm peach and pear flavors, with a mineral texture that will allow the wine to age. Drink now for the fruit, but it will be at its best from 2016.",90,Domaine du Haut Bourg 2013 Sur Lie  (Muscadet Côtes de Grandlieu)
"The nose already promises pleasure. Layers of grapefruit and mirabelle, lemon and tangerine, apple and honey present a series of contradictions—not to mention delicious flavors—creating immense and irresistible tension. This is only going to get better if you can refrain from drinking it all. Pure thrill and lots of concentrated, zesty promise.",95,Eichinger 2014 Heiligenstein Reserve Riesling (Kamptal)
"Alluring, inviting aromas of white flowers, melon and peach are pure as stream water. This feels round and juicy, with flavors of green herbs, lettuce, lime and orange. Tangerine notes carry the finish, which is linear and racy in feel before turning slightly pithy in flavor.",90,Pazo Pondal 2013 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Pronounced Kay-lee, this Red Mountain Syrah remains a bit tight and tannic, with hints of green tea in the finish. The fruit is tart and compact, with a nose of blueberry and brown sugar. Tannins are quite hard and slightly bitter; this will require some further cellaring.",90,Efeste 2007 Ceidleigh Syrah (Red Mountain)
"Initially rustic, this is likely to develop into a dry, firmly tannic wine. The acidity and red berry notes come together in balance, but it does need serious aging to develop fully. Drink from 2018.",88,João Teodosio Matos Barbosa 2009 Ninfa Escolha Red (Tejo)
"This wine captures the popular grapefruity, grassy style of the variety in a crisp, refreshing and flavorful way. Light to medium bodied and full of bracing acidity, it will be great with seafood or as a pre-dinner drink.",88,Guenoc 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County)
"Thick in decadent tannin accents and integrated oak, this wine also offers high-toned cassis and cranberry, with a touch of cedar lurking in the shadows. It finishes in a wash of leather and black pepper.",90,Pope Valley Winery 2012 Estate Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Textbook RRV Pinot Noir, a red wine for Cab and Merlot lovers who want to graduate to this great grape. Dry and full-bodied, it actually has some pronounced tannins, with currant and bitter cherry skin flavors and darker, complex notes of pine sap, balsamic and black pepper.",87,Russian Hill 2006 Estate Vineyards Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"A little watery, but it still conveys tropical fruit, lemon, pineapple and buttered toast flavors. The texture is creamy, and there's a lively spine of acidity.",84,Irony 2012 Chardonnay (California)
"There's a distinct floral streak to this lightly aromatic Chardonnay, which also has notes of apple and spice. Though it has 61 g/L residual sugar, it drinks dry with bitter notes on the finish.",84,Pine & Post 2010 Chardonnay (Washington)
"Light lemon and vanilla flavors and a creamy texture make this wine easy to drink. The body is on the light side, too, with soft acidity and a mouthfeel that's not too thick.",87,Michael Sullberg 2015 Reserve Lot 92 Chardonnay (California)
"Heavy handed in ripe fruit and oak, with a soft, sweet mouthfeel. Will appeal to fans of the tropical fruit and buttered toast style of Chardonnay.",84,Bargetto 2008 Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"This offers a distinctive take on Boushey fruit, with a lot of green tea in the tannins. The berry flavors take a back seat to the vineyard's distinctive highlights of earth, cured meat, and Rhône-like bacon fat.",91,JM Cellars 2007 Boushey Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"The texture is off, with hard and bitter tannins. The fruit also is quite ripe, with the black cherries veering into raisins. Oak sticks out in the form of sweet vanilla and toast. The result lacks harmony.",83,Burrell School Vineyards 2010 Estate Reserve Honor Roll Merlot (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"There's an inky, raw feel to this riserva (Sangiovese blended with tiny percentages of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot), followed by candied cherry and rum cake. It finishes sour and bitter.",85,La Castellina 2007 Squarcialupi Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"La Bambina is a fresh and easy-drinking Sicilian rosé (made from Nero d'Avola) that opens with a pretty peach-pink color and bright aromas of raspberry, white cherry and cassis. Try it with swordfish carpaccio.",86,Cantine Barbera 2010 La Bambina Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"This delicious wine from old Sémillon vines offers a hint of nuts and spice as well as crisp, clean fruit. It is lively with acidity as well as having a richer side. The wine will be just right from the end of 2017.",88,Château Haut Mouleyre 2016  Bordeaux Blanc
"This is nominally a step up from De Bortoli's dB Selection Petite Sirah, but this fresh, directly fruity wine doesn't seem to offer much beyond jammy fruit. It's medium-bodied, with a crisp finish and just a hint of tannic structure. Drink now–2012.",84,De Bortoli 2006 Deen de Bortoli Vat 1 Petite Sirah (South Eastern Australia)
"Aromas of wet stone, smoke and petrol seep evocatively into the sweet pineapple bouquet. The palate is dry but deeply concentrated with a ripe stone fruit character. Finishes briskly with a bracing lime juice acidity.",89,Keuka Lake Vineyards 2009 Falling Man Vineyard Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Dark chocolate and cedar merge easily on the nose of this medium- to full-bodied wine. Those dark, oaky elements are balanced by tart berries on the palate, enhanced by barrel char and oodles of soft tannins on the long finish. Drink now–2025.",91,Howard Park 2013 Scotsdale Cabernet Sauvignon (Great Southern)
"Ripe, brandied aromas of baked cherry and blackberry are heady and leathery upon airing. This shows raw tannins and scratchy acidity in front of traditional flavors: vanilla, oak, currant and raspberry. An oaky finish comes with vanilla, toast and chocolaty accents.",87,Viña Mayor 2010 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"A blend of wines from different vineyards in Pouilly, this powerful wine is concentrated, with tight minerality that demands further aging. Rich and packed with apples and green plums, it is a beautiful wine that will age well. Drink from 2018 at the earliest.",94,Pascal Jolivet 2014 Indigène  (Pouilly-Fumé)
"A tiny-production wine that is exuberantly brambly and wild, this has a bouquet of juicy black and red berries at its core. Balanced and elegant despite the generous palate, it has softened tannins and a thickness toward the finish. offering accents of black pepper and brown sugar.",93,Sequum 2012 Riverwash Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"Yeasty, briney and strange on the nose, this feels clunky, with oily citrus and nut-driven flavors. It's bitter on the finish, and it doesn't show much in the way of mouthfeel. A blend of Chardonnay and Macabeo.",82,Dominio de la Vega NV Artemayor Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava)
"This pure Cabernet Franc is perfumed and crisply fruity. It has balanced acidity as well as a soft, creamy character. Red-berry fruits go well with a citrus aftertaste. Drink now.",86,Gratien et Meyer NV Brut Rosé Cabernet Franc (Crémant de Loire)
"This wine is structured and concentrated, showing a tight character that is closed and firm. It has enough fruit for the future to show its potential richness. Concentrated, very mineral, the wine should not be drunk until 2017.",92,Henry Fessy 2013  Pouilly-Fuissé
"Scents of ripe dark-skinned berry, rose, iris and a balsamic note take shape in the glass. The juicy palate offers ripe black cherry, star anise, orange peel and grilled herb framed in tightly knit but refined tannins. A clove note backs up the finish.",93,Comm. G. B. Burlotto 2012  Barolo
"Nice and familiar for the variety, with common herbal, beefy, black fruit aromas followed by a chunky palate of blackberry, black cherry, mocha and herbs. Clean and solid on the finish, with 15% Cabernet in the blend.",86,Asunto de Vino 2008 Carmenère (Central Valley)
"Fontanafredda's Moscato d'Asti is a cut above its competitors, with intense orange, grape and pear aromas that lead into a palate of white grapes and ground cherries. The medium finish is intensely sweet but an underlying freshness saves it from being cloying. Drink with a plate of mixed fruit.",86,Fontanafredda 2007 Moncucco  (Moscato d'Asti)
"This Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend is from Jess Jackson-owned vineyards high above Alexander Valley. Made solidly in the modern style, it's very ripe, very soft, and extraordinarily rich in chocolate-infused cassis, cherry, date and violet flavors that are liberally treated with new oak. It's a delicious, seductive wine that should ride out the next 8 years with ease.",90,Legacy 2004 Red Wine Red (Alexander Valley)
"Waxy in mouthfeel and dark gold in color, this wine offers simple fresh lemon and green apple flavors, its finish expansive and full.",88,C R Graybehl 2015 Mounts Family Vineyard Grenache Blanc (Dry Creek Valley)
"The nose of this powerfully fruity yet dry Riesling packs a punch, with aromas of ripe pineapple, apricot and floral potpourri. The palate is dense with stone fruit, and a hint of red berry flavor, but finishes elegantly with sleek mineral tones.",92,Dr. Loosen 2011 Ürziger Würzgarten Alte Reben GG Trocken Riesling (Mosel)
"This could be Chardonnay, or any light white wine. Fruit flavors are apple and pear; there's lots of acidity. A simple, pleasant, everyday style.",85,Vin du Lac 2008 LEHM Pinot Gris (Chelan County)
"Minty plum and berry aromas are herbal but ripe, with a note of chocolate and black tea. This is lush and layered, with top-end mouthfeel and herbal, floral flavors of berry fruits and plum. A smooth, herbal tasting finish is the finale to a well-made, flavorful wine.",90,Siegel 2012 Single Vineyard Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"Rich and round, this attractive wine has generous tannins and equally generous fruit. Black currants shine with their acidity while the texture is firm and solid. This is a wine with a future; drink from 2016.",88,Château Roquefort 2012  Bordeaux
This lively fresh wine brings out the fruitiness of the blend rather than the tannins of the Syrah and Merlot. Citrus and red berry flavors are well integrated with the crisp acidity. Drink now.,86,Domaine Uby 2014 No. 8 Merlot-Syrah Syrah-Merlot (Côtes de Gascogne)
"Temecula Valley-based Brookside Winery makes this nonvintage blend, a combination of Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel and Petite Sirah. Moderately light in alcohol, it nonetheless imparts deep, dark fruit and a leathery juiciness, with Zin taking over on the finish.",84,Generation 7 NV Road to Morocco Red (Lodi)
"This wine puts jammy aromas, very ripe flavors, full body and deep, dark fruit flavors on a broad, soft texture.",87,Cuda Ridge Wines 2013 Melange d'Amis Reserve Red (Livermore Valley)
"Subtle notes of bramble, smoke and raspberry entice on the nose of this dry rosé. While delicate in concentration, its supple silken mouthfeel and yielding acidity are approachable and comforting. The finish is bright and clean. Drink now.",86,240 Days 2015 Rosé (Finger Lakes)
"The balance between wood aging and fruit is at its best in this wine. It shows plenty of red fruits filled out with raisins and nutmeg. As a contrast the wood aging has brought out a spicy, almond character. It is fresh, on the dry side for an aged tawny and, of course, ready to drink.",88,Quinta dos Murças NV 10 Anos Old Tawny  (Port)
"This lightweight wine combines herbal notes reminiscent of tomato and celery leaves with hints of white grapefruit. Finishes just a bit short, with vaguely peppery notes.",85,Lobster Reef 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Made to be approachable, this full-bodied red is juicy with black fruit and tart cherry flavors, with a savory side of gunpowder and tobacco. Firm, integrated tannins behave well in the background.",88,Starmont 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A good wine, comprised of fruit from vineyards scattered across Santa Barbara County. It's bone dry and crisp in acidity, and also pretty oaky. The underlying fruit flavors are of apricots and pears, with perhaps a touch of botrytis. Ready to drink now.",86,Gainey 2008 Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Full-bodied, lush and velvety, the 2006 Ben Schild Reserve is ready to drink now and over the next 8 years. Hints of espresso and black olive impart complexity to the plum and blueberry fruit, and a licorice note chimes in on the softly textured finish.",92,Schild Estate 2006 Ben Schild Reserve Shiraz (Barossa)
"This wine lives and breathes terroir, with the rock and wild herb character of the AVA and the vivid cherry fruit of the vineyard. It's beautifully proportioned, with a vein of cola, a toasty bouquet and a focused finish.",93,Owen Roe 2013 Sojourner Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Softened by 20% Merlot, this wine tastes of chocolate-covered clove and spicy dried herb, the robust layers of flavor cradled in toasted oak. Fresh and brooding, it offers forest pine, black currant and tobacco in a refined package of integrated tannin.",93,Somerston 2013 Deerhound Estate Grown Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley)
"The fruit is on the tart side, cranberries and raspberries, but the wine is fleshed out with plenty of vanilla oak, and fills the mouth with soft, seductive flavors. Well made and approachable, with some added interest from Carignane, Petite Sirah and Mourvèdre in the blend.",87,Sebastiani 1998 Old Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
"Minerally white-fruit aromas are clean but generic. In every way, this is a modest but solid Verdejo with proper acidity and overall balance. Briny citrus is the key flavor, while the finish holds form and tastes citrusy and a touch salty.",87,4R4U 2015 Verdejo (Rueda)
Whiffs of smoke and dark toast lend savoriness to this otherwise plush plummy Cabernet Sauvignon. Unctuous black plum and berry flavors are rich and yielding on the palate but finish with bold penetrating tannins.,87,Thirsty Owl Wine Company 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes)
"Tight in acidity and tannins now, but very complex, offering a range of cherry, tangerine zest, mushroom, cola and Indian spice flavors that swirl to a long finish. The mouthfeel is delicate, but the power is impressive. Drink now–2015.",93,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2007 Saralee's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Ripe berry aromas blend nicely with earthy leathery scents. With a full and easy palate, this generous Crianza delivers blackberry and chocolate flavors that veer toward raisin and prune, especially on the finish, which is lightly toasted and dense in feel. Drink through 2019.",91,Matarromera 2012 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"The oak flavoring overpowers, with smoky char, buttered toast, caramel and sweet vanilla dominating the pineapple and pear fruit.",83,Fetzer 2007 Valley Oaks Chardonnay (California)
"A tight, metallic streak runs vertically through this Cabernet. Deep cassis fruit, juicy acids and the mineral/metal signature of the vineyard combine in a well-structured wine with an extended finish.",93,Januik 2011 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"This is very pretty and enjoyable, with creamy peach, butterscotch and yellow rose notes. The wine has a lean, compact feel and a crisp, citrusy finish.",85,Perusini 2006 Ronchi di Gramogliano Ribolla Gialla (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"The 2006 Chertsey is a blend of 49% Cabernet Sauvignon, 47% Merlot, 4% Cabernet Franc and 100% French oak. The oak's vanilla and cedar notes provide a foundation for the wine's cassis and plum flavors, cosseting them in soft tannins. Drink now–2018.",91,Penley Estate 2006 Chertsey Red (Coonawarra)
"Very ripe and almost sweet in jammy, pie-filling cherries and raspberries, with a rich seasoning of cinnamon, brown sugar and cocoa. But it's technically dry, and has a crispness from fine Arroyo Seco acidity. Drink now.",87,J. Lohr 2007 Fog's Reach Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco)
"Rich and creamy, with fruit-forward flavors of pineapple jam, oranges, ripe peaches, vanilla and buttered toast. Crisp acidity gives balance and clean liveliness.",87,Dominican Oaks 2007 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"The grapes used for this estate-grown Cabernet are sourced from younger vines. Round and full, the wine seems to have spent a fair amount of time in barrel, showing pretty baking spices along with tangy fruit.",88,Crossfork Creek 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley)
"Savory whiffs of dried herbs, pine needles and dusty minerals open to a bright, delicately fruity palate of crisp tangerine and quince. Dry and spry, it offers brisk, cooling refreshment. Drink now–2017.",87,Keuka Lake Vineyards 2014 Estate Grown and Bottled Falling Man Vineyard Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"With its tangy acidity, touches of green peppercorns and edgy tannins, this is a rustic wine. Fortunately, it has a lot of blackberry and dark chocolate flavors, with that distinctive briary character of Dry Creek Zins. Drink now with roasted or grilled meats or a vegetarian lasagna.",87,Miro 2010 Piccetti Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"The point of this semisweet bottling is a little unclear, but it offers a beautifully rich nose of honeysuckle, buttercream, white peach, almond paste and flint. The palate is rich, creamy and quite sweet, with peach, melon and mango flavors. Consider it as a light dessert wine or a pairing for spicy foods.",88,Boekenoogen 2015 Late Harvest Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"A common thread among the 2015 Soléna Pinots is a stiff herbal beet flavor rather than fully ripe berry fruit. This tilts into cranberry and very tart raspberry, but finishes astringent and hard. Give it plenty of decanting (two or three hours) to help it open up.",88,Soléna 2015 Domaine Danielle Laurent Pinot Noir
"Aromas suggesting mature dark-skinned berry, French oak, leather, menthol and parched soil come together on this. The round, dense palate is already accessible, offering fleshy black cherry, licorice, cured meat and espresso alongside ripe, chewy tannins. Drink through 2021.",90,Parusso 2012 Mariondino  (Barolo)
"There's a tinge of herbaceous green stem amidst fresh apple and lemon aromas on this Sauvignon Blanc blended with 10% Albariño. Marked with nervous lime acidity, it's lean on the palate with a hint of lime-skin bitterness on the finish.",85,Billsboro 2012 Sawmill Creek Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Finger Lakes)
"A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 10% Petit Verdot, this opens with aromas of red currant, clove and toast. The structured, elegant palate doles out plum, sage and tobacco alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink 2017–2022.",91,Fattoria Le Pupille 2013 Saffredi  (Maremma Toscana)
"A spritzy wine, with strongly herbal flavors. There isn't much in the way of fruit, just stems and herbs and chalky tannins.",83,StoneCap 2011 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This luminous, golden Pinot Grigio offers loads of intensity in the form of peach, apricot, honeydew melon and white almond. The mouthfeel is smooth and thick, making this wine particularly well suited to sophisticated pasta dishes such as pumpkin-filled ravioli with crushed walnuts.",88,Valter Scarbolo 2008 Pinot Grigio (Friuli Grave)
"Aromas of graphite, subtle oak and ripe woodland berries carry over to the palate, along with notes of vanilla and espresso. It has an almost sugary-sweet finish. It's already extremely accessible so drink now.",86,San Giacomo 2012  Rosso di Montalcino
"Beautiful spice, oak and fruit aromas segue seamlessly into abundant, complex flavors reminiscent of cherries and chocolate in this superbly layered and velvet-textured wine. It has quite firm tannins but instead of biting they blend with the fruit acidity and full body for a sense of soft finesse. The blend is Tempranillo with 26% Petite Sirah and 23% Syrah.",91,Las Positas 2011 Estate Coccineous Red (Livermore Valley)
"Spring flowers, pear, peach and honey shape a luminous and bright Falanghina from the sunny Campania region. The wine has pulp and density and would pair well with Indian and Thai foods.",86,Villa Matilde 2007 Rocca dei Leoni Falanghina (Campania)
"Made from a blend of 80% Nero d'Avola and 20% Merlot, this hearty wine opens with aromas of underbrush, tobacco leaf, mature plum, bell pepper and black berry. The round palate offers notes of juicy blackberry, cocoa, vanilla and expresso.",89,Duca di Salaparuta 2010 Triskelè Red (Sicilia)
"Grapefruit and mint make for an interesting and attractive couple on the nose, while tart citrus and a bit of grass make up the flavor profile. It hails from Western Australia, and overall it gets the job done. On the down side, however, is a slight vinegar note.",87,Alkoomi 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Frankland River)
"Spicy, this full-bodied wine is tart in cherry and piquant in baking spices, able to retain a lively and fresh palate within the weightier proceedings. It has a brooding, brushy underbelly of forest-floor pine.",91,Nicholson Ranch 2014 Cactus Hill Estate Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Damp, rubbery aromas of berry fruits and cured meat amount to a weird ensemble. This is decidedly grabby on the palate, with salty, herbal plum flavors. A leafy, herbal, mildly green finish wraps up this kitchen-sink blend of Mencía and other grapes.",84,Adegas Moure 2013 Tradición Joven Red (Ribeira Sacra)
"Notes of anise and white blossoms perfume this gorgeously sheer Riesling. It's intensely sweet, bursting with honey, grapefruit and tangerine flavors, yet balanced neatly by high-toned acidity and a uniquely herbal flair.",93,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler 2015 Bernkasteler Badstube Beerenauslese Riesling (Mosel)
Lots of sharp acidity in this dry Nebbiolo. The tartness gives it a taste of sour cherry candy. Ready now.,84,Bernat 2008 Essence Nebbiolo (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Fresh and lightly fruity, it's crisp and fragrant. With great acidity and a touch of herbaceousness, it's ready to drink.",86,Château du Cros 2013  Bordeaux Blanc
"A delicious Cabernet loaded with black currant and plum complemented by hints of pepper and mocha. The medium body and appropriately gripping tannins give way to a solid, lingering finish, making this a suitable companion to most meat and game dishes.",86,Katlav 2005 Kosher Cabernet Sauvignon (Judean Hills)
"Lusty, rich and tannic, this rustic-chic Zin trades elegance and subtlety for sheer dynamic power. Its wild blackberry, cola and mulberry flavors tread the fine line between dry and off-dry, exploding in the mouth, then finishing in a scour of astringency.",87,Armida 2009 Tina's Block Maple Vineyards Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"Smoky plum and red-berry aromas come with a hint of latex. This is full in feel and generally well balanced, with dark plum and berry flavors that are earthy but not overly complex. It delivers a steady finish.",87,Rejadorada 2012 Tinto Roble  (Toro)
"The wine comes from a small, seven-acre property. This 2010 is structured with a mineral character and chewy tannins. It is well balanced; the blackberry fruit synchronizes well with the dry texture and fresh acidity. Age for 4–5 years.",90,Château Graves de Pez 2010  Saint-Estèphe
"This bottling, which is bolstered by 9% Malbec, 3% Merlot and 2% Carmenère, shows rounded black currant, blueberry, smoked beef and graphite on the nose. Soft tannins make for an elegant presentation, with heavy black-fruit flavors of crème de cassis and dark chocolate.",91,Niner 2014 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Ripe, juicy peach and pink grapefruit flavors are accented with subtle mineral tones on this easy drinking, yet noteworthy Riesling. Dry and full bodied in style, it's lushly textured, with a bristle of lemon-pith astringency on the finish.",88,Franzen 2011 Von Quarzit-Schiefer Riesling (Mosel)
"A bit of leather and barnyard marks this Cabernet Sauvignon's nose, but it does not mask the plum and black cherry notes. The finish is layered with dark chocolate and espresso flavors.",88,Mercer Canyons 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Lightly aromatic with notes of pear, spice, and a kiss of caramel. The small amounts of Viognier (9%) and Sémillon (2%) contribute to its medium bodied, viscous feel before leading to a tart, somewhat thin finish.",85,Original House Wine 2011 House Wine Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Zesty lemon, tangerine and orange aromas awaken the senses on the nose of this elegant dry Riesling. It's spry and lean on the palate but chock full of juicy tangerine and quince flavors. Zesty lime acidity and pleasantly bitter citrus pith notes linger on the finish. Drink now through 2021.",91,Prinz Salm 2015 Trocken Riesling (Nahe)
"There's nothing not to like about this affordable Spanish bubbly. The nose is a little candied and shy, but it's pleasant overall. The palate foams a bit more than a stately Cava might, but the flavors of pear, apple and grapefruit are honest. Fresh yet soft, simple and easygoing.",86,Freixenet NV Carta Nevada Brut Sparkling (Cava)
"This is a dark, rich, modern Cabernet. The nose oozes sweet aromas of coconut and vanilla along with creamy oak and blackberry. The palate is full and chunky in feel, with dark-fruit flavors accented by molasses and pepper. A chewy finish shows grip and lasting acidity.",91,Tapiz 2011 Alta Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"High alcohol, enormously ripe fruit and soft acidity make this wine taste sweet and syrupy. Not likely to evolve, so drink up.",84,Vina Robles 2008 Signature Estate Cuvée Petit Verdot (Paso Robles)
"This is a soft, smooth and ethereally light red wine, bright and fresh in cassis and a wild element of sage. As it develops in the glass, the rounded approachability adds seasonings of leather and cinnamon.",90,Judd's Hill 2012 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Smooth and spicy, this wine explodes in layers of cinnamon and clove dusted in sugary plum and black cherry, a powerful weight and degree of ripeness at its core. The finish is soft and lengthy in vanilla oak.",88,Terlato 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"The blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot and Malbec. Cab Sauv brings rich black currants, as well as thick tannins. Merlot adds softer notes of cherries and violets. The Malbec increases the tannins, along with notes of grilled meat bone that Syrah, with its peppery, beef-jerky meatiness, enhances. The result is a young, vigorous wine, dry and balanced in acidity. It may or may not age, but there's no reason not to decant it now and enjoy with grilled beefsteak.",91,Laird 2010 Jillian's Blend Red (Napa Valley)
"A both heady and leafy swirl of passion fruit adds a tropical touch to the nose. The palate brims with sweetness and zesty passion fruit and grapefruit spice. The flavors are intense and the palate is medium sweet, aptly countered by lemon and passion fruit. This strikes a lovely balance and gives tons and tons of fruit and flavor.",92,Joseph Fritsch 2016 Furstentum Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"This is a delicious rendition of the annual Claret blend. It includes all five Bordeaux grapes, and displays a generous burst of berries and cherries, followed with a swish of chocolate. The wine delivers the goods, mixing in darker fruits, coffee and licorice streaks, winding into a lightly herbal, tannic finish.",89,Robert Karl 2008 Claret (Horse Heaven Hills)
Ripe orange and plump stone fruits rise from the glass while subtle rose scents hover. The palate is fresh. There is enough acidity and a slightly bitter phenolic edge to frame the peach and orange fruit that is augmented by a little residual sweetness. The finish is off dry. Drink while flavors are fresh.,88,Cave du Roi Dagobert 2016 Découverte Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"You could describe this wine as linear and elongated. Everything about it seems to suggest length and longevity including its well-chiseled aromas of graphite, charcoal mineral, tar, licorice and black currant. It offers ash and smoke in the mouth but is not flat or tired. In fact, it tastes succulent, austere and important.",90,Rivetti Massimo 2005 Froi  (Barbaresco)
"This sparkler shows some distant sweetness and loads of fruity softness that comes forward as peach, nectarine and honeydew melon. It is a textbook example of an off-dry Prosecco Superiore that is perfect as an aperitivo wine.",88,Andreola 2012 Millesimato Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Portfolio is a full-on, five-grape, Bordeaux-style blend—half Merlot. Dark, dense and textural, it's loaded with blackberry and black cherry fruit, swathed in baking spices, cinnamon and mocha. The tannins are beautifully managed, and it should drink magnificently through the mid-2020s.",94,Laughing Stock 2014 Portfolio Red (Okanagan Valley)
"Aromas of hay, baked corn and honey suggest that this wine has lost or is fast losing its vitality. The palate is round and full, with honeyed, soft flavors of apple and grass. Finishes mushy, another indication that it's on its last legs.",83,Maniña 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley)
"Aromas of leather, underbrush, ripe red berry and eucalyptus lead the nose on this structured wine. The delicious palate delivers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, baking spice and savory herb alongside big, chewy tannins. It ends on a succulent note. Drink 2016–2024.",92,Tenimenti Famiglia Cavallero 2009 Bussia  (Barolo)
"Structured and dense, this wine revels in its tension and tight texture. While there are plenty of black fruits, the dry core of tannins and the rich, perfumed character show this wine's best quality. It is well balanced and ripe while guarding all the freshness of the vintage. Drink from 2022.",94,Château Angélus 2013  Saint-Émilion
Fleshy honeydew and berry notes verge on overripe in this medium-sweet Riesling. Its delicate body and easygoing tangerine-inflected palate are pleasant. It finishes on a slightly sour note. Drink now.,86,Dr. Heyden 2015 Oppenheimer Kabinett Riesling (Rheinhessen)
Creamy malty aromas of vanilla and baked berry fruits lead to an astringent palate with hard tannins. This Malbec tastes earthy and like baked berry fruits and coffee grounds. A grabby finish with clamping residual tannins makes for a rugged ending.,84,Viña La Fortuna 2013 Twelvestones Malbec (Lontué Valley)
"Tobacco aromas and tight tannins set the scene for a wine that is light and fresh, with tangy berry fruits.",83,Château de l'Orangerie 2007 Grand Classique  (Premieres Côtes de Bordeaux)
"Smells thin and sweaty-funky, with little flavor, except the heat of alcohol. Maybe there's a drop of cherries.",81,Russian Hill 2005 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This ruby-colored blend of Corvina and Sangiovese doesn't offer huge aromatic intensity, but it does deliver clean notes of cherry, dried fruit, spice and fresh tobacco leaf (it is aged in cherry wood casks). The wine imparts a sour note with nutty, earthy flavors on the finish.",86,Masi 2005 Serego Alighieri Possessioni Red (Rosso del Veronese)
"A spicy wine with plenty of cinnamon and cocoa scents and accents. Wild berry fruit is still firm and hard, overtaken by the inviting barrel flavors. Give it more bottle age or decant it for near-term drinking.",89,DiStefano 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a big, rich, thick young wine, impressive in sheer fruity extraction. Shows massive blackberry, currant, anise, black pepper and sandalwood flavors, with a bit of funk. The tannins are strong and refined. Could age well. Tasted three times, with inconsistent results.",88,World's End 2008 Wavelength Sugarloaf Mountain Vineyard Syrah-Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley)
Fresh apple blossom and pear aromas are pristine on the nose of this delicate Pinot Blanc. The palate is lemony and crisp but softened by hints of honey and a mouthwatering silkiness. Ready to consume now but should drink well through 2020.,90,Maximin Grünhäuser 2014 Pinot Blanc (Mosel)
"This Tuscan Sangiovese opens with flavors of cherry, blackberry and bold modern spice. It delivers bright acidity, balance and crispness, with a food-friendly personality.",88,San Polo 2010 Rubio Sangiovese (Toscana)
"From the aroma, this seems heavily wooded, but on the palate the wood spice is becoming well integrated with the dark berry fruits and mineral texture. It is certainly young. Already, though, the fruit is showing its potential richness. Give it 3–4 years.",91,Aveleda 2008 Follies Touriga Nacional-Cabernet Sauvignon (Beiras)
"Force Majeure and Ciel du Cheval are the sources for this pure, compelling Red Mountain Syrah. The complex aromatics shoot up a smorgasbord of cured meat, truffle and umami notes, leading into a crisp, racy palate with lovely blueberry-dominated fruit flavors. Aging in 500-liter puncheons smoothes it out while contributing just a hint of new toast.",95,Mark Ryan 2011 Wild Eyed Syrah (Red Mountain)
"Dusty mineral and herb tones lend complexity to the plush, sunny peach and apricot in this bristling semidry Riesling. It's juicy and plump yet revitalizing and fresh, marked by tangerine acidity and a lacy fringe of sugar that lingers on the finish. Drink now through 2025.",91,Von Schleinitz 2016 Apollo Feinherb Riesling (Mosel)
"Pale gold colored wine with a soft texture, light wood touches and ripe yellow fruits. The wine is rich, warm, opulent in character, open and fruity. A touch of texture brings out the acidity at the end.",91,Domaines Devillard 2011 Château de Chamirey La Mission Premier Cru  (Mercurey)
"Soft, billowy tannins buoy this wine's dense red fruit, accented with dried herb, cedar and pencil shaving flavors. Ripe and full bodied, its oak is integrated and quiet.",91,Patel 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This blend of Cabernet Franc (46%), Merlot (28%), Cabernet Sauvignon (17%) and Petit Verdot (9%) starts out brooding, with black cherry, herb, black currant, anise, and spice notes. The palate is rich and structured, loaded with dark fruit flavors and firm tannins. Give it some time to open up.",92,Cadence 2015 Coda Red (Red Mountain)
"The nose on this red blend from Hungary is so inviting with its balanced wave of warming spices, red berry and pepper. But on the palate, there's a note of hard cherry candy sweetness and tartness and a lack of overall dimension that keeps a good wine from being great.",83,Áldás 2005 Egri Bikavér Red (Eger)
"Lightly mineral in texture, this wine is perfumed and ripe, with both acidity and refreshing citrus fruits. These contrast with hints of yellow fruits that will show well as this develops into a bright and crisp wine. Drink from 2017.",90,Henri de Villamont 2014  Pouilly-Fuissé
"Green apple and lime aromas are well presented and clean. This has a citrusy feel to go with lime, passion fruit and grapefruit flavors. A mildly pithy and citric finish delivers plenty of youthful kick.",86,Viña Requingua 2014 Puerto Viejo Estate Bottled Single Vineyard Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Maule Valley)
"Pretty standard Chardonnay, with a creamy texture and oaky tropical fruit flavors. Not bad for the price, if you're in a Chard mood.",83,10Span 2012 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County)
"Nice complexity and vertical aromas of cola, licorice and cherry liqueur open the nose of this Riserva Barbaresco. The wine's aromatic characteristics are very much in line with classic Nebbiolo and there's a pungent or immediate quality as well. In the mouth, it shows dense, chewy consistency.",92,Orlando Abrigo 2006 Rongalio Meruzzano Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"This is a well-balanced Petite Sirah, with chewy but proportionate tannins, a broadly fruity, black cherry core and nuanced highlights of apricot. The finish does a quick fade.",86,J. Scott Cellars 2008 Petite Sirah (Rogue Valley)
"Firm in tannins, this Bordeaux blend was grown in the cooler Oak Knoll District of the valley. Along with the astringency, it shows very ripe, sweetly jammy flavors of black cherries, currants and licorice. Could improve with cellaring.",86,O'Brien 2005 Seduction Red (Napa Valley)
"This is an extremely aromatic and floral Sauvignon that delivers an intense bouquet of sage, exotic fruit and tomato leaf. It earns high marks for personality and good cheer and offers zesty lemon flavors on the finish.",86,Banear 2007 Tentazioni d'Aba Sauvignon (Friuli Grave)
"Herbaceous and brisk, this elegant, medium-bodied Cabernet perks up on the palate with its crisp red-fruit and acidity. Straightforward yet pleasantly accented with hints of violet and black coffee, it would pair well with a variety of earthy, fall braises.",85,Fulkerson 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes)
"This top-tier bottling from Steve Martell, which blends 62% Grenache with 29% Syrah, 5% Mourvèdre and 4% Petite Sirah, offers roasted coffee, charred black currant, burnt wood and baked earth aromas. The palate is tight and bright with flashy boysenberry and black raspberry flavors balanced by anise and sagebrush accents.",93,Kaleidos 2015 Praying Mantis Red (Paso Robles)
"At three-plus years, this Chard tastes soft and candied, with pineapple LifeSaver flavors.",83,Eagles Landing 2004 Private Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Structured, mineral and tense, this is a classic Pouilly Fuissé. It has lemon and crisp sliced white fruits, very linear in character with a bright, tight texture. The wine is young and could age until 2016.",86,Jaffelin 2013  Pouilly-Fuissé
"This is a good, sturdy wine with ample fruit flavors, a firm texture and full body. It is mouthfilling, ripe and easy to like.",88,Brutocao 2012 Contento Vineyard Estate Bottled Primitivo (Mendocino)
"Too strong and extracted in blackberry and cherry fruit, almost like pure jam, a sweet, candied impression that the caramel of new oak compounds. Feels like the winemaker tried too hard to make it flashy. Pretty good, but could use restraint and finesse.",87,Blue Rock 2009 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"The Deutz style, with its lilting, dancing mouthfeel, is well illustrated by this non-vintage cuvée. It is bright and fruity, with crisp apple and pear fruits and tight acidity. but showing some signs of good bottle aging as well.",89,Deutz NV Brut Classic  (Champagne)
"A terrific effort, this wine highlights the features that make Condrieu special. First is the incredible perfume, like honeyed stone fruit and mango. Second is the richness and texture of the wine, imparting great palate presence. Third is the vibrance of the finish, providing the counterweight to the wine's ripeness and weight. Drink it over the next few years.",93,Michel & Stéphane Ogier 2011 Les Vieilles Vignes de Jacques Vernay  (Condrieu)
"A Grenache-based Rhône blend, C'est Si Bon is good and very subtle. Like a Beaujolais, an earthy leather note emerges in between soft violet and raspberry tones. With a line of acidity, it's a fine wine for food.",87,Elyse 2008 C'est Si Bon Naggiar Vineyard Red (Sierra Foothills)
"This robust, one-dimensional wine delivers mature fruit sensations of stewed prune, fig and resin, along with oak extract, vanilla and espresso. The palate is sugary sweet but lacks fruit richness. Drying wood tannins leave an astringent finish.",86,Máté 2012  Rosso di Montalcino
"Jammy aromas are accented by hints of mint, animal hide and cinnamon. This feels wide, grabby and low in acidity. Rubbery flavors of baked plum, chocolate and baking spices finish flat.",83,Viña Bisquertt 2014 Petirrojo Reserva Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
Cavit is an important wine cooperative in northern Italy that is largely responsible for Pinot Grigio's immense popularity in the United States. This bottle shows easy tones of peach and citrus.,85,Cavit 2011 Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie)
"Creamy notes of tart red currant and crisp red apple perfume the nose. The palate adds to that a gentle, softening creaminess which mellows but does not seek to tame the exuberant freshness. This is lively and joyful, in a way that is mellow and brisk and the same time. The elegant mousse is enriching, the finish is of crisp red apple.",89,Digby Fine English NV Leander Pink Sparkling (England)
"Notes of baked-berry, herb and savory spice come together well on the bouquet. It feels chunky and round but lively, with plum and cassis flavors that carry an herbal, tomatoey shading. This is fresh and herbal enough so that you know it's Old World.",88,Torres 2008 Gran Coronas Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Penedès)
"Opening with aromas of barbecued meat, this soft Cab is all about ripe, meaty tannins and smoky oak over any suggestion of fruit, which is hidden among its cedar and tobacco-lined walls.",84,Peltier 2011 Peltier Station Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi)
"There's a touch of raisiny overripeness in this dry Syrah, not a lot, but just enough to confuse the palate. Other than that, the wine is as smooth as can be, with a chocolate and bitter cherry finish.",87,Burgess 2004 Syrah (Napa Valley)
"Exceedingly rich and sweet in blackberries, currants and chocolate, this Cab is also high in alcohol, but there's no heat. The glycerine-like sweetness is part of the enjoyable package. 100% new French oak is not out of balance, bringing sweet vanilla and toast to the package. Defines the Paso style of warmth, opulence and soft deliciousness.",93,Jada Vineyard & Winery 2010 Passing By Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Scents of sweet-cream butter, vanilla and stonefruit are enticing on the nose of this richly textured, medium-bodied wine. The palate boasts hints of sweet lemon curd and fresh apple, but the slightly-sour oak notes can be overwhelming.",85,Lucas Vineyards 2010 Dry Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"This has subdued aromas suggesting dark berry, a whiff of exotic spice and a slight balsamic note. It's rather light bodied and quite simple for Barolo, offering red cherry and a hint of star anise alongside bright acidity and palate-drying, somewhat fleeting, tannins. Drink through 2020.",87,CarlindePaolo 2013  Barolo
Fresh and inviting with assertive notes of pineapple and sweet citrus backed by fleshy pear and melon accents on the nose and mouth. The palate offers zippy acidity with a clean lift to the finish. Drink now.,87,Winery of Good Hope 2010 Unoaked Chardonnay (Western Cape)
"A fine vein of graphite extends through this bold yet refined Bordeaux-style red. It's robustly fruity, bursting with cranberry, red cherry and raspberry flavors, but enticingly savory as well, nuanced by hints of leather and balsamic vinegar. Dense tannins should smooth out between 2018 and 2020.",90,Benmarl 2014 Slate Hill Red (New York)
"This luminous Nebbiolo from the mountain vineyards of Valtellina opens with a pretty fragrance of rose petal, red berries, baking spice and a whiff of crushed rock. The understated palate delivers ripe wild cherry, cinnamon-spice, licorice and a mineral note alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2017.",88,Nera 2011 Grumello Tirso  (Valtellina Superiore)
"A blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Bianco, this has a delicate fragrance of white flower and orchard fruit. The vibrant palate offers yellow apple, citrus and a touch of mineral while crisp acidity provides the framework.",87,Marchesi de' Frescobaldi 2013 White (Pomino)
"Hearty black plums, smoked beef and violets meet with rust, crushed rocks and a little dried sage on the nose of Russell From's blend of 45% Grenache, 35% Syrah, 18% Mourvèdre and 2% Tannat. Intense and dark blueberry-blackberry fruit shows on the palate along with elegant herbs and spices, from bay leaf and thyme to powerful black pepper. This wine is an attention-grabber for sure.",95,Herman Story 2013 Casual Encounters Red (California)
"The poised, clean and lifted wild black-cherry fruit mixed with notions of cocoa forms the aromatic theme. A very elegant wine, with medium body and alluring depth, it's currently tight and held firmly by structured, ripe tannins, while the acidity is bright and refreshing. With its youthful primary fruit, this is charming, but even a year or two will make this more pretty than it is right now.",93,Anton Bauer 2011 Reserve Red (Wagram-Donauland)
"Stainless steel fermented and bone-dry, this leesy, creamy wine balances lime, lemon and grapefruit flavors. Those citrus notes roll through richer dried apricot tones and into a balanced, persistent finish. Drink now and over the next two years.",91,Abacela 2016 Viognier (Umpqua Valley)
"Marchesi Fumanelli delivers a spice-forward Amarone with great intensity and a broad, far-reaching approach. There are aromas of cherry, blackberry cardamom, cumin and cinnamon. The wine is slightly raw and very sweet in the mouth.",89,Marchesi Fumanelli 2003  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"Dark-skinned berry, leather, coffee and baking spice are some of the aromas you'll find on this solid red. The chewy palate doles out ripe black cherry, blackberry, cocoa and vanilla framed in robust tannins. Drink through 2018.",90,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano 2010 Sanct Valentin Lagrein (Alto Adige)
"Dark in color, with mineral, leather and balsamic notes. With 20% Garnacha, this wine spent six months in oak and it comes on like a saturated, beefy youngster with ripe, healthy plum and other black-fruit flavors. Lasting on the finish, with body and structure. The fact that it doesn't overreach is a virtue.",87,Heredad Ugarte 2006 Heredad Cosecha  (Rioja)
"Oaky toast and salty, firm acidity give this wine a flavor profile of lemon, apple and dried herb that's lengthy and full of complexity. Medium bodied, it finds balance between fruit flavors and a savory edge, remaining bright and rich on the palate.",91,Pride Mountain 2015 Vintner Select Cuvée Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"A dry, firm wine, with light fruits and a perfumed smoky character. It is developing in a dry, black currant, stalky style.",85,Château Grand-Maison 2008  Côtes de Bourg
"Although this Cab is very dry, it's a bit astringent, with hard, edgy tannins and blackberry fruit flavors that veer into raisins. At its best now, so drink up.",85,Huge Bear 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"A delicate, lacy style of Pinot Noir, with pretty rhubarb-like herbal shadings to the cranberry and strawberry fruit, extremely supple tannins and hints of cocoa and coffee on the abbreviated finish. Drink now.",86,The Crater Rim 2010 Pinot Noir (Canterbury)
"Ripe pear shot through with savory notes of lovage and yeast create an appetizing nose. The palate holds the same savory dimension but is streamlined by welcome, citric freshness reminiscent of grapefruit peel. A phenolic component makes for real mouthfeel and texture—one of the characteristic joys of Grüner. This is a tight little bomb waiting to go off. It will do so in great fashion from about 2018.",94,Eder 2013 Süssenberg Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"This value-priced Syrah is meaty, leathery and spicy smelling, which can be typical for the variety. The palate is a bit shrill and acidic, while narrow flavors of red berries, herbs and minty green settle on a lightly herbal finish.",85,Viña Requingua 2011 Puerto Viejo Reserve Syrah (Curicó Valley)
"This doesn't have the same floral notes on the nose as the other 2014s from Escarpment, but instead offers aromas of baking spices, vanilla and black cherries. In the mouth, it's crisp and medium in weight—not the most generous wine right now—but the tart, lingering finish suggests it should age well. Try after 2018.",90,Escarpment 2014 Te Rehua Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Martinborough)
Here's an everyday wine to drink with burgers and such. Tastes like an inexpensive wine served in a fast-food restaurant.,82,Stefania 2007 Haut Tubee Red (California)
"Blackberries, anise, violets, lilacs, plum skin and vanilla show on the nose of this bottling. The palate shows lots of crushed peppercorns, tart elderberry and boysenberry fruit, and then a complex herbal array of tarragon, dried mint and bay leaf.",92,Falkner 2013 Rock Creek Vineyard Syrah (Temecula Valley)
"Instead of brawn and muscle, this ruby Ripasso offers elegance and finesse. The nose is redolent of polished black stone, Indian spice and loads of dried cassis and wild berry. There's a playful hint of sweet almond and cinnamon at the end.",88,Gamba 2007 Le Quare  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
"While this wine is full, it has an indistinct character. A soft texture and only light fruitiness leave a dull impression.",84,Gerald Talmard 2016  Mâcon-Chardonnay
"Thomas Fogarty's Bordeaux project unleashes aromas of black pepper, Bing cherry and cedar in this wine that proves light, airy and vivacious. Flavors of black and sour cherry dominate the acid-driven palate, which picks up more pepper and is quite easy going down.",88,Lexington 2011 Gist Ranch Estate Cabernet Franc (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Smells superripe and overly extracted, with jammy, fruit-tart aromas underscored by earthy, herbal notes of tobacco and sage. It's a big wine, and a little awkward, but it might knit together in the cellar. —S.H.",86,Seven Lions Winery 2000 Poor Man's Flat Vineyards 100 Year Old  Vines Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"Aromas of French oak, roasted coffee bean, dark berry and menthol lead the nose. The ripe, full-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, licorice and a toasted note alongside assertive, close-grained tannins. You'll also notice the heat of evident alcohol that throws the finish off balance.",88,Bersano 2010 Badarina Riserva  (Barolo)
"This opens with earthy aromas of mature plum, underbrush, scorched soil and a funky whiff of game. On the round straightforward palate, a note of ground pepper adds depth to a core of dried black cherry.",87,Il Feuduccio Di S. Maria D'Orni 2010 Ursonia  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo)
"A touch creamy and milky on the nose, with shy tropical aromas in support. The palate shows warm-climate melon and peach flavors on a round, chunky frame. A mild, innocuous wine if there ever was one. Drink as soon as possible.",84,Finca El Portillo 2007 Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Uco Valley)
"This smells strange, with a mix of herbal blueberry, leather and green tobacco aromas. An awkward, fiercely tannic palate leads to herbal, minty flavors of boysenberry and blackberry that finish with dry, abrasive tannins.",83,Zorzal 2012 Tempranillo (Navarra)
"Exotically floral on the nose, the prettiness of this wine follows through on the palate, salty and high in acidity, with a tang of lemon peel and lemon verbena. Focused and fresh, it has body and weight within that context, ultimately finding a balance that persists on the lengthy finish.",94,Lucie 2015 Dutton Ranch Dutton Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"With its apricot and bitter orange flavors, this wine has great concentration, botrytis character and richness. Acidity lends balance to all its beautiful honey notes and intensity. Drink from 2023.",97,Château de Rayne Vigneau 2014  Sauternes
"Faint red apple and lemon scents show on the nose of this wine. Its soft, easy palate, enlivened with slight spritz, shows the same appetizing, freshly-cut red apple fruit. Light-bodied, charming, easy and fresh.",89,Bründlmayer 2016 Langenloiser Zweigelt Zweigelt (Niederösterreich)
"The aromas of clove, flowers, black olive and spice are bright, followed by penetrating notes of boysenberry and plum. The palate is supple and in feel, showing concentration but still elegance to the fruit flavors.",89,Gård 2013 Lawrence Vineyards Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a very fine from the great Port estate. With dark tannins, a mineral texture and rich fruits it is a real Douro wine. But there is also a great sense of elegance that may come from the property's Bordeaux management team. Put the two together and you have a great wine that will age well. Drink from 2019.",95,Quinta do Noval 2014 Red (Douro)
"With wood and white stone fruit in fine balance, this is a ripe, full wine, the acidity lighting up the ripe flavor. The wine has a broad character, ready for drinking in a year.",91,Morey-Blanc 2007 Charmes Premier Cru  (Meursault)
"There's a cantaloupe-like ripeness on the nose of this blend of 37% Grenache Blanc, 33% Viognier and 30% Roussanne, but not overdone, layered with seared white peach, caramelized pear, poached apple and almond aromas. The palate is more restrained and quite grippy, with flavors of green-apple skins, Bosc pear and a touch of honey.",91,Jada Vineyard & Winery 2014 XCV White (Paso Robles Willow Creek District)
"This blend of 75% Sangiovese, 20% Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Colorino opens with aromas that recall underbrush, woodland berries and tobacco leaf. The bright palate delivers tart sour cherry punctuated with white pepper and clove alongside supple tannins. It's already very drinkable so enjoy soon.",89,Castello di Poppiano 2010 Riserva  (Chianti Colli Fiorentini)
"Feline aromas—nothing unusual for Rueda Verdejo—are coupled with notes of briny apple and citrus. Fresh and easy on the palate, green-leaning citrus flavors finish tangy and slightly salty.",89,Vetus 2015 Flor de Vetus Old Vines from Segovia Verdejo (Rueda)
"Aromas of citrus zest, orchard fruit and a hint of toasted walnut lead the nose. The palate includes mature peach, pear and mineral alongside bright acidity. A hint of hazelnut signals the close.",88,Terredora 2015 Loggia della Serra  (Greco di Tufo)
"Herbal, olive-infused aromas of berry fruits and plum are restrained and typical of Chile. This feels round and nonaggressive, while roasted flavors of cassis and plum come with a hint of minty green. On the finish, bell pepper and black pepper flavors are familiar. This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Carmenère and Cab Franc shows Chilean DNA from nose to finish. Drink through 2017.",90,Leyendas de Familia 2009 Magia Negra Ensamblaje Red (Maule Valley)
"Tightly wound and acidic, with forceful red-berry flavors that are spicy and zesty. Finishes a little on the raw side, with cranberry notes and a hard crescendo. Tempranillo with Garnacha and Cabernet.",83,Bodegas Julián Chivite 2004 Gran Feudo Crianza Red (Navarra)
"Meaty and spicy, this wine is in an early stage of development. It has dark tannins that have an extracted, tough character. However, the weight of ripe fruit is all there, promising a rich and concentrated wine for the future. Drink from 2020.",92,Château Bouscaut 2012  Pessac-Léognan
"Although this wine is listed as a white blend, the producer says the variety is Vernaccia, not found often in California. Light in alcohol and approach, it opens in a bouquet of waxy apple and Meyer lemon, followed by a medium-powered palate of pear. The finish is crisp and lean.",90,Paro 2014 Santo Giordano Vineyard Belle Torrette White (Carneros)
"Ripe and wood aged, this is rich with ginger and tropical fruit flavors. Dense and concentrated, it is a full-in-the-mouth wine—powerful and very ageworthy. Give this five years.",93,Château de Fuissé 2010 Vieilles Vignes  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
"Snappy cool-coast aromas of wet stones and green fruits are pungent but not over-the-top aggressive. This is friendly on the palate, with moderate acidity. Flavors of green apple, lime and scallion finish mild and clean. Drink during 2016.",89,Casa Silva 2015 Cool Coast Sauvignon Blanc (Colchagua Valley)
"Aromas of dark-skinned berry, moist earth and a balsamic note of menthol waft out of the glass. The tart, vibrant palate offers sour cherry and star anise framed in racy acidity and austere tannins.",87,Vignamaggio 2013 Gherardino Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"This is an intense, dense Sauvignon Blanc, full of concentrated lemon zest and green herbs. It has a young, mineral texture, while possessing a nervy acidity.",87,Patient Cottat 2011 Le Grand Caillou Sauvignon Blanc (Val de Loire)
"Alicante is making huge inroads in Tuscany. In the warm climate of central Italy this shows bright berry aromas, with touches of spice, leather, cola and menthol. The palate is bright, fresh and cleansing.",89,Fattoria Mantellassi 2007 Querciolaia  (Maremma)
"Cabernet Sauvignon gives this wine a luscious, elegant mouthfeel, with classic currant and cedar flavors. Syrah brings a gamy, leathery note, with white pepper accents. The result is an interesting, complex young wine of power and authority. Drink now.",92,Treana 2004 Red (Paso Robles)
"This wine displays all of the intensity of expression of Cold Creek. Aromas of toasty spices and pear are light but lead to a full, rich-feeling palate, with the acids providing a perfect counterbalance.",91,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2012 Cold Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Ginger ale and Sprite are the first things that come to mind when you give it a sniff. The palate shows ripe and sweet orange, tangerine and pink grapefruit, while the back end is lean and citrusy but far short of complex. Good in a standard way.",87,Codorníu NV Reserva Raventós Brut Sparkling (Cava)
"Stainless steel fermented, off dry (35 g/L residual sugar) and low alcohol, this is a perfect spring/summer quaffing wine. Crisp apple fruit and a refreshing texture keep it light and interesting.",88,Lujon 2012 White Riesling (Willamette Valley)
This is a very pretty example of Negroamaro that has been shaped by warm oak tones of vanilla and spice. It's elegant and soft and delivers loads of succulent spice notes throughout.,90,Tormaresca 2005 Masseria Maime Negroamaro (Salento)
"Seductively rich and powerful but also refined, this opens with aromas of ripe berry, orange zest, exotic spice and leather. The firm, juicy palate delivers crunchy red cherry, crushed raspberry, anise, mineral and pipe tobacco alongside polished tannins. Drink 2016–2032.",93,Passopisciaro 2012 Contrada G Nerello Mascalese (Terre Siciliane)
"Odd and unusual aromas of murky fruit and clove are matched on the palate, which tastes of fake oak, clove and little else. This Pinot seems more artificial than natural.",81,flipflop NV Left Coast Pinot Noir (Chile)
"Aromas of ripe plum, sunbaked earth and toast lead the way on this structured red. The palate offers dried black cherry, ground pepper and toasted oak while dusty tannins give it a firm, slightly astringent finish.",89,Baglio di Pianetto 2010 Cembali Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"This is dilute to the point of being thin, showing pale flavors of apple and underripe peach. A plastic note runs through it also. Tasted twice with consistent results.",86,Soléna 2013 Domaine Danielle Laurent Chardonnay
"Powerful and rich, this wine tastes of black and red berries. The ripeness of the vintage is evident, with a dense character that lends weight and concentration, while adding fresh black-currant-like acidity.",87,Château La Maroutine 2009  Bordeaux
"Deeply golden in color, this opens with aromas of dried chamomile flower, hay, lightly toasted oak and a butterscotch note. The palate delivers dried apricot, mature apple, candied ginger, mineral and almond alongside racy acidity.",88,Inama 2013 Vigneti di Foscarino  (Soave Classico)
"There's a fair lick of dried wood notes on this straightforward sipper. The fruity strawberry and blueberry core is plush and pleasing, as is the soft grip of tannins at the backend.",86,Hardys 2014 Stamp of Australia Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)
"This relatively small estate in the Awatere Valley continues to impress. The tomato leaf character of the region comes through loud and clear without being overbearing, being balanced by passion fruit and gooseberry flavors. It's reasonably full in body, yet finishes spicy, prickly and refreshing.",91,Eradus 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Awatere Valley)
"Sweet, surprisingly soft for its age, this shows light wood tannins, spice and dried fruits, followed by just an edge of the spirit. It is fresh, elegant, a pleasingly perfumed wine, but not exciting.",87,Burmester 1963 Colheita  (Port)
"The Côte Est Pinot Noir is more structured and less immediately accessible than the winery's Rocheux bottling, but ultimately may prove to be the better bottle. It offers tightly woven, chewy fruit flavors of black cherry, black raspberry and plum, along with darker streaks of clove, leaf, smoke and earth. As always, the wine is structured with elegant precision.",92,Le Cadeau 2006 Côte Est Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"A bouquet of blackberry, violet and subtle rose petal is the precursor to rich flavors of cherry, blackberry, strawberry, clove and mint. A blend of Syrah and Merlot, this offers a chewy texture and refreshing astringency that carries through to the velvety finish.",89,Suvla 2011 Sir Red (Thrace)
"This all-Italian expression of Sylvaner shows beautifully delicate floral and exotic fruit aromas wrapped within a light, fresh bouquet. The wine's smooth, silky, slightly oily texture reinforces its feminine feel.",88,Strasserhof 2010 Sylvaner (Alto Adige)
"The earthy and leafy aromas are akin to Chilean Merlot. The plum flavors are attractive but there's also an indistinct berry/tomato taste that lowers the bar. A smooth, round, carefree wine better geared to casual parties than contemplative sipping.",84,Corbett Canyon 1997 Reserve Merlot (North Coast)
"Candied red and purple fruit meets mocha and cola spice on the nose of this bottling, which is approachable and simple. The palate is tart with cranberry and plum skin flavors, lifted by dried ginger spice.",87,Steele 2013 Goodchild Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
"Dark pink-red in color, this wine has a ripe, sugary nose and a high-octane entry. It grows up to be tangy in citrus peel and fresh grapefruit and cherry, finishing dry.",87,Peter Cellars 2014 Estate Rosé of Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"This blend of Syrah and Malbec was sourced from the estate's Doc Stewart Vineyard. Light, tart rhubarb and watermelon flavors show an accent of mocha. Drink up.",85,Gilbert Cellars 2008 the pilgrim Red (Wahluke Slope)
"This small-production Pinot is ripe and intense. It immediately strikes you with the sheer opulence of its cherry and blueberry flavors. But the structure is immaculate, with pure, refined tannins, plus bright, zesty acids. It has a lot of alcohol, and the wine is a bit warm, but Pinot-friendly foods like steak and lamb will help to balance it. Drink now–2016.",93,Cambria 2010 Barbara's Clone 667 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"Sweet, ripe tannins are embraced by a soft texture and touches of black pepper in this multiple appellation wine. Robust, if not bordering on crazy ripe, it needs food to find itself fully.",86,St. Francis 2013 Three Valleys Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
"A festive, elegant Pinot for drinking  now with fine fare, such as lamb, steak, salmon or tuna. It's crisp, silky and dry, yet there's a core of ripe raspberry and cherry essence enriched with toasty oak.",90,Domaine Chandon 2010 Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"A straightforward, medium-bodied wine that's not fussy, this offers generously expansive flavors of apple skin and pear, veering toward the tropical end of the fruit spectrum on the finish.",86,Roche 2013 Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Fragrant and floral with exotic figueroa, orange and peach scents, this wine is a feast for the senses, playing out on the palate with high-toned acidity, anise flavor and oak.",88,Fog Crest 2014 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Shows Sangiovese's bright cherry and cola flavors and mouthwatering acidity, in a light, silky texture. It's a good, dry, savory wine, but a little one-dimensional. Drink up.",86,Acorn 2010 Alegria Vineyards Sangiovese (Russian River Valley)
"A healthy portion of new oak blends beautifully with the variety's inherent tannins in this full-bodied wine. The two influences meld with each other rather than pile on. It has that sweet-seeming oak perfume, like cedar, vanilla and cinnamon, followed by vivid red cherry and raspberry flavors with new leather accents that linger through the finish.",91,Muscardini 2012 Pauli Ranch Sangiovese (Redwood Valley)
"Off dry and fruity, this simple wine tastes like peach juice, with a bit of citrus. It's pleasant but one-dimensional.",86,Cuckoo's Nest 2014 Aromatique Viognier-Gewürztraminer (Oregon)
"Lightly creamy in the mouth, tasting of wet stone and crushed apple, this young wine seems to gain weight as it runs through the palate. The scent and flavor of peanuts permeates the finish. Showing fine definition and length, it should continue to improve with an additional year or two of bottle age.",90,The Eyrie Vineyards 2015 Pinot Blanc (Dundee Hills)
"Fresh and not too oaky on the bouquet, with apple comprising the fruit element. Feels full and a bit rich, with plump, sweet flavors of apple touched up by spice. Turns stickier and more sweet on the finish, but overall this is a very solid Chard for the money.",88,Finca Vides 2011 Torcidas Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"Aromas of tilled earth, truffle and woodland berry lead the nose. The lively, straightforward palate offers up juicy wild cherry, cinnamon and clove alongside soft, polished tannins. Simple but well made, it's ideal for everyday.",86,Villa Calcinaia 2013 Piegaia  (Chianti Classico)
"Hints of bramble and smoke add savoriness to fresh apple and pear flavors in this almost-dry Riesling. The palate is piercingly high in acidity, but zesty lemon and lime flavors are bright and invigorating.",89,Bischöfliche Weingüter Trier 2013 Feinherb Riesling (Mosel)
"From a 250-acre vineyard on the slopes of the Entre-deux-Mers above the Garonne river, this wine is silky smooth, attractively balanced with wood and soft but dry tannins. Flavors of dark chocolate, black plums and spice from the wood all blend together well. To finish, there is good acidity.",88,Château les Hauts de Palette 2005  Premieres Côtes de Bordeaux
"Scents of leather and turbinado sugar surface on the nose first, which are offset by accents of blackberry, forest floor and pepper. The medium-to-full palate feels supple and expansive, until the finish where the tannic muscle kicks in. Overall, the flavors are intense and juicy but come with an edge of prune.",86,North Gate 2010 Meritage (Virginia)
"Apple and mild spice aromas precede a blocky, wide, almost thick palate that foams up with palate contact. This tastes toasty and baked, with melon and apple notes sitting on top of a full, round, somewhat flat-feeling finish.",85,Codorníu NV Anna de Codorniu Brut Sparkling (Cava)
"Made by the Tari family who used to own Château Giscours in Margaux, Bordeaux, this wine with its 18 months wood aging shows a great understanding of red-wine making. Firm and tannic, almost totally from Mourvèdre, this dark and brooding wine is nowhere near ready to drink. The organically grown grapes give a purity of fruit that cuts through the tannins. Don't drink before 2018.",95,Domaine de la Bégude 2012 La Brûlade Red (Bandol)
"Here's a curious Recioto with aromas of green olive and caper backed by blackberry and some distant spice. Sweetness and succulence push the wine forward over the palate but those green, herbal notes appear once more on the close.",83,Brigaldara 2007 750ml  (Recioto della Valpolicella Classico)
"This is a very ripe, fruity Syrah, rich in raspberry, blueberry and cherry jam flavors, with hints of bacon and pepper. The acid-tannin balance is lovely, making the wine easy to like now.",88,Cimarone 2009 Reserve Three Creek Vineyard Syrah (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
"Made with organic grapes, this rosé is a blend of 30% Grenache Gris, 30% Grenache Noir, 30% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc. It's a dainty and floral selection, with forward scents of sweet pea, lavender, laurel and white tea. The palate offers some tart white cherry and currant fruitiness, with medium acidity and a subtle sweet-spice accent on the close.",86,Vignobles Jeanjean 2015 Domaine le Pive Gris Rosé (Sable de Camargue)
"The aromatic opening includes a forest-like note, plus mineral and earthy berry scents. The palate feels chunky and wide, with solid tannins that don't bite or dominate. Flavors of herb, olive, spice, molasses and cassis are typical for the Alto Maipo, while the finish is defined by racy acids that should allow this wine to age nicely for another five-plus years.",89,Undurraga 2010 T.H. Alto Maipo Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"A fascinating wine, it was processed in a carbonic fashion, in which the juice is allowed to ferment inside the mostly intact grape skins, much like what's done in Beaujolais. The result is a transparent, ruby red wine that offers scents of a dust storm mixed with crushed rock and chile pepper herbaciousness. It's warm and soft on the mouth with a presence that suggests something between peppercorns and bell peppers.",92,Alta Maria 2013 Carbonic Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"Aromas of leather, dried cherry, vanilla and leafy earthiness get this gran reserva moving. In the mouth, it's a touch choppy and wiry, with leafy, roasted flavors of savory plum and spice. This is shy on the finish, with a hint of spice and chocolate. Drink now.",89,El Coto 2004 Coto de Imaz Gran Reserva  (Rioja)
"White flowers, honey and toasted spice lead on this Riesling from New York, and on the palate, a backbone of elegant fruit prevails. Paired with the wine's sweet touch, the flavors offer a simple, appealing quaff that will pair well with spicy cuisine.",83,Anthony Road 2007 Semi-Sweet Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Brooding aromas of huckleberry, braised meat, flower and mineral lead to a full-bodied palate, rich with blue and purple fruit flavors that possess a supple seamless feel and a lengthy finish.",90,Col Solare 2014 Component Collection Estate Vineyard Syrah (Red Mountain)
"This blend of Sciaccarellu and Niellucciu is delicious and light—full of refreshing red currant flavors and crisp acidity. It's bright, fruity and ready to drink.",87,Domaine Poli 2016 Sciaccarellu-Niellucciu Rosé (Ile de Beauté)
"This is a good Pinot Noir. While it's not an ager because it's made for immediate consumption, it does show an elegant structure. Crisp acidity provides balance to the cola, cherry, pomegranate, spice and smoky vanilla flavors.",88,Mossback 2006 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Made from 75% Chardonnay and 25% Pinot Noir, with detectable residual sugar, this wine is moderately complex in its mix of peach, cherry and citrus flavor. The acidity is simple and direct. The palate is thick and creamy.",88,V. Sattui 2012 Prestige Cuvée Brut Sparkling (Napa Valley)
"Lightly scented, this opens with aromas of yellow stone fruit, citrus and a whiff of aromatic herb. The bright, medium-bodied palate offers creamy peach, mature green apple and a hint of nectarine while a mineral note fills in the juicy finish.",90,Villa Raiano 2015  Greco di Tufo
"A fresh wine, all berry flavors and ripe juiciness. It's a wine to be drunk young, just touched by tannins. Delicious and fruity.",85,Domaine Rotier 2008 Initiales Duras (Gaillac)
"Too ripe and too oaky, and both attributes reinforce each other. The blackberry and currant fruit approaches Port in raisiny ripeness, while the oak accentuates the tannic sweetness. Clumsy now, but sometimes these wines improve in the long run. Try holding until after 2013.",86,Janzen 2007 Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"An aromatically pleasing wine with notes of pear, apple and petroleum jelly. It's almost frizzante in feel and drinks dry with just a touch of residual sugar (3.6 g/L) sweetening the finish.",85,Sockeye 2012 Pinot Grigio (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Soft Honeycomb cereal, toasted apple skin and pear lead the nose of this accessible wine, with pleasant hints of fresh herbs. The palate is clean and light on its feet, with vibrant acidity that kicks up the ripe apple, orange and white melon flavors. Drink this balanced beauty now.",89,Eikeboom 2016 Bush Vine Chenin Blanc (Western Cape)
"This is the third separate cuvée of Grüner Veltliner from Reustle, and given the name (which means emerald), it's clearly meant to be modeled after the Austrian style. For those who relish a crisp, mineral-driven wine, with ripe fruit flavors of Meyer lemon, green apple and pink grapefruit, this rings all those bells and more. The length and definition are most impressive.",91,Reustle 2014 Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Umpqua Valley)
"Herbal berry aromas come with oak-based toast and maple notes. This feels pumped up and grabby, with rocky tannins and high acidity. Blackberry and chocolate flavors are forceful, while this Cabernet from a cool vintage shows lasting oak and herbal notes on a wiry yet bulky finish.",89,Viña Maipo 2013 Protegido Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"This wine is 100% varietal, all aged in once-used French oak. It's packed to the brim with black fruit, herbs, licorice, jalapeño pepper and barrel spices, with crystalline clarity to the aromas. There's plenty of depth and richness to the full-bodied flavors, with exquisite balance and a finish that lingers.",92,Gorman 2013 Old Scratch Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)
"Peach, cantaloupe, pear and a touch of citric zest characterize this expertly made white wine from southern Italy. Beyond the fruit aromas, you'll also pick up notes of white flower and mineral-flint that add dimension and complexity. Drink it well-chilled with seafood or white meat.",88,Feudi di San Gregorio 2005  Fiano di Avellino
"Citrus, yellow apple, orange blossom and saline aromas take center stage. On the palate, notes of savory herb accent creamy apple and pear flavors that are brightened by fresh acidity and a mineral note.",88,Casa di Grazia 2013 Zahara Grillo (Sicilia)
"Waxy and exotic with lychee scents, this is a bone-dry, nutty and meaty version of the variety, which has been grown by this producer since the 1950s. It's refreshing and complex—a perfect companion for the table or picnic basket.",92,Stony Hill 2015 Gewurztraminer (Spring Mountain District)
"A tremendous Cabernet, showing the authority of its vineyard, high up in the Vaca Mountains. Dry and full-bodied, this wine is spectacularly rich in blackberries, cassis and minerals and is well oaked. What's most remarkable is the quality of the tannins. They're firm, yet soft and sweetly refined. A tremendous accomplishment, and should develop in the bottle for a decade. At this price, an outstanding value.",96,Conn Creek 2007 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak)
"Full, juicy and ripe, this is rich with black cherry and red plum fruits that are textured with tannins and spice. The wine, while drinkable now, will be much better from late 2016 as it broadens out.",90,Vignobles Bulliat 2014  Moulin-à-Vent
"An absolutely delicious wine. It's like a fine Pinot Noir in the silky texture, yet deeper and bolder, almost Grenache-like, in the blackberries, cherries and currants, with tangy notes of oranges and vanilla. Dry and richly tannic, this is one of the few Sangioveses that's perfectly ripe and eminently drinkable. Drink now.",91,Cimarone 2007 Gran Premio Three Creek Vineyard Sangiovese (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Ian Brand's fun and wallet-friendly blend of 53% Grenache, 28% Syrah and 19% Mourvèdre offers an interesting nose of charred beef, anise, beets, red rose petals, hints of purple fruit and a judicious touch of asphalt. The dark flavors of black licorice, black pepper, pencil lead and dried violets surround a boysenberry core, but remain light on the palate.",91,L'Ptit Paysan 2012 Le P'tit Pape Red (San Benito County)
"This serious wine is young and still has prominent wood-aging flavors. That toastiness masks the ripe blackberry fruits that are underneath the tannins and wood. The wine will be fine as it matures, giving richness and dense fruits. Wait to drink until 2019.",89,Château l'Espérance 2014 Les Cèdres  (Côtes de Bourg)
"Toast, underbrush, fragrant blue flower and woodland berry aromas lead the way. The firm palate offers tart red cherry, licorice and baking spice alongside fine-grained tannins that lend elegant structure. Drink 2018–2024.",92,Paolo Scavino 2012 Cannubi  (Barolo)
"Light, fruity and sweet, this is classic Rosé d'Anjou. Bright strawberry fruits are softly linked with a crisp texture and acidity to finish.",84,Barton & Guestier 2011  Rosé d'Anjou
"There are lots of ripe, heady flavors of blackberry, dark chocolate, anise and exotic spice in this high alcohol wine. While it's a bit heavy by itself, it needs food to perk it up and coax out the richness. Grilled beef in almost any form is ideal.",86,Rosenblum 2010 Planchon Vineyard Zinfandel (Contra Costa County)
"Tasty and full-bodied, this is a wine you might mistake for a Chateauneuf, with its plummy, blackberry and spice flavors. Heavy for a Pinot, with thick but manageable tannins, but still a good, rich wine.",88,Masút 2001 Pinot Noir (Redwood Valley)
"Top-notch Malbec blended with other varieties gives Corte A a chance at greatness. In its current juvenile state, the wine is fresh, expressive and exotic on the nose, with mineral, licorice and spice in addition to a lot of driving berry character. The core is a touch racy and acidic, so this is no mushy fruit bomb. Instead it is serious wine with a lot of oak, polish and pizzazz.",92,Vistalba 2006 Corte A Malbec (Mendoza)
"This blend of 42% Grenache, 37% Mourvèdre, 16% Syrah and 5% Petite Sirah offers plum and mulberry aromas, with touches of thyme and sage. The palate delivers a similar range of dried fruit and wild herb flavors, showing dark strawberry and plenty of savory garrigue.",90,Cass 2014 Rockin' One Red (Paso Robles)
"Dried herb aromas are at the fore of this Cabernet; exotic spice, smoke, licorice and cherry notes follow. Cherry and chocolate flavors coat the palate, showing vibrancy, while a distinctive espresso note marks the finish.",91,Novelty Hill 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Red berry, crushed stone and herbs aromas open. The vibrant, polished palate delivers tart cherry, strawberry, tangerine and a hint of pastry alongside zesty acidity and small, persistent bubbles.",89,Cascina Chicco 2012 Cuvée Zero Rosé Metodo Classico Sparkling (Vino Spumante)
"With cherry, green herb and mint flavors, this Cab Franc is elegantly structured, but lacks the richness you want in a California Bordeaux-style wine.",85,Trinchero 2010 Central Park West Vineyard Cabernet Franc (St. Helena)
"Earthy, woody aromas of vanilla and dried red fruits filter into a raw, scratchy, acidic palate with plum, raspberry and medicinal flavors. On the finish, this wine is mildly oaky, with lively tartaric acidity driving racy, zesty length.",86,Viña Bisquertt 2013 La Joya Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"Flat aromas of lanolin and oily white fruits lead to a round, full palate that's getting tired. Salty nectarine and flowery flavors finish with a yeasty note of ham and white fruits.",85,Aymara 2015 Estate Torrontés (Maipú)
"This tastes distinctly sweet—like a cherry-and-chocolate confection—and the acidity is high. It's hard to predict where this is going, but it seems awkward now. Tasted twice, with consistent results.",86,Decades5 2009 Stagecoach Vineyard Petit Verdot (Atlas Peak)
"Underbrush, sunbaked earth, cured meat, menthol, toast and mature plum aromas unfold in the glass. The ripe palate is mature and offers dried black, cherry, truffle, licorice, espresso and a funky hint of game alongside firm but somewhat fleeting tannins that leave a drying finish.",87,Collosorbo 2011  Brunello di Montalcino
"A juicy blend of 86% Mourvèdre and 14% Grenache this is a bang-up value for subtle blueberry and crushed blackberry layers amid a sanguine, earthy core. Soft and medium-bodied, it has a distinct suggestion of licorice on the finish.",88,Courtney Benham 2011 Vin D'Eliza Grenache-Mourvèdre (Lake County)
"A wonderful wine, one of the best Petite Verdots in California, although the truth is there aren't all that many. It's sturdy in tannins and richly textured, with delicious blackberry flavors that are a little earthier and drier than Cabernet Sauvignon.",92,Kunde 2009 Limited Selection Petite Verdot (Sonoma Valley)
"Aromas of underbrush, tilled soil, toast and espresso lead the nose. The firmly structured palate offers ripe black cherry, blackberry, coffee, anise and grilled herb alongside assertive tannins that need to unwind. Drink 1016–2020.",90,Castello di Monsanto 2010 Il Poggio Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"A whiff of earth under tangy, young, grapy fruit leads into a tasty, easy-drinking Gamay with flavors of mountain berries. Firm, lemony acidity underscores the bright fruit. Drink this over the next couple of years while the freshness remains.",88,St. Hubertus 2012 Oak Bay Vineyard Gamay Noir (Okanagan Valley)
"A blend of 83% Merlot and 17% Cabernet Sauvignon, this robust red is juicy and smoky, offering tastes of blackberry, cassis and mocha. Dusty tannins give a heaviness, accented by black licorice on the finish.",88,Verse & Chorus 2013 Mat Kearney Red (Napa Valley)
"This wine doesn't appear to have fully come out of its shell, with light aromas of plum, tire rubber, pomegranate, herb and a dusting of spices. The flavors display a pleasing sense of purity, with lightly grainy tannins providing support.",88,Lagana 2014 Minnick Hills Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This is a delicately perfumed wine that packs a punch of refreshing fruitiness. It has intense, crisp acidity and ripe apricot and lemon flavors. It's textured and ready to drink.",86,Union de Vignerons de l'Île de Beauté 2016 Terra Santa White (Ile de Beauté)
"A lovely bottle of Pinot Noir, dry and silky and considerably lighter in body than most. Despite the lightness of texture, the wine is powerful, with succulent raspberry, cherry, Dr. Pepper cola, anise and white pepper flavors that linger long in the finish. Should develop in the bottle for at least six years.",93,W.H. Smith 2009 Marimar Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"From a 24-acre vineyard with vines aged from five to 65 years, this is an attractively fruity wine. Ripe apple flavors gain even greater liveliness from the twist of citrus zest. It is ready to drink with all its freshness.",86,Domaine Siret-Courtaud 2014  Quincy
"Standard all the way, but isn't that what we want from a $9 wine? The nose offers raspberry and strawberry aromas, while the flavors are generic but familiar, with a lean toward cherry and berry. Solid on the finish, and fairly intense as a whole. Imported by Clock Tower Imports.",86,Cruz Alta 2009 Malbec (Mendoza)
"A big improvement from the previous vintage, this pretty, salmon-hued wine is packed with subtle but flavorful fruit. Tart citrus and strawberry notes underscored with crisp, clean acidity make it refreshing and a real winner.",90,Rain Dance 2016 Nicholas Vineyard Estate Rosé (Chehalem Mountains)
"Herb and spice aromas mix with volatile notes. The flavors are light and elegant, but seem a bit faint.",83,Tucannon 2012 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Lightly aromatic with notes of yellow apple, pear and melon. It drinks off dry, with the sugar seeming out of place but followed by an extended finish with clarifying acidity.",88,Tsillan 2013 Estate Pinot Grigio (Lake Chelan)
"Notes of honey and yellow fruit give this wine both sweetness and softness. It has weight and a rich mouthfeel, powered by a warm and rounded texture. There is just a touch of dryness at the heart of what is otherwise a medium-sweet wine.",87,Willm 2011 Réserve Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"A youthful wine that is just packed with fruit. It is a blend of Trincadeira, Aragonez and Syrah. Juicy, ripe and rich with black plum flavors, it is a delicious wine already. Drink now.",88,Terras de Alter 2014 Terra d'Alter Red (Alentejano)
"A richly fruity wine marked by tropical fruit and spice aromas and flavors, and a rich, creamy texture. Has a slight burn in the mouth from alcohol and spice that calls out for food.",87,Fetzer 1998 Barrel Select Chardonnay (California)
"With its slightly sweet, jellied flavors of cherries, black raspberries, anise and vanilla bean, balanced with smooth tannins, this is a fun wine. It's easy to enjoy with almost anything that wants a medium-bodied red.",84,Surf Point 2006 Merlot (California)
"This open and fruity expression of Malbec is helped to softness by its ripe Merlot. The wine is floral, fruity and lightly touched by tannins. Red-fruit flavors and a crisp aftertaste add balance to this ready-to-drink wine.",86,Château de Gaudou 2015 Domaine de Gaudou Exception Malbec-Merlot (Côtes du Lot)
"All whole cluster fermented, this was given 22 months in neutral wood. It remains fresh and clean, with berry and cherry fruit flavors, and a moderately sweet candy impression. There's a touch of wet rock also, and a textural, persistent finish. Drink now through 2023.",91,Maysara 2012 Momtazi Vineyard Rumi Pinot Noir (McMinnville)
"If there is any criticism to be made of this wine, it might be that it is just too fruity. Waves of honey and tropical fruit coat the mouth, wonderfully balanced by zesty acidity, and while it is sweet and lush it never seems cloying or heavy. Delicious now–2015, at least.",92,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler 2009 Bernkasteler Badstube Spätlese Riesling (Mosel)
"A clean, fruity, tart bubbly with a lively mouthfeel and spicy fruit. A nice touch of licorice adds flavor interest, and the balance throughout is impeccable.",87,Pacific Echo NV Brut  (Mendocino County)
"Vanilla, plum, clove and leather wrap around softy layered tannin and oak in this simple blend of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Tempranillo and Carignane.",87,Tom Gore 2013 Field Blend Red (Alexander Valley)
"Crisp and fresh, this is a light wine that is dominated by red-currant fruits. It has considerable acidity as well as tannins. Fruity while lightly perfumed, it will be ready from 2018.",88,Château Tour de Gilet 2014  Bordeaux Supérieur
"An unexpected combination perhaps, but it works to give a fresh, flavorful wine, with soft tannins, juicy fruit and flavors of red cherries and vanilla. Not complex, and ready to drink now.",87,DFJ Vinhos 2004 Tinta Roriz and Merlot Red (Estremadura)
"Pressed white flower, nut and dried apricot lead the nose. The firm, structured palate offers baked yellow peach, candied citrus zest, toasted almond and mineral alongside bright acidity.",89,Lis Neris 2012 La Vila Friulano (Friuli Isonzo)
"This 100% Feteasca Alba has aromas of tropical fruits and lemongrass. It is medium bodied with good minerality and flavors of apple, mango, grapefruit and pear.",88,Vinaria din Vale 2013 Feteasca (Moldova)
"This light-colored, alert wine with melon and nectarine aromas is confident up front. Cleansing acidity is the driver of a juicy, tangy and lean palate. Crisp flavors of pie cherry, currant and rose water finish fresh.",87,Volver 2016 Tarima Rosado (Alicante)
"A touch of flinty smoke hovers above the glass and clouds other varietal aromas of citrus and fern that find ready expression on the dry, fresh palate. The slender body still has some smoky edges, defined freshness and a clean-cut finish.",90,Tement 2015 Steirische Klassik Sauvignon Blanc (Südsteiermark)
"Frothy and robust, this presents aromas of blue flower, ripe plum, fig and cassis that carry over to the palate, along with spicy blueberry. It's balanced with sharp acidity and hearty tannins.",87,Villa di Corlo 2013 Frizzante Secco  (Lambrusco Grasparossa di Castelvetro)
"Harvested at 40.16 Brix and retaining a whopping 255 g/L residual sugar, this wine shows a complex medley of notes ranging from fresh baked apple pie to apricot and cinnamon. It's thick and rich in feel with stone fruit and dried orange rind flavors persisting through the long-drawn-out finish.",92,Inniskillin 2007 Gold Icewine Vidal Blanc (Niagara Peninsula)
"From a high-altitude vineyard in the heart of the Douro, this is a fruity while well textured wine. With a strong mineral character that comes from the lees stirring during fermentation, it has both bright citrus fruits with acidity and a more tropical character. Drink now.",88,Magnum Vinhos 2013 Tom de Baton Branco White (Douro)
"Smooth, rich wine, with spice, red berries, firm tannins and a pure, juicy, ripe fruit character. The wine has structure and intensity. It could still develop.",90,Mas de Gourgonnier 2007 Red (Les Baux de Provence)
"Already drinking nicely, this offers generously ripened peach, candied lemon and pineapple fruits. The lush flavors are balanced against fresh, natural acidity, with little or no time in new oak apparent.",91,Evening Land 2012 Seven Springs Vineyard Chardonnay (Eola-Amity Hills)
"A problematic wine. It starts out with an inert aroma that's mainly caramelized wood. In the mouth it's sweet and simple, with cola, blackberry, Dr. Pepper and cocoa flavors, and some bitterness on the finish.",83,Lolonis 2005 Winegrower Selection Chase Vineyard Zinfandel (Redwood Valley)
Very slight notes of elderflower play around the crisp apple fruit. The palate is more mellow—its tart freshness countered by ample red apple fruit and the rounding effects of autolysis that highlight fruit and refreshment in every one of its prickles.,89,Ridgeview Estate 2013 Fitzrovia Rosé Sparkling (England)
"This wine strikes a nice balance between sweet and savory spice on the nose, with ripe fruit, prune and leather in the background. This is a velvety, warm, earthy wine with a broad aromatic delivery and bold Brunello style. It's smooth and round, without any of the sharp acidic accents you sometimes find in Sangiovese Grosso.",89,La Colombina 2007  Brunello di Montalcino
"Aromas of tomato vine, hay and passion fruit unfold in the glass. The crisp, linear palate offers white grapefruit, mango, a hint of oak-driven spice and mineral alongside bright acidity that leaves a clean finish.",89,Caldaro 2014 Castel Giovanelli Sauvignon (Alto Adige)
"Here's a creamy and sophisticated expression of Pinot Bianco from one of the best-suited territories for this particular grape. The wine offers layered tones of stone fruit, pear and white almond and boasts a very silky feel that rides long on the finish. It's an excellent wine.",91,Volpe Pasini 2006 Zuc di Volpe Pinot Bianco (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"Tart and sweet, like cherry and black raspberry Lifesaver candy, this blend of Italian varieties is distinctly rustic.",83,Brutocao 2006 Quadriga Hopland Ranches Red (Mendocino)
There's a really nice point of mature peach or apricot that emerges from the fragrant bouquet of this luminous and bright Pinot Grigio. That fruity note adds a sweet sensation to the nose followed by aromas of passion fruit and citrus.,86,Tommasi 2010 Le Rosse Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie)
"Warm, lightly baked aromas of plum, cherry and dust set up a layered palate with just enough acidity to keep this wine upright and steady. Flavors of loamy berry, earth and chocolate are rich, while the finish tastes oaky, with more than enough vanilla and toast. Drink now.",89,Luis Cañas 2006 Reserva  (Rioja)
"Nicely rounded in texture without being flabby, this is a lively, crisp white wine, well endowed with flavors reminiscent of melon, pear and lime. Perfect to drink now with most seafood dishes, or as an apéritif.",90,Zonte's Footstep 2010 Doctoressa di Lago Single Site Pinot Grigio (Fleurieu Peninsula)
"This wine is rich garnet colored, with flavors of pomegranate, dark plum and cranberry that excite the palate. Fruit forward, well-structured and thoroughly enjoyable.",89,Piližota 2009 Babić (North Dalmatia)
"This is bright in color and loud on the nose, where it's distinctly medicinal and minty, with a strong green component. The palate doesn't differ; it's gritty and heavy in feel, with forced, jammy flavors of mint, grass and bitter black fruits.",81,O. Fournier 2012 Urban Uco Tempranillo (Uco Valley)
"One of three Chardonnays named after the winemaker's daughters, the aromas draw you into the glass, with notes of lees, almond, melted butter, cream, peach and spice. All Clone 95, the tropical-fruit flavors are sweet, rich and layered. A touch of heat on the finish is the only thing that holds it back.",91,Morell-Peña 2015 Amylla Loren Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The wine is soft, smooth and full of rich berry fruits. The blend of Aragonez, Trincadeira and Alicante Bouschet gives a warm southern feel: ripe wine, sunshine and soft tannins. Wood aging has smoothed the bold fruits and created a full generous aftertaste. Drink now.",89,Herdade da Comporta 2014 Private Selection Red (Península de Setúbal)
"Everything about this Cab is out-sized. The color is black, the black currant and cassis flavors are mind-blowingly huge, the oak presence is strong, the tannins are thick, and the finish is long and spicy. It's nowhere near ready to drink. Give it at least eight more years to let the parts find each other and integrate.",90,Bello Family Vineyards 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Aromas of cellar floor, roasted herb, anise and toast come together on this. The straightforward palate offers cherry marinated in spirits and licorice while a note of powdered sage gives it a bitter finish.",87,Demarie 2012  Barolo
"An easy-drinking Sauvignon Blanc thats fermented in barrel and stainless steel, this has a depth of pear, tangerine and lime flavors. Creamy and rich, it will make a consistent companion to most fish dishes.",86,Murphy-Goode 2011 The Fumé Sauvignon Blanc (North Coast)
"A lively, spicy wine that shows ginger and nutmeg character, followed by ripe white pears. Beneath this vivid character, the texture is smooth, honeyed, deliciously ripe.",92,Château Doisy-Daëne 2006  Barsac
"Rubbery, sweaty, muted aromas lead to a dilute, fizzy palate. Prickly green citrus and melon flavors end on the vegetal side.",84,Bouza de Carril 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Bright fruit flavors of pear and tangerine light up the palate, set against tangy acids. A versatile, fresh and quite tasty young white wine, it's best enjoyed right now.",88,Wildewood 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"Structured and still remarkably young, this vibrant wine delivers aromas and flavors of ripe black cherry, cinnamon and licorice. It's balanced with bright acidity and youthfully austere tannins that need time to mellow out. Drink 2018–2033.",93,Sordo 2008 Ceretta di Perno Riserva  (Barolo)
"This medium-bodied white is made from the Trebbiano grape in a small area between Veneto and Lombardy. It has lovely fragrances of peach blossom and Spanish broom, while the palate delivers white peach and lemon pastry flavors. It finishes crisp and clean.",89,Zenato 2012 San Benedetto  (Lugana)
"With a blend that is half Cabernet Sauvignon, half Merlot, this is as rich as the year. The weight of fruit is borne by sweet tannins and layers of wood toast. There is a very dense dusty texture along with fine acidity and final blackberry fruit. It is for aging over the next 4–5 years.",92,Château Paloumey 2009  Haut-Médoc
"An intensely acidic wine, its tannins and spice acting as a foil to the freshest of black currant fruit flavors. It's definitely a cool-climate red. Screwcap.",86,Bründlmayer 2008 Ladner St. Laurent (Niederösterreich)
"The slightest hint of lemon zest on the nose leads into the light, crisp, dry palate. If it weren't for the friendly lemon notes, this would almost be neutral, but also clean. Slight spritz makes this slimline wine very easy to enjoy. Drink soon.",87,Graf Hardegg 2015 Veltlinsky Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"Light and steely, this wine offers mild flavors that lean tropical, like pineapple and guava. Those succulently ripe layers meet stone fruit and a medium-sized body, making for an enjoyable, food-friendly experience on the palate.",88,Clif Family 2016 Rte Blanc Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Full and rounded, this is a soft wine, more suited to food than as an aperitif. The apple and red currant fruits are textured and spiced with lemon zest and mandarin orange flavors, finishing with some richness.",86,Domaine Sainte-Marie 2012 Vie Vité Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This perfumed wine offers aromas of plum, flowers, orange peel, smoked meat and coffee. The blue fruit flavors are soft, focused and rich, lingering on the finish.",92,Stolen Horse 2012 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This offers aromas suggesting scorched earth, stalky underbrush, leather and steeped prune. The palate shows raisin, cassis and a hint of espresso alongside raspy tannins that leave an astringent finish.",87,Domìni Veneti 2012  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"Vibrant and easy-drinking, this delivers intense aromas and flavors of crushed strawberry, ground white pepper, clove and mineral backed up by a note of orange peel. Thanks to fresh acidity and smooth, supple tannins, it's made to be drunk young.",88,Planeta 2013 Frappato (Vittoria)
"Tropical fruit, passion fruit and lime aromas are a bit sweaty and suggestive of pine resin. This is low on spine and verve, meaning it's a touch flat and flabby. Briny nectarine and tarragon flavors finish with green notes of scallion and lime.",85,Emina 2014 Verdejo (Rueda)
"The nose seems lean and vaguely unripe. You get aromas of chocolate and green olives, and the most distant whiff of meat. Of course there's a great deal of oak, including American, which lends vanillin and smoky notes, but still an impression of leanness carries through in the mouth. It struggles to say the word “fruit.” It's also very tannic. That aside, it may soften and improve in time.",85,Newlan 1998 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"This Syrah-based blend is marked by bone-dry, unsweetened baker's chocolate and blackberry flavors. It's a simple, tannic wine to drink with simple fare, such as burgers.",82,Chocolate Box 2012 Red (California)
"Red fruits dominate a wine that is rich, full-bodied with a firm, tight structure. Round the firm texture there is a richer, ripe fruit character, dense and juicy. The wine can be aged, but it is ready to drink.",89,Real Companhia Velha 2008 Porca de Murça Reserva Red (Douro)
"Fragrant layers of cinnamon, toast and vanilla adorn this intensely ripe, fleshy red wine. Blackberry and plum flavors are ruddy on the palate, but brightened by a zip of acidity and fine, chalky tannins on the finish.",85,Standing Stone 2013 Saperavi (Finger Lakes)
"The nose is jammy and slightly medicinal at first, but then plum and berry aromas settle. This feels firmly tannic and mouthfilling, with baked berry and roasted plum flavors. The finish is hard and strapping, with excess power.",86,Ruca Malen 2010 Yauquen Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"A blend of fruit sources used for the winery's three single-vineyard wines, this bottling saw no new oak and is light golden in color with reserved notes of mineral, almond, pineapple and lees. Full bodied, rich and layered with a creamy feel, it's appealing now but should have a long life ahead.",92,Sixto 2012 Uncovered Chardonnay (Washington)
"This is a surprisingly dry wine that's all spice and lychee flavors without any hint of sweetness (not indicated on the label unfortunately). It has a light texture with notes of pepper and rosewater, along with some acidity on the finish.",86,Domaine Allimant-Laugner 2011 Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"A very firm wine, layering acidity, black currant fruits and dense tannins. It currently is dominated by its acidity and structure, needing several years to open out. But it's all there, a powerful, perfumed and textured wine.",90,Charles Joguet 2010 Les Charmes  (Chinon)
"As comfortable as an old shoe, the Grand Estates Chardonnay from Columbia Crest delivers broad, open flavors of buttered fruit – almost like biting into a slice of apple pie, crust and all. Hard to argue with it, all 160,000 cases strong.",86,Columbia Crest 2007 Grand Estates Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Attractive aromas of pear and coconut set the stage for clean, fruity pear and apple flavors. This wine is balanced, offering length on the palate and finish, but also defined flavors and freshness. By all indications it's well made, and best of all it tastes as it should. Best Buy.",86,Errazuriz 2000 La Escultura Estate - Reserva Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)
"The pungent aromas of grass, waxy lemon and canned corn on the nose are followed by more citrus and overripe melon on a palate. This is zippy and clean but finishes slightly bitter.",85,Smart Cookie 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"This is all about juicy, ripe fruit, tempered by freshness and a velvety tannin structure. Fleshy, ripe red and black cherry is expansive and open on nose and palate. A joy to drink and ready now.",90,Esterházy 2012 Blaufränkisch (Leithaberg)
"It is rare to find Tinta Barroca on its own. Normally it is used for blending in Port. Here, though, it is in all its ripe fruit glory, an attractive, relatively lightweight wine. It's for drinking now, with red berry fruits right to the fore.",87,Muxagat 2010 Tinta Barroca (Douro)
"This wine is herbal and grassy in character, with a strong Sauvignon Blanc element. It has spiciness, tangy with squeezed lemon and very fresh acidity. Drink from 2017. André Lurton has owned the estate since 1965.",87,Château la Louvière 2013  Pessac-Léognan
"Oaky spice aromas are up front on a nose that also shows berry and prune notes. This is fleshy and tannic in feel. Flavors of blackberry, wood grain and chocolate finish dry and firm, with wood-spice flavors.",88,Bracco Bosca 2016 Ombú Reserve Tannat (Atlantida)
"Deliciously varietal in its huge offering of white pepper and robust black and blue fruit, this well-crafted wine boasts a lithe texture that invites sip after sip. It remains light footed throughout the palate, yet with enough complexity and balancing weight before the refined finish gives a final hit of juiciness.",95,Dutton-Goldfield 2013 Dutton Ranch Cherry Ridge Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley)
"This is a dark, concentrated effort that shows its wood strongly. The tannins are firm and almost heavy, producing a wine that is intensely dry and will need many years to age.",87,Château Cissac 2010  Haut-Médoc
"Ripe, fruity and tannic, this shows lusty flavors of cherry and raspberry jam that finish sweet and spicy. The blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Zinfandel.",84,Mad Crush 2010 Red (California)
This was half whole cluster-fermented and neatly incorporates hints of earth and bark into its tart cranberry and pie cherry core. Its verticality and tannic power suggest it will age quite nicely through the late 2020s.,93,Patricia Green Cellars 2015 Freedom Hill Vineyard Dijon 115 Clone Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Gritty, green aromas are not really ripe or friendly. This is high in pyrazines and tastes peppery and largely fruitless. A sour finish with sweaty notes are as expected given the nose and flavors.",83,Salentein 2015 Portillo Estate Bottled Sauvignon Blanc (Valle de Uco)
"Initially shy, this eventually reveals aromas of citrus blossom, orchard fruit and grilled herb. The aromas carry over to the savory enjoyable palate along with citrusy notes.",88,Tenuta Grimani 2015 Farinaldo  (Soave)
Jammy black fruit and inky blackberry preserves open the bouquet of this syrupy red wine. The wine's texture is both dense and gritty.,85,Feudo Disisa 2007 Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"Pretty cherry fruit shows some spicy highlights, along with hints of leather. The funky aromas will be more pleasing to some palates than others. You make the call.",86,Division 2014 Les Petits Fers Gamay Noir (Oregon)
"Maderized and brownish-gold in color, this is oxidized on the nose, palate and finish. Heavy, chunky and dull in feel, it has sherried flavors and a clumsy, weak finish.",82,Arínzano 2010 Gran Vino Chardonnay (Pago de Arínzano)
"A cool coastal Pinot with powerful aromatics and silky tannins. Flavors veer toward sweet ripe cherries, with earthy complexities of tobacco and espresso. Dry and stylish, a youthful wine that's not built for the cellar, but is delicious now. A new label from Caymus.",90,Belle Glos 2001 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"Light in color and light-bodied in the mouth, this Grenache-based Rhône blend offers easy, sweet flavors of cherries, cola, vanilla and oak.",85,Foxen 2009 Cuvée Jeanne Marie Red (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Hot in the mouth and sweet on this finish, this blackberry, coffee and spice-flavored Zin is rustic. The sugary finish might pair well with a rich barbecue sauce.",83,Trinitas 2004 Bigalow Vineyard Zinfandel (Contra Costa County)
"Plenty of fruit aromas and flavors make this wine a pleasure to drink. It smells and tastes like ripe red and black cherries and has a broad, rich texture. Medium bodied, it maintains a good, tense acidity that keeps flavors going on the finish.",92,Phillips Hill 2013 Terroirs Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Gritty, slightly grassy aromas are low on fruit. This is light yet composed on the palate, with mild stone-fruit and melon flavors. Modest acidity and equally modest fruit flavors make for a mild easy finish. Drink immediately.",87,Gimenez Riili 2015 Buenos Hermanos Torrontés (Mendoza)
"Inkblot is Lodi winery Michael David's first Cabernet Franc, a relatively small production wine with MD's signature smoky, toasty coconut aromas, thick and raspberry jammy. Aged 15 months in French oak, it would be a hit with big wine lovers but doesn't exhibit Cab Franc's herbaceousness, which some people will be happy about, others will not. Includes small amounts of Cab Sauvignon and Petite Sirah.",86,Michael David 2009 Inkblot Cabernet Franc (Lodi)
Red cherries and jelly fruits highlight a wine that is ripe and soft. A hint of acidity puts the sweetness into attractive relief.,85,Bouchard Père & Fils 2006  Bourgogne
"Made from the Chambourcin grape and aged in Bourbon barrels from the A. Smith Bowman Distillery, this fortified red wine has bold notes of baguette, blackberry and brown spice, plus a mushroom inflection. Medium to full bodied, an oxidative tone of apple juice surfaces on the palate and predominates with time. The alcohol becomes fiery on the second half of the palate.",83,Philip Carter 2010 1762 Red (Virginia)
"Aromas of fragrant spring blossom, orchard fruit, hazelnut and bread crust lead the nose on this refined white. The elegantly structured palate offers creamy yellow apple, lemon drop and mineral alongside crisp acidity that leaves a tangy finish.",90,Torre Rosazza 2014 Pinot Bianco (Friuli Colli Orientali)
"With very slight oak, but aged on the lees, this Sauvignon Blanc has richness that outshines the underlying fruit, which suggests lemons and limes. The wine was not put through the malolactic fermentation, so acidity is brisk. Good job for a fancy wine at a decent price.",88,Easton 2008 Monarch Mine Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Sierra Foothills)
"A vineyard on the river plain of Saint-Émilion, Haut-Pezat has produced a wine whose full black fruits handle strong wood-aging flavors with ease. The result is a ripe wine packed with blackberry flavors and acidity that is filled out with the wood spice. The wine should age well, drink from 2020.",89,Château Haut-Pezat 2014  Saint-Émilion
"This has aromas of overripe black-skinned fruit, scorched earth and a funky whiff of barnyard. The rustic sensation carries over to the palate along with a bitter note. It lacks fruit richness while grainy tannins leave an abrupt, astringent finish. Tried twice and had the same notes.",85,Revello Fratelli 2011 Gattera  (Barolo)
"A very nice Sauvignon, easy to drink, and showing lots of style and elegance. Bone dry and zesty in acidity, it has citrus, tropical fruit and white pepper flavors, with a stimulating touch of tart gooseberry.",88,Carica 2010 Kick Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County)
"A somewhat unusual expression of Viognier with notes of lime, lime leaf, and white peach that seem more reminiscent of a Sauvignon Blanc. It's full bodied and viscous, ending with a bitter note.",86,Valley View 2011 Anna Maria Viognier (Applegate Valley)
"Made only in the best vintages, Cuvée Annamaria Clementi is Ca' del Bosco's flagship wine. This sparkler offers aromas of white flower, pastry, stone fruit and a hint of oak. The palate delivers apricot, peach and candied lemon layered with subtle oak notes. The wine closes on a dry note of toasted almond.",90,Ca' del Bosco 2004 Cuvée Annamaria Clementi Sparkling (Franciacorta)
"Dry and steely in focus, yet ebulliently fruity and floral on the nose and palate, there's so much dimension to this fantastic Riesling. Intensely ripe stonefruit flavors leave an irresistible glycerine slick on the palate, but it finishes clean with a shower of crushed-stone minerality and steel.",93,Prinz Salm 2010 Wallhausen Felseneck GG Trocken Riesling (Nahe)
"This is pure Viognier, finishing in a moderately sweet, dessert-friendly style. There is a candied sensation to the mouthfeel, and the fruit seems rather thin. Light flavors of orange pekoe carry into a gentle finish.",86,Columbia Crest 2012 Reserve Late Harvest Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This shows rustic sensations of overripe black fruit, animal and hints of barnyard that contrast with harsh and astringent tannins.",82,Fattoria Carpineta Fontalpino 2010  Chianti Classico
"Scents of plum, orange rind, banana and a touch of mentholated herb unfold on the nose, while the palate offers fruit-skin flavors of plum and cherry, lending a slightly tannic structure.",85,Le Cirque 2013 Rosé (Côtes Catalanes)
"Shows some Riesling character in the petrol, honeysuckle and citrus fruit aromas and flavors, and that crisp Central Coast acidity makes it very bright and clean. It's a bit thin, but nice enough as an apéritif sipper.",85,Claiborne & Churchill 2007 Dry Riesling (Central Coast)
"Reserved aromas of lemon zest, shaved butter and wet stone greet the nose on this ready-to-drink bottling from West Paso. The palate shows poached apple and cooked pear tones, with a slightly sour tang keeping it lively.",87,Midnight 2014 Estate Chardonnay (Paso Robles Willow Creek District)
"Oaky and ripe, this Chardonnay shows barrel-inspired vanilla and buttered toast flavors that enrich the pineapples and apples. A touch of Gewurztraminer lifts it into floral and lychee territory.",86,Wente 2008 Riva Ranch Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco)
"Somewhat restrained aromas of dried cranberry and pomegarante mix with light herbs and spices on the nose of this bottling. It's vibrant, fun and easy-to-drink on the palate, where the simple red-fruit flavors make it perfect for the beach or poolside.",87,Francis Ford Coppola 2014 Diamond Collection Silver Label Pinot Noir (Monterey County)
"Smoky and oaky past the point of balance, this tastes of charred wood rather than fruit. The tannins are chewy and smoky. After considerable breathing time, blackberry fruit emerges. Aeration is highly recommended.",85,Kriselle 2013 Malbec (Rogue Valley)
"Pretty notes of Italian espresso, chocolate and spice revolve around a core of solid black fruit. This is an elegant and refined wine that boats a traditional style that is never overdone or too powerful. In fact, it showcases its delicate berry nuances very nicely in the mouth. Drink after 2014.",93,Fattoria dei Barbi 2004 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Officially launched in 2011, this is a fresh and fruity style of the classic fortified wine. Lively notes of strawberry and cream, white cherry and fresh bay leaf dance on the nose, while the palate boasts flavors of small red berry and vanilla spice.",87,Croix Milhas 2011 Grenache (Rivesaltes Rosé)
"A bit heavy handed, with lots of tannins and acidity, and the jammy cherry-berry fruit is in your face. It's made in a big, bold style that will appeal to fruit-forward fans.",87,Ortman Family 2008 Turner Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Earthy plum and stalky berry aromas are bolstered by bold oak aromas. This feels good and healthy, with spicy oaky flavors that are dry lactic and push the wine's fruit to the background. A woody spicy, minty finish ends this. Drink through 2017.",87,Ramón Bilbao 2012 Crianza  (Rioja)
"This wine is a rarity for Washington in a number of ways. It's 100% varietal, comes from Golden Ridge Vineyard, and saw just 20% new French oak. It offers appealing, luscious raspberry compote and herb aromas and flavors backed by lightly grainy tannins.",91,DaMa 2012 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This opens with variety's signature floral fragrance of acacia and jasmine, accented by tropical fruit. The flavors of creamy lemon, pear, tangerine and lime are accented with hints of dried Mediterranean herbs. This is linear and focused.",88,Collevite 2012 Villa Piatti  (Offida Pecorino)
"Merlot and Cabernet Franc make up the majority of this blend. The aromas of dried herbs, pencil lead, cherry and spice are subdued while the palate brings a somewhat elegant style, with the tannins seeming a bit bunched up.",88,Telaya 2013 Sruth Boushey Vineyard Red (Yakima Valley)
"Heaps of crushed black pepper meet with fresh and caramelized boysenberry fruit and beef char on the nose of this wine by Doug Margerum, who co-ferments his most hopeful lots from around the county into this annual blend. The cracked pepper shines on the savory palate too, giving spice to blackberry paste and crushed lavender flavors.",92,Margerum 2013 Über Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"This wine is produced solely with Nerello Mascalese grapes aged in terra cotta vessels and made with no selected yeasts or added sulfites. It offers concentrated black cherry, raspberry and licorice flavors accented with cracked black pepper and smoky mineral alongside big but velvety tannins. The warmth of alcohol marks the close.",89,Frank Cornelissen 2012 Munjebel Rosso 9 Nerello Mascalese (Vino da Tavola)
"Though light in color, this flagrantly floral expression of the variety offers a crème brûlée-like richness on the nose. The palate is a different story—all tart fruit, lifted acidity and gravelly minerality.",90,Sonoma-Cutrer 2014 Les Pierres Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"In the Boissonneau family since 1839, this southern Entre-Deux-Mers vineyard gives a crisp, herbal wine with light fruit and attractive acidity. It has lemon and grapefruit flavors, bright with a crisp aftertaste. Drink now.",85,Château de la Vieille Tour 2016  Bordeaux Blanc
"Earthy, spicy plum and berry aromas are racy and a touch leathery. Grabby tannins make for a drawing mouthfeel, while this tastes of herbal plum and wild berry along with chocolate and mint. A dry, lightly oaked but spicy finish provides for a good ending.",89,Valentin Bianchi 2014 Malbec (Mendoza)
"Slender poise and supercharged lemon are signaled with the first sniff. A pleasantly bitter note—think almond or Castelfranco—plays along the edges of the palate before riper, more generous yellow plum kicks in, always toned by that citrus freshness. Drink now to 2025.",95,F X Pichler 2013 Loibner Loibenberg Smaragd Riesling (Wachau)
"Extraordinarily rich and ripe, just explodes with cherry jam, crushed black raspberries and sweet toasted oak and vanilla flavors. But it's not a simple fruit bomb. Crisp acidity and a deep, fine tannin structure give it complexity and limited ageability. Good now and through 2012.",92,Harrington 2006 Brosseau Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chalone)
"Soft, low-intensity aromas of raisin, marzipan and cedar announce a wine that's not in the best of shape. This feels jammy and lacking in foundation. Flavors of loamy berry, prune and raisin finish with a note of licorice.",85,Señorio de Valdiestro 2008 Reserva  (Rioja)
"This vibrant, savory white opens with alluring scents of pear, tropical fruit and a whiff of fragrant white flower. The round, medium-bodied palate shows white peach, golden apple and mineral. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors while an almond note backs up the finish.",90,Selva Capuzza 2015 San Vigilio  (Lugana)
"This special waxed-top reserve bottling shows deep aromas of cedar and sandalwood along with black plum and allspice on the nose. Black cherry pops on the sip with lots of nutmeg spice, but it's the evenly distributed acidity and firm tannins that ensure a long life. Drink now through 2029.",94,Flying Goat Cellars 2014 Rita's Reserve Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"A well-balanced Chardonnay, this has flavors of tropical fruit, apricot and lemon candy, brightened by that famous Edna Valley acidity. This would make for a great apéritif.",87,Mount Eden Vineyards 2010 Wolff Vineyard Chardonnay (Edna Valley)
"This comes from a single vineyard—Folie Hill—and shows the pinpoint flavors that such wines can deliver. Cherries and milk chocolate, with light notes of dried herbs, sail across the palate. It's drinking well and needs no further cellaring.",88,Lundeen 2012 Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Alluring scents of apple and Alpine wildflower float over to the bright but slender palate along with notes of pear and mineral. Brisk acidity gives it a clean, crisp finish.",86,Franz Haas 2014 Lepus Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
"Bouncy, rubbery berry aromas come with latex and Band-Aid scents. A wiry, crisp mouthfeel sets up limited but spunky red-fruit flavors that are also a bit herbal and stalky. A briny finish shows juicy acidity but mediocre flavors.",84,Señorío de Sotillo 2013 Joven  (Ribera del Duero)
"This lovely blend of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah and Grenache is hearty and robust, with lavender, garrigue, black pepper and cinnamon aromas. Its velvety texture gives way to rich blueberry cobbler flavors peppered with firewood smoke notes, recalling a winter's night.",93,The Tribe 2015 Proprietary Red (Sonoma County)
"This is a robustly built, densely packed and velvety wine with smooth layers of integrated oak. Tannins provide the power and foundation behind its crisp blue fruit and dried herb flavors, seasoned with cola and black pepper spice.",92,FEL 2014 Hirsch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"A blending of one-third Pinot Noir gives body and raspberry-strawberry flavors to this rosé, while the balance of Chardonnay brings elegance, bright acidity and tantalizing notes of oranges and limes. It's a lovely wine to drink now.",90,Mumm Napa NV Brut Reserve Rosé Sparkling (Napa Valley)
"An unusual blend of Tempranillo and Ruby Cabernet, this New Mexico red blend is a touch overripe with soft, cooked prune and cherry compote flavors. Hints of violet and tobacco leaf are pretty, but overall, there's a flatness in the midpalate that could use some fine-tuning.",84,La Chiripada 2009 Vintners' Reserve Red Red (New Mexico)
"This lacks the smooth and sensual mouthfeel that's normal for Merlot. Instead, this is sharp, with a green flavor. While it's properly dry, it lacks richness.",82,Frei Brothers 2010 Reserve Merlot (Dry Creek Valley)
"Match this easy wine with brick oven pizza on sourdough crust or juicy grilled sausage. Made with the Dolcetto grape, the wine is loaded with bright fruit tones of blueberry and black cherry and offers a thick, creamy mouthfeel.",87,Clavesana 2008 Il Clou di Clavesana  (Dolcetto di Dogliani)
"Aromas of rose petals and fresh-hoed earth come to the fore as this wine opens, followed by fine-grained, intense tannins and savory wooded notes. Black pepper, red cherry, sea salt and dried herb pop at different times. It's still tight, so let this wine open in the glass or decant; better yet, cellar through 2023.",92,Siduri 2013 Hirsch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview)
"This barrel-fermented Sémillon deftly mixes smoky toast with rich and deep fruit flavors of melon and grapefruit. Exceptionally concentrated and full-bodied, it carries forward into this new vintage the well-established style of Ardenvoir's unique take on Washington Sémillon.",92,Ardenvoir 2009 Sémillon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Notes of apple, yellow peach and pear are savory in tone in this unoaked Chardonnay. Dry in style, it's delicately concentrated with soft tangerine acidity. The finish is brisk but clean.",86,Harbes Family Vineyard 2014 Steel Fermented Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island)
"This is rich and generously spiced, smelling and tasting like chocolate, vanilla, smoke and blackberries. Aging for 19 months in American and French oak certainly boosted the spices. It tastes full-bodied, very deep and almost sweet in flavor, with moderate tannins to lend some support.",88,Mettler Family Vineyards 2012 Epicenter Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi)
"Muffled, shy aromas are redolent of cherries, dried flowers and pear drops. Soft and rounded, the palate has a sweet quality about its core, with mild acids and a dusting of tannins.",83,Les Bourgeois NV Fleur du Vin Fruity Semi Dry Red (Missouri)
"By the sheer fact that this wine costs $6 and never really goes up in price, it holds onto its tenuous value status via clean tropical aromas and mild flavors of lime, pineapple and citrus. It's a touch hot and burning on the finish, but finish isn't what you're banking on with a wine like this. Imported by Freixenet, USA.",83,René Barbier NV Mediterranean White White (Catalunya)
"Made with 90% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% each Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this wine offers a bouquet of black cherry, green pepper and toast. There is a nice balance of fruit and cooling herb flavors, featuring blackberry, eucalyptus, anisette and espresso bean. Lingering, velvety tannins continue on the palate until a final burst of cranberry on the finish.",90,Tulip Winery 2011 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Galilee)
"Nicely focused, with a core of wild strawberry and black cherry, this bears herb and pepper highlights common to Oregon Pinot. It has a nice mouthfeel and is balanced throughout.",90,Gresser 2009 Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"This medium-bodied wine is fresh and fruity, but also polished and sophisticated. It smells like raspberries and black plums, then adds chocolate and blackberry in the flavors. Rich and flavorful it also has welcome firm tannins and fruit acidity to keep it lively. Grenache is the leading grape ingredient.",89,Fenestra 2010 Estate Infrared Red (Livermore Valley)
"This is a rich wine, with a texture that's comfortably cushioned by ripe cherry and plum flavors. It's a wine to savor now, full and fruity.",87,Georges Duboeuf 2013 Domaine Pignard  (Beaujolais)
"Clarendon Hills is best known for its Syrah and Grenache, but it is no slouch when it comes to McLaren Vale Cabernet. The 2008 Hickinbotham is full bodied and velvety in texture, with ample notes of cocoa and crisp cassis. Hints of mint and other herbal shadings give it varietal character and welcome complexity. Drink it over the next 10–12 years.",92,Clarendon Hills 2008 Hickinbotham Cabernet Sauvignon (Clarendon)
"Aromas of toast, oak, espresso and a whiff of rubber lead the nose and carry over to the firm palate, along with dried black cherry and oak driven spice. It's still tightly wound, with an astringent finish. Give it another year or two for the tannins to unclench then drink sooner rather than later.",88,Camparo 2011 Boiolo  (Barolo)
"A Right Bank Bordeaux-style blend, 45% Cabernet Franc and 55% Merlot. The fruit is marginally ripe but thin, and there is a watery character to the midpalate. Flavors of tart berries are set against lemony acids; tannins are insubstantial and the wine feels a bit weightless in the finish.",84,Lost River 2006 Cedarosa Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A velvety texture makes this varietal wine luxurious. Cassis, tar and clove notes mingle with dried herb and black olive flavors, all integrated and deliciously graceful. Its robust tannins soften as it progresses toward a long finish.",94,Nickel & Nickel 2014 John C. Sullenger Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"Funky aromas of farmyard, tire rubber and fetid flowers waft from the glass of this Nero d'Avola. The muddled palate offers stewed prune, overripe black plum and oaky vanilla alongside bitter, green sensations of old sage. Panebianco, Vinity.",84,Armosa 2008 Curma Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"Trisaetum produces both a dry and an off-dry cuvée from each of its three estate vineyards, as well as two versions of an Estates Reserve. Richer and bigger overall than the individual cuvées, this dry bottling is smooth and round, with a palate-pleasing blend of citrus flesh and peel, notably orange. There's tangerine and spice as well, and the wine continues bright and long through a most engaging finish.",94,Trisaetum 2014 Estates Reserve Dry Riesling (Willamette Valley)
"From one of the villages that lies behind the primary Chardonnay vineyards of the Côte de Beaune, this is already smooth, fruity and perfumed. It has attractive acidity and a rich, baked apple character that is pointed up by the layer of toastiness. Drink now, although the wine will be better from 2017.",88,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2013 Sous le Château  (Saint-Romain)
"Slightly sweet on the nose, but wheaty and grassy too. It tastes like clay and bubble gum, with a touch of peach and citrus. It's acidic on the finish.",80,Vinisterra 2011 Dominó Cinsault (San Antonio de las Minas Valley)
"Soft and ripe, this young wine is already to drink. Light tannins and a touch of spice give it just the right amount of richness from this good vintage. The wine is filled with red berries and is ready to drink.",85,Les Vignerons Réunis de Monségur 2015 Belle Prairie  (Bordeaux)
"Aromas of blackberry extract, leather, prune and a whiff of carob lead the nose and follow through to the dense palate along with a note of bitter chocolate. It's simple but well made, with solid, rounded tannins.",86,Villa Pozzi 2014 Nero d'Avola (Terre Siciliane)
"Aromas include white spring flowers, tropical fruit and a hint of graphite. The juicy palate offers green apples, white peach and melon alongside fresh acidity. Delicate almond marks the close.",87,Montonale 2012 Montunal  (Lugana)
"This is a rich, finely structured wine. It is highly perfumed, packed with black fruits and has a dark, firm texture. At the same time, the acidity is intense and the structure tight, suggesting a wine to age. Beautifully endowed with great fruit, it will take time to develop. Drink from 2026.",97,Vieux Château Certan 2014  Pomerol
"This is a perfumed, fragrant wine. Its acidity is offset by the red berry and currant fruits that add freshness to the dry, crisp character. It's a full wine, with good fruit depth and ripe flavors, and will be better with food. Drink now.",87,Jean Reverdy et Fils 2014 Les Villots Rosé (Sancerre)
"A decent value in New Zealand Pinot Noir, the 2008 Wild Rock displays aromas of bright if somewhat simple cherry fruit. On the palate, this is a medium-bodied, supple wine; the cherry and plum flavors show only modest complexity, perhaps a hint of hickory smoke. Drink now.",86,Wild Rock 2008 Cupids Arrow Pinot Noir (Central Otago)
"Honeyed lemon and white floral notes are bright,brisk and breezy on the nose and palate of this exceptionally refreshing off-dry Riesling. It's nervy with acidity and steely minerality, with a delicate spritz that gives the palate extra effervescence and vibe.",90,Dr. Hermann 2011 H Riesling (Mosel)
"Varietally correct aromas of cured ham, honeysuckle blossom and orange peel are fair and solid. This is a bit flat in feel, without much zest or snap. Flavors of green banana and lightly bitter green fruits fall off quickly on the finish.",86,Siegel 2016 Special Reserve Viognier (Colchagua Valley)
"Exceedingly dry berry aromas register as scratchy and woody. This is intense and grabby in feel, with minty strawberry and raspberry flavors that run heavy with oak. A minty, dry, peppery finish is a touch hot.",86,Telmo Rodríguez 2012 LZ  (Rioja)
"Full bodied and richly tannic, this gives lie to the notion that all Grenache-based blends are easy quaffers. Dried spices and mixed berries include hints of clove and cracked pepper, finishing with some dry, chewy tannins. The assemblage is 49% Grenache, 29% Shiraz and 22% Mourvèdre. Drink 2020–2030.",91,Yangarra Estate Vineyard 2013 G-S-M (McLaren Vale)
"A feminine, almost soft Pinot Noir, this opens nicely with scents of roses, red fruits, and pine forest. Despite its light color, it has plenty of grip and density in the mouth, even bringing some streaks of light milk chocolate into the finish.",89,Chehalem 2008 3 Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"The bouquet of this kabinett is so exuberantly floral and peachy, the delicate palate struggles to keep up. It's firm with minerality, but a bit soft in acidic structure. Finishes moderately long, with a honeyed, floral touch.",86,C.H. Berres 2011 Erdener Treppchen Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"White-fruit aromas and a prickly scent of cactus or nettle opens this tight, citrusy old-vines Verdejo. Matching the aromas, this tastes of pithy citrus, grapefruit and green herbs. A racy finish fades out nicely.",89,Vetus 2016 Flor de Vetus Old Vines From Segovia Verdejo (Rueda)
"Earthy game, truffle, underbrush, used leather and dark-skinned fruit aromas lead the nose. They carry over to the taut, tightly wound palate, where austere, dusty tannins leave a drying finish.",88,Belpoggio 2012  Brunello di Montalcino
"Representing a breathtaking advancement over the '07, Sinatra's 2008 Cab is simply delicious. It's fleshy and fat in texture, with a glyceriney richness that makes it almost oily and that, when combined with caramelized oak, turns into nougat. The blackberry, cherry and cassis fruit flavors rise to the occasion. This is truly a stunningly good Cabernet.",95,Sinatra Family 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Tight and tart, this is packed with concentrated, high-acid flavors of cranberry and raspberry. The wine is young and fresh, with both grip and depth, and should age nicely through 2019–2021.",89,Coelho 2012 Atração Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"While grapefruit and lychee aromas are fresh and clean on the nose, the palate of this full-bodied Gewürztraminer is a bit muted by comparison. It's texturally rich, but flavors suggest pressed apple and pear accented by hints of ginger and spice. Drink now through 2018.",85,Rooster Hill 2015 Estate Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes)
"This wine is ripe, packed with tropical fruit and rich acidity. A hint of vanilla has rounded the wine out, giving a full body to the delicious fruitiness. Opulent and generous, it is kept in order by final, aromatic acidity. Drink from 2016.",91,Terroirs et Talents 2013 Cuvée Claude Brosse  (Saint-Véran)
"Dark cherry and vanilla aromas swirl around crisper flavors of rhubarb in this tight, leathery wine made in a restrained, savory style. Made for the table, it'll suit many meals with versatile aplomb.",88,Stickybeak 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A light and fruity wine that has bright black fruits and an edge of tannins. The black currant and acidity give the wine its fruity character, typical of the vintage. Drink now.",85,Château Bellevue 2014  Bordeaux
"Pleasing aromatics send up a mix of cherry, black tea and clean earth. The wine is tannic and substantial, with ripe black cherry fruit and a streak of caramel.",92,Owen Roe 2012 Anna's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"This wine has structure and ripe black fruits. It is made to be drunk young, with plenty of berry fruits and soft tannins. Drink from 2019.",86,Quinta do Portal 2015 Tinta Barroca (Douro)
"Raw pastry dough, blackberry jam and vanilla aromatics are offset by cigar box and leather notes. Compared to Rappahannock's nonreserve 2010 Cabernet Franc, this wine feels warmer due to its alcohol, which is more than 1% higher than the nonreserve bottling. The palate is chewy and muscular, with flavors of dried rose petal and espresso that surface late.",87,Rappahannock Cellars 2010 Reserve Cabernet Franc (Virginia)
"On first take, this smells a bit chunky and like stewed plum. The palate is firm and tannic, with roasted plum and berry flavors that are more savory than fruity. On the finish, a spicy beef-jerky flavor vies for attention with raw tannins. Drink through 2020.",91,Bodega Furlotti 2011 Finca Adalgisa Malbec (Luján de Cuyo)
"This easy-going Prosecco opens with a fresh bouquet of white flowers, citrus, peach and talc powder. The mouthfeel is crisp, fresh and very informal.",85,Trevisana NV Santiquaranta Extra Dry  (Prosecco)
There's a deep smoky element here that is offset by bright tones of cherry and blackberry. This is a wine that would pair beautifully at an outdoor barbecue with hamburgers and baby back ribs.,87,Corte Lenguin 2007  Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso
"The almost 100-acre vineyard of Brillette is situated at one of the highest points in Moulis. Ripe and generously structured, this concentrated wine has layers of blackberry fruits and solid tannins. It will age well, with its fresh acidity and dry core. Drink from 2019.",89,Château Brillette 2013  Moulis-en-Médoc
"Part of a Limited Release series, this is an all-stainless Chardonnay. Ripe, tart and focused, it offers spicy bursts of yellow and green fruits, and it shows a sur lie-derived texture. The pinpoint details are gorgeous.",91,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2011 Unoaked Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This Malbec is lush with flavors of ripe blueberries, blackberry jam, mocha and cassis all wrapped up with toasty oak. There's fine acidity and rich tannins as well. It's one of the best examples of the variety in California, and endlessly enjoyable through a long, spicy finish. Kudos to winemaker/owner Kenny Kahn.",94,Blue Rock 2010 Best Barrels Malbec (Alexander Valley)
"A deliciously  crisp and fresh wine with some good concentrated fruit, but more attractive acidity. There is just a hint of spice, but freshness is what this wine is all about.",87,Machherndl 2006 Kollmitz Federspiel Riesling (Wachau)
"This SB delivers citrus peel, grass and other common varietal aromas. The feel is a touch flabby and soft despite modest acidity, while flavors of citrus fruits and green herbs finish round and long.",86,Michel Torino 2013 Ciclos Fume Sauvignon Blanc (Cafayate)
The crispness of this wine is balanced by the intensely ripe fruit. Together the wine has concentration as well as a bright texture that makes it refreshing. The wine is ready to drink.,88,Jean-Paul Picard 2015 Le Chemin de Marloup  (Sancerre)
"Powerful, concentrated wine, a very solid Cabernet-dominated wine. It has dark tannins, the black currant fruit still hiding in the background. Dark and dense, it's destined for good aging, at least over the next six years.",90,Château Tourteran 2010  Haut-Médoc
"This gorgeous sparkler offers enticing scents of white stone fruit and spring flower. Vibrant and silky, the smooth elegant, palate delivers crisp apple, creamy white peach and juicy nectarine set against bright acidity and an ultrarefined perlage.",93,Villa Sandi 2016 Vigna La Rivetta Brut  (Valdobbiadene Superiore di Cartizze)
"Rich and soft, this wine is all black fruit, soft tannins and fragrant acidity. It's already attractive, full of warm fruitiness, and can be drunk from 2015.",86,Casaleiro 2013 Red (Tejo)
"Notes of cedar, paper and leather carry to the cassis laden palate, with meat juices and a hint of plum. Light in weight, with talcy tannins, this wine is straightforward and an easy drinking entertainer.",87,Robertson Winery 2002 Cabernet Sauvignon (Robertson)
"A blend of typical Alentejo grapes, this is a firm effort, with the fruit laced inbetween the complex tannic structure. The acidity gives the wine a final lift.",88,Herdade do Esporão 2010 4 Quatro Castas Red (Alentejano)
"Fine fruits, red-berry flavors and crisp acidity give this wine a fine balance and immediate attraction. It is lively with its bright texture and finishing acidity. Drink from 2017.",86,Château Sainte Barbe 2014 Merlot du Château Sainte Barbe  (Bordeaux)
"Grippy in wound-up black fruit and black pepper, this is a ripe, bright and softly layered wine, completely in keeping with its old-vine status in dusty, complex notes. Spicy cinnamon and leathery pepper combine on the lengthy finish. Drink now through 2021.",92,Seghesio 2013 Old Vine Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
"Fruity in a grapy, plummy way, this is a substantial wine with deceptively sweet undertones that finishes dry and with a slight tang of black tea.",86,Ministry of the Vinterior 2013 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Big and dry, this wine shows the tannic, firm character of the vintage. It has a dark, dense core of wood tannins while the juicy black currant fruit is still developing. The wine needs to age, so drink from 2018.",88,Château Teyssier 2011  Montagne-Saint-Émilion
"There's a lot of funk and animal hide on the nose of this earthy Toro. The palate is so concentrated it's like syrup, while flavors of leafy, earthy berry fruits are accented by chocolate and pepper. This finishes toasty, oaky and spicy, but also heavy and sticky.",88,Elias Mora 2011  Toro
"Shows a certain aggressiveness, offering up vibrant raspberry and cherry fruit, cola, mocha and oak flavors, but kept aloof by its acidity and tannins. It's certainly elegant and pedigreed, but it need 3–4 years in the cellar.",93,Merry Edwards 2010 Georganne Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Dusty cherry and red-plum aromas are simple and clean. A fresh, tight, normal feeling palate gets the job done, while flavors of cantaloupe, red plum and nectarine wrap up with pithy citrus notes and a hint of bitterness. Drink this year.",86,Marqués de Cáceres 2014 Rosado (Rioja)
"A very earthy Pinot Noir from the gorgeous Oppenlander Vineyard. The wine—from mostly Pommard clones—is a heady mix of aromatic mushrooms growing in dirt and bright cherry-strawberry notes, finished by a lilting lift of rose petal and supple spice. An elegant wine that would be tempting to drink early and often.",92,Couloir 2010 Oppenlander Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino County)
"A severity of tannin and heat opens this wine before mellowing into soft, juicy red raspberry and plum. Remaining relatively light bodied and restrained for the variety, it becomes softer on the chocolaty midpalate before a grippy finish grabs back the power.",88,Byington 2013 Smith Vineyards Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley)
"Very perfumed, this is a spicy Traminer with an amount of sweetness. The wine is ripe and rounded, with dominant tropical fruit. The acidity cuts through the richness. Screwcap.",87,Dürnberg 2011 Altes Kreuz Traminer (Niederösterreich)
"This wine has attractive fruit, crisp acidity and a good balance with the light tannic structure. Bright and fresh wine, it is ready to drink. This is one of the Ducourt family properties on the Right Bank of Bordeaux.",84,Château la Rose du Pin 2013  Bordeaux
"Nettle and celery aromas come in front of a citrusy, tight palate housing lemony acidity. This tastes mostly of lime, green apple and green herbs, while the finish introduces a lettuce-like flavor to go with racy lasting acidity.",88,12 Linajes 2014 Verdejo (Rueda)
"Smoky, rich, this wine packs a powerful punch of vibrant black cherry fruits, and generous sweet tannins. It is big, muscular, the structure wide and open. It shows richness and opulence, brought into line by a firm, youthful structure that needs five years or more to age.",95,Bouchard Père & Fils 2006  Echézeaux
"This is an attractive, ready-to-drink wine, a blend of Arinto and Fernão Pires. Bright and fruity with plenty of citrus freshness, it is lightly crisp and fresh at the end.",85,Quinta da Alorna 2014 White (Tejo)
"Aromas of mulberry, savory herb, green tea, vanilla and spice lead to medium-bodied, easy-drinking cherry flavors.",87,Sawtooth 2011 Sawtooth Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon
"A powerful and concentrated wine, this shows the region's dark and tannic side. The black plum and juicy black-currant flavors shine, and wood aging has smoothed the palate, which makes it feel dense and fully mature.",92,Wines & Winemakers 2008 Aguia Moura Em Vinhas Velhas Reserva Red (Douro)
"Cherry and berry aromas are touched up by oak-based vanilla, coconut and spice accents. While this is a bit choppy in feel, with citric-leaning acidity, flavors of red-berry fruits, smoky oak and coffee are nice despite a hint of heat and scour.",87,6cepas6 2013  Rioja
"This is a strawberry-pink-colored wine with candied flavors balanced by acidity. It is fruity, crisp and light in character.",84,Château Lamothe-Vincent 2015 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
"A rich and opulent wine, very ripe, packed with luscious blackberry and damson fruit as well as sweet tannins. It is a fruit salad of fruit flavors given structure by a core of dryness. Already a gorgeous wine, but one that will also age.",95,Château Rauzan-Ségla 2009  Margaux
"This is made from a majority of Cabernet Franc, with sizable additions of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot. Mint and bay leaf curry favor on the nose, while a severity of oak hits the palate.",84,White Rock Vineyards 2013 Claret (Napa Valley)
"Aromas of tropical fruit, pressed wild flower and ripe orchard fruit lead the nose. The round savory palate offers juicy peach, red Bartlett pear and a white almond note. Energizing mineral lifts the creamy flavors.",90,Gini 2015  Soave Classico
"Right Bank employs 72% Cabernet Franc to make a statement, accenting it with 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Malbec, 3% Merlot and 1% Petit Verdot. Herbal and pretty, this full-bodied wine remains tight in its youth, the tannins firm and powerful, barely letting in the mouthful of red cherry that awaits. Drink now through 2021.",91,Medlock Ames 2013 Right Bank Red Red (Alexander Valley)
"There is an aromatic, herbal lift among the full-fruited nose of this wine that is reminiscent of freshly peeled curls of ripe Cox Orange Pippin apples. The palate adds a pleasantly bitter, slightly phenolic edge that gives texture and and counterbalance to the soaring freshness of the citrus and apple notes. Concentration and power come in a compact, taut package that is likely to unfold a little more with bottle age. It finishes with the rich and honest flavor of crisp, ripe apples. Compelling now but it will be even better. Drink 2017–2030.",93,Domaine Ostertag 2014 Clos Mathis Riesling (Alsace)
"A big, ripe and juicy wine packed with black fruit notes and laced with acidity. The tannins offer a contrast to the fruitiness, bringing balance and structure. This is an impressive wine, the smoky aftertaste bringing out the wood aging.",91,Château Manon la Lagune 2010  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux
"Bright cherry and blueberry notes combine with hints of leather, earth, crushed pepper and grapeseed on the nose of this bottling. It's relatively light in body, showing peppery verve on the palate plus blueberry-elderberry fruit and bay-leaf herbals.",89,Clos La Chance 2012 JoLi Meritage (Central Coast)
"Charming and perfumed, with notes of musk, white flowers and wild grapes on the nose and exotic spices in the mouth. This is not a concentrated wine, but there's enough acidity here to balance the slight sweetness and to make it a refreshing apéritif. Drink up.",84,Messina Hof 2009 Muscat Canelli (Texas)
"Bacon, rubber and berry fruit aromas comprise the bouquet. Feels crisp on the palate, with roasted berry flavors and herb and pepper accents. It feels warm on the finish, with herbal leanings and some roughness.",86,Scala Dei 2008 Prior Red (Priorat)
"A sound, everyday Pinot Grigio, with good citrus and spice flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Gets the nod for simple richness.",84,Glen Ellen 2010 Pinot Grigio (California)
"Aromas of cranberry and berry are fresh and juicy. The flavors are tart and supple, showing depth and length. It's delicious in its own right but will shine on the dinner table.",90,Wind Rose 2012 Barbera (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Sweet and extracted in pineapple, tangerine, lime and vanilla flavors, this Chardonnay also is generously oaked, which gives it even richer vanilla and buttered toast notes. It's flashy, yet would benefit from greater dryness and restraint. Size isn't everything.",86,Anaba 2009 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"Tastes as ripe, bright and spicy as it smells, with intense, pure flavors of raspberry, strawberry and cherry essence dusted with crushed white pepper, cinnamon and vanilla. Drink this light-bodied, savory young Pinot now and over the next year or two.",88,Gundlach Bundschu 2010 Heritage Selection Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Only in California's warmer regions will you find the enormously ripe cherries and blackberries this Cabernet offers. It's as sweet as jam. Likeable, even opulent, but would benefit from greater dryness and structure.",86,Joseph Family 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"An excellent wine from the great Heiligenstein Vineyard. Its perfumed character is full of rich pear and peach flavors, with the cut of intense citrus. The tense mineral texture promises good aging. Screwcap.",91,Allram 2010 Heiligenstein Erste Lage Reserve Riesling (Kamptal)
"This rich, oak-driven Merlot from Sicily opens with bright cherry and blueberry backed by toasted almond, leather and pipe tobacco. There's a raw or chewy note in the mouth that will soften with a few more months of bottle aging.",89,Baglio di Pianetto 2006 Salici Merlot (Sicilia)
"This is a clean and bright selection, with pure notes of green melon, apple and fresh herbs. The lively palate offers lime peel and grassy tones that finish clean on the finish. It's an approachable and easy-drinking wine best enjoyed now.",87,Spier 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape)
"Attractive fresh fruit, crisp apples and vivid acidity make a great citrus wine, perfect as an apéritif.",86,Gritsch Mauritiushof 2009 Kalmuck Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"As is most often the case with Sangiovese, this comes across as a pleasant, rather generic red wine that could be almost anything. The fruit tastes of light cherry and plum, with a rather sour finish. Tannins are earthy and there is a hint of sweaty saddle as well.",83,Maryhill 2005 Proprietor's Reserve Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This charming and refreshing wine has aromas like green apples. Richer flavors that suggest white peach accompany a tangy but smooth texture. Light to medium bodied, it is perfect for lunch or pre-dinner drinking.",87,The White Doe 2013 White (California)
"You'll find this Pinot Noir drier, earthier, tarter and even more tannic than most coastal bottlings. It has flavors of cherry skins, black raspberries, cola, peppery spices and herbs. Drink now–2010.",87,Clos du Val 2006 Pinot Noir (Napa Valley)
"A blend of young vines fruit gives a very soft, gently rounded wine with only the lightest of depth. The fruit is full, the flavors show some spice, while yellow fruit tastes roll around underneath. Drink now.",87,Vincent 2006 Marie Antoinette  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
"As sweet as a dessert pastry, with vanilla, cream, toast, butter and pineapple jam flavors. Vibrant acidity provides balance just in time.",85,Michael Pozzan 2010 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This is a good yet basic Merlot with baked berry aromas. The mouthfeel is more lively and raw in feel, with modest berry and spice flavors that hit quick and hollow at just as quickly. A standard finish is fine but doesn't evolve.",86,Santa Carolina 2011 Reserva Merlot (Colchagua Valley)
Sweet candied apple overpowers this oddly textured and flavored wine.,82,Tedeschi Family 2014 Truchard Vineyard Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"This impressive wine, packed with both fruit and tannins, is just setting out on a long road of aging. It is rich, dense with dry fruit and wood tannins, and buttressed with dark black fruits layered with acidity. The wine, with its ripe fruit and firm structure, needs time. Drink from 2018.",93,Conceito Vinhos 2013 Conceito Red (Douro)
"Wild red berries, crushed pepper, lilacs and a frame of asphalt show on the exuberant nose of this bottling. The palate is loaded with meat, smoke, cedar, charcoal and easy boysenberry flavors, the perfect pairing for a hamburger. It is a tad light in body, especially since it hasaged for so many years.",89,DeTierra Vineyards 2010 Russell Estate Merlot (Monterey)
"This is a solid, chunky wine, rich in dark blackberry and and red plum flavors. Maybe the tannins are too hard at this stage, but its weight and rich fruit suggest aging potential. Drink from 2016..",89,Château du Cros 2011 Clos Bourbon  (Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux)
"Simple and fruity, with upfront blackberry jam, cherry, currant and cocoa flavors, wrapped into fine, smooth tannins. Tasty, but lacks definition and complexity.",85,Cobblestone 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Amber honey and peach jam aromas are in the forefront of this passito-style wine. Marmalade, praline and African honeybush tea fold into button mushroom notes in the background. These translate onto the palate effortlessly. The acidity feels sprightly and lifts this lucious wine. The finish is long and luxurious.",88,Barboursville Vineyards 2013 Passito White (Virginia)
"A big, toasty wine, full of ripe, delicious fruit, veering toward opulence. There are open yellow fruits along with toast and butter tastes. This is almost ready to drink now; only the acidity promises some aging.",90,Pascal Bouchard 2006 Fourchaume Vieilles Vignes Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"The yellow-fruited richness of mirabelle compote with a touch of vanilla becomes apparent on the nose. The palate is just as luscious as promised but also carries a welcome, thrilling streak of lemon oil at its core, brightening and framing the medium-sweetness with its zesty lift. A touch of pleasant phenolic bitterness can just about be felt, adding dimension to the palate. This is intriguing and exciting in the way it plays with richness and sweetness while keeping them on a very tight rein. Lovely. Drink 2017–2027.",94,Domaine Pfister 2013 Engelberg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"An aromatic wine, it has notes of tangerine and mineral. It drinks medium sweet (10 g/L residual sugar), with the sugar getting just a bit out in front of the acids.",87,Cave B 2013 Riesling (Ancient Lakes)
"With some blackberry, cassis and oak flavors, this is a pretty good wine. It's a little green, and the acidity is sharp. Drink up.",85,Edna Valley Vineyard 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast)
"Ripe fruit tones of raspberry jam and blackberry jelly open the bouquet giving this Brunello a plump, sun-kissed personality. It shows a dark garnet color in the glass and has flavors of toasted espresso bean, tobacco, leather and spice with aromatic vanilla endnotes.",90,Poggio Nardone 2008  Brunello di Montalcino
"This is a tannic while richly fruity wine, showing ripe warm-climate Cabernet Sauvignon flavors. Blackberries and dusty tannins are to the fore, giving a firm structure, fine juiciness and a dense texture. The wine could age, so drink from 2016.",90,Fiuza 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Tejo)
"Forward and spicy, this puts some muscle into the Merlot with earthy, tongue-gripping tannins. The fruit has a sweet tomato flavor, with a streak of cherry candy. Though not entirely knit together, it's a pleasant drink best enjoyed young.",86,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2008 Indian Wells Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Classic varietal aromas of tomato leaf, exotic fruit and citrus practically jump out of the glass. The bright palate doles out juicy peach, nectarine, grapefruit, celery and sage while a mineral vein lends energy.",91,Vie di Romans 2015 Piere Sauvignon (Friuli Isonzo)
"A robust, very ripe style of red wine, this is deep in color and packed with fruity flavors that tend toward prune and raisin. A taste of celery comes up on the finish. Though not high in alcohol it feels full-bodied and rich in texture, and rather heavy.",85,Saracina 2011 Skid Row Vineyard Malbec (Mendocino County)
"This stellar wine has a huge yum factor. Deliciously ripe and spicy, it's loaded with cranberry and raspberry fruit. There's an underlying tang of pink grapefruit acidity, along with aromatic highlights of violets and rose petals. Drink now through 2022.",93,Cowhorn 2013 21 Grenache (Applegate Valley)
"Purple as can be, with grapey aromas that aren't subtle in the least. Typically thick, with mild tannins and shy, almost reserved berry, cassis and chocolaty oak flavors. Dense wine, but not as expressive and deeply flavored as previous vintages. Drink now through 2011.",90,Viu Manent 2007 Viu 1 Malbec (Colchagua Valley)
"This is a bright, medium-bodied wine with a thickness of creamy vanilla that makes it seem slightly sweet, built atop crisper shocks of lime zest and orange peel. Ultimately it finishes smooth and velvety, a nice match for the table.",88,Davis Estates 2013 Private Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford)
"Medium-gold to the eye, this wine has aromas of white peach and bitter almond. There is an almost beer-like flavor profile, including peach, apple, hops and floral notes. Ever-present but not overpowering tannins and a bright, lingering finish make for an appealing and interesting wine.",89,Orgo 2014 Rkatsiteli (Kakheti)
"This unique blend of Dundee Hill Pinot Noir and Walla Walla Syrah seduces instantly with a bouquet redolent of smoke and licorice, tobacco and vanilla. Though it's Syrah that seems dominant, adding flavors of supple purple fruits to the aromatic mix, it seems apparent that the Pinot Noir component extends the finish, turning a potent and powerful wine into one that exits with delicacy and breeding.",93,Domaine Serene 2013 Grand Cheval Pinot Noir-Syrah (Oregon)
"Tasted at their regular release date less than a year after the vintage, the Tahbilk Marsannes aren't terribly expressive. The key is bottle age, and this Museum Release has it. Lemon custard and thyme are tinged with hints of toast and marmalade in this medium-bodied white. A touch of creaminess on the midpalate extends through a long finish.",92,Tahbilk 2009 Museum Release Marsanne (Nagambie Lakes)
"Complex and showing so much of what we love about Ribera del Duero. Baking spices, mature fruit and leather grace the stately bouquet, while the palate sings a pretty tune of berries, plum and brown sugar. There's thrust and potency to the mouthfeel but also a toasty, rich, mocha character. Drinking good now but should hold in there for another five to eight years.",92,Alidis 2001 Gran Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)
"Full, rich wine, with a concentrated structure to go with the pineapple and apple juice flavors. Still young, the wine should age for a year, to fill out the structure and give final richness.",91,Guy Saget 2010 Le Domaine  (Pouilly-Fumé)
"Enticing aromas of wisteria, Spanish broom and a whiff of pear emerge in the glass. The crisp, creamy palate is loaded with finesse, delivering white peach, nectarine zest, apple and a mineral note. Vibrant acidity brightens the creamy flavors while a foamy mousse gives it a smooth texture.",90,Vettori NV Extra Dry  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"This wine may have potential in the years to come, but is still searching for its soul at this young age. Aromas of dried black cherries and strawberries meet with black tea, juniper and a touch of tar on the nose. The palate is framed in a foamy acidity, offering plum and squeezed blackberry fruit, but dominated with a very herbal character that's still integrating.",88,Alexander-Smith 2014 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"This feels sharp and raw, with ripe, jammy blackberry and cherry flavors, plus a streak of sweet, toasty oak. Drink now.",85,Shadowbox 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Round, superripe aromas of earthy black plum come in front of a tannic palate. Earthy baked-cherry and black-plum flavors finish with licorice root and baking spice notes along with gripping tannins. Drink through 2019.",89,Bodega Las Cañitas 2010 Juan Cruz Navarro Torre Gran Malbec (Argentina)
"With 80% Chardonnay barrel-fermented and 20% Pinot Noir from vat, this prestige cuvée is ripe, with the fruit softening towards a more mature character. A tang of orange zest gives a crisp texture that contrasts with the spicy, rich aftertaste. The wine from the family's small vineyards in the Marne Valley is still developing; drink from 2018.",91,Liebart-Régnier 2010 Confidencia Brut  (Champagne)
"Tart in acidity, with cranberry, sour cherry candy and smoky, sweet vanilla flavors. It's an easy wine, at an easy price.",85,Sterling 2010 Vintner's Collection Merlot (Central Coast)
"At the risk of overgeneralizing, Martinborough Sauvignons typically show less overt herbal characters than their Marlborough counterparts. At least, that's the case for this medium-bodied wine. White grapefruit, stone fruit and underripe melon notes finish crisp and clean.",87,Palliser Estate 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Martinborough)
"Floral scents spring from the glass, followed by a graceful mix of flavors: rose petals, pomegranate and red berries. This elegant wine seduces as it winds through a long finish, with a creamy lick of caramel to finish up.",93,Expression 44° 2013 Roserock Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"This Slovenian Ribolla Gialla has aromas of peach and vanilla, with flavors of freshly baked peach pie, canned apricots and green apple. It is soft on entry, rounded in the mouth and shows good minerality on the finish.",90,Colliano 2013 Estate Bottled Ribolla Gialla (Goriska Brda)
"In a style that is reminiscent of neighboring Jurançon, Pacherenc produces fruity, fragrant and fresh sweet wines. There is a touch of honey and tropical fruit that balances the acidity and the crispness. A wine for pâtés as well as desserts.",88,Producteurs Plaimont 2010 Château Arricau-Bordes  (Pacherenc du Vic Bilh)
"Feels a bit thick and heavy now, with jammy raspberry, cherry, mocha and sandalwood flavors, but so good, so pure that a few years in the cellar have to benefit. A splendid acid-tannin balance provides the framework for aging. Better after 2011.",93,La Fenêtre 2007 Calmant Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Slightly sweet flavors of concentrated strawberry preserves create a rather thick mouthfeel. It's a jammy style of Pinot, to be sure, but with just enough supporting acidity to keep it from crumbling under its own weight. Drink over the next two or three years.",88,Seufert 2012 Vine Idyl Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"L'Anima, which is Italian for “the soul,” is a blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon and Gewürztraminer, and it shows pretty aromas of white flower, honey and exotic fruit. The density and creaminess of the mouthfeel recall the wine's warm-climate Tuscan roots.",87,Livernano 2010 L'Anima White (Toscana)
"A powerful and dense wine, showing some rustic character, big red fruit and dark tannins. This superb wine has weight and concentration, balanced acidity and a growing sense of maturity. This wine from the legendary Mouchão estate needs considerable aging; drink from 2018.",95,Mouchão 2007 Red (Alentejano)
"This Pinot Gris is marching to the beat of its own drum, with some funky aromas and toast notes along with lemon and pear fruit. It's a tad volatile in the mouth but has some nice depth of flavor and a lingering cashew finish. Likeable for its originality.",86,Pewsey Vale 2008 Individual Vineyard Selection Pinot Gris (Eden Valley)
"Very rich in oak, with massive buttered toast, caramel and crème brûlée flavors. The underlying fruit is good, suggesting pineapples and ripe peaches, but misses a beat for all that winemaker intervention. Drink now.",88,Far Niente 2007 Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Lots of rich, ripe blackberry and cassis flavors in this dry, full-bodied Cabernet. It's quite scoury in youth, with strong, edgy tannins and a hit of zippy acidity. Give it 5–6 years in the cellar to begin to calm down.",89,Kissos 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This estate-grown Riesling is sourced from some of the oldest vines on Red Mountain—planted in 1975–1976. Lush and textural, it's both rich and elegant, with flavors of pink marshmallow, honeycomb, pear and meringue. It fills the mouth with pleasing confectionary flavors, fine layering and depth. Residual sugar is 13 g/L—still dry enough for most foods.",91,Kiona 2011 Reserve Dry Riesling (Red Mountain)
"Made entirely from Nebbiolo, Italy's most noble grape, this offers a fragrance of McIntosh apple, grapefruit and yellow peach. The palate displays an enticing depth of flavors including red cherry, strawberry and notes of cinnamon-spice alongside a refined and persistent perlage.",91,Parusso 2010 Metodo Classico Nebbiolo (Vino Spumante)
"A soft, strawberry flavored wine that is smooth and immediately attractive. Despite its low alcohol, it has a ripe feel to it from the rich fruit and the almost off-dry character. The acidity gently kicks in at the end.",85,Carayon la Rose 2015 Rosé (Languedoc)
"Earthy, rubbery red-berry aromas lead to a hard-drilling palate with fiery cherry flavors and an allotment of herbal mint. The hollow finish leaves a salty flavor and heat.",84,Domaine Jean Bousquet 2013 Made With Organically Grown Grapes Malbec (Tupungato)
"There's a softness to this dry wine. It's forward and rich in currants and smoky oak, but could use greater acidity. The tannins also seem a little ungainly, although they could mellow out in a few years.",87,Beringer 2004 St. Helena Home Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Loosen's best Dr. L to date, this is a terrific value, delivering typical Mosel Riesling notes at a great price. Citrus blossom, lime and crushed stone aromas are followed by apple and citrus flavors in this just-slightly-sweet wine. Drink it now and over the next year or so.",90,Loosen Bros. 2010 Dr. L Riesling (Mosel)
"Lightly scented, this medium-bodied white opens with whiffs of white spring flower and orchard fruit. The soft, round palate offers mature pear, citrus peel and a hint of toasted hazelnut.",87,Giacomo Vico 2015  Roero
"This is the workhorse grape of Champagne and some domestic sparklers. Very little is bottled as still wine in Oregon. It has Pinot Noir color with some similar aromas of cola and sassafras, but veers off into an earthier, almost musky direction all its own. The pretty cherry fruit calls out for duck or salmon.",90,Amalie Robert 2013 Pinot Meunier (Willamette Valley)
"A blend of Nerello Mascalese, Nerello Cappuccio, Nocera and Nero d'Avola, this polished wine conveys earthy aromas including violet, ripe berry, leather, game and baking spice. The savory palate doles out juicy black cherry, ripe raspberry, licorice, cinnamon and clove alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2016–2020.",94,Le Casematte 2012 Quattroenne  (Faro)
"This vineyard-designate Brunello opens with ripe tones of prune, thick blackberry fruit and lingering but subdued Indian spice. This is not an overblown or overly intense wine. Instead, the focus is on elegance and longevity.",91,Tiezzi 2006 Vigna Soccorso  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"A blend of Sangiovese, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this opens with tones of fruit, mild tobacco and spice. The wine's measured intensity and bright acidity make it a good choice for cheesy pasta dishes.",87,Tenuta del Buonamico 2010 Etichetta Blu Red (Montecarlo)
"The cool-climate-loving Alvarinho translates well to the coastal Lisboa region. It's rich and creamy, acidity well in hand and supporting the melon and citrus flavors. It's a delicious wine now, but it will age, so keep it until 2015.",88,DFJ Vinhos 2013 Grand'Arte Alvarinho (Lisboa)
"This attractive, family-owned estate has produced a fruity, crisp and light wine. With its orange-zest acidity, citrus fruits and a tight, mineral character, it is a light wine—bone dry with just a touch of pepper at the end.",86,Domaine Sarragousse 2015 Rosé (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence)
"This wine features a melding of concentrated fruit, toasty oak and toffee notes, especially on the finish, which is similarly ringed in smoky oak. It's a meaty Cabernet Sauvignon out of Lodi, with a touch of burnt ember reminiscent of a campfire.",85,Mettler Family Vineyards 2009 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi)
"This is a softer Sauvignon Blanc for those not sworn to the grassy side of the grape, as the Buellton-based winery does a lot of barrel-fermenting. Aromas include pressed kiwi and a sour pucker of lime, and the broiled pear flavors prove easy drinking, if not exceedingly complex.",88,Dragonette 2012 Vogelzang Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
"In this wine, a core of juicy apple and Anjour pear flavors is dressed with light vanilla, nutmeg and cream accents for a beautiful, airy wine that's dry and not at all heavy. Baking spices linger on the long, vibrant finish.",90,Great American Wine Company 2013 Chardonnay (California)
"Initially a bit shy, this slowly opens in the glass to reveal aromas of ripe berry, leather, baking spice and a hint of scorched earth. The palate offers suggestions of raspberry compote, dried black cherry, vanilla and licorice alongside tightly wound tannins. A marked espresso note closes the finish. Drink after 2019.",89,Poderi Luigi Einaudi 2012 Terlo  (Barolo)
"Pretty scents show pure varietal character, with the accent on fresh berries and sweet herb. Flavors follow suit, with well-managed, ripe and smooth tannins. A medium-bodied wine drinking well right now.",88,Boedecker Cellars 2008 Stewart Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This wine opens with just a touch of reduction followed by quite pure aromas of red and blue fruit. The flavors are sweet and fresh, with the tannins bringing a light grip.",88,Charles Smith 2014 The Velvet Devil Merlot (Washington)
"This is black in color, and on the nose it's jammy and intense, with slightly reduced blueberry and exotic cumin scents. The palate offers a smooth texture, depth and balance alongside toasty, blackened flavors of berry, cassis and pepper. A chocolaty, lightly toasted finish is a fine ending to this lively, tasty Malbec.",89,Santa Carolina 2010 Reserva de Familia Malbec (Rapel Valley)
"Touriga Nacional's home is believed to be the Dão and this 100% variety wine gives a very fine, ripe and textured red. Still young with dense tannins and a rich and concentrated structure, it is powerful and needs several years to reveal its real, rich self. Drink from 2018.",93,Fontes da Cunha 2012 Munda Touriga Nacional (Dão)
"Made with 70% Nebbiolo and 30% Pinot Nero, this savory sparker offers aromas and flavors of wild cherry, juicy strawberry, orange zest and a hint of cake spice. Fresh acidity and a vibrant but refined perlage provide the backdrop.",90,Rivetti Massimo 2009 Duemilanove Rosé Metodo Classico Sparkling (Vino Spumante)
"Fragrances recall acacia, white spring flowers, honey, bread dough and beeswax. The concentrated palate delivers mature yellow apple, toasted walnut, clove, vanilla and pie crust alongside vivacious, persistent effervescence.",91,Bellavista 2007 Pas Operé Extra Brut Sparkling (Franciacorta)
"Briny citrus aromas are mild to the point of quiet. This clear-looking SB is in solid shape on the palate. Peppery lightly zesty flavors include a note of sweet green melon, while this tastes a bit like jalapeño peppers on the finish.",87,Viña Casablanca 2016 Nimbus Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"Zesty white grapefruit, green apple and lime form the core of this lithe, racy Riesling. Dry in style, it's feather light on the palate yet penetrating, honed by an edge of steel and minerality. The finish lingers long, yet refreshes thrillingly.",94,S.A. Prüm 2012 Graacher Dompropst GG Dry Riesling (Mosel)
"The wine has plenty of fruit, the right layers of tannin. And yet it seems one-dimensional—something that can happen with Touriga Nacional. The depth and complexity found in previous vintages of this wine are missing. So you get bold black fruits and a stylish structure in a wine that is almost ready to drink.",87,Quinta do Passadouro 2013 Passadouro Touriga Nacional (Douro)
"This is a beautiful wine with aromas of pear, peach and yellow rose. The palate is plush and intense, with a sassy, spicy close.",90,Meroi 2010 Friulano (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"A nose of wild blackberry and brambles lays the groundwork for a tender dance of fruit and herbal flavors, especially blackberry, pomegranate, eucalyptus and fennel bulb. Mouth-coating tannins dissipate on the finish, joined by a burst of tart pomegranate.",90,Carmel 2011 Kayoumi Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Galilee)
"Aromas of green olive, grilled asparagus, moist peat, mineral and coffee meld with earthy funk. The smoke and savory flavors are lithe yet concentrated, lingering on the finish.",94,Cayuse 2012 En Cerise Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Warm and mulchy at first; this is a muscular, dark wine despite the bargain price, and it's tight, tannic and herbal but serious in weight, structure and depth. The palate shows creamy, oaky, herbal fruit in front of a full, grabby, tobacco-accented finish. Elevated size and structure is what brings it up a notch.",87,Montes 2008 Special Cuvée Limited Release Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"This is a mouthfilling wine that doesn't go over the top in terms of ripeness or tannins, so it's smooth to drink and offers mild plum and cherry flavors.",88,Matchbook 2013 Tinto Rey Red (Dunnigan Hills)
"This a single-vineyard wine is dry and high in acidity, with cherry, tobacco and tar flavors, and has a rustic mouthfeel. Think of it as American Chianti, and drink with roasted meats and hearty pasta dishes.",86,Lava Cap 2005 Matagrano Sangiovese (El Dorado)
"Tart, clean and juicy, this has ripe flavors of apricot, citrus, tropical fruit and spice. With zesty acidity, it feels basically dry, despite the honeyed finish. A touch of oak lends vanilla and smoke notes.",87,Amici 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"This wine starts off with a broad blend of berries and cherries, and well-integrated, smooth tannins. But in the finish and aftertaste, a chemical bitterness emerges and persists.",87,Colene Clemens 2014 Victoria Estate Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"Sourced from Mike Sauer's Les Vignes de Marcoux Vineyard (near Red Willow), this sends up classic Yakima Valley Syrah scents––black tea, seaside funk, and umami, with drying tannins that seem soaked in ripe black cherry fruit. Juicy finish, with a streak of lemony acidity.",92,Mark Ryan 2008 Lost Soul Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"This expression of Montepulciano opens with a good deal of spice and chocolate backed by cherry and plum. The tones are simple and well-defined, making this a great value wine for homemade meat sauce and pasta.",87,Umani Ronchi 2011 Montipagano  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo)
The wine is tight and perhaps firm. Its extracted tannins and dry core are too much for the fruit.,83,Château Labatut 2015 Cuvée Prestige  (Bordeaux Supérieur)
"This ripe, still very young wine has a tangy, mineral texture that cuts into the white fruit flavors. Acidity, creamy texture and flavors of melon and apricots all give this wine the potential to be deliciously fruity. Drink from 2017.",88,Domaine Pascal et Mireille Renaud 2014  Mâcon-Villages
"On the palate, this feels velvety and smooth thanks to its rich texture and enduring flavors. The nose is characterized by black cherry, cola, licorice, espresso and tobacco notes",90,Prà 2010 Morandina  (Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso)
"This soft wine is yeasty with a strong bubbly mousse. It is balanced, moving towards the sweet end of Brut although with plenty of apple acidity to keep it crisp. Drink the wine now.",87,Nicolas Feuillatte NV Brut  (Champagne)
"A spray of lime pith mingles with white florals on the nose and palate of Prejean's Dry Riesling. It's dry on the palate, but softened considerably by a gorgeously concentrated apricot and white peach fruit profile.",87,Prejean 2009 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Shows good blackberry and currant flavors, but there's something off in the mouthfeel. It's a sharpness, a rugged, tart green chlorophyll feeling that suggests unripe tannins.",84,Le Vigne di Domenico 2007 Merlot (Paso Robles)
"Forceful on the nose, with herbal, saucy, rubbery aromas. It's weighty in the mouth, with blackberry, herbal tomato and dry spice flavors. Feels pretty good on the finish, which comes with a lasting herbal accent. A little grating but solid enough.",85,Veramonte 2008 Reserva Merlot (Casablanca Valley)
"An attractive wine from Chitry, south-west of Chablis, this is fresh, soft and fruity. It lacks complexity, but does have bright apple and pear flavors and refreshing acidity. It's a great apéritif wine, ready to drink now.",85,Simonnet-Febvre 2012 Chitry  (Chablis)
"Meaty aromas suggest baked berry, prune and other ripe fruits. The palate is almost soupy in its richness, while flavors of molasses, berry and toast are ripe and concentrated. A roasted-tasting finish features notes of cooked brown sugar.",89,Finca El Origen 2011 Gran Reserva Malbec (Uco Valley)
"The blend is largely Merlot, with splashes of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. There is a strong scent of vanilla that only partially masks the flavors of leaf and stem. Tannic and a bit earthy, this would be a good wine to pair with a red pasta sauce.",86,Mercer Canyons 2009 Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Attractive aromas of red berry, rose petal and a light note of cooking spice fill the glass. On the tightly wound palate, dried red cherry, sage and white pepper are offset by austere tannins that lead to a rather short, bracing finish.",87,Bel Colle 2012 Monvijè  (Roero)
"Pecorino is the white wine of the moment for those who love the rustic tastes of Italy's vast patrimony of indigenous grapes. This expression shows loads of peach, lemon and Golden Delicious apple.",87,Talamonti 2009 Trabocchetto Pecorino (Colline Pescaresi)
"The nose gives little away but the palate comes in with the fruity pleasant ease of ripe pear and gentle citrus freshness. This is rounded and ripe, fresh and bouncy, with a clean-cut finish.",89,Winzer Krems 2015 Kremser Wachtberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"There's a savory, almost chewy side to this Brunello that is enhanced by aromas of tobacco, spice, dark cola, licorice, blackberry and currant. The wine shows balance and intensity with a soft, plush feel in the mouth that stands in pleasing contrast against to wine's young tannins and acidity.",91,Conti Costanti 2008  Brunello di Montalcino
"Simple and straightforward aromas of red berry and mineral cap the aromatic nuances expressed in the Brunello Riserva. What the wine lacks is complexity, although it does feel rich, smooth and bright in the mouth. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers.",89,Le Potazzine 2004 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Really sweet and unctuous in texture, this pale copper-hued Muscat is a blend of white- and dark-skinned grapes. Peach and berry flavors are balanced by a spicy, green-herb tinge to the finish.",86,Vignobles de Balma Venitia 2011 Carte Rosé  (Muscat de Beaumes de Venise)
"This is a mint- and licorice-flavored wine, with its wood aging prominent at this stage. Full bodied, rich and concentrated, it shows strong signs of extraction that give it a bitter finish. Age this tannic wine for 2–3 years or more.",87,Château Lestruelle 2010  Médoc
"The product of a partnership between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie with the Perrin family of Château Beaucastel in Châteauneuf-du-Pape, this bottling achieves instant fame. Happily, it is also a very fine wine, perfectly balanced between crisp fruit and acidity. In the background a touch of tannin accompanies pepper and minerality. It is ready to drink.",91,Château Miraval 2015 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"If you drink this wine too cold, you'll miss the nuances behind the pineapple, orange and spice flavors. There's a minerally undertow, and some interesting herbal notes.",87,Girard 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Enticing scents of chamomile, white spring flower and white stone fruit mingle together in the glass. The creamy full-bodied palate doles out ripe honeydew melon, juicy yellow pear and nectarine zest while a ginger note adds depth. A far cry from the many bland Pinot Grigios that flood the market, this one is loaded with personality.",91,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano 2015 Anger Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige)
"With fragrant violet and red-fruit aromas, this is an enticing wine. Its structure and its concentration bring out its richness and dense black fruits. The wine is elegant, on the dry side of Ports with some firm tannins as well as fine ripe fruits and acidity. Drink this now or (better yet) wait until 2020.",91,Ferreira 2013 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port)
"Showing the tannins this estate bottling is known for, this is quite astringent despite the fabulous wealth of fruit flavors, which include ripe blackberries, sweet cherries, savory currants and anise liqueur, with a hint of Provençal herbs. Despite the hardness, this shows elegance and opulence that put it into the top ranks. Drink now–2016, at the very least.",94,Sabina Vineyards 2008 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
"Smoke, blackberries, black cherries, pencil lead and woody mints show on the nose of this wine from a label once owned by the California winemaking pioneer. The palate is heavily sprinkled with oregano, thyme and anise against a background of tart blueberry juice, and the tannins need some mellowing though 2017–2018, when it will drink even nicer.",88,Martin Ray 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"This is a high-powered, full-bodied wine. The aromas are like toasted baguette slices, vanilla and nutmeg, the flavors do a good impression of dark chocolate and blackberry, and the texture is saturated with fine tannins that give all those flavors plenty of support and lip-smacking appeal.",91,Michael David 2013 Inkblot Cabernet Franc (Lodi)
"Rose, leather, black cherry and balsamic aromas lead the nose on this friendly wine. The savory palate delivers crushed red berry and white pepper alongside lithe tannins that give it an easy drinking texture.",88,Col di Lamo 2011  Rosso di Montalcino
"Aromas of red-skinned berry, underbrush and leather lead into a medium-bodied palate that offers cherry, tobacco and a hint of white pepper. It's rather straightforward and already approachable so drink over the next few years.",88,Bonacchi 2012 Molino della Suga  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Punchy citrus, apple and lanolin aromas are a bit dusty and entirely typical of Rías Baixas Albariño. Direct citrus flavors and a note of briny orange peel finish a bit salty, with a hint of green banana.",88,Licia 2016 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Aromas that recall nail varnish eventually fade to reveal raisin, prune, chocolate and coffee notes that carry over to the palate along with plum, toasted oak and vanilla.",86,Colombaio 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
"On the nose, luscious peach notes are slightly muddied by earthier notes. On the palate, generous sweetness boosts all the fruit flavors to an intense lusciousness. There is balance in the form of lemony freshness and a lovely tangy texture. This is momentarily quite intense.",91,Joseph Cattin 2015 Hatschbourg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Spicy tangerine peels perfume this intense, full-bodied Gewürztraminer. It's richly textured, almost creamy, in mouthfeel but balanced brightly in acidity. Hints of fennel and pollen pepper a pleasantly phenolic finish.",89,Sheldrake Point 2015 Estate Bottled Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes)
"Aromas of truffle, new leather, black-skinned fruit, wild herb and pressed rose lead the nose. The velvety full-bodied palate delivers fleshy wild cherry, ripe cranberry, star anise and clove set against athletic tannins. Drink 2018–2023.",91,Tenuta La Fuga 2011 Le Due Sorelle Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"This leads with violet, black-skinned berry and baking spice aromas while red cherry, raspberry and white pepper flavors mark the savory palate. Smooth tannins and bracing acidity provide balance. Enjoy through 2020.",88,Marchesi di Barolo 2016  Barbera d'Alba
"Aromas of cured meat, violet and grilled herb waft out of the glass. The rather diluted palate offers wild cherry, game and a salty note alongside fleeting tannins and zesty acidity.",86,La Togata 2014  Rosso di Montalcino
"This offers aromas of new oak, coconut and a whiff of exotic spice that carry over to the underripe palate along with tart cranberry and an orange zest note. It lacks the fruit richness needed to stand up to the oak while raspy tannins leave an astringent finish.",86,Icardi 2013 Montubert  (Barbaresco)
"This Bordeaux-style blend, which includes all five classic Bordeaux varieties, opens with herbal aromas of forest berry, black-currant leaf and tobacco, all grounded in ripe, fruity tones of blackberry and cassis. The palate is concentrated and dense, with a full yet firm texture and flavors of black-plum skin, cherry, leather, bittersweet chocolate and anise that carry  through to the long finish.",90,Spier 2010 Creative Block 5 Red (Coastal Region)
"Tarry and gritty smelling up front, this offers herbal black-plum notes on second and third takes. This is a wide load on the palate, with huge, pounding tannins. Peppery berry flavors finish dry and abrasive.",86,Lar de Sotomayor 2013  Rioja
"For a higher-priced wine, this has some issues. The nose is heavy and murky, with leathery, baked aromas. In the mouth, it's somewhat choppy and acidic, thus punctuating the cherry tomato portion of the earth-and-leather flavor profile. Lingering oak accents the finish, which is zesty and leans toward sour.",85,Dominio Lasierpe 2007 Flor de Lasierpe Viñas Viejas Garnacha (Navarra)
"Country style, with its rough, earthy tannins and brambly berry flavors. Yet it's clean and likeable, with intensely jammy, berry and stone fruit flavors. It also has a nice, round, supple texture. A versatile wine with lots going for it.",86,Granite Springs 1999 Syrah (El Dorado)
"A beautiful Pinotage with superb expression and balance. Intriguing aromas of spicy cured meat, pepper, raw vanilla bean and mulled boysenberry abound, while the lush mouth offers concentrated dark fruit flavors of plum preserves and berry pie filling. Enjoyable now thanks to a creamy texture and silk tannins, though this wine also shows the potential to cellar for another 3–5 years.",91,Diemersfontein 2006 Reserve Pinotage (Wellington)
This Champagne is soft and has some sweetness (although technically Brut). Ripe melon and pear fruits are cut with enough acidity to keep the wine fresh and fruity.,87,Canard-Duchêne NV Authentic Brut  (Champagne)
"In the pale style made fashionable by Provence, this rosé is fruity, crisp and lightly textured. It's an attractive wine, fresh and ready to drink.",84,Philippe Girard 2014 Rosé (Sancerre)
"Vanilla, cedar and caramel abound on the nose of this opulent reserve Cabernet Franc. Its unabashed oakiness integrates well into the palate though, adding a sexy, spicy tone to ripe black berry and plum flavors. It's bold, concentrated and a bit brawny, but irresistibly so, finishing with remarkable depth and persistence. Hold till 2020 to allow its brawn to settle.",91,Raphael 2013 Reserve Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island)
"This delivers fresh aromas of white peach and sun-ripened apricot. Dry and tonic on the palate, this has a lively blast of acidity on the finish.",86,Cà Vittoria NV Costa dei Peschi Brut  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"This is a sound Pinot for everyday drinking. It brings some structural finesse to fairly simple sour cherry candy and cola flavors. There's a touch of green veggies that limits enjoyment, though.",84,Simi 2011 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County)
"Grassy aromas include notes of corn and apple. This feels fresh and citric, with moderate roundness. Salty citrus and kiwi flavors are lasting on a crisp juicy finish.",87,Viña Casablanca 2016 Nimbus Single Vineyard Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)
"Fruit is the star of this wine. It's gigantic and forward in sweet raspberry and cherry flavors that taste wild, picked under a hot summer sun. Fortunately, there's a lot of acidity, and firm tannins provide additional structure. The finish is thoroughly dry. A bit in your face now, but could do interesting things over the years.",90,Fort Ross 2009 Sea Slopes Fort Ross Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This is a ripe, lemon and orange zest-driven wine. It has a lightly mineral texture that gives structure as well as a cool feel. It's a delicious wine already but will be better by late 2014.",86,J. Portugal Ramos 2013 Marquês de Borba Branco White (Alentejo)
The 30-year-old vines of this estate surround a 16th-century castle. The wine is ripe although with intense acidity at the end. Wood aging has added spice and has smoothed out the bright acidity and red-berry fruits. Drink from 2019.,89,Château Cruzeau 2014  Saint-Émilion
"There's a real richness to this wine, as aromas of butter and cream flood the nose alongside notes of ripe peach and apple. The mouthfeel is as full and lush as one would anticipate from the bouquet, and the finish is long but clean. Drink now.",89,Hartenberg 2006 The Eleanor Chardonnay (Stellenbosch)
"New American oak cradled this wine, which includes 12% Petite Sirah. A strong aroma of root beer or Dr. Pepper wraps itself around smoky tar and toast, with a grippyness on the leathery finish that falls a touch flat.",86,Saddleback 2013 Old Vines Zinfandel (Calistoga)
"Randall Grahm's blend of 55% Roussanne, 26% Grenache Blanc and 19% Picpoul Blanc shows sliced honeydew, wet stone and a flash of topicality on the delicate nose. The mouthfeel is steely with layers of tense energy, showing lime pith and faint green banana, as well as lemon blossoms lasting long on the finish.",91,Bonny Doon 2013 Le Cigare Blanc Beeswax Vineyard White (Arroyo Seco)
"Winemaker Tyler Russell sources the fruit for this bottling from an extremely cool-climate vineyard. Tons of fresh-pressed boysenberries meet with wood ash, underripe berries, black olives, rosemary, roasted lamb and Mediterranean spices on the nose. Tart black-plum skin is layered with bay leaf, rosemary, thyme, crushed peppercorn and charred beef on the dynamic palate.",95,Cordant 2014 Presqu'ile Vineyard Syrah (Santa Maria Valley)
"Good and dry, with tough tannins that make it hard to drink now. With blackberry, currant, molasses and dark chocolate flavors, it seems like an ager, but may not have the concentration for the long haul. Try again in 2–3 years.",87,Calicaro 2010 Les Fauves White Hawk Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara)
"Full and generous, this has creamy peach and apricot aromas backed by a slightly spicy touch of vanilla bean and caramel. Pair this wine with coconut curry.",85,Riondo 2011 Monte Forte Lot 6 Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie)
"Tasty and true to type, this wine smells like ripe plums and cherries accented by dried thyme, and tastes slightly meaty on top of all that fruitiness. It's a smooth-textured wine in which moderate tannins add a good bite to the mouthfeel.",88,Cambridge & Sunset 2014 California Series Merlot (California)
"Fern, jasmine, green pear and tart mandarin create an aromatic, inviting nose. The palate supports these aromatics with an intense, concentrated freshness of bright, pure lemon on the midpalate. This is streamlined and refreshing, with just the right amount of invigorating spritz.",91,Türk 2016 Kremser Weinberge Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"Strong char, toast and barrel aromas are at the fore, getting way out in front of the fruit. The fruit flavors are tart and considerably more elegant than the aromas might suggest. There seems to be a bit of disconnect between the two.",87,Longship 2015 Wise Man Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills)
"The best wine from Phélan Ségur for several years, this shows less of the often-intrusive new wood and more of the fruit that had been missing in past vintages. It shows a subtle level of toast and a black currant flavor, plus great acidity and freshness on the finish.",92,Château Phélan-Ségur 2010  Saint-Estèphe
"Rich and toasty, this has aromas barrel-dominated aromas and flavors of vanilla and sweet, buttery oak. The underlying wine is strong in cherry and balsam flavors, which are girded by considerable tannins. Pair this with game meats, stews or barbecue to wrestle the structural elements into submission.",88,Fort Ross 2007 Fort Ross Vineyard Pinotage (Sonoma Coast)
"This blend of 50% Nebbiolo, 25% Barbera and 25% Syrah offers aromas of fudge, blackberry and plum that are somehow both lean and rich. It's thick and full on the palate, with pepper spice, leather, tobacco and violets, yet the acidity is quite powerful. Serve with hearty pasta.",87,Palmina 2010 Savoia Red (Santa Barbara County)
"Ripe black raspberry and cherry mark this lovely Pinot that is rich and concentrated. The oak is prominent, with a touch of meaty gaminess on the full palate. Balanced, the wine's acidity remains remarkably bright.",90,Marimar Estate 2012 Doña Margarita Vineyard Mas Cavalls Unfiltered Estate Grown & Bottled Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
