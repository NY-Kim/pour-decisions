"Made from grapes that were sourced from two parcels, this Pommard is firmly structured, and it shows fine red-fruit flavers that sit under the dark, dense tannins. It has a ripe yet minerally texture.",88,Domaine Champy 2010  Pommard,,,,
"Aromas of pithy citrus and pineapple are decent but unrefined, while flavors of tangerine and pineapple are tropical, zesty and what they are. This is nothing more than a fresh, simple, citrusy white to sip on the patio. Anything beyond that would be stretching it.",84,Bodega Norton 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Mendoza),,,,
"A lovely young Cab, rich and balanced, and with the elegance you expect from this producer. Made from all 5 Bordeaux varieties, with a drop of Syrah, the wine is potent in red and black currant, blackberry and new oak flavors, with sweetly ripe tannins. Delicious now, it should develop through 2015.",91,Robert Mondavi 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"A beautiful 100% Viognier, showing the variety's exotic tropical fruit, wildflower and pear flavors wrapped into a texture of firm tannins and adequate acidity. Finishes with tiers of honey, apricot jam, tangerine-infused crême brûlée. Very nice, if high in alcohol.",92,Chalk Hill 2009 Estate Bottled Viognier (Chalk Hill),,,,
"Spicy wood-aging flavors dominate this wine. It is rich, almost too rich and pushy for its own good, seeming to be more opulent than previous vintages. Nutmeg dominates more than the pineapple and apricot fruit flavors. It could settle down, although it will always be larger than life.",89,Quinta Nova de Nossa Senhora do Carmo 2013 Mirabilis Grand Reserva White (Douro),,,,
"There is a strong steeliness to this wine although it doesn't lose out on fruitiness either. Crisp apples are tempered with pineapple to give a ripe feel, while the end is fresh and mineral.",85,Henry Fessy 2012  Beaujolais Blanc,,,,
"Produced from Syrah, this is still a cool wine, with crisp fruitiness to the front. Lively acidity and fresh red fruits are balanced by a warmer layer of caramel. Drink now.",84,Domaine d'Arton 2013 Rosé (Côtes de Gascogne),,,,
"Kevin Riley packs eight varieties into this pink wine, but the major proportion of Syrah and Grenache lend it its deep hue and rose petal, red cherry and vanilla notes on the nose. Grippy red plum skin flavors dominate the compellingly tense palate, followed by Rainier cherry and orange rind touches.",89,Proulx 2016 Resistance Willow Creek Farm Rosé (Paso Robles),,,,
"This is a lightly wood-aged wine, with crisp acidity and just a hint of toast. The fruit is upfront, showing a crisp, tight lemon character that's tangy and refreshing. Drink now.",88,La Chablisienne 2014 La Pierrelée  (Chablis),,,,
"Such breezy freshness, such citric concentration on a slender, very streamlined body. Bright, lemony flavors fizz everywhere and create a feeling of lightness, but with a firm backbone. A clean, taut finish.",90,Allram 2014 Gaisberg Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),,,,
"Practically a liquid fruit salad, this smells and tastes like orange, apple, cantaloupe and banana. The texture is smooth and rounded, rather than crisp. A little buttery flavor comes through on the finish.",85,Barrel Racer 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Solano County),,,,
"This full-bodied white leads with typical varietal aromas that recall white roses, lychee and spice. The round, low-acid palate delivers creamy exotic fruit layered with notes of clove and nutmeg. A soft, lingering finish closes on a sweet note punctuated with the warmth of evident alcohol.",89,Elena Walch 2012 Kastelaz Gewürztraminer (Alto Adige),,,,
"Yeasty aromas are low on fruit and specifics. This Viura-Chardonnay blend is lazy in feel, with modest acidic cut. Sweet bland flavors quickly fall off and taste of powdered sugar on the finish.",84,Bodegas Aragonesas NV Viura-Chardonnay (Campo de Borja),,,,
"Plump black currant, lavender extract, bright purple flowers and touches of raw beef and tar show on the nose of this bottling, made with 20% whole-cluster and 7% Viognier. Black pepper and asphalt show first on the palate, where tannins softly coat the mouth and then stand up to boost elderberry flavors. Thorough, zesty acidity ensures long cellar potential. Drink 2017–2032.",93,Big Basin 2012 Coastview Vineyard Syrah (Monterey County),,,,
"Aromas of toasted almond and yellow apple skin lead the nose. The aromas follow through to the palate along with a hint of peach and a mineral note. It's rather lean, with brisk acidity.",86,Fantinel 2014 Tenuta Sant'Elena Friulano (Collio),,,,
"Dark cherry and toast shows on the nose of this straightforward Cabernet. The wine offers more of the same and some earthy shadings on the dry and even palate. Finishes with medium length, and displays a hint of chocolate on the back end.",85,Backsberg 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paarl),,,,
Aromas of stewed black fruits and compost are leafy and a touch green. This has a wide-bodied mouthfeel and grabby tannins. Medicinal plum and berry flavors taste minty and herbal on the finish.,87,Chaman 2016 Cabernet Franc (La Consulta),,,,
"A good but awkward attempt at a bigger, more saturated, more serious wine. The nose tells you that it's ripe, but there's some reduction in there too. The palate is revved up and tannic with turbulence along the way. Spice, chocolate and heat all play a part on the berry-driven palate.",86,TerraMater 2006 Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère (Curicó Valley),,,,
"Rugged and astringent in texture, with jammy blackberry and spice flavors.",84,Petroni 2007 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"Even at six-plus years, and despite its origin in superstar grower's Beckstoffer's vineyards, this Cab has an imbalanced sweetness. The sugariness of the blackberry flavors accentuates the tannins, making them awkward and sharp. Not going anywhere, so drink up.",84,Oakford 2001 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),,,,
"As with its companion releases, the inviting aromatics capture your attention. On the palate, the wine offers classic varietal flavors of berry and tart plum, along with nuanced highlights of sassafras, bramble and a slight hint of hemp. Concentrated and compact, it should cellar well for at least a decade. Drink now through 2026.",93,Domaine Serene 2013 Winery Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),,,,
"The high alcohol shows through everything else, giving this Zin a chili pepper heat and a distracting Port-like sensation. It's rich and dry, with firm tannins framing the blackberry and currant flavors.",86,Rosenblum 2010 Richard Sauret Reserve Zinfandel (Paso Robles),,,,
"Made from a 50-50 blend of Chardonnay and Viognier, it features aromas of yellow peach, apricot and a hint of baked bread. The palate is less expressive however, with a thick honey-like consistency but not much flavor.",86,Gurra di Mare 2011 Tirsat White (Sicilia),,,,
"This is a delicious and fruity wine from the smallest Beaujolais cru. There are tannins although they are lost in the generous cushion of ripe blackberry and black-cherry fruits. It is a smooth, rounded wine that is packed with fruit at the moment. Give it time and it will mature well. Drink from 2018.",93,Domaine de Côtes Rémont 2015  Chénas,,,,
"Bone dry, acidic and subtle in citrus and tropical fruit flavors, this is a Chardonnay that doesn't insist on standing on its own. Instead, it's perfectly content to let the food star, remaining in a supporting role. For pairings, lobster risotto comes to mind, or just a delicious mayonnaise-based sandwich.",88,Justin 2011 Chardonnay (Central Coast),,,,
"A touch of spring blossoms lends softness to this puckery sweet-tart Riesling full of juicy green apple and lime flavors. It's a straightforward, refreshing wine but with ample verve and kick. Drink now.",88,Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium 2014 Fritz Willi Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"A finely perfumed wine, touched with wood, Beaujolais in a Burgundy style, structured and with intense acidity. It is packed with firm tannins, surrounded by a lively cherry and rich fruit character.",92,Château des Jacques 2010 Clos du Grand Carquelin  (Moulin-à-Vent),,,,
"There is a light pepper and spice character that comes through in this wine. It adds to the wine's simple fruitiness with complexity, pushing the rosé into a food friendly character. The wine is ready to drink.",87,Chateau Peyrassol 2016 Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"The ripe 65% of Sémillon is the secret behind this rich wine. While at the young stage it has a herbal character that is going to fill out impressively to give a creamy wine with a touch of vanilla and fine crisp, juicy acidity. Drink from 2020.",90,Château Rahoul 2014  Graves,,,,
"This is crisp and lemony, with intense acidity. It has a spicy note that gives the wine an exotic character, enhanced by lychee fruit. The wine is full in the mouth, really fruity and crisp at the end.",90,Château Roquefeuille 2016 La Combe Rosé (Côtes de Provence Sainte-Victoire),,,,
"This third generation vineyard has produced a classic Cahors, with firm tannins that bring out the black fruits. It is richly structured while keeping fruitiness right to the fore. A wine for rich foods, it will be good to drink from 2018.",87,Château Armandière 2014 Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"A little sharp, with a sting throughout, but otherwise a fine, classic Cabernet brimming with flavor. Shows upfront blackberries, currants, chocolate-covered cherries, smoky vanilla and toast, wrapped into smooth, sturdy tannins. Could mellow and soften in the next several years.",88,Bardessono 2006 Maxine's Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
A smooth and rounded wine this rich wine has caramel as well as ripe strawberry flavors. A light touch of saltiness gives extra interest.,91,Domaines Ott 2013 Clos Mireille Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"This medium-bodied Syrah is silky in texture, those soft tannins framing plummy fruit notes and hints of cracked pepper and licorice. The oak is integrated almost perfectly into the wine, leaving an impression of almost pristine fruit. Drink now–2020.",90,Crossroads 2010 Winemaker's Collection Syrah (Hawke's Bay),,,,
"The wine from this clos or walled vineyard in the city of Reims has spent eight years aging before disgorgement. It's a rare wine, with a wonderful balance between its toasty character and the crisp, dry apple and green-fruit flavors. It will certainly age further, so wait—if you can—until 2019.",96,Lanson 2006 Clos Lanson Chardonnay (Champagne),,,,
"Despite some floral notes, this tight, dry wine is all structure. Its power comes from the dry center, showing intense acidity. Very dry, firm and hard-edged.",92,Niepoort 2011 Bioma Vintage  (Port),,,,
"A solid effort, with cherry and red currant aromas. The palate bears scratchy tannins and flavors of raspberry and red plum, with mild, dry and crisp finish. This should pair well with basic foods.",85,Casa Silva 2009 Reserva Merlot (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"Earthy berry and leather aromas are fairly quiet. A more lively palate offers good weight and overall composition, while plum, raspberry and spice flavors finish with sweeter notes of raisin and baked berry.",88,Larchago 2012 Pagos de Tahola Crianza  (Rioja),,,,
"Claret is the old British term for the wines of Bordeaux. This wine, the first such from Francis Ford Coppola's Sonoma County winery, is a good buy. It's a bit rustic, but offers smooth flavors of blackberries, currants and chocolate.",87,Francis Ford Coppola 2006 Francis Coppola Diamond Collection Black Label Claret Red (California),,,,
"Perhaps the lightest Pinot in the producer's lineup, and the most readily accessible, this is fresh and fruity. Highlighted in strawberry and cherry, it retains a tension of black tea and earth. Silky on the palate, it finishes as lightly as it started.",90,Williams Selyem 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),,,,
"Simple and fruity, this has a mix of pineapple, citrus and apple, high-toned and slightly bitter. The toasty component from some sort of barrel/oak treatment is not yet integrated into the fruit. This will need decanting or aging in bottle until 2016.",86,King Estate 2013 Signature Collection Chardonnay (Oregon),,,,
"It's all about acidity and long hangtime with this Chard. The acids come from chilly, foggy nights, the ripeness from long, warm, sunny days. What you get is oodles of bright, pure pineapple, Granny Smith apple, Meyer lemon and spicy clove flavor, with a touch of caramelized oak for richness.",87,Husch 2006 Chardonnay (Mendocino),,,,
"A blend of Nero d'Avola and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine offers ripe, plump layers of black fruit, chocolate and spice. The palate is soft, luscious and velvety.",89,Feudo Arancio 2009 Cantodoro Red (Sicilia),,,,
"This finely balanced wine is both crisp and packed with fruit. Its mineral texture is balanced by the sliced green apple and lively acidity. With its lightly toasty aroma, it is ready to drink.",91,Faniel et Fils NV Appogia Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),,,,
"A sensational value, this is a Pinot lover's wine, beginning with the gorgeous color of a deep red/orange sunset. Cherries, chocolate, and a light touch of orange peel elevate the aromatics and inform the well-integrated midpalate. The wine lingers gracefully through an immaculate finish.",93,Love & Squalor 2013 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This 100% Pinot Nero opens with aromas of red berries, rose petals and a whiff of vanilla. The juicy linear palate offers red currants, vanilla and a hint of beets framed in polished tannins. Enjoy soon.",89,Elena Walch 2014 Ludwig Pinot Nero (Alto Adige),,,,
"Heavy in alcohol and overripe, but entirely dry, and the black currant, chocolate and pepper flavors will play well against richly sauced barbecue.",84,Starry Night 2007 The Caboose Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),,,,
"This is a bright, fully realized wine from the distinctive appellation: soft with an integrated approach to its use of oak. Wild strawberry, cranberry and a threading of dried herb combine effortlessly into a pleasurable whole.",90,En Garde 2014 Gold Ridge Pinot Noir (Green Valley),,,,
"With chocolate as well as fruit flavors, this is a structured wine. A bitter edge gives the juicy damson fruit a jolt. However, it should develop well to give a ripely textured wine from 2016.",86,Herdade do Perdigão 2011 Vinha do Almo Red (Alentejano),,,,
"Made from organic grapes, this succulent wine delivers balsamic aromas and juicy black cherry flavors layered with cinnamon and white pepper. It's radiant and structured, with big round tannins and edgy acidity. Drink 2015–2025.",91,Fontodi 2010  Chianti Classico,,,,
An attractively crisp wine that is already well developed. There is lemon drop sweetness in the dosage and ripe grapefruit flavors. The wine is balanced and fruity.,87,J. Dumangin Fils 2000 Vintage Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"Herb and mint aromas dance with lactic berry notes, and as it unfolds a mask of sawdust and forced oak rises up to smother things. The palate is woody, tart and lemony, with an angular feel and a resiny finish. Harmony is in short supply here.",82,Viña Casas Patronales 2007 El Llano Vineyard Estate Bottled Carmenère (Maule Valley),,,,
"Another impressive bargain-priced 2015 Sauvignon Blanc. Consumers looking for summer 2017 refreshment should grab some of this for its crisp flavors of pineapple, passion fruit and grapefruit. Drink now.",87,Ponga 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"Red in color and pretty clean on the nose, where raspberry and rose petal essence come together. The palate is acidic and tight, with tangy watermelon and peach flavors carrying the cleansing finish. Juicy to the extreme, but a good partner for food.",84,Coto de Hayas 2007 Rosado Rosé (Campo de Borja),,,,
"Made in a seemingly off-dry style, this offers simple but pleasant apricot, peach and white flower flavors, with bright acidity. It's tastes similar to Pinot Grigio in many respects.",84,Jacuzzi 2011 Arneis (California),,,,
"A sound Cabernet, fruit-forward and somewhat one-dimensional, with cherry, blackberry and raspberry fruit. Oak adds sweet notes of caramel.",85,Sebastiani 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),,,,
"This is a medium-weight, supple Cabernet with bright acids that's seemingly designed for early drinking. Perfumed notes of mint, vanilla, brown sugar and cassis lead the way, followed by similar flavors and ample oak.",90,Yalumba 2010 Menzies The Cigar Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra),,,,
"You have to classify this as a dessert wine, because of the residual sugar sweetness. The honey, apricot, orange and vanilla flavors are balanced with refreshing acidity.",87,Maddalena 2012 Moscato Muscat Canelli (Paso Robles),,,,
"This lightly perfumed wine is full bodied and packed with ripe quince and mango flavors. There is just a touch of pepper, which is balanced by the acidity and edgy texture. Give the wine a year to age further, or drink now. Screwcap.",87,Domaine Zinck 2010 Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"A rounded earthiness reminiscent of Bosc pear envelops this fluid, balanced and fruit-driven wine. It conveys effortless harmony with a creamy touch that's clear and beautiful. The light approach is admirable, the clean, apple-scented finish very satisfying.",91,Domaine Ostertag 2014 Vignoble d'E Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"Young and tightly wound, this wine from the family's Olivet Lane Vineyard is reduced and generous in oak and spicy dark cherry, its aromas resplendent in rose petal. Layered and soft, it's big on complexity and plush textures, with a lengthy, caramel-and cola-laced finish.",88,Pellegrini 2013 Olivet Lane Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Aromas of dried black-skinned fruit, cedar, charred earth and ground pepper lead the nose. The palate offers dried black cherry, ripe blackberry, clove, allspice and tobacco alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2018.",89,Carpineto 2010 Riserva  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),,,,
"Noval has often in the past released a Vintage Port in years when other producers hold back. And, as in the past, the release is justified. For this is an impressive, dense and seriously age-worthy Port. While it has plenty of perfumed jammy red fruits and balanced acidity, it is the dark tannic character that will sustain this wine for decades. It could be drunk now for its fruit, although that would be a shame. Better to wait until 2030 and longer.",95,Quinta do Noval 2013 Vintage  (Port),,,,
"Aromas of black cherry, espresso bean and white chocolate tease the palate in this Moroccan blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 10% Syrah. Brightness reigns despite powerful tannins, and flavors of black cherry, rhubarb, jalapeño, coriander seed, vanilla and citrus zest are a pleasure on the tongue.",93,Ouled Thaleb 2012 Médaillon Red (Zenata),,,,
"Crisp green-apple freshness blends with hints of butter and vanilla for a nicely balanced, un-oaky, medium-bodied wine at a very reasonable price.",88,Chime 2013 Chardonnay (California),,,,
"Informal and light, this fresh wine made from the Verdeca grape opens with easy aromas of citrus, honey and peach. It shows a bitter almond flavor in the mouth.",85,Luccarelli 2011 Ampelo Verdeca (Puglia),,,,
"This amber-colored wine offers a clean bouquet of green apple. Sophisticated flavors of tart apple, honeydew and sage play on the tongue amid chewy tannins that persist into a mouthwatering finish, with lingering notes of Mediterranean herbs.",89,Schuchmann Wines 2014 Vinoterra Kisi (Kakheti),,,,
"Fragrant and inviting in dark cherry, raspberry and cola spice, this medium-weight Pinot Noir is lush and meaty. Bright flavors veer from dark cherry to raspberry, with a pronounced lift of earth and herb. The wine is layered, beautifully textured and long in the finish.",91,Joseph Jewell 2011 Hallberg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Here's a fresh and crisp Pinot Grigio that offers many more layers of intensity and personality than your standard, supermarket-bought Grigio. It shows creamy layers of silky, ripe fruit.",87,Colutta 2010 Pinot Grigio (Colli Orientali del Friuli),,,,
"This bottling offers much of the richness and fruit-forward character of Paso Robles. Accessible aromas of black cherry, vanilla ice cream, black-currant juice and licorice lead into a juicy palate. It's very likable and hedonistic.",88,ONX 2016 Indie Noir Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"This wine opens with an explosion of Granny Smith apples underlined by firm minerality. The honeyed palate shows nice grapefruit and lemon character. Medium, citrus finish. Best now, but will gain complexity over three to four years.",88,Domaine Marcel Deiss 2006 Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"Bailly Lapierre regards this full-bodied rich Pinot Noir as its signature wine. It has a cool, northern feel to it, but it also has powerful red-berry fruits, a firm structure, a final layer of acidity and a sense this is a wine as well as a Crémant.",91,Bailly-Lapierre NV Pinot Noir Brut  (Crémant de Bourgogne),,,,
"This is a dark bomber with black cherry, kirsch, lemony oak and shoe polish aromas. The palate is creamy and big, with acid-derived lift boosting blackberry and licorice flavors. With tons of black-fruit character, this qualifies as a fruit-forward wine with sweet overtones.",87,Vega Sindoa 2010 El Chaparral de Vega Sindoa Old Vines Garnacha (Navarra),,,,
"Strong , complex aromas, with notes of tropical fruit and coconut. In the mouth, it's oaky and spicy, with penetrating, bright, effusive flavors that you might go so far as to call racy. The alcohol content is high and it drinks a little soft, but this is a very seductive wine. A crowd-pleaser, for sure.",89,Fritz 1998 Ruxton Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Coming in a bottle adorned with an informational treasure map of the region, this wine conveys bubble gum, honeysuckle and Pink Lady apples on the nose. A similar apple character shows on the palate, along with riper grapefruit notes, Anjou pear slices and graphite. The apples get more sour as the sip lingers.",87,Inconceivable 2014 Queen of Tides Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"The nose burgeons with so much ripeness of fruit, there is almost a hint of dried pear with a big dollop of spice. The palate shows the same generosity but is masterfully balanced by a lovely phenolic edge and zesty grapefruit freshness. White pepper shimmers in the background and makes for a very well-rounded, balanced, juicy and refreshing wine.",92,Türk 2015 Frechau Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),,,,
This is a simple and straightforward expression of Prosecco with tight perlage and medium aromas of white flower and citrus. That subtle but soft sweetness you taste would pair nicely next to vegetable tempura.,85,Ornella Molon NV Extra Dry  (Prosecco Treviso),,,,
"A 100% varietal, single-vineyard estate wine, at the top of the producer's heap, this was given almost two years in French oak, half of it new, the other half once-filled. Juicy, it offers refined layers of herb, currant and clove, making for a soft, complex and lightly spicy experience. With sizable structure and depth, it can be enjoyed now through 2022.",93,Frank Family 2012 Winston Hill Vineyard Patriarch Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),,,,
"This 100% varietal from one of the state's oldest vineyards brims with aromas of dark roasted coffee, char, bittersweet chocolate and black cherry. Flavors show plenty of concentration and depth with a lingering, cocoa and vanilla-filled finish.",91,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2012 Cold Creek Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Here's a fun delightful sparkler that gives you yellow apple, Bartlett pear and nectarine zest flavors alongside steely, vivacious bubbles. Firm acidity gives it a crisp finish.",87,Tenuta Stella NV Brut Ribolla Gialla (Vino Spumante),,,,
"For the price, this is a commendable effort, with scents of toast and vanilla layered over modest cherry fruit. The wine is medium bodied and marked by the a fine, soft texture, then finishes on a tart note.",84,Ballast Stone Estate Wines 2006 Steeple Jack Merlot (South Australia),,,,
"A good Cab, dry and balanced, whose tannins are richly impressive and sweet. Shows a good tension between the oak and the ripe black currants. Easy to like, and should develop for a few years.",90,Wild Oak by St. Francis 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),,,,
"A big, strong Chardonnay with prominent buttered toast, buttered popcorn, vanilla, and pineapple-orange jam flavors. Elaborate and flashy, but obviously made to appeal to the modern style. Drink up.",87,Beringer 2011 Private Reserve Chardonnay (Napa Valley),,,,
"A foundation of truffled earth and forest floor give this a rustic edge, complemented by savory herb and black tea. Weighty, it shows its backbone of oak aging well, finishing abruptly in cranberry and dark cherry.",86,Gehricke 2013 Pinot Noir (Los Carneros),,,,
"Chocolate, tobacco and new leather aromas make a dramatic first impression for this full-bodied and comparatively smooth wine. Then very deep dark fruit hits the palate along with smoky, peppery nuances accompanied by a just-tannic-enough texture. It will be great to drink alongside some smoked brisket.",90,Fleur 2013 Petite Sirah (North Coast),,,,
"Smooth and fruity on the nose, with ample lushness and fairly ripe berry and cassis flavors. This is basically a Cabernet Sauvignon (with 20% Merlot), and it offers comfortable, medium-intensity flavors of raspberry, strawberry and currants. It's what you can drink with pizza or a grilled skirt steak.",86,Estampa 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"Red berry, cinnamon and vanilla mingle playfully in this personality-laden Cab. The combo of pretty and slightly wild flavors works well—and firm tannins and structure mean the wine will age nicely. Imported by Monsieur Touton.",87,Steenberg 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Coastal Region),,,,
"This is a rich style of rosé, full-bodied and packed with ripe strawberry fruit. As a happy contrast to this richness, it also has a spice and orange zest element that adds both piquancy and final crispness.",90,Château les Valentines 2011 Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"A minuscule amount of this wine is made, coming from 45-year-old vines. Ripe, dense and dusty red and black berries combine against soft, approachable layers of integrated tannin and oak, finishing with leather and cigar.",90,Leto 2012 The Hidden One Exceptional Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),,,,
"Chocolate, cherries and baking spices make up the flavors of this layered and tasty wine. The color is dark, the texture is nicely astringent due to assertive tannins, and it conveys a sense of something held in reserve.",89,Longevity 2012 Tempranillo (Livermore Valley),,,,
"An aroma of fresh, green Bartlett-pear peel comes first, then the riper notion of pear compote, with a grippy, lime-zest accent and a dash of pepper. Waves of flavor unfold on the tongue and give exquisite length. It has ample mileage to develop; enjoy it now while primary and zippy or wait for mellowed richness later. Either way, it belongs on the table. Drink 2014–2020.",92,Pratsch 2012 Steinberg Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),,,,
"A good, sound wine to drink now. It's nicely dry and rich in tannins, with a burst of acidity. The cherry, blackberry and raspberry flavors are a bit jammy.",86,Black & White 2006 Topanga Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"This is one of the first wines to bear this new appellation in Sonoma County. More importantly, it's one of the best California Malbecs out there. It's rich and juicy with ripe cherries and mocha, along with a sweet coating of toasty oak. It's soft enough to drink now, especially with a great grilled steak.",90,Imagery 2010 Malbec (Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak),,,,
"This opens with aromas suggesting mature berry, baking spice, menthol, scorched earth and oak. The ripe palate offers stewed prune and bitter chocolate while assertive, tightly wound tannins grip the finish.",88,Raineri Gianmatteo 2012 Monserra  (Barolo),,,,
"Few wines offer as much as this for under $30, but this extracted, bullish Tempranillo blend is not for everyone. Blackberry, cola and savory herbal aromas are strong and pure. This feels wide and cushioned, yet is still a driller. Blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors finish rich and ripe. Drink through 2024.",93,Abadia Retuerta 2012 Estate Grown Selección Especial Red (Sardon de Duero),,,,
"This is an aromatic, lightly sweet wine. It has ripe strawberry fruits that have just enough acidity to keep the wine crisp. Drink now.",84,Enoport 2015 Vinhas Altas Rosé (Vinho Verde),,,,
"A restrained nose just hints at ripeness: Comice pear perhaps? The palate is full-bodied but sinewy and one feels that the wine will open up in years to come, power is evident, so is deep fruit that still needs to blossom. The muscular structure is full of promise. Drink as of 2017.",93,Josef Jamek 2012 Smaragd Ried Hochrain Weissburgunder (Wachau),,,,
"Extraordinarily rich and sweet in raspberry, cherry, vanilla custard, brown sugar and cinnamon spice flavors. Soft and somewhat sugary on the finish, it shows lots of ripe California fruit, but would benefit from being drier.",87,Château Julien 2007 Black Nova III Malbec-Syrah (Monterey County),,,,
"From a vineyard in the heart of the appellation comes this bottling that's redolent with hibiscus, Earl Grey tea, orange rind, black cherry, spiced plum and fennel bulb on the nose. The palate plays a bit lighter, with brisk cranberry, more hibiscus and lots of cola, proving quite light and easy to sip though well structured as well.",91,Foxen 2013 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"This selection offers balance and integrated aromas of spice, dark fruit, leather, tobacco, cola and rum cake. The wine shows power and heft both in terms of alcohol and consistency. Smoothly polished, fine tannins appear on the close.",91,Castello Banfi 2008  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Oodles of blackberry and ripe grape flavors characterize this smoothly textured, well-balanced red blend. Firm elements of tannin and acidity support the ripeness, and the wine tastes fresh and mouth-watering. This will be great with meat, pasta and cheese.",88,Alias 2012 Secret Agent Red (California),,,,
"Aromas of underbrush, blackcurrant, oak and cake spice lead the nose of this blend of Sangiovese and 15% Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The palate offers dried blackberry accented with oak-driven spices of coconut, vanilla, mocha and cedar alongside assertive tannins. Drink through 2016–2022.",89,Carpineto 2007 Sant'Ercolano  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),,,,
"Vivid, bright red cherry and cranberry notes create the main aroma and flavor impressions, while crisp acidity and lip-smacking tannins make a firm texture. On subsequent sips, more complexity and depth come out as the crisp, austere structure holds its ground. This is tantalizing, and should improve through 2019.",91,Donkey & Goat 2013 Broken Leg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),,,,
"A blast of spice, mint, bramble and pepper explodes from the glass. The wine is dense, dark, deep and mysterious; the flavors pungent, penetrating and persistent. Tannic, layered with herbs and spices, powered with big, punchy fruit. This is classic Cline.",93,Cline 1998 Big Break Vineyard Zinfandel (Contra Costa County),,,,
"Soft and forward, with jammy flavors of cherries, berries and herbs. Tastes a bit overripe toward the finish, with some raisins. Drink now.",85,Beringer 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"French oak, coconut and spice aromas follow through to the lean palate, where they're joined by sour cherry and vanilla flavors. Grainy, fleeting tannins give it an abrupt finish.",86,Castello Tricerchi 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Always one of the top performers in Margaux, this dense and concentrated wine has a bold, ripe character from the plum and berry fruits. It has the weight to develop. Drink from 2020.",93,Château Rauzan-Ségla 2013  Margaux,,,,
"This bright, easygoing red offers aromas of truffle, chopped herb and wild berry. The fresh, easy-drinking palate doles out juicy Marasca cherry, white pepper and star anise alongside racy acidity and pliant tannins. Drink soon.",87,Valdipiatta 2014  Rosso di Montepulciano,,,,
"Rich, ripe and chocolaty in style, this is a full-bodied yet soft and velvety-textured wine. It's a rich, satisfying mouthful of lusty red from the right bank of the Rhône, made by Laudun Chusclan Vignerons for the importer.",89,Cachette 2009 Red (Côtes du Rhône),,,,
"Based in the Côte des Blancs, this producer enjoys access to some fine Chardonnay. This ripe, aromatic wine, a blanc de blancs in all but name, conveys maturity as well as tangy mineral texture. The aftertaste is soft.",91,Gauthier-Christophe NV Cuvée Mathilde Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),,,,
"Meaty, cuddly and kind is the best way to describe this big-boned, ultra ripe Toro. What makes it great is the price ($20 is a steal for this) and the complete lack of fierceness. It's easygoing but complex, with pulsing blackberry, plum and chocolate flavors. With modest but measurable tannins, it should age nicely for at least five years and maybe more, making it a bargain hunter's dream.",91,J. & F. Lurton 2005 El Albar Barricas  (Toro),,,,
"This is a fine, impressive Cabernet that shows the soft tannins and slight herbaceousness of Alexander Valley, yet is rich in cherry jam, cassis liqueur, chocolate and sweet oak flavors. Feels plush and fancy in the mouth. Drink soon.",90,Dewitt 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Structured and savory, this opens with scents that recall black berry, blue flower, chopped herb, menthol and moist soil. The chewy, textured palate offers mature Morello cherry, black raspberry, grilled herb and clove accompanied by densely packed, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2018–2023.",90,Rignana 2013  Chianti Classico,,,,
"Exhibiting all the richness of the vintage, this is a round, ripe, spicy wine. It has a full, warm, creamy feel, with notes of almonds and ripe peaches. Only on the finish does the suggestion of white Bergerac's characteristic herbaceousness show.",88,Château Thénac 2009 Fleur du Périgord White (Bergerac Sec),,,,
"Minty and toasty upfront, this is layered with blackberry, licorice, leather and toast aromas. It feels raring and ready to go, courtesy of firm acidity and good overall framing. Flavors of wild berry are bright, with herb and oak accents. Long, toasty and solid on the finish.",91,Trapiche 2010 Broquel Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Baked, earthy aromas of raisin, fruitcake, ink and oak require plenty of air to show their best. A jammy, creamy, oaky palate is home to resiny flavors of vanilla, spice and berry fruits. The finish is woody, resiny and pasty, with ripe yet generic flavors in reserve.",88,Bodega Toneles 2011 Reserva Tonel 46 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"92-94 Barrel sample. A big, concentrated, powerful wine, yet also one restrained by elegant fresh fruits. There is plenty of style here, a complex mix of fruits, acidity and balanced tannins.",93,Château Langoa Barton 2008 Barrel sample  (Saint-Julien),,,,
"While the tannins are very present in this wine, it also has good acidity and blackberry fruits. It's firm and structured in the front, still young, although allowing plenty of room for the fruit to show strongly over the next few years. Drink from 2019.",88,Château le Sartre 2012  Pessac-Léognan,,,,
"This is a balanced wine, moving easily between rich fruit and a tight mineral and grapefruit texture. There is a hint of toast to give extra weight. Worth aging for several years.",92,Drappier 2002 Millésime Exception Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"San Polo has shown very impressive work lately and this velvety rich Brunello pushes its ambitions even further. The bouquet offers a long succession of beautiful aromas including black cherry, vanilla, carob, cola, cinnamon spice and black licorice. There's also a drying mineral note that adds a dusty touch of elegance and sophistication.",94,San Polo 2006  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"This wine seems slightly past peak with aromas of overripe apple, lees and pear. It's lightly sweet with the concentration not seeming all there.",85,Bunnell 2012 Wine O' Clock Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Dry and crisp but unripe, with vegetal flavors beside the modest cherries and currants. Drink now.",83,Moser Scharding 2005 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"Supple and silky, this expressive, seductive wine offers ripe plum and cherry fruit matched to polished tannins. It's finished with tasty barrel flavors of coconut, butter pecan and toast, and it is thoroughly, irresistibly delicious.",92,Saffron Fields Vineyard 2013 Dijon Clones Pinot Noir,,,,
"Made from 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Feteasca Neagra, this wine has a bright nose of black cherry and dark plum with just a whiff of mint. Flavors of blackberry and plum are joined in the mouth by a sophisticated touch of tobacco leaf that recedes with the arrival of the zesty finish.",89,Domeniile Panciu 2012 Sagio Red (Panciu),,,,
"This mature blend of Gewurztraminer, Sauvignon Blanc and Macabeo is oily, plump and fragrant, but also blocky, chunky and on its last legs of freshness. Flowery peach, melon and papaya flavors end short, with an oily mouthfeel.",87,Oliver Conti 2009 White (Empordà),,,,
"Intensely concentrated flavors of sweet cantaloupe, tangerine and peach belie the difficulties inherent to Mosel's 2013 vintage. This spätlese is unusually rich and silken on the palate, yet maintains a thrilling high-acid profile. Finishes long with lingering notes of honeysuckle and saffron.",93,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch) 2013 Berncasteler Doctor Spätlese Gold Cap Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"An everyday Cabernet, this has blackberry, plum and oak flavors. It's dry and full-bodied, and it will satisfy red wine drinkers at parties.",84,Cambridge & Sunset 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),,,,
"The aromas of herbs, pencil lead and blue and red fruit are forward, fresh and appealing. The flavors follow similarly, showing depth and balance uncommon for a wine this price.",90,Charles Smith 2013 Velvet Devil Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Cranberry and other red-fruit aromas are sort of raw, and the oak treatment on this wine is domineering and resiny. Amid the wood chips there's plum and boysenberry flavors, but as soon as you center in on those you also get dry tannins and a veneer of oak flavor.",84,Chilcas 2006 Reserva Merlot (Maule Valley),,,,
"Muddled strawberry and watermelon aromas and flavors are partnered with an earthy streak reminiscent of wet leaves. The palate is similarly fruit forward, with ample acidity that lifts the fruity richness and results in a short but clean finish.",85,Domaine Sainte-Eugénie 2015 Rosé (Corbières),,,,
"This opens with delicate aromas of soapy lavender flower, pressed rose petal, sweet marzipan and white pepper. The tannins seem evolved and silky, and there's a touch of sweet fruit on the finish.",91,Rivetti Massimo 2007 Serraboella Riserva  (Barbaresco),,,,
"This simple Extra Dry Prosecco Superiore opens with peach, nectarine, simple lines and a watery mouthfeel. The sparkler's momentum is achieved mostly by the creaminess of its bubbles.",85,Terra Serena NV Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
"Blueberry, chocolate, mint and clove aromas lead the nose of this blend of 50% Syrah, 35% Cabernet Franc and 15% Petit Verdot. The palate offers dried black cherries, coffee, cinnamon, black pepper and cocoa. Fine-grained tannins provide the framework.",89,OT 2009 Oliviero Toscani Red (Toscana),,,,
"This blend of Chenin Blanc and Cabernet Franc is the most successful of the Baumard sparkling wines. It is fruity, very fresh and crisp while also having the potential for some bottle aging. Acidity and a tangy aftertaste contribute to its lively freshness.",89,Domaine des Baumard NV Carte Turquoise Brut Sparkling (Crémant de Loire),,,,
"The Gleason family and winemaker Ryan Deovlet deliver a tropically inclined wine, with warm aromas of ripe melons, candied apples, pineapple and cherimoya. The flavors are also round, with Golden Delicious apples, Meyer lemon, apricot and a touch of marzipan poking out from behind a fresh citrusy veil.",88,Refugio Ranch 2012 Viognier (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Firmly tannic and structured, this has a dark, black-fruit character along with paprika and pepper. Blackberry and juicy plum flavors sit behind the tannins. This should develop over 5–6 years. Screwcap.",91,Gunter Triebaumer 2009 Plachen Reserve Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),,,,
"A complex, dark-cherry-flavored Petite Sirah, this is marked by bright fruit and tame tannins, giving the wine a mouthwatering vibrancy. Intense but full of life, bottle aging has helped this wine, as it often does with a variety like Petite Sirah, which can be overwhelming when young. In this case, the years have opened it up, lending an elegance that makes the wine ideal for meaty foods.",91,Sheldon 2007 Deviant Velocity Petite Sirah (Lodi),,,,
"Acidity and a ripe structure are on the way to giving a wine that will be rich, dense while remaining dry and firm. It is generous, concentrated and developing well. Black fruits and perfumed acidity are still buried in the tannins. Drink from 2019.",91,Quinta das Carvalhas 2011 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),,,,
"Powdery, creamy notes of rose, orange and mandarin oil unite in a concentrated, punchy palate that focuses on taste rather than aroma. This is rounded and rich with an immensely concentrated phenolic vein that lends structure and poise. The finish is lasting but demure.",91,Trimbach 2013 Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"Guidoalberto is the “pocketbook-friendly” alternative from the same estate that makes Sassicaia. But for $60, you could ask for more. This is a chewy, succulent wine with good length on the close. The aromas are awkward in places with espresso, chocolate yogurt and a touch of cheese rind.",87,Tenuta San Guido 2005 Guidalberto Red (Toscana),,,,
"This has come to epitomize the Hawke's Bay style of Sauvignon Blanc, typical in it's ripe fruit and oak treatment. Hints of vanilla and cedar frame passion fruit and pink grapefruit notes, then leave a lingering impression of Creamsicle behind on the silky-textured finish.",93,Te Mata 2013 Cape Crest Sauvignon Blanc (Hawke's Bay),,,,
"One of the most ripe, opulent and unctuous of the Anderson Valley wines, this full-bodied bottling smells and tastes like cinnamon, cherries, milk chocolate and brown sugar, but not as sweet as that sounds. The texture is very broad and mouth-coating and the alcohol feels on the high side, giving a feeling of power with polish.",92,Goldeneye 2012 Gowan Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),,,,
"L'Ecole consistently makes the best Chenin Blanc in the Northwest, if not the entire country. Done in an almost-dry Vouvray style, this engages the full range of varietal flavors. This has a scent of white flower and flavors of stone and citrus fruit, with overriding freshness and vitality that are heightened by the snappy, juicy acidity.",90,L'Ecole No. 41 2011 Chenin Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Forest berry and white cherry aromas are followed by slightly green notes of chopped sage or rosemary. This simple wine sports a lean mouthfeel, with a crisp but short finish.",84,Rubinelli Vajol 2011  Valpolicella Classico,,,,
"Aromas of mature black fruit, tobacco, allspice and mocha unfold in the glass along with a note of tilled earth. The opulent palate offers blackberry extract, dried plum, licorice and chocolate while velvety tannins provide support and give it a smooth texture. Drink through 2019.",91,La Braccesca 2009 Bramasole Syrah (Cortona),,,,
"Delicate scents of white flowers and fresh herbs frame the core notes of green apple and lime zest. Refreshing and easy drinking, ample acidity lifts the melon pith and citrus peel flavors that flesh out the medium-weight palate, finishing clean yet short.",84,Domaines Paul Mas 2015 Paul Mas Estate Single Vineyard Collection  (Picpoul de Pinet),,,,
"A very nice wine that's zesty and fresh in the mouth, and deep gold in color, the Vat 47 offers bright yellow fruit flavors, with light vanilla, toast and citrus accents. Nose is alternately perfumey and toasty. Tasted twice.",89,Tyrrell's 2000 Vat 47 Chardonnay (Hunter Valley),,,,
"There's lots of zesty acidity in this wine. Reviewed in March, it still had a spritz on the palate, although by the time of general release it should mellow out. It will still be a zingy wine, clean and almost dry with orange, peach, mango and honeysuckle flavors.",87,Balletto 2011 Estate Pinot Gris (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Reticent aromas of kiwi and herb are followed by tart, medium bodied citrus flavors. The concentration isn't as dense as it could be.",86,14 Hands 2015 The Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"This structured wine also has bright red fruits and juicy acidity. It's an attractive bottle now, the tannins showing through while leaving room for an elegant, leisurely aftertaste. Drink from 2015.",88,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2011  Vosne-Romanée,,,,
Almost overripe richness of fleshy peach pervades nose and medium-sweet palate. There is a heady overtone of vanilla into the bargain. For those who like it rich and decadent.,86,Willm 2011 Clos Gaensbroennel Kirchberg de Barr Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"A lovely Cabernet that shows the soft tannins and earthy herbaceousness of Alexander Valley. On a fruitier note are the cherries and red currants that are accented by sweet, smoky oak. Spicy and dry, this polished wine wants a few years in the cellar. 2011–2015.",91,Respite 2006 Reichel Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Layers of smoke, slate, saffron and pollen lend earthy, mineral complexities to bright honey and tangerine flavors in this off-dry kabinett. It's brisk and refreshingly juicy yet intriguingly nuanced. Drink now through 2018.",89,Heinz Eifel 2014 Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Aromas of underbrush, tobacco leaf, scorched earth, menthol and ripe berry lead the nose. The palate delivers juicy black cherry, raspberry, grilled herb, anisette and white pepper alongside round tannins. Drink through 2018.",90,Castello d'Albola 2011 Il Solatio Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"This is a spicy wine, with toasty wood flavors. Happily the fruit is also there, spreading its juicy acidity over the tannins. Let this wine fill out over the next few months and it will be ready to drink from 2017.",88,Château Lamothe-Vincent 2014 Intense  (Bordeaux),,,,
"Soft and buttery, this wine is smooth and creamy with hints of citrus and a tangy backdrop. With a lightly toasty edge, the wine finishes more tightly than it starts. Drink now.",88,Patriarche Père et Fils 2013 Fourchaume Premier Cru  (Chablis),,,,
"Alluring aromas of rose, iris, menthol and woodland berry waft out of the glass. The straightforward, polished palate offers ripe cherry, black raspberry, white pepper and star anise alongside fine-grained tannins.",89,Paolo Scavino 2011  Barolo,,,,
"This is a delicious, fruity wine, a blend of Arinto and Viognier. The Viognier does bring its trademark apricot flavor and creamy texture while the Arinto adds the bright acidity, citrus and crisp apples. The wine is ready to drink.",87,Herdade da Comporta 2016 Private Selection White (Península de Setúbal),,,,
"A blend of 80% Sémillon and 20% Sauvignon Blanc, both grown in Chiles Valley, this wine was 100% stainless-steel fermented. Jasmine and a sweetness of fresh-picked corn show off on the nose, while a wet stone minerality peeks through on the palate. Light and velvety, the wine offers body and complexity, and should age interestingly. Drink now through 2018.",90,Volker Eisele Family Estate 2013 Gemini Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"There are some attractive dried-spice notes built into this wine, but on the whole it's dominated by confected, jammy berry fruit. The texture is slightly syrupy, and the wine finishes soft. Despite the impressive moniker, it's an easy, entry-level Shiraz for the casual drinker.",84,Grant Burge 2007 Benchmark Shiraz (South Australia),,,,
"Dry and spicy, with a note of bacon to go with red berry fruit and leathery aromas. The palate is voluminous and round, with smooth tannins, balanced acids and nice flavors of roasted berry and dry plum. Finishes dry, elegant and with tea-like flavors. A wine to enjoy; good value for Rioja.",88,Bodegas Palacio 2007 Glorioso Crianza  (Rioja),,,,
"Stonestreet consistently delivers complex, refreshing renditions of Sauvignon Blanc. Grassy on the nose, with an exotic tease of pea shoot, it seemingly vibrates on the palate with lemon, grapefruit and apricot flavors.",91,Stonestreet 2015 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Alexander Valley),,,,
"An orange pink color and orange blossom aromas give the wine a fine start. The palate follows through with some richly textured fruit, full of fresh acidity but softened away from total crispness. There is an attractive, full finish.",88,Colin NV Rosé Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"This is a much more oaky version of the winery's Game Ranch regular bottling, which was released two years ago. The original release was very ripe in fruit but very tannic. This one's the same, but plastered with new oak.",86,Goldschmidt 2004 PLUS Game Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),,,,
"Wet stone and graphite scents up front give way to hints of honey and Earl Grey tea (bergamot). It's medium bodied and fades quickly on the finish, but it's a solid buy for under $10.",85,Half Mile Creek 2014 Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (South Eastern Australia),,,,
"The vast amount of complexity in this makes it a Cabernet Sauvignon on steroids. The acidity is mouthwatering, the tannins are hard, the oak is pronounced and the alcohol is evident. This wine is a fruit orchard in a glass, bursting with ripe blackberries, plums and cherries. The parts haven't begun to knit together, but six years in the cellar will allow them to begin the process.",90,Materra Cunat Family Vineyards 2010 Hidden Block Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),,,,
"For a simple Beaujolais, this has richness and fruit density. It's as fruity as the wine should be, but it also has firm tannins. The finish has a minerally texture along with black-currant-like acidity.",86,Domaine Chasselay 2011 La Platière  (Beaujolais),,,,
"Certain Argentine wines have a rustic, foxy character to them that reminds us that winemaking isn't a factory-proven science. This fits the bill; it's murky and sharp on the nose, with brambly raspberry sitting in wait. Feelwise, it's a bit too piercing and choppy.",83,Altocedro 2006 Año Cero Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Gournier's rosé is a full-bodied, richly textured wine, filled with cherry-berry fruit and accented by hints of crushed stone on both the aromatic nose and lengthy finish. Drink up.",89,Domaine de Gournier 2012 Rosé (Vin de Pays des Cévennes),,,,
"Generous Bing cherry and black plum flavors saturate this smooth and full-bodied wine, supplemented by subtle nutmeg, cinnamon and clove notes. It has a suave, mouth-filling texture, soft acidity and a warm spicy finish. Winemaker Greg Graziano blended in 14% Pinotage.",89,Saint Gregory 2014 Pinot Noir (Mendocino County),,,,
"This deliciously warm and ripe wine has swathes of red fruit that are full of energy and richness. It offers a touch of perfumed spice and good acidity. Drink now, although the wine will be better from early 2016.",88,Domaine de la Madone 2014 Tradition  (Beaujolais-Villages),,,,
"Rich and full, the wood and yellow fruit flavors are well integrated with the ripe acidity. Generous as well as elegant, it's a wine to drink now.",88,Vignerons de Buxy 2009 Les Chaniots Premier Cru  (Montagny),,,,
"Bright and brambly, this dense and textural wine brings strawberry and cherry fruit goodness front and center. It remains powerfully focused deep into a long finish, nuanced with cured meat and barrel toast.",93,Cristom 2013 Jessie Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
"Earthy and gritty cherry, tomato and herbal aromas set up a grabby, sticky, caramelized palate. Flavors of brown sugar and generic berry fruits finish with a hint of sweet chocolate. This is good but short on traditional Pinot Noir character.",86,Denario 2014 Pinot Noir (Río Negro Valley),,,,
"A beautiful, complex and upscale Cabernet to drink now, after a good decant. It's bone dry and a little soft, with intricately layered blackberry, black currant and oak flavors. Feels lush and important in the mouth, and the spicy finish lasts for a long time.",92,Steven Kent 2007 Home Ranch Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),,,,
"Amancaya, a blend of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, never fails to impress. This wine is rich and controlled but also alert and upright. It is juicy and succulent, with ripe blackberry and cassis at its base. Finishes tight and long, and sports a fine structure throughout.",90,Bodegas Caro 2006 Amancaya Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"The vanilla, coffee, red apple and hay aromas are initially quite light and not fully in sync. The red fruit flavors are rich and full, pulling no punches.",89,Dumas Station 2013 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Tannic while also fruity, it shows the structure of 2010. It has a fragrant character with its black currant and berry fruits, laced with acidity. A wine that could age, it will be better drunk from 2016.",86,Château Thuron 2010 Tradition  (Bordeaux Supérieur),,,,
"This is full-bodied expression of the variety, big in oak and tannin presence, grippy still, with a leathery feel on the palate. Baked plum is seasoned by a hint of clove and cola, finishing expansively.",88,MacMurray Estate Vineyards 2013 Winemaker's Block Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"The label shows a pretty graphic of a young woman in flapper attire—the actual Stella Fino. Clean, fresh and true to varietey, with appealing melon and apple flavors, this displays confident winemaking with an elegant touch.",88,Stella Fino 2006 Pinot Gris (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Stony, minerally aromas are a touch dusty and suggest melon and peach. The palate is round and juicy, while flavors of lime, green melon and gooseberry finish mellow and easy, with a touch of residual citric acid.",88,Vicente Gandia 2013 Nebla Verdejo (Rueda),,,,
"Delightfully fun and refreshing, this perlwein, or lightly sparkling white, is Germany's answer to Italian prosecco. Made from Müller-Thurgau grapes, it's gorgeously floral, but with a chalky, earthen tang. Sprightly acidity and a fresh, green touch lends vibrance to a moderately long finish.",90,Fritz Müller NV Perlwein Trocken Müller-Thurgau (Rheinhessen),,,,
"The inaugural release of this producer's GSM blend is comprised of 55% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 12% Mourvèdre. Jammy and dense in blackberry, espresso and leather, it offers a mouthful of flavor and intensity without ever becoming over the top.",90,Davis Family 2012 Throne G-S-M (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Deep golden-yellow in the glass, this wine offers honeyed, candied aromas of mango, crystallized vanilla and golden raisin. It's thick and unctuous on the palate, with more honey, spun sugar, honeysuckle and fruit-nectar flavors that are delicious, but would be aided by a boost of acidity.",88,Talbott 2012 R&V Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Late Harvest Riesling (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Aromas of mineral, smoke and floral black fruit are attractive, while the palate is focused and nimble, with red fruit, rhubarb and herbal notes. There's a wild, rather natural character to this wine along with a solid finish that brings herb flavors and medium tannic bite.",87,Viña Casablanca 2007 Nimbus Estate Single Vineyard Syrah (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"William Church has outdone itself with this new Viognier, a mix of fruit from Conner Lee and Gamache Vineyards. A leesy, yeasty, textural underpinning complements the tangy lemon, lime, grapefruit and tangerine flavors. It's superfresh and delicious.",90,William Church 2011 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This wine is already ripe and rounded. It has good balance between the rich apple and pear fruits and acidity, along with an attractive mineral texture. Drink this fruity wine now.",88,Château de la Rivière 2016  Bordeaux Blanc,,,,
"The oaky power of this wine is its hallmark, giving smoky, buttered toast, vanilla and woody extract tastes to the underlying pineapple and pear flavors. Would be better if the oak weren't quite so dominant.",85,Artesa 2006 Reserve Chardonnay (Carneros),,,,
"Positive, bright citrus elements in this Albariño are marred by uncomplimentary mushroom and sour hay notes. Though the mouthfeel is even, and one can detect the crispness behind, the odd qualities depress the flavor profile. —M.M.",81,Vionta 2000 Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"Honeylike aromas, ripe peach and apple flavors and rather full body give this wine good depth and breadth. It seems like just the thing for a picnic or to serve with cheese at a party.",88,Balo 2014 Pinot Gris (Anderson Valley),,,,
"Pungent, pure aromas of citrus and tarragon are appealing. This feels upright and tangy, with bright, driving acidity. Grapefruit, lime and jalapeño flavors finish juicy, with leftover citrus notes and a dash of white pepper.",89,San Pedro 2016 Castillo de Molina Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Elqui Valley),,,,
"A cuvée of Riesling, with a tiny splash of Moscato, this is on the sweet side of brut. Scents of wet paper carry into disjointed flavors of waxy lemon and simple sugar.",83,Wetzel Estate NV Cuvée Blanc Sparkling (Willamette Valley),,,,
"The wine has red fruits and spice from wood aging. It suffers from the lean character of the vintage, giving a wine that shows tannins while not having enough fruitiness. Drink from 2017.",85,Château Montaiguillon 2013  Montagne-Saint-Émilion,,,,
"This Perli is a gem, a gorgeous reminder that California Syrah can be a liquified representation of beauty. Carrying violet overtones, the wine offers just-picked raspberry and a pronounced entry of peppery spice. Soft it has a long finish and complex subtleties approaching magic. Sit this wine in your cellar if you dare—it's so good to drink now.",95,Donkey & Goat 2010 Perli Vineyard Syrah (Mendocino Ridge),,,,
"There's tremendous fruit on this Zinfandel, mostly of the red and black forest berry type. It's also spicy, showing Zin's cinnamon, nutmeg and white pepper notes. The criticism is that high alcohol makes it feel hot and finish glyceriney sweet.",85,Frei Brothers 2011 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Fresh and fruity without overdoing it, this medium-bodied wine has light notes of apple, banana, peach and cherry in the aromas and the flavors, and a good snappy texture to balance them out. Perfect for the cocktail hour.",88,Bella Grace 2016 3 Graces Blanc White (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),,,,
"A small-production vintage-dated sparkler made from 67% Pinot Noir and 33% Chardonnay, this wine succeeds in its smooth refined contour of peach mousse and vanilla. It's dry, but voluptuously rich, remaining balanced through the tangy tart finish.",91,Gloria Ferrer 2010 Anniversary Cuvée Sparkling (Carneros),,,,
"An oily white-fruit aroma is overrun by a heavy oak scent, leaving notes of resin and toast on the bouquet. The wine feels fleshy, and the palate keeps that theme going with baked flavors of apple and peach. This is about as oaky as a wine can be and still be very good.",87,Domaine Jean Bousquet 2010 Grande Reserve Chardonnay (Tupungato),,,,
"This complex vineyard-designate is memorably full bodied and richly concentrated. It's integrated in terms of oak, with bold, forceful aromas and flavors of cured meat, salt and dried herb. Made in small amounts, it impresses from the pull of the cork through the last sip.",94,Flanagan 2014 Bacigalupi Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This unusual 100% varietal offering comes from this winery's young estate vineyard. Aromatically it offers notes of candied red apple, wheat cereal, raspberries and dry chocolate. The chocolate, cherry and apple flavors are sweet, ripe and full, backed by dry, grainy tannins.",88,JM Cellars 2012 Louisa Margaret's Vineyard Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"This blend of Syrah (52%), Petit Sirah (24%), Mourvèdre (16%) and Grenache from StoneTree and Red Heaven vineyards is appealing with its chocolate, mulberry and peppery spices. It's high-octane and richly flavored with a lingering blue-fruit and meat-filled finish backed by lightly chalky tannins.",91,Dusted Valley 2012 Wallywood Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This is the real deal, as they say, a fine, intricate Pinot Noir. The vineyard is famous for producing complex wines, and the winemaker has vinified the grapes well, resulting in a dry, silky wine. Waves of raspberries and cherries are balanced with earthier notes of mushrooms and minerals. The wine should age well for a good eight years, but it's easy to enjoy now.",92,Fontes & Phillips 2010 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"There's a lot to admire in this producer's entry-level wine in terms of price and complexity, a blend of 71% Cabernet Sauvignon with 25% Merlot and 1% each of Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Syrah. Burnt wood and herb underlie full-bodied, sizable waves of black-fruit flavor, graphite, tar and coffee.",91,Medlock Ames 2013 Bell Mountain Estate Red (Alexander Valley),,,,
The Arroyo Seco region of Monterey County takes a big leap forward with this richly textured Chardonnay. Ripe tropical fruit and citrus flavors combine with smoky oak notes and crisp acidity. It's a a fine wine that should not be consumed too cold.,90,Blair 2012 Roger Rose Vineyard Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),,,,
"Not clear what the varietal blend is, but it's like a nice, easy southern Rhône wine. Soft and fruity, it's rich in jammy blackberry, cherry, Mandarin orange, chocolate and anise spice flavors.",85,Benessere 2005 Costa Del Sol Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Light to medium in body, crisp and grassy in style, this is a solid choice for the money. Pineapple and passion fruit peek through the herbal overtones. Drink now.",86,Echo Bay 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"Though considered a rosé, Grenache Gris is actually its own grape, and a delicious one at that. Pale pink in color, this shows bubblegum, watermelon, rose petal, strawberry and cola spice on the nose. The palate is marked by boisterous, lemon-like acidity yet remains soft and welcoming, with sweet cotton candy touches.",92,Curran 2016 Grenache Gris Rosé (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Juicy, wooded and herbal, this full-bodied wine is deliciously layered in plum, cherry and blackberry, well composed and sourced from a site in Yountville. The grippy texture is accented in dark chocolate that gives velvety lushness that lasts through the finish.",94,Peter Paul Wines 2013 Giuliani Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"You'll love the smoked bacon and bresaola notes that emerge at the top of this deep bouquet. At the back are notes of ripe fruit, black cherry, dusty mineral and exotic spice. The wine offers a tight and compact feel with a long, smooth finish.",91,Gianfranco Bovio 2007 Vigne Gattera  (Barolo),,,,
"If you can accept a slight hint of jamminess, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot is for you. Beyond the ripe cherry and blackberry is a beautiful blast of pleasure and opulence. Pair this wine with succulent cuts of red meat.",91,Cipriana 2007 San Martino  (Bolgheri Superiore),,,,
"Boysenberry and blueberry form the fruit aromas on this wine made by the family of former Los Angeles Laker Sasha Vujacic. In addition, it features a dark black-dirt minerality, black olive, cinnamon bark and absinthe-like scents. The tannins coat the mouth along with blue and purple fruit flavors, and it ends with strong acidity.",93,S&G; Estate 2010 Aleksander Reserve Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"Aromas include black berries, coffee, espresso and grilled Mediterranean herbs. The one-dimensional palate lacks the essential fruit richness needed to support the bracing, astringent tannins that give a drying, bitter character. It also displays evident alcohol sensations despite the modest alcohol.",86,Cordella 2009  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"One of the appellation's more famous wines, this opens in black licorice and blackberry, alongside a streak of malted chocolate, soft and sinewy, with a tension of acidity that adds age-worthy structure. Dense and interesting now, it'll get better over time, cellaring well through 2027.",94,Beaulieu Vineyard 2012 Georges de Latour Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Oak, ripe berry, toast, menthol and vanilla aromas set the tone. On the bracing palate, notes of mocha, espresso and licorice accent dried black cherry while astringent tannins leave a raspy finish.",88,Boasso 2012 Gabutti  (Barolo),,,,
This aromatic wine conveys notes of Mounds Bar and dark cherries along with a whiff of volatility. It's full bodied with semisweet fruit flavors along with abundant vanilla accents.,89,Henry Earl 2010 Merlot (Red Mountain),,,,
"Made entirely with the native grape Bombino Nero, this informal light-bodied wine has subdued aromas of wild cherry and a hint of crushed herb. The aromas carry over to the über-simple palate along with a hint of pink grapefruit.",84,Rivera 2016 Rosé (Castel del Monte),,,,
"This has mocha, game and black-skinned berry aromas. The dense palate evokes cured meat, espresso and prune, framed by grainy, mouth puckering tannins. Drink through 2021.",87,Podere La Vigna 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Aromas of red berry, espresso, underbrush and French oak lead the nose along with a balsamic note. The bright, sleek palate evokes wild cherry, crushed raspberry, pipe tobacco and licorice alongside tightly knit, fine-grained tannins that lend refined support. Drink 2020–2028.",92,Castello Romitorio 2012 Filo di Seta  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"The vineyard is near the northwest edge of the Sonoma Coast, a wild, rugged mountainous region whose personality seems stamped on the wine. It's enormously rich in Dijonesque fruit, offering an array of red and black currants, cherries, pomegranates, anise, cinnamon and pepper. For all the opulence, the wine is dry and balanced. But it's just a baby. Hold until late 2010, if you can.",94,Hartford Court 2007 Velvet Sisters Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),,,,
"A nice Cabernet for everyday usage largely because it's balanced, mild and under total control. The nose is pure red fruits with a touch of leather, while the palate is snappy, alert and full of tight, almost narrow cherry flavors and fine tannins. Dry and light on the finish.",87,O. Fournier 2009 Urban Maule Cabernet Sauvignon (Maule Valley),,,,
"Pressed from Lagrein grapes native to northern Italy, this bright rosé offers an easy, crisp finish with tones of wild berries, peach and pink grapefruit.",86,Josef Weger 2010 Lagrein Rosato Rosé (Alto Adige),,,,
"Clean, vibrant in acidity and ripe in fruit, with lemon and lime flavors accented with a hit of green gooseberries. The finish is totally dry and stimulating. The cool 2012 vintage has given this wine elegance, making it a another value after the 2010 and 2011.",90,Long Meadow Ranch 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford),,,,
"Prickly green-herb and cactus aromas are punchy but not overly pungent. This offers a mix of softer tropical acidity and harder citric brightness, which sets the stage for flavors of grapefruit, lime and tropical fruits. A steady, lively finish is lasting.",91,Leyda 2016 Lot 4 Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),,,,
"Supple and structured, this delicious red offers scents of Mediterranean scrub, mint, blue flowers and ripe berries. Made with 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 20% Alicante, the juicy palate delivers Morello cherry, cassis, mocha and wild aromatic herb notes. Supple tannins carry the savory flavors. Enjoy through 2016.",92,Tenuta Monteti 2011 Caburnio Red (Toscana),,,,
"Made by Carmen Stevens, one of South Africa's first black female winemakers, this is a gorgeous blend with rich aromas and flavors of black currant leaf, licorice, cigar tobacco, boysenberry and black cherry.

"Over the years, Altimus—a blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Tannat—has been all over the map. This vintage is quite good, with burly aromas of bacon, balsam wood, campfire and black fruit. It's a load in the mouth, where minty, lemony oak flavors vie with blackberry and foresty herb notes. Leather and tobacco flavors appear on the feisty finish.",89,Michel Torino 2009 Altimus Red (Cafayate),,,,
"This is warm region, warm vintage Syrah at its decadent best. It opens with generous aromas of raspberry and blackberry jam, along with plum pit, mineral, black olive and smoked meat. The flavors are velvety and palate coating, rich and intense, with black-fruit notes that glide on the extended finish. The sense of texture is dazzling.",93,Efeste 2014 Ceidleigh Syrah (Red Mountain),,,,
"It's important to not drink this Merlot right out of the bottle, because it's pretty tannic, and thus it's hard to appreciate the wine's beautiful fruit. Give it some time in a decanter to reveal the complex flavors of blackberry, cherry jam, grilled prosciutto, cassis, red licorice, cola and spice. It's unclear if this will age for a long time, but it can certainly be enjoyed over the next five years.",91,Shafer 2010 Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"With creamy Encruzado and perfumed Malvasia in the blend, this is a deliciously full-bodied wine. There is a smoky character as well as a creamy texture. The wine is young and fruity but ready to drink, although it will be better from 2018.",90,Casa da Passarella 2016 Branco White (Dão),,,,

"White flowers, green apple, pear, lime and mineral notes come together on this linear, lightly sparkling wine. Refermenting in the bottle on its yeasts gives it a slightly cloudy appearance and a fine sediment at the bottom. It has a dry, almost austere finish.",87,Valdellövo 2012 Bade  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
"Underbrush, grilled herb, roasted coffee bean and dark-skinned berry aromas unfold in the glass. The elegantly structured palate delivers red cherry, raspberry, sage, anise and clove framed in bright acidity and fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2020.",91,Castello di Fonterutoli 2013 Ser Lapo Riserva  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"Here's a big, bold Pinot of tremendous fruity extract. Although It's a bit heavy and soft, it's very delicious, offering waves of cherries, pomegranates and smoked meat, accented with sandalwood. Advances the cause of Pinot Noir grown in this southern Napa Valley region, which is almost in the Carneros.",89,Monticello Vineyards 2009 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Oak Knoll District),,,,
"This Bordeaux blend is dry, smooth and complex. There's a wonderful earthiness and herbalilty to it, with green olives complementing Cabernet's blackberry and black currant fruit, as well as the effects of oak aging. Shows real elegance and interest, at a very fair price. Drink now.",90,Gain Bay 2008 Cabernet Family Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Hazelnut, candle wax, dried apple and nectarine aromas show on the nose of this rich and nutty bottling. Similar flavors show on the palate, including dried apples, Meyer lemon, and a honeyed character that lasts into the finish.",87,Derby 2013 Derby Vineyard Albariño (Paso Robles),,,,
"Made with native grape Magliocco, this structured wine conveys aromas of scorched earth, spiced plum and vanilla. On the palate, touches of white pepper, tobacco, toast and licorice accent the core of juicy black cherry, while racy acidity and assertive tannins provide the framework. The finish lingers, closing on a coffee note.",90,Librandi 2011 Magno Megonio Magliocco (Val di Neto),,,,

"Too sweet and Porty. This mountain-grown Syrah has rich cherry-berry flavors and smooth tannins, but seems to have some residual sugar that makes it taste more like a dessert wine than a table wine.",83,VJB 2005 Syrah (El Dorado County),,,,
"From the distant 1994 vintage, this Vin Santo blend of Trebbiano and Malvasia has been aged an astonishing 15 years in small oak barrel. You can detect some of that evolution on the bouquet thanks to aromas of dried apricot, marron glacé, maple syrup and candied fruit with cinnamon spice. It's a sweet, thick wine with great intensity and the potential to age many more years to come.",93,Fattoria di Grignano 1994 Riserva  (Vin Santo del Chianti Rufina),,,,
"A soft and fruity style of rosé from a small Aube producer, this is ripe with red berry fruit and bright with acidity and orange zest tang. Dominated by Chardonnay, its color coming from still Pinot Noir wine, it's ready to drink now.",88,Lété-Vautrain NV Brut Royal Rosé  (Champagne),,,,
"This fine marriage of site and winemaker shows experience and intuition at work, presenting a full-bodied, lush and plush expression of tremendous depth and complexity. It offers notes of tart apple, licorice and a wealth of orange zest, which adds a touch of citrusy crispness to the naturally buoyant minerality and nuanced oak. It has much more to share; drink now through 2020.",95,Patz & Hall 2014 Hyde Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros),,,,
"This delicately carbonated Riesling sparkler offers all of the grape's characteristic aromatic exuberance. It's blossomy and plump in notes of sweet peach, apple and lemon, yet bristling and spry. An easy going, light-bodied sip for everyday enjoyment.",88,Glenora 2016 Bubbly Riesling (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Pineapple appears first on the nose and palate, followed by high-toned acidity and a back-up of lemon and lime. Medium bodied, the wine remains light and crisp throughout, finishing in a swirl of lemon zest and grapefruit pith.",90,Rodney Strong 2014 Charlotte's Home Estate Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc (Northern Sonoma),,,,
Here's a pleasantly fresh and fruit-forward Barbera d'Asti with notes of wild berry and blackberry backed by a delicate touch of vanilla spice and bitter chocolate.

"A slightly orange shade of pink, this rosé offers faded notes of strawberry, cooked plum, melon and orange peel on the nose. The palate mingles light, tart red fruit and fresh citrus.",87,Orfila 2016 Rose of Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"Big, ripe and juicy, with some overripenes veering into raisins, but it gives a rich plummy edge to the wild berries, tobacco and spice. Drink this impressive Zinfandel with roasts and beef stews.",88,JR Wine 2006 Boschetti Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),,,,
"The ripe fruit of this vintage is right up front in this strawberry and spice-flavored wine. With a texture that adds a touch of tannin to the fruitiness, it is smooth and round. Drink this aromatic wine from 2018.",87,Château des Loges 2015 Sélection  (Beaujolais-Villages),,,,
"Leathery, mossy aromas of dark-berry fruits lead to a bright, energetic, acid-driven palate with quality flavors of plum and spiced blackberry. This has zest and savory notes on the finish, and overall it's fresh in feel, tasty and not too demanding.",88,Indomita 2011 Duette Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère (Maipo Valley),,,,
"Light and luminous in appearance, this bright Rosso di Montalcino delivers subdued aromas of raspberry, cherry, cola and wet earth. None of these aromas are particularly intense, but they are balanced.",86,Geografico Castello Tricerchi 2008  Rosso di Montalcino,,,,
"This creative blend of 74% Viognier, 19% Chardonnay, 4% Grenache Blanc and 3% Albariño delivers a juicy nose of squeezed orange and peach with tangerine-rind edge and yellow-cake warmth. There's a flash of acidity at first sip, then the flavors dive toward green apples, guava and banana, altogether both ripe and sour.",85,Quadrant 2013 White (Paso Robles),,,,
"Fresh lemon and lime and a spray of minerals and sea salt gives this wine a slightly lean, austere character. Clean and bright and not overly complicated, it will pair well with shellfish and grilled seafood.",84,Argyros 2007 Estate Assyrtico (Santorini),,,,
"There's lovely vibrancy to the nose of this bottling, with tangy cranberry, hibiscus and strawberry aromas, yet those are deftly cut by peppercorns, brown spice and turned earth. The mouthfeel is engagingly peppery, with spicy bay leaf and thyme herbs, a touch of cured Kalamata olives and an underlying, underripe raspberry and cranberry fruit base.",93,Comartin 2014 Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"This very lemony wine is crisp and cool from the mountain vineyards of Savoy. It has a bright, creamy texture and baked-apple and pear flavors accented with a shot of citrusy acidity. It's a wine to drink now.",89,Domaine de l'Idylle 2012  Roussette de Savoie,,,,

The flavors are delicate, ranging from cherry to cedar to Italian herbs, with some noticeable complexity.",87,Edna Valley Vineyard 2012 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),,,,
"A yellowish color announces this oaked Albariño. Aromas of sunflower seeds and stone fruits are more mellow than loud. Creamy and full bodied, this benefits from bold malic acidity. Flavors of summer corn, dried apple and wood resin finish salty. Drink now with fish, crab or lobster.",89,La Caña 2013 Navia Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"Viognier is a particular strength at Penner-Ash, and here, once again, the challenge of balancing the grape's high-wire sensibility is met with ease. Firm and compact initially, it blooms with delicious flavors of lemon pastry, hints of mint, and lemongrass. It's full bodied, poised and steers clear of both bitterness and burn.",92,Penner-Ash 2015 Viognier (Oregon),,,,
"The combination of acidity, dark fruits and a minerality give this wine both great density and a fine potential. It is firm, showing the terroir of the Douro well in its grainy texture while also bringing acidity into play. It is young, concentrated and needs to age. Drink from 2017.",92,Companhia das Quintas 2012 Quinta da Fronteira Grande Reserva Red (Douro),,,,

"Whiffs of smoke and spice introduce heady aromas of white flower, lychee and stone fruit.

Drink from 2018.",95,Joseph Drouhin 2013 Clos de la Garenne Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),,,,
"Perhaps one of the best wines for the money available right now, Andrew Murray delivers aromas of cherry, blackberry, lavender and a white pepper wow factor on the very inviting, florally driven nose.

The wine is rich and ripe, with just the right amount of tannic structure for the fruit.",93,Château Lagrange 2010  Saint-Julien,,,,

"Made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon with a handful of Merlot and Petit Verdot, this wine is on the cooler-climate side of the sensory equation, a note of pencil and olive here, a bit of juicy cranberry there. Chalky tannins complete the picture, the wine balanced and medium to light in weight.",90,Vellum 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"A lovely wine that, despite its youthful impertinence, shows dramatic flair now and should develop in the short term. It has the weight and structure of a fine Cabernet Sauvignon, with flavors that veer toward red cherries, sweet leather and pomegranates. All this is kept in tight rein by acidity. This is a balanced wine that wants to assist food.",91,Russian Hill 2005 Top Block Syrah (Russian River Valley),,,,
"A big, bold, tannic Zinfandel, the kind that needs richly sauced barbecued and roasted meats to tame it into submission. It's peppery, with brooding black currant, licorice and teriyaki beef flavors.",89,Beauregard 2010 Beauregard Ranch Zinfandel (Ben Lomond Mountain),,,,
"This Zinfandel is a bit rustic, with a jagged mouthfeel. It offers sweet-tasting varietal flavors of wild berry, spice and tobacco, plus a touch of prune.",83,Kokomo 2010 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,

"Black cherry and blueberry fruit show on the dense, dark nose of this bottling, alongside clove, allspice, nutmeg, purple flower, crushed rosebuds and dust.

"Lime sherbet and wet-stone aromas are classic for the variety and region. This is a light- to medium-bodied wine, dry, with high acidity that drives it through a long, zesty finish. Drink it now with raw oysters or ceviche, or cellar it another five years to develop greater weight and complexity.",90,Kilikanoon 2015 Mort's Block Riesling (Clare Valley),,,,
"There are some curious, almost Syrah-like elements to this bottling from a rural region between Santa Clarita and Palmdale, but it's an interesting wine. Aromas of concentrated blueberry and blackberry meet with tar, peppercorn and black licorice on the nose. Then the palate shows dark fruit with fennel, oregano, marjoram, black-olive and beef-crust flavors.",88,Reyes 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sierra Pelona Valley),,,,
"Alluring notes of Asian five spice and wet stone frame ripe cherry aromas in this medium-bodied wine. The texture is firm, becoming faintly dusty on the finish, but the wine is approachable now for its cherry fruit and appealing damp clay quality. Drink now–2018.",91,Akarua 2012 Bannockburn Pinot Noir (Central Otago),,,,
"Light and fruity, this is a delicious wine with no sides. It has green fruits, citrus, a touch of perfume and good acidity. From old vineyards with mixed plantings, this is a blend in the typical Viennese tradition. Screwcap.",88,Cobenzl 2012 Gemischter Satz Classic White (Vienna),,,,
"Briny, wiry red-fruit aromas are mild but saucy. This blend of Garnacha and Tempranillo feels ordinary, while flavors of briny plum are fresh but limited. A finish with a healthy pulse is fine for what this is.",85,Bodegas Aragonesas 2014 Crucillón Garnacha-Tempranillo (Campo de Borja),,,,

"Kana's Workingman's Red has turned into a southern Rhône style blend of six grapes, the only outlier being a splash of Tempranillo.

"While lower-priced than some of the Loring single-vineyard wines, this offers compelling characteristics and complexity.

Martini 2012 Lot No. 1 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,

That could calm down eventually, leaving behind a big, flavorful and dry red wine, brimming with berries, cherries and cola.",86,Furthermore 2008 Bohemian Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Crisp, pristine peach and apricot notes resonate through the nose and palate of this fresh, blossomy dry Riesling. While zesty and lithe in body, ripe grapefruit and melon flavors feel supple and silky on the palate. Drink now through 2019.",91,Weingut Liebfrauenstift 2014 Dry Riesling (Rheinhessen),,,,
"There's an appealing nose of ripe yellow stone fruit, spice and an earthy minerality. Medium-sweet with a lovely rich texture, fleshy, but well balanced by the refreshing acidity. Smooth and broad across the palate, showing strong flavor intensity that lingers. Long, with a persistent layered, minerally finish.",89,G&M; Machmer 2008 Bechtheimer Stein Spätlese Gewürztraminer (Rheinhessen),,,,
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (73%), Merlot (20%) and Cabernet Franc (7%) comes from vines at Champoux Vineyard that average 34 years of age. It's soft and seductive with notes of coffee bean, chocolate, and olive backed by slightly gritty tannins.",91,Andrew Will 2010 Sorella Red (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"With its concentration and dark tannins, this is a wine that will need many years of aging. It is a serious combination of great style and great power. From one of the top Douro vineyards, this is a wine with an impressive, long-lasting sense of presence.",95,Quinta do Vale Meão 2009 Red (Douro),,,,
"Deep gold in color, this wine opens with a whiff of caramelized apple, mango and pineapple, following through with a richness of those flavors. Robust with a backdrop of chiseled minerality, it's brawny, full-bodied and brisk.",92,Raymond 2014 Generations Chardonnay (Napa Valley),,,,
"Oaky, spicy and tannic, this is showing some sharp edges around moderately ripe plum and cherry fruit. It's solid and substantial, a bit blocky, and currently showing more barrel influence than fruit. All estate fruit, 40% new French oak. Additional bottle age might improve the score.",88,Iris Vineyards 2012 Reserve Pinot Noir (Oregon),,,,
"Pronounced dust, pollen and earth tones lend savoriness to this otherwise citrusy wine. Racy acidity and fresh tangerine and lemon flavors turn herbal on the finish. Drink now.",86,P.J. Valckenberg 2015 Undone Dry Riesling (Rheinhessen),,,,
"The vanilla and cookie-dough lick of toasty oak lends softness, warmth and spice to the red currant fruit of this slender, but elegant wine. Slightly more bottle age is needed for fruit and wood to marry completely, but it finishes with a wonderfully savory flourish of pepper and undergrowth. Ready from 2015.",90,Markowitsch 2011 Reserve Pinot Noir (Carnuntum),,,,
"Light and gently spicy, this first-ever varietal Grenache from Sineann offers cranberry, pomegranate and boysenberry fruit, lots of acid and a quick fade.",87,Sineann 2007 Scorched Earth Vineyard Grenache (Columbia Valley (OR)),,,,
"Aromas bring notes of beeswax, lees and lemon. The palate is medium bodied and creamy in feel, backed by zippy acidity. The variety isn't entirely distinct but, despite this, it delivers appeal.",87,Bontzu 2016 Pinot Gris (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Rooty, earthy aromas of cola, baking spices, blackberry and pepper are potent and ripe. Like always, this is a generous, well-balanced example of Ribera del Duero with toasty oak flavors riding on top of baking spice, plum and cassis notes. Vanilla and mint flavors on the finish are oak-based, while modest heat and burn call for short-term aging. Drink through 2019.",91,Emilio Moro 2012  Ribera del Duero,,,,
"Fragrant and fresh, this sleek red offers scents of wild berry and just-picked violet. The smooth palate provides juicy red cherry, crushed raspberry and a hint of spice alongside bright acidity and supple tannins. Enjoy now.",88,Feudi di San Gregorio 2014 Lachryma Christi Rosso Red (Vesuvio),,,,
"Plum and cherry aromas are generic in nature. This feels jammy and candied, while heavy berry fruit and oak flavors combine to keep things basic and muddled.",83,Viña Bisquertt 2012 La Joya Gran Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"Buttery and smooth, this shows toasty apple and melon fruit, butter and some framing skin phenolics. It's another excellent example of the superlative Chardonnays being made in the Willamette Valley.",91,Rex Hill 2011 Dijon Clone Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This vintage of Peg Bay's Pinot shows the firm structure of the year, suggesting 2–3 years of cellaring. But while the black cherry fruit may not be immediately accessible, there's plenty of it, touched with herbal, minty complexity and a touch of oaky toast on the finish.",90,Pegasus Bay 2005 Pinot Noir (Waipara Valley),,,,
"Dry aromas of leafy, spicy red-berry fruits register as complex and mature. Medium in body, it has integrated tannins and acids. Flavors of lightly baked cherry and sweet red currant are earthy and finish with notes of cocoa powder, raspberry and plum. Drink now.",89,Hubert Weber 2006 Vineyard Selection Merlot (Mendoza),,,,
"A partnership between winemaker Chris Phelps, who makes the wines for Swanson, and his son, Josh, this Cab is silky in currant, cassis and black raspberry, the oak more sweet than overwhelming. With room to age through 2015–2017, let it open before enjoying.",90,Ad Vivum 2011 Sleeping Lady Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville),,,,
"For such a young wine, this is surprisingly mature. Its tannins have softened and rounded, becoming well integrated with the black currant flavor and bright acidity. It's an attractive choice to drink now or over the next few years, but not for long-term aging.",87,Château Bel Enclos 2010 Cuvée Evidence  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),,,,
"Aromas of kirsch and spiced plum mix with smoked meat, blue fruit and assorted herbs, with the Viognier (4%) blended in adding a floral top note. The palate offers dense, layered blue-fruit flavors that glide on the finish. Best by 2020.",93,K Vintners 2012 The Beautiful Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Red berry aromas and spicy fruit give a wine that is ripe and smooth, with just the lightest of tannins. It's all fruit—juicy and open. Drink now.",86,Famille Laplace 2016 Aramis Tannat-Syrah (Vin de France),,,,
"A lovely counterpoint to Phelps Creek's estate reserve Chardonnay, this comes from just across the river, sourced from a vineyard on the Washington side of this two-state AVA. It got the full malolactic, fermented in French oak treatment, and shows plenty of pleasing barrel toast and spice. The fruit mixes hints of peach and melon with a lemon drop core, and finishes with a lick of butterscotch.",90,Phelps Creek 2008 Celilo Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Gorge (OR)),,,,
"This is a rich, full-bodied and generous wine. It has great red berry flavors that are supported by a light oak character and freshened with acidity. Although young, it is ready to drink.",88,Fiuza 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Tejo),,,,
"Aromas of mature dark-skinned fruit, sunbaked earth, violet and a whiff of espresso lead the nose. The juicy palate doles out ripe black cherry, anise, clove and a hint of coffee alongside round tannins. Enjoy soon.",88,Livernano 2012 Casalvento  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"This wine is densely packed in ripe red-fruit aromas and flavors, but still expressive in earthy notes of cocoa nib, anise and black tea. Medium tannins and plush berry flavors flesh out the mouthfeel, with a crushed satin texture. The evolving finish seamlessly transitions between ripe, fleshy fruit flavors to cherry skin and finally lightly charred oak and woody spice. Drink now–2018.",91,Radford Dale 2012 Freedom Pinot Noir (Elgin),,,,
"This delivers inky dark, brooding aromas of black fruit, dark spice, molasses, resin, tar and cured meat. The mouthfeel is soft and chewy, with a sticky mocha flavor and a spicy endnote of barbecue spice.",92,Musella 2007 Riserva  (Amarone della Valpolicella),,,,
"Simple and neutral, with sweetness to the nose. It's soft and flabby in the mouth, with candied vanilla and melon flavors. Sweet and low in intensity, and already it's dull despite being a new release.",82,Quasar 2010 Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley),,,,
"This inexpensive Rhône white represents a notable bargain. It's medium to full in body, but balanced. Slightly confected notes of Turkish delight, melon and pineapple flavors coat the palate, lingering through the long finish. Drink now.",89,Brotte 2016 Bord Elegance White (Laudun),,,,
"This aromatic barrel selection employs multiple clones, from a winery which lays claim to farming more Pinot Noir clones than any in Oregon. Black cherry, cola and spice combine, leading into pinpoint tannins with a pleasing sweetness from the barrel aging. Drink over the next five years.",91,WillaKenzie Estate 2014 Jory Hills Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),,,,
"An enormously appealing Cabernet, this is nearly as good as the magnificent but more expensive '09 Estate, showing concentrated blackberry, blueberry, cassis and mineral flavors that are wrapped into firm Diamond Mountain tannins. Beautiful to drink now and over the next six years.",93,Von Strasser 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),,,,
"A big and bold wine, showing black plum fruits, an impressive structure and a solid, foursquare feel. It is obviously a wine for aging. Give it 2–3 years.",89,Château Saint-Sernin 2008 Prestige Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"Fresh, clean and rather soft in balance, this shows easy-to-like aromas of pear and apple, slightly sweet flavors of honey and pear juice, and an almost syrupy, soft mouthfeel. It's agreeable and sweet.",84,Tortoise Creek 2013 Jam's Blend Chardonnay (Lodi),,,,
"Finely structured, this has become an impressive wine, gaining in intensity as it develops. The tannins are powerful but come from concentrated fruit as much as from wood. It is becoming a powerhouse of ripe flavors. This is a wine that shows how Malescot St-Exupéry is joining the top ranks in Margaux.",92,Château Malescot Saint-Exupery 2006  Margaux,,,,
"This 90% Sangiovese, 10% Merlot and 10% Canaiolo Chianti opens with subtle blackberry and moist earth aromas. Morello cherry fruit dominates the palate, accented by baking spice notes and round tannins. Enjoy soon.",86,Poggio Salvi 2014  Chianti Colli Senesi,,,,
"Tastes fresh and acidic, like a Beaujolais, with jammy blackberries and cherries, and that sharp, tart finish. An everyday red to drink with ham, sausage, paté.",84,The Crusher 2008 Grower's Collection Petite Sirah (Clarksburg),,,,
"Green apple and lime aromas are well presented and clean. This has a citrusy feel to go with lime, passion fruit and grapefruit flavors. A mildly pithy and citric finish delivers plenty of youthful kick.",86,Viña Requingua 2014 Puerto Viejo Estate Bottled Single Vineyard Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Maule Valley),,,,
"This is a smooth, ripe wine that's just beginning to mellow. The flavors of toast and cashew are opulent, with just a touch of spice. It has weight and a finish that shows both acidity and richness.",92,Hirsch 2009 Gaisberg Erste Lage Riesling (Kamptal),,,,
"From both Muscat Canelli (65%) and Muscat Giallo (35%), this fragrant and inviting wine is exactly what it proclaims to be, slightly sweet in honeysuckle, citrus and crisp texture. It offers lightness and lingering acidity in a moderate-alcohol package.",90,Rosa d'Oro 2012 Slightly Sweet Muscat (Yolo County),,,,
"Cranberry and raspberry comprise the red-fruit nose, and next is the aroma of horse hide and a heavy dose of oak. The fruity palate is all about plum and cassis, and on the finish everything is in place and the texture is firm.",85,Carmen 2001 Carmenère (Rapel Valley),,,,
"This is the entry-level wine from this biodynamic estate. It is full of flavor, ripe from the lees aging and with intense acidity to balance. It goes more to the apple side of Muscadet, producing a wine that is rich and full bodied. Drink from late 2017.",90,Domaine de l'Ecu 2016 Classic Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),,,,
"An inaugural release, this blend of Mourvèdre (85%) and Cinsault is pale copper with salmon tinges. Aromas of strawberry and rose petal lead to dry, full-feeling fruit flavors that linger.",88,Coral Wines 2014 Rosé (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"All Malbec aged in neutral oak, this wine opens with pure, penetrating aromas of plum, cedar, mushroom, spice and high-toned herbs. The palate is elegant in style—almost delicate—with bright, tart fruit flavors. Will show best at the dinner table.",88,Savage Grace 2014 Côt Red Wine Dineen Vineyard Malbec (Rattlesnake Hills),,,,
"A popular wine in Portugal, this is ripe, full of black fruits and with a lightly stalky aftertaste. It is rich and fruity, softly tannic with a full-bodied structure. It is easy to drink young.",87,Global Wines 2014 Cabriz Colheita Seleccionada Red (Dão),,,,
"Rich, ripe yellow peach and mango flavors are deeply concentrated in this fruity, off-dry wine. It's plush and delectably juicy, but clean lines of steel and lime lend balance and vibe.",89,Johann Falkenburg 2013 Riesling (Rheinhessen),,,,
"Delicious, refined and sexy, but that's assuming you like palo cortado. Hidalgo's version is alluring and full of caramel, salt and hazelnut; it has an excellent feel, sensational acidity and a long, long finish of salted cashews and bitter spice. Elegant, balanced and structured; it's what Sherry lovers want from an elevated bottling.",91,Hidalgo NV Marqués de Rodil Especial Palo Cortado Palomino (Jerez),,,,
"From vineyards on Howell Mountain and Oak Knoll, this wine is bristling in acidity, with a taste of lemon peel and grapefruit. Secondary characteristics of peas and pineapple confound as a stony texture adds breadth.",86,Ladera 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"This tiny boutique does well with thick and heavy wines that frequently top 15% alcohol. This sweet, syrupy Syrah is loaded with blueberries, chocolate, licorice and espresso flavors. Nothing shy here, but it delivers a lot of flavor for the price.",88,Passion Vineyards 2009 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This Chardonnay is a little heavy-handed on the butterscotch or caramel, top to bottom, but its citrus and mineral accents keep the toastiness in check. Offers yellow fruit on the palate and on the nose.",87,Grant Burge 2000 Summers Chardonnay (Eden Valley),,,,
"Makes a strong statement for the potential of Chardonnay in Chile, with powerful toast and hazelnut aromas playing opposite fruit comprised of peaches and Granny Smith apples. It's barrel-fermented and aged, but stayed only a relatively short time in wood, so you can still taste the fruit and all of the nutty, leesy complexities. Editors' Choice.",90,Miguel Torres 1999 Maquehua Chardonnay (Curicó Valley),,,,
"There are solid Cabernet flavors of blackberries and black currants in this dry, tannic wine. It's rough and astringent in the mouth, without much charm, but a rich steak, maybe topped with a gorgonzola sauce, will make it shine.",85,Markham 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Aromas of bread crust, dried chamomile and mature orchard fruit come together on this. The palate offers ripe yellow-apple skin, vanilla and toasted oak alongside a vigorous perlage. The somewhat brief finish closes on a note of bitter almond.",86,Contadi Castaldi 2011 Satén Chardonnay (Franciacorta),,,,
"Wide open and seductive, this brings together grapes from both Conner Lee (northern Columbia Basin) and Champoux (Horse Heaven Hills). Muscular, ripe and round, the sweet blackberry and cassis fruit is limned with a granite-like minerality. Great concentration and layering—a berry/rock/tannin layer cake.",94,Buty 2009 Merlot-Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This cheerful 60-40 blend of Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc offers pristine aromas of white flower, honeysuckle, peach blossom and a touch of crushed white pepper. The wine is smooth and silky on the close and shows a sunny Tuscan personality.",86,Badia a Coltibuono 2009 Trappoline White (Toscana),,,,
"This is a rich cru wine with red-plum flavors as well as tannins that are still young and forceful. Densely textured, the wine has plenty of potential. It will become a ripe and fruity wine while also remaining firm and structured. Drink from 2018.",91,Domaine Labruyère 2014 Coeur de Terroirs  (Moulin-à-Vent),,,,
"Fermentation on the grape skins has given this wine a pale gold color. The result is a smooth, oxidative wine with a lightly tannic structure, dominated by apple and citrus fruit. Ready to drink.",88,Roquevale 2015 Branco de Curtimenta White (Alentejo),,,,
"Fresh fruit flavors suggest a bowl full of berries and cherries. Crisp acids help to focus the wine, with spot-on varietal flavors and balance. Both elegant and complex, it's a lovely bottle from an under-the-radar producer.",90,Carabella 2013 Estate Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),,,,
"A wonderfully breezy, citrusy scent promises far fuller expression in the future. The palate is tightly coiled too, but already vibrates with pepper and herbal spice. Riper notions of yellow plums creep onto the palate but the spiciness and citrus zest remain, making for a truly long, lip-smacking finish.",92,Bründlmayer 2014 Terrassen Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),,,,
"Musky in leather, tobacco and black tea, this wine is juicy in currant and cranberry before finishing a tad flat. From a robust mountain appellation, it's surprisingly resolved in terms of tannin and the oak is relatively restrained.",87,Courtney Benham 2012 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),,,,
"This elegant, fragrant expression of Orvieto delivers heady aromas of tropical fruit, apricot and citrus. The linear palate doles out juicy peach, pineapple and lemon zest accented with a hint of aromatic herb. Vibrant acidity provides the framework.",89,Castello della Sala 2014 San Giovanni  (Orvieto Classico Superiore),,,,
"Intensely ripe black cherries and plums lend heft to this rich, boldly textured Pinot Noir. It's a nuanced wine, accented by hints of dried herbs, violets and a crush of mineral tones that elongate the finish.",90,Winzergenossenschaft Mayschoss-Altenahr 2011 Erzeugerabfüllung Trocken Spätburgunder (Ahr),,,,
"Very mineral, textured wine, its acidity and taut green fruit flavors firmly in evidence. It has some of the richness and opulence of the vintage, with great swathes of ripe yellow fruits developing. For long-term aging.",93,Louis Latour 2009 Bâtard-Montrachet  (Bâtard-Montrachet),,,,
"This Malbec-driven blend is concentrated up front, with staunch aromas of espresso, balsamic vinegar, leather, raw oak and mixed black fruits. This is big and lush, but vaguely focused on the midpalate. Flavors of berry fruits, toast and balsamic brine end with cushion and moderate structure. Drink through 2022.",91,Vistalba 2011 Corte A Red (Mendoza),,,,
"Nothing is out of place in this wine: It's intense, but it's not too strong, and the bouquet shows a balance of sweet fruit and savory spice aromas.",90,Venturini Massimino 2007  Amarone della Valpolicella,,,,
"Rooty aromas of licorice, leather and blackberry improve with airing. This shows hard tannins and a grabby palate along with rooty, herbal flavors of blackberry and dark plum that finish with blackened spice notes, licorice root flavors and lively acidity.",88,Proemio 2013 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"The Helix Chardonnay is a lush offering of pineapple flavor, plus a leesy, mineral-soaked midpalate that is supremely refreshing. It has terrific acidity and persistence on the palate.",90,Helix by Reininger 2011 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"The nose isn't very expressive, offering aromas of toasted hazelnut, while the dense, simple palate shows dried black cherry and licorice. It's shy on freshness and has round but rather fleeting tannins. Drink through 2018.",87,Cascina Bruciata 2013  Barbaresco,,,,
"All stainless fermented, with the addition of 5% Viognier, this is a solid, if unspectacular effort. It shows pear and citrus and plenty of acid, with appealing freshness. Drink up over the next couple of years.",87,Hawkins Cellars 2015 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),,,,
"A dark color and chunky aromas of black plum and animal hide set up a full tannic, rubbery palate. Herbal salty notes accent core plum and berry flavors, while this is long on the finish, with earthy notes and a sauvage hint of garrigue.",89,Portal del Priorat 2013 Gotes del Priorat Carignan-Grenache (Priorat),,,,
"Although this includes only 3% Viognier, it's apparent from the musky hints of gingery spice on the nose. Ginger, nasturtium and melon flavors round out an expansive mouthfeel. It's odd—especially in a lineup of more traditional Sem-Sauvs—but not unpleasant. Drink now.",86,Skuttlebutt 2012 Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Margaret River),,,,
"Bold and full-bodied, this opens with aromas of mature berry, eucalyptus, baking spice and a balsamic note. The powerful palate doles out ripe black cherry marinated in spirits, licorice, menthol, mint, clove and pipe tobacco. Closely-knit, polished tannins provide support and an almost velvety texture. It boasts muscle and finesse.",94,Cantina del Pino 2011 Albesani  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Basically a clean, light, simple white with a flat/soft body and pithy, dry flavors of citrus and melon rind. Shows some bitterness on the finish along with a flash of white heat. Decent at best. Drink right away.",84,Terrapura 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),,,,
"Ripe and generous with sweet berry flavors, but still very young, this wine has dark tannins and a dry core. Drink next year to enjoy its warm, full-bodied character.",88,Pezat 2011  Bordeaux,,,,
"Spring blossoms and lemon zest lend a fresh exuberance to this effortlessly elegant kabinett. Just a shade off dry, it's juicy with tangerine, honeydew and yellow peach flavors, but vibrant, with bright streaks of Meyer-lemon acidity.",90,Joh. Jos. Prüm 2011 Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Under the same ownership as Château de Panigon, this property (which has a heart on its cork) has produced a wine offering layers of smoky wood as well as ripe fruit. That solid structure suggests the wine will need time to develop. The aftertaste boosts a more juicy fruitiness.",87,Château Amour 2013  Médoc,,,,
"Much in the style of Leonetti Cabernet, with the richness of Napa Valley fruit, this deeply satisfying, superripe wine is 100% varietal. Notes of cassis, fig and a hint of prune are swathed in deeper flavors of espresso and dark chocolate.",95,Boudreaux Cellars 2007 Champoux & Loess Vineyards Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington),,,,
"With a vivid golden color, bold and buttery aromas, and rich, almost nutty flavors, this is a full-bore rendering. It is full bodied and brings out the most flavorful aspects of the grape. The texture is rich and almost thick, and the buttery nuances linger on the finish.",88,Matchbook 2013 Old Head Chardonnay (Dunnigan Hills),,,,
"Complexity abounds on this spicy cedar-toned Cabernet Sauvignon. Ripe red-plum and cherry flavors are juicy and plush yet balanced briskly by sharp edges of acidity and graphite. It's intensely earthy, studded with notes of bramble and autumn leaf. Fine feathery tannins lead a long lingering finish.",91,McGregor 2012 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),,,,
"A blend of fruit from Loess, Mill Creek Upland and Leonetti Old Block, this standout wine opens with alluring aromas of dark chocolate, raspberries, blueberries, sandalwood and assorted spices. The palate is plush and fruit-filled but with well-balanced acidity and impressive length.",92,Leonetti Cellar 2013 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"This medium-bodied wine would be a fine accompaniment to weekday burgers. It's a bit simple, but fruity, supple and pleasant, ending with some soft tannins. Drink now.",86,Lavau 2013 Red (Côtes du Rhône),,,,
"Given 10 months in new French oak, this Dolcetto is firm and lush, imparting mouthwatering raspberry cobbler and smoky, cinnamon-cola aromas. Featuring resolved acidity, the texture is smooth and satisfying. It finishes leathery with a taste of earth.",88,La Folia Winery 2012 Dolcetto (Sierra Foothills),,,,
"In 2008, Januik made a single-vineyard Syrah from Lewis Vineyard fruit; now the winery has sourced fruit from Ciel du Cheval Vineyard, one of the superstar spots on Red Mountain. A compact wine that snaps right into focus, this offers varietal flavors of fig, berry and plum. A streak of smooth chocolate weaves through the finish, along with a hint of red licorice and underlying slate-like minerality.",92,Januik 2009 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Syrah (Red Mountain),,,,
"Flourescent pink in color, like Day-Glo paint. It smells of sweet plum and berry; the palate is crisply acidic, with citrus and tart red-fruit flavors. The finish is crisp and cleansing but regular.",84,Bogatell 2011 Garnacha Negra-Syrah Rosé (Terra Alta),,,,
"Aromas of grilled porcini mushroom, scorched earth, dark spice and a whiff of crushed herb lead the nose. The brawny palate offers dried cherry, vanilla, prune and a hint of licorice alongside a backbone of bracing tannins. The heat of evident alcohol throws off the finish.",89,Citille di Sopra 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"The latest release of the H3 Chardonnay shows plenty of fruit upfront (20% was fermented in stainless steel). Firm, crisp apple and a buttery finish set this clearly in the mainstream Columbia Crest style.",87,Columbia Crest 2010 H3 Chardonnay (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"Pressed yellow flower and spring orchard fruit are the primary opening scents. The lean palate shows rennet apple skin, lime and a mineral note alongside zesty acidity.",85,Pighin 2014 Pinot Grigio (Collio),,,,
"Lake County producer Chacewater has made a pleasant, refreshing rosé from 100% Syrah. It's dark in color, with tastes of watermelon, ripe peach and tropical fruit. Intensely textured and full bodied in mouthfeel, it emphasizes its flavors through to the finish.",86,Chacewater 2011 Rosé (Sierra Foothills),,,,
"Blended from 70% Syrah, 18% Mourvèdre and 12% Grenache, this concentrated refresher offers light, crisp waves of vanilla-cherry, grapefruit and orange. It will remain restrained in the glass if not revelatory in ripe fruit.",88,Lasseter 2015 Enjoué Estate Grown Rosé (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"This is a bouncy, fresh, fruit-forward wine. Cherry-berry fruit shines from start to finish, ending with just a hint of cocoa. Drink now–2017.",86,Château de Farel 2014 Red (Côtes du Rhône),,,,
"Fresh and zesty in acidity, this Chardonnay has forward flavors of ripe green apples, peaches, oranges and vanilla cream, with a little bit of smoky oak. It's an easy wine to like, and grows better as it warms in the glass.",90,Martin Ray 2010 Reserve Chardonnay (Los Carneros),,,,
"This is a full-bodied wine that exudes yellow fruits and a smooth structure. It is ripe, packed with citrus acidity to keep it fresh while the mineral texture is so well-cushioned by the rich fruitiness. It is delicious now with the exuberance of young fruit although it will certainly age and will be even better from 2017.",94,Domaine Delaporte 2014 Maxime Cuvée Silex  (Sancerre),,,,
"Direct berry fruit aromas are firm and tight. This feels ripped, honest and authentic, but ultimately approachable and uncomplicated. Black fruit, raw oak and licorice flavors precede a woody and weighty yet fresh and clean finish.",89,Luna Beberide 2012 Mencía (Bierzo),,,,
"A peachy nose includes the botrytis aromas you get in late-harvest Alsace whites and Sauternes. Linear and still lively on the palate, this tastes a bit woody but also of muddled stone fruits. A chunky finish is peachy tasting.",85,Batán de Salas 2013 Chardonnay (Somontano),,,,
"Like most Sancerre producers, Roger also draws on vines across the Loire in Pouilly-Fumé. This ripe full wine shows the richness of this appellation and also its potential for aging. Its lime and green-plum fruits are shot through with acidity and balanced by a tangy rich texture. Drink from 2018.",91,Jean-Max Roger 2015 Cuvée les Alouettes  (Pouilly-Fumé),,,,
"A little raw around the edges, lacking the sexy lushness you want in a fine Pinot Noir. Mostly that's a function of high acidity and a touch of minty green. Still, it's a delicious, complex wine, with oaky flavors of raspberries, cherries and Asian spices. Probably best now and for the next five years.",89,La Rochelle 2007 Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Block A Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"A mere suspicion of black cherry can be discerned on the nose of this Zweigelt-Pinot Noir blend. On the palate, ripe but tart cherry fruit is on full display, made precise by ample freshness. It conveys a touch of white pepper amid soft, pliable tannins, with an edge of crunchy freshness.",91,Arndorfer 2016 Vorgeschmack Red (Niederösterreich),,,,
"Carves a path right down the center of Marlborough's stylistic fairway, featuring hints of bell pepper, stone fruit and wet-stone minerality. It's medium in body, with flavors of nectarine, herbal flourishes and a dry, stony finish. Drink now.",89,Brancott 2008 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"Rather bland and done up with butterscotch and cream. And while those aromas indicate heft and richness, the wine is sort of flat and soft, with mealy apple and creamy fruit flavors. And then it finishes pithy and bitter. Not much definition or design. Expensive for what you get.",83,Ikal 1150 2007 Chardonnay (Tupungato),,,,
"Winemaker: Carl Schultz. A ripe and concentrated selection, with a touch of warmth throughout, this offers rich notes of black cherry, boysenberry, licorice, black pepper and game on the nose and mouth. The texture is plush and mouthfilling, with medium tannins and dense black-fruit flavors that finish spicy and chocolaty. Drink now–2022.",90,Hartenberg 2012 Cape Winemakers Guild CWG Auction Shiraz (Stellenbosch),,,,
"Timing is everything with this full-bodied PG. Get at it right away and it will still be almost viscous, but it should also show ripe tropical fruit flavors, core acidity and lots of personality. Just don't let it hang around for long, especially not at room temperature.",85,Santa Julia 2007 Pinot Grigio (Mendoza),,,,
"This wine is young—full of acidity and rich yellow fruit. A blend of Petit and Gros Manseng, it has the typical honeyed edge yet is bone dry. It will take time for its intense acidity to calm down, so drink from late 2018.",88,Château de Jurque 2016 Fantaisie  (Jurançon Sec),,,,
"A wine that has freshness, some wood and a soft series of tannins, almost velvet. There is a stalky juiciness here, to complete a wine that offers the freshest acidity, with only hints of darker fruits.",89,Château Duhart-Milon 2007  Pauillac,,,,
"This is an excellent young Cabernet Sauvignon that will take some bottle age. Coming on the heels of the high-scoring 2004, it's full-bodied and extraordinarily rich, with intense blackberry, black currant, chocolate, coffee and cedar flavors, wrapped into near-perfect tannins. Shows great grapes and a deft winemaking hand.",93,Brandlin 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),,,,
"The bouquet opens with touches of candied fruit, lemon zest and cola, followed by red fruit and spice notes. It has a thick, velvety mouthfeel.",86,Zeni 2010 Marogne  (Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso),,,,
"This is a structured wine, juicy with black-currant fruit and acidity. It will develop quickly, softening its tannins and filling out with ripe fruit. Drink from 2018.",86,Cheval Quancard 2015 Fleur du Roc  (Saint-Émilion),,,,
"Another fine Chardonnay from this producer. It's typical of the vineyard, showing intensely concentrated tropical and citrus fruit and green apple flavors, enhanced with mouthwatering acidity. Vertical tastings of this bottling show its ability to slowly evolve in the bottle over as much as eight years.",90,Talbott 2011 Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Rooty aromas of licorice and sarsparilla are out front, followed by a big wave of barrel char. This wine feels good but a little abrupt and choppy. Savory flavors of barbecue and meaty berry fruits finish blackened and peppery, with a lasting note of charred wood.",88,Marqués de Vargas 2014 Conde de San Cristóbal  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"Ripe bramble, crisp strawberry and cherry perfume this full-bodied moderately concentrated rosé. Dry in style, it's easy drinking with a slightly candied cherry-cough-drop finish.",87,Bellangelo 2016 Merlot Dry Rosé (Seneca Lake),,,,
"Whiffs of nuts, dusty mineral and lemon are demure on the nose, but become more concentrated on the palate of this dry white. A blend of Chardonnay, Riesling and Grüner Veltliner, it's more minerally than fruity, but refreshing and brisk.",85,Inspire Moore 2014 Gratitude White (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This substantial, powerfully styled Pinot Noir is layered with tart, punchy red fruit. That rich core is laced with brown sugar, coffee, caramel and cola streaks. It was aged in 10% new French oak.",91,Ghost Hill 2014 Bayliss-Bower Vineyard Pinot Noir,,,,
"Vegetal-leaning, stewy aromas of plum and jammy berry are saucy. This feels sticky and low in acidity. Grassy, herbal plum and berry flavors are a bit green on the finish.",83,Finca Flichman 2015 Misterio Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"A simple bouquet offers light apple and melon aromas, while the palate shows some malic acidity before it softens. Melon, apple and a touch of butter work together to create a mild flavor profile, while this is mellow and short on the finish.",86,Otazu 2014 Chardonnay (Navarra),,,,
"Roasted berry and cassis aromas are basic and familiar. The palate on this varietal Cabernet is grabby yet solid, with sweet, baked flavors of cassis, berry and chocolate. Hints of toast and darkness rise up on what amounts to a rubbery feeling finish.",88,Undurraga 2011 Aliwen Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley-Colchagua Valley),,,,
"Single block wines, such as this one, often show a tight focus rather than a broad palate. Here it works well, wrapping savory notes around red currant fruit. There's a lightly metallic ring to the flavors, running straight through the finish. Give this a few hours of decanting, or tuck it away for drinking after 2020.",91,Sokol Blosser 2013 Goosepen Block Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),,,,
"A one-dimensional, pungent style of SB that's fresh, zesty and tangy in the mouth courtesy of zippy acidity and flavors of tangerine, grapefruit and passion fruit. Finishes more in the pink grapefruit zone, but with snap. Chiseled and linear, but definitely still kicking.",88,Cameron Hughes 2009 Lot 225 Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),,,,
"Earthy aromas quickly transition to ripe marasca cherry and cake spices. The palate delivers juicy red berry, mint and white pepper alongside polished but not very persistent tannins. It's already accessible so drink now through 2019.",89,Poggio Antico 2009  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Unusual aromas of pine needle, cough drop and herbal berries set the stage for a juicy, tight palate with raspberry, red plum and herbal flavors. Medium in length and intensity, with a smooth finish that leaves a solid, generally positive lasting impression.",85,Melipal 2007 Ikella Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"This value selection is a no-brainer, with medium tannins providing good structure to the ripe palate. Boysenberry and black currant flavors mingle with spicy accents of hoisin sauce, licorice and coffee bean. Drink now.",86,Excelsior 2010 Hands Cabernet Sauvignon (Robertson),,,,
"Firmly textured and appetizingly balanced, this wine combines ripe grape aromas with a rather tannic feel. Some tart fruit notes of raspberry and cranberry lift the grapiness. It grows in appeal with each sip.",86,Naggiar 2011 Della Casa Red (Sierra Foothills),,,,
"Ripe berry, raisin, prune, chocolate and cool earth aromas make for a fine nose. This is full and rich, a bit chunky, but not too heavy. Flavors of coconut are backed by blackberry fruit; on the finish, that oaky coconut character transitions to vanilla. Drink through 2022.",92,Errazuriz 2013 La Cumbre Syrah (Aconcagua Valley),,,,
"A worthy followup to the 2008, showing crisp acidity and rich flavors of citrus fruits, New Zealand-style gooseberries, and vanilla spice, with a honey sweet finish. Drink now with Vietnamese food or sushi.",88,Atmosphere 2009 Denmark Street Vineyard Tribute Fumé Blanc (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"Stalky, lightly vegetal aromas come with notes of match stick and bitterness. This feels fresh in the mouth but tastes briny, with citrus, jalapeño and green bean accents. A bland, pithy finish feels round. Drink now.",84,Santa Carolina 2012 Ocean Side Sauvignon Blanc (San Antonio),,,,
"From Frescobaldi's gorgeous Nipozzano estate, this Riserva Sangiovese (with small percentages of Malvasia Nera, Cabernet and Merlot for extra density and intensity) opens with impressive generosity and personality. It offers lingering flavors of cherry, chocolate and dark spice.",93,Marchesi de' Frescobaldi 2007 Nipozzano Riserva  (Chianti Rufina),,,,
"Made from the estate's oldest vines, this silky blend of 95% Schiava and 5% Lagrein opens with a fragrance of wild berry and alpine herb. The vibrant palate doles out layers of sour red cherry, juicy raspberry, mandarin orange and a light almond note alongside fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. Enjoy soon to capture the delicious fresh fruit flavors.",90,Franz Gojer-Glögglhof 2013 Rondell St. Magdalener Red (Alto Adige),,,,
"This wine offers more power and heat on the palate than would be expected given the listed alcohol by volume, a hammering of huge tannins holding the fruit hostage. An unpleasant fish-sauce aroma mars the nose.",82,Haywood 2011 Los Chamizal Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"There's smoke, pink grapefruit, graphite and just a hint of asparagus on the nose, but virtually nothing to indicate this wine is over 10 years old. Honeyed grapefruit flavors feature a liberal dusting of minerals on the long finish.",90,Cantina Terlano 1992 Riserva Sauvignon Blanc (Alto Adige),,,,
"A very dark color and ripe, almost raisiny aromas lead to rich, opulent flavors like chocolate-covered cherries and blackberry jam. These saturate a velvety texture of good acidity and firm tannins. While the wine is full of big flavors from ripe or overripe grapes, it has the structure to support them.",89,Naggiar 2011 Le Grand-père Estate Grown Red (Sierra Foothills),,,,
"Here is a unique white wine with aromas of mature peach, honeydew melon and almond nut. It offers a compact, streamlined texture and medium persistency on the finish.",86,Farnese 2007 Casale Vecchio Passerina Passerina (Colli Aprutini),,,,
"This dry, full-bodied selection benefits from the rich Pinot in the blend. It has a tight, minerally texture, its acidity cutting the flavors of lime juice and orange zest.",87,Aubry NV Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this offers dainty aromas of peony, nectarine and white strawberry. Fresh and bright, this has a lively mouthfeel and a zippy finish.",86,Odem Mountain 2011 Volcanic Dry Rosé (Galilee),,,,
"Fresh-squeezed grapefruit, pomelo, Key lime, lemongrass, green papaya and Anjou pear combine for a very green, fruit-driven nose on this bottling from a vineyard just behind Pismo Beach. The palate is a tad ripe but shows apple soda, lime juice, cherimoya and apple-custard flavors.",87,Croma Vera 2015 Spanish Springs Vineyard Albariño (San Luis Obispo County),,,,
"Gooseneck is based in Rhode Island but sources wines from around the world. This Pinot was produced at River's Edge, in the Elkton Oregon AVA. It sends out aromas of caramel and graham cracker, and enters the palate with a soft, silky mouthfeel and plum fruit. Though the vintage is recent, it drinks like a more mature wine, with granular tannins and flavors of coffee grounds running through the finish.",87,Gooseneck 2014 Pinot Noir (Oregon),,,,
"A light style of Petite Sirah, this is softly drinkable now, offering a wealth of cherry, mocha and tobacco flavors and gentle tannins.",85,Fleur 2009 Petite Sirah (North Coast),,,,
"The Barrel Select is given 26 months in 100% new oak, and it shows in both the nose and the mouth. Smoke and char are not accents here; they are the main event. The fruit flavors are simple cherry/berry, and thin out rather quickly in the finish.",87,Bergevin Lane 2008 Barrel Select Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Luscious golden in color, this dessert wine shows aromas of honeyed and seared lemons, with hints of marigold and toasted sunflower seeds. The palate is rich and sweet, but balanced expertly with a great tartness.",90,Testarossa 2012 Novitiate Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc (Arroyo Seco),,,,
"Black plum, baking spice and cedar aromas lead the way. On the firm medium-bodied palate, notes of mocha and toasted oak underscore blackberry jam while assertive tannins provide support. Drink through 2020.",88,Battistini 2013 Solstizio Riserva Sangiovese (Romagna),,,,
"A wood-aged Chardonnay from mountain vineyards above the Douro. The wine has spice, yellow fruits and a strong toast character. Acidity is there to add some freshness to the concentrated, rounded taste.",91,Real Companhia Velha 2009 Quinta de Cidrô Reserva Chardonnay (Duriense),,,,
"The second wine of the historic Mouchão estate, this contains less Alicante Bouschet than the top wine, while still having great power and concentration. There is a crisp feel, as well as plenty of acidity and forward black-currant fruit. It will be ready to drink from 2018.",90,Mouchão 2013 Dom Rafael Red (Alentejo),,,,
"Aromas of violet, dark-skinned berry and baking spice are the highlights. On the bright, juicy palate, soft velvety tannins frame mature black cherry, blackberry and a hint of cocoa.",89,Tiefenbrunner 2013 Turmhof Lagrein (Alto Adige),,,,
"The wine is dry, and firm with tannins still masking the fruit. With its dark coffee flavor it has been heavily extracted and this needs to soften before the wine will be ready. Look for the berry fruits and acidity as the wine ages. Drink from 2017.",86,Solar de Cambres 2011 Casa de Cambres Reserva Red (Douro),,,,
"A mild concentration of cherry, green herb, spice and rose petals mark the nose. Softly grained tannins offer just enough grip to this medium-bodied wine, with high-toned cherry and cranberry leading the flavors.",86,James Charles 2014 Arrivato 1913 Ameritage Red (Virginia),,,,
"Considerable aromas of eucalyptus, Bay leaf and cedar rise to the front of this wine, making for an inviting, savory introduction that provides a reasonable complexity. Easygoing, approachable and softly light bodied, it'll do well at the table and big-crowd events.",87,Benziger 2013 Merlot (Sonoma County),,,,
"Aged five years after bottling prior to release, this is an exceptional wine. It has the hallmark dryness of Lanson, along with toast and ripe white-fruit flavors. Its tangy with lemon zest and crisp apple flavors that meld harmoniously. Ready to drink now.",94,Lanson NV Extra Age Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"Barrel-fermented in French oak, this wine is high in acidity and subtle in wood flavors, offering a brightness of citrus, pear and peach. Seamless on the palate and steely, it's well balanced and elegant.",88,Pine & Brown 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"Starts out somewhat fiery, with a dose of aromatic horseradish. After airing out, this varietal Tempranillo is fresh, juicy and crisp on the tongue, with flavors of baking spices, tomato, roasted plum and earth. Feels juicy on the finish, maybe a bit lean, and overall it's cut from the classic cloth.",87,Viña Bujanda 2006 Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"Warm, rich aromas of wild berry carry a hint of dried cheese, while the rest of the bouquet is woodsy and spicy. The palate is juicy with fresh acidity, and the flavors of red plum and raspberry are solid. A structured wine with good DNA. Drink now through 2011.",88,Zuccardi 2007 Q Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"This wine, from the man who invented the name ""Fumé Blanc,"" is not for everyone. It's way on the citrus, hay, and gooseberry side of the chart (as it is in every vintage), making for a lean, tart, almost sharp drink that some will find sour despite softening with 6% Sémillon and lees aging. Others will appreciate the sleek, almost severe elegance. Again, a wine that absolutely demands the right foods.",88,Robert Mondavi 1998 To-Kalon Vineyard Reserve Fumé Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"Concentrated aromas of ocean brine, sweat and citrus fruits feed into a juicy, minerally palate. Green, tangy flavors of tangerine and canned beans end long, minerally and fresh, with lasting acidity.",89,Matetic 2015 EQ Coastal Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"Great fruit flavors and a lively, fresh texture come together for a very well-balanced and vivid-tasting wine. Just enough tannin and grape acidity provide an agile, appetizing structure to let the fresh red and black cherry notes stand out. Fermented with native yeast and aged in neutral barrels., it will be best after 2018.",92,Red Car 2013 Manchester Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino Ridge),,,,
"From the producer's estate at over 1,000 feet in elevation, this seamlessly textured wine grabs one's palate from the start and doesn't let go. Huckleberry and cedar notes meet bay leaf accents and grippy tannins, all enveloped in smoky oak. It finishes with bright, fresh blackberry.",92,Kuleto Estate 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"This Barbera is soft, sweet and simple. It shows the rich tannins of the variety, but isn't ageworthy. Tastes like melted blackberry jam mixed with anise, black pepper and smoke.",82,Muscardini 2006 Pauli Ranch Barbera (Mendocino County),,,,
"Strongly briny and raw on the nose, with an insistent aroma of tomato sauce, this cool-region Pinot is austere at first, then dry, raw and snappy by the midpalate. Racy red plum, currant and spice flavors finish dry, with blazing acidity.",87,Ventisquero 2012 Grey Glacier Single Block Las Terrazas Vineyard Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley),,,,
"Despite being barrel fermented and matured, this Condrieu retains a remarkable amount of varietal character in its flamboyantly floral and spicy aromas. It's full bodied, broad and richly textured, yet avoids any sense of heaviness, finishing on hints of honey and white pepper. Drink now–2020.",94,E. Guigal 2010 La Doriane  (Condrieu),,,,
"This blend of 80% Sangiovese, 10% Canaiolo and 10% Ciliegiolo opens with bright aromas of red berry, violet and a whiff of Mediterranean scrub. The vibrant, easygoing palate brings juicy black cherry, raspberry and a note of clove alongside bright acidity and supple tannins. Enjoy through 2016.",87,Cantine Ravazzi 2013  Chianti,,,,
"A blend of Loin de l'Oeil and Sauvignon Blanc has produced a ripe and soft but balanced wine from a vineyard owned by the Wine Museum of Paris. It has refreshing melon and white-plum fruits, and an aromatic character that is rich and full bodied. Drink now.",88,Château Labastidié 2014 White (Gaillac),,,,
"This ripe, deliciously fruity wine has red plum and black currant fruits along with fragrant acidity and a gently tannic structure. It will be ready to drink from 2017. Canadian David Curl purchased Moya in 2008; Damien Landouar is the winery director. The vineyard was certified organic in 2013.",87,Château Moya 2012  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,,,,
"Just beautiful and oh, so refreshing. The cool vintage has resulted in a high-acid wine of enormous fruit, bursting with intense, classic Edna Valley flavors of limes, kiwis, Meyer lemons, honeysuckle and minerals. The vanilla spice and creamy smoke have got to come from the terroir, because the wine never saw a splinter of oak.",90,Tolosa 2006 Edna Ranch No-Oak Chardonnay (Edna Valley),,,,
"Just-cracked, yeasty sourdough bread and dried lemon-skin aromas float off of this bottle-aged sparkler from an esteemed, longtime producer. Her winemaker son named this wine in honor of her birth year. An oxidative warmth gives bready depth to the palate, which shows lots of toast and lemon marmalade flavors.",90,Kathryn Kennedy 2004 Twenty-Seven Blanc de Blanc Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"Call this traditional, a throwback, or whatever you want, because it's a less-polished wine with a strong sense of buttery oak and animal. It's also challenging and strained, with herbal tart plum flavors and a strong note of cheesy oak to the finish.",87,Bodegas Hnos. Pérez Pascuas 2012 Viña Pedrosa La Navilla  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"There's a yogurt-driven dairy element on the nose of this estate wine from western Gilroy, with sleek white peach, light white pepper, lemon blossom and lime-pith aromas in support. The Brie cheese-rind tension carries to the palate, along with grapefruit pith, lime zest and bountiful energy. This bottling is great now but will hold until at least 2022.",92,Sarah's Vineyard 2013 Estate Chardonnay (Santa Clara Valley),,,,
"Heavy, oaky and fruity now, but it's a young Cabernet, and all the signs point to ageability. The tannins are firm, in the way of Napa, the acidity is just right, and the core consists of massive black currant and cassis flavors, with a fine minerality adding to the structure. The winemaker is the brilliant Kirk Venge.  Drink 2017 and beyond.",92,Tudal 2009 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),,,,
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah is too ripe and obvious for its own good. It's very good, offering a vast wealth of pie filling blackberries, cherries, cassis, licorice and chocolate flavors, but you find yourself wishing that, at this price, it had greater structure and was a little more aloof and tantalizing.",87,B Cellars 2005 Blend 25 Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"This wine shows ultraripe fruit, with cola and sweet-oak spice wrapped in a plush texture and juicy finish. A simple, user-friendly weeknight glugger.",86,Little Penguin 2015 Shiraz (South Eastern Australia),,,,
"Three vineyards contribute to this lovely wine, two in Rutherford, both certified organic, and another in Soda Canyon which is at 800-feet in elevation. Red and blue fruit open for leather and a touch of cedar and dried herb—the wine ultimately elegant and Old World. The tannin weight is substantial but never distracting.",91,Pine & Brown 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),,,,
"Good for Valdivieso that they are willing to experiment with a Mourvèdre-led blend that also contains Carignan and Syrah. This is racy and a bit tangy, with plenty of old-vines acidity making the wine a bit jumpy and scouring. Probably best with food; it's a bit astringent on its own.",86,Valdivieso 2005 Eclat Red (Maule Valley),,,,
"Tortoise Creek makes bargain wines from the Languedoc region of France as well as from Lodi. “The Chelonian” is a new label a portion of the proceeds of which will go to the Chelonian Research Foundation to help benefit the conservation of turtles and tortoises. The wine itself is a decent representation of Lodi's bigger, more raisiny style.",84,Tortoise Creek 2009 The Chelonian Zinfandel (Lodi),,,,
"Rich fruit and cream flavors and a smooth, almost sweet impression in the mouth add up to a palate-pleasing taste. This smells like lime, honeydew and cream, feels rounded on the palate, tastes like poached pears and has a soft finish.",85,One Hope 2013 Chardonnay (California),,,,
"Velvety and dense, this vineyard designate from a cool appellation is floral and herbal as well as freshly celebratory in wild strawberry. A leathery texture finds balance and life in prickly acidity.",90,Baldassari Family Wines 2014 Nolan Vineyard Syrah (Bennett Valley),,,,
"The purity of juicy, tart, red apples runs like a fault line through a very taut, linear, whistle-clean Riesling. This has purity and precision, linearity and drive. Still tightly wound, this needs time to unfold but promises to be a wine of great longevity and expression. Resolutely dry, the purity and concentration of flavors will always remain. Drink 2018–2030.",95,René Muré 2014 Clos Saint Landelin Vorbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"It's pretty chilly at Roche's Carneros vineyard, and this wine is not one of those superripe Syrahs. It shows a nice array of cherries and berries, but is also very peppery, with a fine note of grilled, charred beef on the bone. It's a complex, pleasing wine for drinking now with upscale fare.",90,Roche 2006 Syrah (Carneros),,,,
"Citrus, orchard-fruit and spring-blossom aromas float out of the glass. Mirroring the nose, the slightly sweet, creamy palate tastes of white peach, apple and candied citrus peel offset by fresh acidity and a foaming perlage.",88,Drusian 2016 Millesimato Dry  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
"Complex wine that has both great fruitiness and great structure. It's very ripe, dense and textured, a wine with weight and a feeling of warmth. Brûlés means burnt because the vineyard has great exposure to the sun and that gives a powerful and concentrated wine. Age for 5–6 years.",93,Château Fuissé 2011 Les Brûlés  (Pouilly-Fuissé),,,,
"From one of the Nelson region's pioneering winemakers, this is as good a wine as I can remember the Seifried family producing. The combination of subtle snow-pea and bold passion-fruit flavors is spot on, and the wine's ample weight, slightly creamy texture and long, grapefruity finish work together to create a harmonious whole.",91,Seifried 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Nelson),,,,
"Nicely concentrated with a core of ripe red fruit and menthol, this is a fresh, forward Cab that's a bargain at $8. Bright and clean from start to finish, the finish lingers on smooth, velvety tannins and a fresh, herbaceous mint note.",87,Vini 2009 Veni Vidi Vici Cabernet Sauvignon (Thracian Valley),,,,
"Winemaker: Jeff Grier. This Cab Franc is remarkably pronounced in purple floral characteristics, presented in bold waves of crushed violet and iris that are grounded by raspberry, cherry and strawberry preserves. The smooth palate offers ample tannic structure to frame the lush, ripe fruit flavors, followed by loads of baking spice and cigar ash on the long, intriguing finish. Drink now–2022.",92,Villiera 2015 Cape Winemakers Guild Drip Barrel Cabernet Franc (Stellenbosch),,,,
"This wine is a blend of Evergreen, Schmitt and Oasis vineyards. It displays a mixture of butter, tropical fruit and red-apple aromas that lead to creamy feeling flavors and a drawn-out finish that impresses.",90,L'Ecole No. 41 2014 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
Crisp acidity gives this off-dry Riesling just the edge of tartness it needs to balance out the sweet citrus and flower flavors. It's the perfect inexpensive summer picnic white wine.,85,Hacienda 2010 Riesling (California),,,,
"Aromas of sweet white peach and apple blossoms are lovely on this lean, light-footed Grüner Veltiner. The palate could use a hint more concentration, but it's lemony and brisk, with pleasant crushed chalk and grass notes. Drink now.",85,Lamoreaux Landing 2011 Estate Bottled Grüner Veltliner (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Grown in a celebrated vineyard, this Pinot isn't showing well at this point. It's heavy and soft, and the raspberry-cherry flavors are compromised by a vegetal quality. Decant and drink up.",86,Sojourn 2012 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Luscious stone-fruit notes on the nose suggest ripeness and opulence. The palate speaks with that same generous fruit but holds a tight fresh grip that unites mirabelle, crisp green apple, bright citrus and yeasty richness. This is a beautifully balanced expressive wine with fine creamy fizz that is lovely now but will also reward laying down. The finish is long and deliciously dry and fresh. Drink 2017–2022.",92,Kuentz-Bas NV Trois Châteaux Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),,,,
"Big, bold and spicy, this wine is ripe with black fruit. Tannins and a rich texture confirm its upfront style. Likely to take its time to develop, it will be ready to drink from 2020.",89,Château Glorit 2015  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,,,,
"Tre Saggi is steadily becoming a representative wine for the Abruzzo region in central Italy. It shows loads of ripe fruit and blackberry, with shadings of spice and leather. That tight, bitter close would pair with succulent grilled meats.",89,Talamonti 2007 Tre Saggi  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),,,,
"Lots of ripe, forward citrus, tropical fruit, melon and peach flavors in this slightly sweet Sauvignon Blanc. A bit of oak brings a nice smoky creaminess. More controversial is the green, gooseberry tartness that will divide wine lovers into pro and con.",86,Lola Kay 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"A hint of spice peppers this rich, lusciously bodied Chardonnay full of ripe apple and lemon flavor. It's creamy and clingy in mouthfeel, but balanced elegantly by sharp lemon and lime tones that brighten the midpalate.",89,Anthony Nappa 2012 Sciardonné Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"This wine is an unusual blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (40%) with the rest Sangiovese, Syrah, Merlot and Mourvèdre. Aromas of fresh raspberries, cranberries and toast lead to fleshy red and black-fruit flavors that skirt the edges.",88,Stottle 2013 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This is a delicious expression of the genre, medium bodied and forcefully crisp, with delicate lacings of cherry, apricot and peach. The underlying hint of vanilla gives it a welcome succulence and touch of sweetness though the wine otherwise presents dry.",91,Kobler 2015 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Quite dark in color, brooding aromas of olallieberry, blackberry, grape soda, plums and concentrated purple flowers appease the nose on this bottling from one of Paso's newly designated appellations. The palate blends licorice, turned earth and eucalyptus with a fresh pomegranate juice flavor.",90,Brecon Estate 2013 Estate Grenache (Adelaida District),,,,
"Subdued earth notes precede the ripe freshness of red apple and mirabelle. A touch of residual sweetness boosts ripe fruit flavors of pear and orange, red apple and mirabelle plum. Lemon freshness brightens the palate and makes for an appetizing, zingy and refreshing finish.",91,Domaine Gresser 2015 Duttenberg Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"Made from Zweigelt, this has a soft feel along with lively acidity. Its raspberry flavor is paired with a note of orange peel while the wine finishes with a touch of spice. Scewcap.",86,Dürnberg 2011 Blanc de Noir Select Rosé (Niederösterreich),,,,
"This is a ripe, full and fruity wine. It is packed with attractive red-berry fruits and a crisp dry backbone. The acidity and the bright aftertaste make it a fine food rosé. It comes from a small appellation surrounded by the large Côtes de Provence area.",90,Domaine Harmonie des Arpents 2016 Rosé (Coteaux Varois en Provence),,,,
"Predominantly crafted from Chardonnay, this features a fistful of Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier to add silky smooth layers of texture and a seductively elegant body. It's marked by a long finish and spiciness.",91,Chandon 2008 Vintage Brut Sparkling (Mount Veeder),,,,
"91-93. Barrel sample. A wine with weight and richness, there is considerable concentration, with citrus flavor and ripe fruit densely set in the background.",92,Château Olivier 2011 Barrel Sample  (Pessac-Léognan),,,,
"Timid but clean as a whistle on the nose, with apple and vanilla aromas along with a sprinkling of talcum powder. The palate is lively and fresh, with flavors of pineapple, lemon and other tropical hints. Entirely pedestrian as cava goes, but 100% clean and refreshing.",87,Cavas Hill NV Artesanía Brut de Brut Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"Intriguing layers of fruit and herbs interplay on the delicious nose of this bottling, showing bay leaf, thyme, oregano, pepper, hibiscus and cherry. The palate is rich and savory, with more of the same roasting herbs as well as fig, black olive, black pepper, fennel and purple-flower flavors. It's quite rich and delicious.",94,Nelle 2014 Grenache (California),,,,
"McCay is a producer to watch in Lodi and this wine is a perfect example of why. A blend of four different Zinfandels and Petite Sirah, it opens with a nose of baked blackberry clafouti with a bit of hazelnut and almond, a still-tight wine that with air shows a ton of structure and layered tannins.",88,McCay Cellars 2008 Paisley Red (Lodi),,,,
"Plenty of flavor in this extremely ripe wine. Bursting with blackberry and cherry pie filling, currant, chocolate and cedar flavors, it's clearly delicious. Yet it's a very soft wine. Makes you wish it were firmer in structure, to support all that decadent flavor. Made entirely from the Stagecoach Vineyard, and the alcohol is 15.5%.",88,Vice Versa 2005 Versa Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
This soft and slightly sweet wine smells like cinnamon and vanilla and tastes like cherry juice. It is medium bodied and smooth in texture.,84,Backhouse 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),,,,
"This Pinot is crisp and delicately structured, with a silky texture. But the cola, raspberry and red currant flavors are thin, leading to a fast finish. Drink now.",85,Riverbench 2011 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"This is a serious, impressive wine. Fermented in open stone tanks and wood aged, it has a rich texture that encompasses the ripe black fruits and the spicy tannins. The wine has real depth and concentration with a firm, dense structure that will allow it to age. Drink from 2018.",93,Herdade do Esporão 2012 Esporão Private Selection Red (Alentejano),,,,
"This is a firm yet ripe wine that boasts ripe black-plum flavors layered with dense and dusty tannins. The wine is concentrated, with wood aging filling out the structure. It is big and bold, finishing with great ripe fruit.",90,Château Lanbersac 2009  Puisseguin Saint-Émilion,,,,
"Fragrant aromas of Anjou pear and green apple skins make for a fresh and fruit nose on this wine that is cut with lime-peel bitterness. It's delicate at first on the palate, with a slightly sour yellow grapefruit-peel flavor that leaves an energetic zing in the mouth.",89,Santa Barbara Winery 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"With cool, herbal aromas of cola, pine, juniper, fine oak and savory berry fruits, this is a fine Carmenère. The palate is full, deep and still fresh after several years in the bottle. Flavors of stewed cherry, baked plum and cassis come with no shortage of savory support, while the finish is saucy in taste, with raciness, gravitas and length. Drink through 2018.",91,Santa Rita 2008 Pehuén Carmenère (Apalta),,,,
"This varietal Garnacha is chunky and heavily oaked on the nose, with woody aromas of vanilla and plastic. An overtly oaky, awkward feeling palate tastes of resin on top of plum and blackberry, while the finish shows more resin mixed with mint.",84,Bodegas Langa 2012 Pieza el Caidero Grenache (Calatayud),,,,
"Ripe, lush and a touch raisiny on the nose, this smells like boysenberry pie and crème de cassis liqueur. Chewy, tannic and a bit heavy in this youthful state, this offering from vineyards in the town of Porrera (Vall Llach's home) delivers blackberry, cassis and prune flavors along with a toasty, chocolaty, oak-heavy finish. Best from 2016 through 2021.",93,Vall Llach 2012 Porrera Vi de Vila Red (Priorat),,,,
"This structured, dense and smoky wine features dry tannins and a mineral texture. It has blackberry fruitiness to go with this scaffolding, so it will develop well to give a ripe, full, rich wine. Wait until 2015.",88,DFJ Vinhos 2011 Patamar Reserva Red (Douro),,,,
"Relatively restrained for Viognier, with attractive fruit notes of muskmelon, apricot and pineapple, but not much more in the way of complexity. It's medium bodied, with a long, refreshing finish that hints at white pepper. Drink now.",89,Alain Jaume et Fils 2015 Domiane Grand Veneur Blanc de Viognier (Côtes du Rhône),,,,
"For a large-production sparkler made from an almost 50-50 split of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, a dollop of Pinot Meunier blended in, this is impressive, dry and refreshing in acidity. Flavors of stone fruit, apple and almond linger on the palate, balanced by a distinct layering of fresh-squeezed citrus, from orange to lime.",90,J Vineyards & Winery NV Cuvée 20 Sparkling (Sonoma County),,,,
"This ripe and fruity wine is rich and full in the mouth. It's balanced in acidity and packed with layers of yellow fruits, quince and pears. It will still develop, bringing out a fuller character. Drink from late 2015.",89,Henri Ehrhart 2013 Réserve Particulière Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"Dão Sul's venture in the Alentejo has produced a wine that is soft, rich, all ripe berry fruits and gentle tannins. It's a warm, fruit-driven wine that has a rounded feel, with the acidity at the end giving some freshness. Drink now.",88,Dão Sul 2009 Monte de Cal Reserva Red (Alentejano),,,,
"This ripe, structured wine is full of cherry flavors and crisp acidity. Spice and dark chocolate notes make an appearance, but the wine is mainly about perfumed fruit.",85,Maison de la Villette 2016 Pinot Noir (Vin de France),,,,
"From century-old vines, this wine is potent and focused, with powerful, ripe fruit flavors and a texture that feels polished and precise. The aromas favor black cherry and black pepper, the flavors are fresh and mouth-filling, and the wine has firm acidity and tannins that make the texture appetizing.",92,Bella 2013 Big River Ranch Vineyard Series Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Smooth, wood-polished wine, packed with a ripe, comfortable texture, very ripe red fruits, highlights of tannins. There are black figs, balanced with sweet acidity and fattened with some bacon flavors.",88,J. Portugal Ramos 2005 Aragonês (Alentejano),,,,
"This tight, stalky, still-young wine has a firm structure of tannins over the blackberry fruits. Wood aging has softened some of the harder edges and has also given the wine a chance to mature. Drink from 2017.",88,Caves Velhas 2012 Catedral Reserva Red (Dão),,,,
"Cigarbox, mint, balsamic and leather lead this traditionally minded Agiorgitiko from Boutari. On the palate, plum, spice and tobacco prevail.",85,Boutari 2011 Agiorgitiko (Nemea),,,,
Green apple and honeysuckle aromas follow through to the fresh polished palate along with nectarine drop and white peach. Bright acidity lifts the rich flavors while a creamy mousse lends finesse.,89,Terre di San Venanzio Fortunato NV Extra Dry  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
"From one of the small wine areas close to Chablis, this delicious, steely, crisp wine has fine acidity and a tight texture. It's cool, fresh and refreshing with a light, dancing aftertaste.",87,Simonnet-Febvre 2012 Vézelay  (Chablis),,,,
"Meaty, smoky aromas and good, high-amplitude fruit flavors give a robust personality to this full-bodied, dry and firmly tannic wine. It will make a good pairing with pasta, roasted birds or grilled meat.",90,Andis 2012 Cooper Ranch Barbera (Amador County),,,,
"On the rich side for a Muscadet, with acidity adding to the yeast, citrus and grapefruit flavors. There is a great zingy character, finishing with intense acidity.",86,Domaine du Haut Bourg 2009  Muscadet Côtes de Grandlieu,,,,
"This wine offers red berry fruits, the softest tannins and texture and an earthy, rustic aftertaste. Drink now.",83,Domaine Charles Frey 2013 Harmonie Pinot Noir (Alsace),,,,
"At first whiff, there's a slightly odd funkiness to this co-fermented blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah, but that blows off with time. Aromas of dill, green peppercorns, wet cedar and forest underbrush lead into flavors of freshly sliced rare beef, dried mulberry, fresh elderberry and slightly sour tar.",88,Lost Blues 2012 Good Fences Grenache-Syrah (California),,,,
"Plenty of dark Malbec tannins here, giving a tight, mineral wine with a core of dryness. Around the core are black plum and fig fruits, and an edge of the crispest black currants. Firmly extracted, with fine wood toast flavors.",91,Château Lamartine 2007 Cuvée Particulière Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"Luscious berry notes make for a totally appetizing opening: fresh huckleberries are chief amongst them, paired with ripe plum. They are equally lively on the just about mid-weight palate where a soft and pliable structure holds them aloft. Easy but berry-tastic drinking.",89,The Dot 2015 Austrian Plum St. Laurent (Niederösterreich),,,,
"Made from organically grown grapes, this Chardonnay imparts a taste of beeswax and lemon. It's robust in acidity and structured with a sizeable finish. Small percentages of Muscat, Viognier and Riesling are mingled in.",86,Bonterra 2012 Chardonnay (Mendocino County),,,,
"Fresh, jammy raspberry and currant aromas are simple but attractive. This offers a chunky, full mouthfeel along with lightly herbal berry, loam and modest spice flavors. The finish is good but standard in feel, length and complexity.",87,Bodegas Valdemar 2012 Conde de Valdemar Selección Especial  (Rioja),,,,
"This wine opens sweet, smelling of lemon and grapefruit, and is appropriately creamy in mouthfeel, with a sliver of sweetness on the finish.",85,Hannah Nicole Vineyards 2010 Viognier (Contra Costa County),,,,
"A big, smooth, ripe wine, with rich raspberry-jam flavors and just gently dry tannins. This blend of Merlot with some Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon comes from vineyards 1,500 feet in the Limoux hills, yet it has the richness of a wine from warmer climate. Wood and spices add interest and richness.",90,Château d'Antugnac 2005 Aux Bons Hommes Red (Limoux),,,,
"A pleasing mix of grapefruit, green apple and melon fruit flavors highlights this fresh and appealing wine. Crisp acidity buoys up the fruit and ensures a clean exit.",89,Spindrift Cellars 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),,,,
"With a sweet nose of honey, malt and Golden Delicious apples, this is a fairly weighty Chardonnay from an unheralded appellation. The slightly oily herb and peach flavors pick up more butterscotch on the finish, yet remain crisp and clean.",85,Louis Latour 2000 En Paradis  (Pouilly-Vinzelles),,,,
"Earthy berry aromas come with woodspice notes. This is raw and acidic on the palate, and overall it feels prickly and a bit disjointed. Saucy plum flavors are salty, while the punch of red-fruit acidity propels a tangy finish.",85,Los Andicos 2016 Selección Especial Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
Steely cranberries and earthy tannins control the palate here. As the wine sits in the mouth a certain sense of green coffee beans arises. The finish is light and supple.,87,Quady North 2012 Steelhead Run Vineyard Syrah (Applegate Valley),,,,
"Classic Carmenère aromas of oregano, basil and tomato vie with ripe plum and spice to create an herbal-leaning but honest bouquet. Feels good, with balance and lift to flavors of berry, olive, tobacco and herbs. Mild and short on the finish, but nice for $10.",87,oops 2010 Carmenère (Central Valley),,,,
"Packed with dark tannins, this complex wine shows a powerful structure allied with very fresh acidity and red berry fruits. It is still feeling its way, heavy on the texture and still waiting for the fruit. Drink from 2014.",87,Château le Bonnat 2010  Graves,,,,
"This is a clean, fresh style of Garnacha with floral black cherry aromas offset by a minty note. The palate has a zingy feel and crisp, fresh plum, raspberry and dry herb flavors. As a whole it's focused and uncomplicated; this is very good Garnacha from one of the Valencia region's better producers.",89,Bodegas Rafael Cambra 2010 Soplo Garnacha (Valencia),,,,
"With damp earth and crusty leather aromas, this is a heavy wine with baked fruit, a syrupy mouthfeel and flavors of mocha, carob, leafy berry and earth. On the finish, it's full bodied and soft, with ripe black-fruit flavors that register as thick and a touch raisiny. Drink now.",88,Real Sitio de Ventosilla 2004 RSV 1601 El Duque de Lerma  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"This opens with restrained cooking spice and dark-skinned berry aromas. The lively, informal palate offers red cherry, white pepper and anise hints, with soft tannins and brisk acidity. Drink soon.",86,Ca' de Lion Ghione 2014 Le Muccie  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore),,,,
"Made from 40-year-old, bush-trained vines, this opens with earthy aromas of charred earth, smoke, grilled sage and black spice. The concentrated but elegant palate delivers mature blackberry, dried black cherry, allspice and pipe tobacco alongside velvety tannins.",90,Cantine Paolo Leo 2012  Primitivo di Manduria,,,,
"Full and round, this wine is fruity while smooth and rich. A layer of crisp acidity is surrounded by the generous white and yellow fruits, accented by a touch of toast and spice. Drink this wine from 2018.",90,Château de Santenay 2014  Meursault,,,,
"Soft and slightly buttery, this smooth-drinking Pinot Gris deftly mixes spiced pear fruit with a pat of butter and a whiff of resin. It's at a perfect point of drinkability right now.",89,Firesteed 2009 Pinot Gris (Oregon),,,,
"Subtle and shy at first, exhibiting light aromas of rose petal, this wine unveils slowly to reveal complex elements of cinnamon, red and black cherry—a curious commingling that comes together nicely. From several vineyards, including Martinelli, it's medium bodied and lengthy, with plenty of earthiness to the finish.",93,Benovia 2013 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Tastes soft and a little tired at the age of six-plus years, with pie-filling raspberry, cherry and spice flavors. A certain dry complexity makes it interesting, but its lifespan is largely exhausted.",86,Collier Falls 2004 Hillside Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"A sweet wine that is packed with botrytis and also intense acidity. Honey, apricot and orange peel of the Riesling are blended with spicy Gewurztraminer, giving a taut, still young wine. Keep 3–4 years.",89,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2010 Late Harvest White (Tejo),,,,
"A bit Porty, with raisiny flavors, but the finish is dry, and the tannins are nice and rich. Something about it brings to mind Cognac.",84,Westbrook Wine Farm NV Lamanuzzi & Pantaleo Vineyard Gambono Red (Madera),,,,
"The Cabernet is stiffened up with small amounts of Petit Verdot, Cab Franc and Malbec, resulting in a firm, herbal, but very well-balanced Bordeaux-style blend. There's compact cassis fruit, streaked with light stem, earth and herb. This is a wine that should improve with bottle age through 2019.",91,Seven Hills 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Sharp aromas of peach blossoms, honeyed nuts and lemon balm make for a fruity yet biting nose on this blend of 58% Grenache Blanc from Happy Canyon and 42% Viognier from San Luis Obispo County. Ripened stonefruit flavors are cut with a sizzle of acidity and warmth of sea salt and candied Meyer lemon on the palate.",89,Barton 2014 The River White (Central Coast),,,,
"Once tannic, always tannic? If so, this tough wine will remain rasping, and will need to be drunk with rich, oily foods to help tame the tannins. Underneath, it has some briary flavors and soft acidity, and is as dry as a desert summer wind. —S.H.",85,Midnight 1999 Starlight Sangiovese (Paso Robles),,,,
"Ripe and round, this soft, juicy wine shows just a hint of a more serious tannic structure. It has plenty of acidity to go with its warm, red cherry flavors. Drink now, or better from 2015.",88,Vincent 2012 Domaine de la Conseillère  (Juliénas),,,,
"This wine is packed with red fruits, crisp apples and oranges. It is so fresh and bright, with good acidity that gives everything a total lift.",86,Domaine de la Croix 2014 iirrrésistible Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"An amazing wine, so light and delicate in the mouth, it has the weight of a cloud. Yet this is a powerful wine. Shows concentrated red currant, cola, pomegranate and sandalwood flavors, brightened by bold acidity. This beauty will improve over the next eight years, but it's lovely to drink now.",94,Tantara 2011 Tondre H Block Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Here's a Cab that makes a play for supremecy in a very crowded field. The wine, which contains a drop of Merlot, is solidly in the modern, international, Napa cult style. Soft and appealing for its blackberry, currant, plum and vanilla oak flavors, it's drinkable now, but such are the tannins that it will be better after 2008.",93,Pillar Rock 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),,,,
"Ripe and jammy, this is bright Beaujolais. It's full of sweet fruits, soft tannins and lively acidity. At the end, the wine shows delicious cherries and just a touch of structure.",85,Jean-Claude Debeaune 2011 Domaine Pignard  (Beaujolais),,,,
"This is a very complete, well-balanced and satisfying wine that has a firm tannic structure to carry the tempting berry and black-cherry flavors. It starts with light cinnamon, clove and vanilla aromas that join loads of fruit on the palate, layering nicely for an interesting, complex and substantive character. Drink through 2025.",93,Boeger 2015 Rosa Canina Zinfandel (El Dorado),,,,
"A bit too pungent for this reviewer, with layers of crushed tomato stalk and leaves holding the edge over more attractive passion-fruit notes. It's light in weight and clean on the finish, so does offer some refreshment value.",85,Sileni 2015 Cellar Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"Aged on its lees for 30 months and bottled in March 2015, this is an exceptional Muscadet. It still has plenty of freshness along with a tight, mineral texture and lightly smoky flavors. The concentration gives the wine richness while it remains bone dry and crisp. It is ready to drink.",92,Château de la Ragotiere 2012 Vallet  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),,,,
"Underbrush, truffle, crushed herb and ripe black-skinned fruit aromas slowly take shape along with a waft of new leather. The bold palate shows mature black cherry, licorice, clove and tobacco framed in big velvety tannins. This is already tempting but will be even better in a few years. Drink 2020–2027.",94,Le Ragnaie 2012 Fornace  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"Blocky, stewy, raisiny aromas of nonspecific black fruits are jumbled and green. This feels awkward and jammy, with little to no structural integrity. Flavors of prune, raisin and oak finish soft and loamy.",83,Concha y Toro 2014 Reserva Casillero del Diablo Carmenère (Central Valley),,,,
"Smells barbecued and saucy, with dry oak, resin and smoked meat aromas. The palate is more acidic, while the flavors lean toward resiny and saucy, i.e. hickory and roasted berry. Oaky on the finish, with sawdust and vanilla flavors.",86,Colores del Sol 2010 Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Full-volume cherry and cassis are in the lead on the nose. This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Carmenère is robust and ripe. Raspberry, red plum, strawberry and pie cherry flavors cover the full red-fruit spectrum, while the finish remains fruity and bright, with a ton of energy. Drink through 2022.",90,Santa Ema 2012 Catalina Red (Maipo Valley),,,,
"This is a wood-aged blend of Alicante Bouschet, Syrah and Touriga Nacional, producing a wine that is both structured and ripe with black fruits. It has considerable acidity, spice along with some aging potential. Drink from 2018.",88,Quinta do Casal Branco 2014 Lobo e Falcão Reserva Red (Tejo),,,,
"Exotic aromas of fig pudding, prune and cocoa bean aren't just soft and sweet; there's edge and angle to this wine, with plenty of acidity at the core along with coffee and chocolate. If there's a fault here, it's that the acidity sweeps away the fruity sweetness, leaving some hollowness on the finish.",91,González Byass NV Matusalem Oloroso Dulce Viejo 375 ml Sherry (Jerez),,,,
"Sizable, tightly woven tannin wraps itself around black fruit with moderate acidity in this thick, tangy wine, which has 9% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot within the blend. Given less than two years in French oak, 60% of it new, it's an approachable, enjoyable wine that will also age. Drink now through 2021.",91,Cakebread 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"This red is roughly split between Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. It spent time in 40% new French oak and shows density and grip. There are substantial acids, bright black fruits and a streak of black tea among the flavors.",89,Soos Creek 2011 Artist Series #11 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A big, rich, softly jammy Petite Sirah that's packed with flavors of blackberry, blueberry, dark chocolate, anise and pepper. It's tannic, so cellaring this puppy for a good six years is recommended—although, it will always be fairly rustic.",89,Frank Family 2009 SJ Vineyard Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),,,,
"This tart, silky wine brings together hints of vanilla and cedar with pie cherries and beets. Light in body, it finishes with crisp acids.",84,Stoneburn 2013 Pinot Noir (Marlborough),,,,
"A heartier and meatier take on Pinot Noir, this bottling shows black plums, hoisin, hickory smoke and pepper on the nose. The palate is also rich with plum sauce and strong fennel flavors, showing oak smoke as well. Quite tasty overall for those seeking some heft.",92,Westerly 2014 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Fresh, fruity and forward, this wine is full of bright apple, peach and pineapple flavors. Dry in style with soft lemon acidity, it's quaffable and brisk, but finishes a tad short and simple.",86,Roanoke Vineyards 2011 The Wild Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"This Prosecco is not as fresh as others and offers a tiny hint of ash or matchstick at the back. In the mouth, however, the wine tastes tonic and tight and ends with a blast of citrus zest.",85,Bellenda 2008 Miraval Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene),,,,
"Pretty scents of raspberry, baked strawberry, rose potpourri and exotic spice carry onto the lithe, open-knit palate. The dried herb and licorice flavors that extend onto the finish lend this Cabernet Franc a savory bent.",86,Lovingston 2011 Josie's Knoll Cabernet Franc (Monticello),,,,
"This is a very pale Chardonnay from Laetitia Winery, which sits just three miles from the ocean amidst vineyards planted on rocky clay loam, and yet possesses an appealing, complex mix of creaminess and crispiness on the nose. There is a slight bitterness on the palate as well as brioche and citrus zest on the finish. This tightly focused wine would perfectly cut the richness of shrimp scampi or other buttery dish.",89,Laetitia 2012 Estate Chardonnay (Arroyo Grande Valley),,,,
"Ripe wine, pushing its toast, pear and apricot flavors. Smooth, with an English walnut taste, and green herb acidity. Ready to drink now.",87,Louis Jadot 2009  Mâcon-Villages,,,,
"Tomato leaf and nettle aromas join with grapefruit and tropical fruit. This is both more pungent and rounder than the Reserva, with greater concentration and verve.",88,Tarapaca 2008 La Isla Gran Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),,,,
"Winemaker: Gordon Newton Johnson. This is such a pretty and elegant Pinot, certainly not what most would expect from a ""New World"" wine region. It expresses the masterful balance that South African Pinot can achieve in the New World style of ripe red-fruit character with the Old World finesse of bright acidity and an earthy, forest-floor dominance. Pressed floral tones are partnered with notes of red cherry, cola spice and sous bois throughout. Silky and smooth, it offers soft, fine tannins that somehow still manage to provide a present structure for overall balance and harmony. Drink now–2023.",92,Newton Johnson 2016 Cape Winemakers Guild Windansea Pinot Noir,,,,
"This brawny red opens with aromas suggesting resin, stewed prune, blue flower, cooking spice and leather. The robust palate offers raisin, blackberry extract, cinnamon and mocha while solid, velvety tannins provide support.",92,San Rustico 2011  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,,,,
"This opens with a classic Nebbiolo fragrance of red rose, leather, perfumed wild berries, forest floor and a hint of menthol. On the palate, white pepper, mint, thyme and eucalyptus notes add depth to the mouthwatering wild cherry and ripe raspberry flavors. It's still young, with a firm, tannic backbone balanced with just enough fresh acidity. Drink 2018–2026.",93,Poderi Colla 2011 Roncaglie  (Barbaresco),,,,
"This wine is full of acidity, with a crisp edge that's a delicious part of the riper fruit. The wood-aging spiciness is well judged to give a balanced wine that is generous and ready to drink.",90,Château de Beauregard 2015 Vers Cras  (Pouilly-Fuissé),,,,
"A softly polished wine that's ready to enjoy soon, this shows classic aromas of black fruit, spice, tobacco leaf and underbrush. It has a delicious black-cherry flavor, punctuated with black pepper, clove and a hint of bitter almond.",88,Tenuta Sant'Antonio 2011 Monti Garbi  (Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso),,,,
"Butter, sea salt, hard caramel candy, pan-seared white peach and poached apple aromas show on the nose on this wine by veteran Bryan Babcock. Once sipped, the wine tightens around a citrus pith, showing yogurt, iodine and lots of acidic energy, as well as more seared pome fruit on the finish.",91,Babcock 2013 Top Cream Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
This smokey Amarone opens with woody tones of forest floor and bramble followed by savory notes of cured beef and wild mushroom. Dark fruit flavors fill in the background and the wine ends with distinct layers of leather and dried tobacco leaf.,88,Vaona 2006 Paverno  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),,,,
"This five-grape, Bordeaux-style blend is principally Cabernet Sauvignon, and offers forward, moderately light fruit flavors of strawberry and cherry. It's balanced and pleasant tasting, though lacking the depth that you might wish for in this price range.",88,Swiftwater Cellars 2010 Proprietary Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A touch of freshly cut apple peel is all that appears on the shy nose. The palate is more approachable and opens into beautifully aromatic notions of ripe tart apples and blossom. This has a very harmonious balance and something like tender poise. This is absolutely fresh but it comes like a caress, touching and convincing with tenderness rather than flashy force. The palate is dry, has ample and aromatic apple fruit and immense charm. This is so easy to drink right now but will certainly evolve. It finishes with a long pure echo of lemon. Drink 2017–2027.",94,Kuentz-Bas 2015 Eichberg Grand Cru Trois Châteaux Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"Black-cherry fruit is decorated with crushed thyme, dried sage, roasted meat and cinnamon on the nose of this bottling. The palate offers more cherry fruit but also a bit of black-plum-skin tartness, as well as decent amounts of asphalt and turned earth.",90,Sextant 2014 Wheelhouse Zinfandel (Paso Robles),,,,
"While light in color, this rich wine is full of both fruit and tannin. It has real Pinot Noir cherry and strawberry flavors, lightened by cool acidity. The structure comes from the rich wood flavors and the complex tannins. Drink from 2015.",89,Charles Sparr 2011 Leimengrub Pinot Noir (Alsace),,,,
"With 20% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc, this wine is muted yet robust, speaking with a loud voice of tannin and power. Simple and soft, it's ready to enjoy now.",85,Topanga 2012 Black and White Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Aromas of apple cider, peach and oak lead to a full palate. Flavors of melon and banana have a nutty quality, while this is stable on the finish, with tropical fruit and honeyed flavors. Drink now.",89,Viña Cobos 2016 Felino Chardonnay (Mendoza),,,,
"Though Syrah makes up only 14% of this wine, it seems to take over the show with its notes of plum and smoke playing against barrel accents of pencil lead and vanilla. It drinks off dry (9.5g/L residual sugar), with dry grainy tannins.",84,Canoe Ridge 2012 The Expedition Canoe Ridge Estate Vineyard Merlot (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"This Chardonnay needs a few more months to come around. It's tart with acidity, along with oak and tropical fruit flavors that have plenty of potential, but haven't meshed together yet.",87,Frank Family 2012 Chardonnay (Carneros),,,,
This informal red has a shy nose that eventually reveals whiffs of black-skinned fruit and a suggestion of cooking spice. The simple palate delivers black cherry and vanilla alongside laid-back tannins. Drink soon.,85,Famiglia Cielo 2014 Pinot Nero (Delle Venezie),,,,
"Produced in the same area as many of the Armagnac vineyards, the wine is gently sweet and with a herbal edge. It has fruit flavors of dried apricot, citrus and apple jelly. The wine is shot through with attractive acidity and is ready to drink.",86,Domaine de Ménard 2015 Moelleux Gros Manseng (Côtes de Gascogne),,,,
"A great price for a great wine, this Bea's Knees offers soft raspberry and leathery plum. Likewise it's soft, though not shy, in tannins. With savory cedar and espresso going on aside a long finish, it's ready to enjoy right now—thanks to the winery's holding back on release—and could further mellow into an even more savory self in time.",88,People's Wine Revolution 2008 Bea's Knees Petite Sirah (El Dorado County),,,,
"Asphalt, licorice and espresso mark the nose of this medium-bodied, juicy Shiraz. The flavors are brighter, hinting at rhubarb, yet still retaining a dark, tarry edge. Drink this mouthwatering wine over the next few years.",90,Red Knot 2014 Shiraz (McLaren Vale),,,,
"Made in a tart, citrusy style, like an elegant Chablis, this rich, balanced Chardonnay shows candied flavors of pineapples, lemon custard, Key lime pie and stony minerals. Brisk acidity provides a keen, bracing balance.",92,Darioush 2008 Signature Chardonnay (Napa Valley),,,,
"Here is a huge ripe and luxurious wine, with great power. The texture is solid, filled with firm tannins, the flavors are black and ripe. Along with the power, though, is much of the elegance and poise that characterizes great Saint-Julien.",95,Château Branaire-Ducru 2000  Saint-Julien,,,,
"Made with ungrafted 80-year-old vines, this gorgeous wine opens with an enticing bouquet of perfumed berry, fragrant blue flower, baking spice, leather and a whiff of Mediterranean brush. The concentrated enveloping palate is still young but already offers blackberry extract, raspberry jam, licorice, dried sage and tobacco. Firm fine-grained tannins offer age-worthy support and a velvety texture. Drink 2020–2032.",94,Basilisco 2012 Storico  (Aglianico del Vulture),,,,
"Their estate Chardonnay is all barrel fermented. A bigger style, with lots of texture but not too much oak. Leesy, creamy, with buttery, tropical fruit. Again, well-balanced and stylish.",88,Paschal 2000 Estate Chardonnay (Rogue Valley),,,,
"It takes a while for the taste of this light, fresh white to come through. Then, it is soft, creamy textured, flavored with pear juice and lemon zest. It is simple, easy, cleanly made.",84,DFJ Vinhos 2008 Portada Branco White (Estremadura),,,,
"92-94 Barrel sample. With its big, almost dry core of botrytis, this is going to be an intense wine - many years from now. For the present, the acidity gives it some freshness, while it remains concentrated.",93,Château Suau 2008 Barrel sample  (Barsac),,,,
"It's amazing how much this wine smells like peppermint. A blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah, this is a distinctive wine that offers playful aromas of clove, cardamom, chocolate and rhubarb behind a solid wall of spearmint. It has tight tannins, a solid structure and fresh acidity.",90,Guicciardini Strozzi 2005 Ocra  (Bolgheri),,,,
"Created in 1819, this vineyard surrounds a Victorian château overlooking the Loire. This wine is fruity, fresh and soft. It has attractive acidity, a light texture and perfumed acidity set in the context of apple and lime fruits. Drink now.",85,Château de Thauvenay 2014  Sancerre,,,,
"Plump, easy, mostly neutral aromas of white fruits and crushed vitamin set up a drawing palate with citric acidity. Simple, ripe nectarine and citrus flavors confirm a good but largely innocuous Chardonnay.",87,Santa Rita 2015 Medalla Real Chardonnay (Leyda Valley),,,,
"Scents of honey and marmalade are accented with lemongrass and ginger on this exquisitely composed beerenauslese. It's lusciously rich, with flavors of peach preserves and mango, but accented with hints of warm, exotic spice and a streak of lemony acidity that reverberates on the finish.",95,C.H. Berres 2011 Ürziger Würzgarten Beerenauslese Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Light scallion and green herb aromas are offset by buttercup and melon scents. It feels fairly deep and melony, with peach and apple flavors. Despite being soft on the finish, it's packed with white fruit and tropical fruit flavors.",87,Terras Gauda 2011 Abadia de San Campio Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"In style, Coutale doesn't make many concessions to Malbec tannins. What you get is an impressively structured, firmly tannic wine, packed also with black fruits. The solid structure and the weight of fruit demand aging for at least 5 years.",91,Clos la Coutale 2009 Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"Typically semi-sweet style of rosé, crisp and clean, flavored with ripe strawberries. Good as an apéritif or with spicy dishes. Screwcap.",83,Les Vignerons des Terroirs de la Noëlle 2010 Les Ligeriens  (Rosé d'Anjou),,,,
"Brisk and bright, this straightforward white blend offers fresh apple and pear flavors accented with a streak of grapefruit acidity. It's dry in style with an easy, quaffable character.",85,Baiting Hollow Farm Vineyard 2011 White Satin White (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"From a small vineyard in the north of the Côte de Nuits, this is a rare white wine in a red-wine region. Lightly toasty, it has spice, pear flavors and perfumed acidity. It's bright and crisp, ending with lively acidity.",90,Alex Gambal 2014  Fixin,,,,
"Extravagantly floral on the nose, with blueberry, mineral and other particular aromas. But once you hit the palate, the acidity is extreme and thus the mouthfeel is sheering. Flavors of blueberry and mulberry are tangy, while the finish is angular. Too sharp and tangy to compete with the best, including Altamira and Bella Vista, Achaval-Ferrer's other single-vineyard big boys.",88,Achaval-Ferrer 2007 Finca Mirador Malbec (Medrano),,,,
"The small area of Pez is one of the top sites in Saint-Estèphe, with many highly rated chateaus. This is one. New wood aging shows strongly at this stage, although so does the fruit. That gives a structured wine, firm and also full of blackberry fruit flavors. The future is good for this wine, so drink from 2018.",90,Château Tour de Pez 2012  Saint-Estèphe,,,,
"This Tempranillo-Graciano blend opens with rugged aromas of cherry and currant. The palate follows that lead, with choppy, bumpy tannins. Flavors of cherry and berry fruits come with a coating of crusty, blackened oak, holding onto coarseness across the finish. Drink through 2022.",89,Tinedo 2013 N. 2 Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),,,,
"This is such an elegant wine that has all the structure of the vintage. Surrounding the tannins, the wine is sweet and ripe, with smokiness from the wood. It's powerful, elegant and sophisticated with a strong sense of poise. The tannins promise long-term aging.",96,Château Montrose 2010  Saint-Estèphe,,,,
"The nose is still shy but already tells of tender sweetness. The palate has a rounded earthy smoky element that grounds the luscious generous fruit of dried pear and supersweet Reine Claude and mirabelle plums. The sweetness of this SGN is balanced and almost fresh, but the intriguing thing is a kind of smoky, dark and mysterious core of stone.",95,Domaine Schoffit 2007 Clos Saint-Théobald Grand Cru Rangen Sélection de Grains Nobles Larme de Lave Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"As with all the 2013 white wines from Chehalem, the alcohol is way down and the acids up in this blend of the three estate vineyards. All-stainless fermented, it's quite tart with green apple and grapefruit flavors dominating.",87,Chehalem 2013 Three Vineyard Riesling (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This brut sparkler is made from Chambourcin, a hybrid grape of uncertain parentage. Fresh figs and dates come to mind on the nose, while the linear palate is persistently citrus-driven.",85,Illinois Sparkling Co. NV Franken's French Hybrid Brut Sparkling (Illinois),,,,
"Aromas of tilled earth, leather, game and spicy plum carry over to the palate with dried blueberry, ground pepper and a hint of licorice. Round but fleeting tannins provide easygoing support.",87,Palamà 2012 Arcangelo Primitivo (Salento),,,,
"This has a subdued nose that eventually reveals fig, smoke and graphite. On the straightforward palate, a nutmeg note accents mature blackberry while round tannins offer loose-knit support. Drink soon.",87,Loacker 2013 Lagrein (Alto Adige),,,,
"The refreshing flavor of creamed apples and citrus shine in this ripe, generous wine. Its acidity and light, peppery touch make it delicious and ready to drink.",89,Les Rocailles 2016  Roussette de Savoie,,,,
"This is the winery's priciest red and also its best. It immediately appeals for the soft, lush texture and the way the sweet fruit marries with the oak to wow the palate. Shows lush cherries and cassis, with rich nuances of vanilla, smoky wood and anise. Decadent and delicious, and best now through 2011. Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, but comprised of all 5 Bordeaux varieties.",92,Stephanie 2005 Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"While the nose suggests ripe tangerines and blossoms edged by hints of smoke and slate, the palate of this dry Riesling turns surprisingly austere. Light on its feet with a lean, razor-edged precision, it's angularity and steeliness are refreshing and revitalizing. The finish is marked by lingering lime pith and herbal tones.",91,Johannishof 2015 Johannisberger Auf der Höll Erste Lage Trocken Riesling (Rheingau),,,,
"Honeyed but otherwise not overly aromatic, this full-bodied, corpulent Condrieu still provides enjoyable drinking. The weighty notes of honeyed citrus linger on the finish, but drink up over the next six months or so.",90,Les Vins de Vienne 2009 Les Archevêques  (Condrieu),,,,
"Here's a plump, juicy rosé from Tuscany with a pretty palette of aromas that goes from wild berries to pink flower. There's a touch of ash or white mineral at the back and the wine tastes generous and full in the mouth. It has intensity, personality and staying power.",87,Il Poggione 2008 Lo Sbrancato Rosato Rosé (Toscana),,,,
"Silky, cherry-fruited elegance and a caressing subtlety make this a winner in the sleekness stakes. There is freshness and perfectly pitched balance, with soft yet structured tannins. Seductive notes of Amarena cherry and dark chocolate, with mere edges of cinnamon, dance on the palate. Drink 2016–2020.",92,Gernot and Heike Heinrich 2011 Pannobile Red (Burgenland),,,,
"With an attractive toasty aroma, this wine is rich and delicious. It is one of this producer's nonvintage blends, a very superior marriage between Grand Cru grapes from the Côte des Blancs and Montagne de Reims. With apple, toast and lemon flavors it is dry and ready to drink.",91,Lombard et Cie NV Brut Nature Grand Cru  (Champagne),,,,
"A savory touch of soy colors the nose of this wine. It boasts underlying fleshy, black cherry notes that are edged with peppery spice and enough freshness to feel lively, honest and appetizing. The finish is fresh and juicy.",89,Nadler 2014 Rote Rieden Zweigelt (Carnuntum),,,,
"Tannic and astringent at first taste, this wine opens up into a more complex and interesting play of dark fruits and darker flavors. Smoke, earth, char and espresso components are set against tight blueberry fruit, with lead pencil tannins. Those tannins might need a juicy steak to put them back in their cage.",89,Nk'Mip Cellars 2009 Qwam Qwmt Syrah (Okanagan Valley),,,,
"This is the winery's sweet sparkling wine. It has the elegant structure, fine acidity and forward raspberry, strawberry, lime, vanilla and smoke flavors of the dry bruts, with a sugary finish, for those who like their bubblies on the sweet side.",86,Mumm Napa NV Cuvée M Sparkling (Napa Valley),,,,
"This barrel-fermented Chardonnay, from the oldest plantings (1972) in Washington State, displays exceptional concentration and palate weight. Apple pie, pear tart, baking spice, butter and caramel flavors abound. It's rich and packed with fruit, along with the seductive flavors that aging in new French oak can provide.",95,Ashan 2012 Kestrel Vineyard Chardonnay (Yakima Valley),,,,
Apple and spice aromas come in front of a soft palate. Melony flavors are short on zest and finish abruptly.,84,Vilarnau NV Brut Reserva Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"Aromas of red berry, game, scorched earth and a whiff of menthol emerge on this full-bodied Barolo. The linear, powerful palate offers succulent red cherry, wild berry, anise and baking spice alongside firm but refined tannins and bright acidity. Give it time to unwind then enjoy. Drink after 2020.",92,Cascina Adelaide 2011 Preda  (Barolo),,,,
"Fruity, aromatic wine, this is a few months too young to drink. Already, it is showing its attractive wild berry and rhubarb fruits and soft tannins. There is a juicy, open aftertaste.",88,Johanneshof Reinisch 2011 St. Laurent (Thermenregion),,,,
"Hermann J. Wiemer may be synonymous with NY Riesling, but its Cabernet Francs are consistently some of the best reds made in the state. Subdued shades of cigar box, cedar and tomato leaf lend savory Old World elegance to this ripe richly concentrated wine. Pristine blackberry and plum flavors are juicy and penetrating yet briskly composed. A bristle of soft cocoa powder tannins extends the finish.",93,Hermann J. Wiemer 2014 Magalena Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Seneca Lake),,,,
This wine shows how aromatic and floral this varietal can be. It offers clove and rose petal along with raspberry in the aromas. The full body is supported by good acidity and moderate tannins.,86,Barrel Racer 2013 Barbera (Yolo County),,,,
"Very clean and clear, and even though it's a 2009 it is still holding onto its core freshness and character. White fruits and flower blossoms work the nose, and the palate is now fully mature, elegant and smooth. Flavors of peach, melon and kiwi are clean and tasty. Albariño at its best.",90,Lusco 2009 Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"At more than six years of age, this wine is as fresh and fruity as if it were made yesterday, with blackberry, cherry and blueberry jam, currant and mocha flavors, enriched with toasty, caramelized oak. The tannins are strong, yet smooth and refined. The wine is so gorgeous right out of the bottle, you can drink it now, but try giving it six more years to really show its stuff.",95,En Garde 2007 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),,,,
"Crisp with acidity and ripe with apricot flavors, this is a finely perfumed wine. A core of botrytis hints at future richness. Now, it boasts bitter orange notes and a bright finish.",88,Château d'Arche 2014 Perle  (Sauternes),,,,
"After an unusual, almost saline note passed, this wine presented a bouquet of dark cherry, chocolate and toast. This opens to a mouth of mild cherry flavors with a dry even feel and a black-plum and cocoa finish that displays slightly edgy tannins.",84,Poggio Salvi 1998  Chianti Colli Senesi,,,,
"A blend made of up a majority Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine also includes Merlot, Sangiovese and Syrah. Licorice and red plum mingle on the palate, around a layering of cinnamon and black spice. Soft, the overall texture and body is substantial, finding a balance and trace of acidity on the finish.",88,Benessere 2010 Phenomenon Estate Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Aromas of sour cherry, raisin, herb and a hint of scorched earth lead the nose. On the straightforward rather lean palate, ground pepper accents dried cranberry and pomegranate alongside lithe tannins.",87,Barone Cornacchia 2011 Vigna Le Coste  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),,,,
"This medium-dry Muscat has aromas of white flowers and lemon blossoms. On the palate there are flavors of honeysuckle, peach and lime juice.",85,Jidvei 2016 Treasure of Transylvania Medium Dry Moscato (Tarnave),,,,
This warm and rich wine has bold red fruit and a background of tannins and wood-derived flavors. It's full of ripe fruit and balanced acidity and has an open character that makes it drinkable soon. Drink from 2018.,88,Château de la Vieille Tour 2015  Bordeaux Supérieur,,,,
"Blended with 8% Merlot and 6% Petit Verdot, this is a well-made wine from the mountain appellation. With integrated oak and a supportive undercurrent of acidity, it's rounded and rich in bright cherry fruit, the accents a mix of clove and graphite, finishing with balance.",92,Lobo 2014 Wulff Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak),,,,
"Pristine layers of guava, blossom and green plum are etched by crushed stone and acid in this pure, crystalline Auslese. It's ethereally light with a delicate sweetness that meanders long on the finish. Drink now to enjoy its youthful exuberance but hold a few back to savor over the next decade.",94,Fritz Haag 2014 Brauneberger Juffer Auslese Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"This Chardonnay, as you may have guessed from the designation, is unoaked. What you get is fruit, and plenty of it, in the form of pineapples and peaches. There's a good burst of acidity on the finish.",84,Carmel Road 2012 Liberated Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),,,,
"There's a nice, juicy, lip-smacking tang to this Sauv Blanc, like biting into a not quite ripe peach or a lemon drop. It's a good mix of citrus, steel and stone. A small amount of Sémillon in the blend adds weight to the midpalate.",87,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This beloved annual bottling by Randall Grahm blends 39% Mourvèdre, 33% Grenache, 26% Syrah and 2% Cinsaut to create a very savory, Old World-style expression, with aromas of roasted game, pencil shavings, dried red fruits and blood. The palate is very iron-rich and rustic, with uncrushed black peppercorns and raw and dried meat flavors.",92,Bonny Doon 2012 Le Cigare Volant Reserve Red (Central Coast),,,,
"Plum and cola aromas set up a spunky, rubbery Merlot that features a mix of roasted berry and chocolaty oak flavors. It is mild on the finish.",85,Zolo 2011 Merlot (Mendoza),,,,
"Girolamo Russo is an impressive winemaker and we are absolutely smitten with his elegant line of Etna wines. The Feudo cru offers an interesting medley of fruit, spice and mineral notes with playful dabs of smoked bacon. Try it with a thick cutting of pecorino cheese.",92,Girolamo Russo 2007 Feudo  (Etna),,,,
"This well-made wine has appealing aromas of milk chocolate, coffee and plum. The style is lighter, with the concentration not seeming quite all there, but it still provides plenty of appeal with its elegance. Put it at the dinner table to see it at its best.",88,Telaya 2012 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Medicinal cherry and plum aromas are smothered in milk chocolate scents that turn more animal and leathery with airing. The palate is chunky but dull in feel, with generic red-berry flavors covered with candied oak and herbal notes.",83,Toscar 2010 Monastrell (Alicante),,,,
"Aromas of cotton candy, vanilla and strawberry jam are fluffy. In the mouth, this wine feels ripe and syrupy, with firm tannins. Medicinal flavors of cassis, chocolate and herbs finishes thick and saturated. Drink through 2023.",89,San Pedro 2014 Cabo de Hornos Cabernet Sauvignon (Cachapoal Valley),,,,
"Rieflé is one of the rare Alsace producers who indicates the sweetness and richness levels of their wine. This wine rates a level just below the median of the chart, a fair assessment of the medium-sweet taste, emphasizing the richness of the grape and giving flavors of lychee and spice.",87,Rieflé 2005 Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"Aged for 30 months in French and American oak (90% new), this wine brings pleasing notes of café au lait, pencil lead, cashew and woodspice. Rich coffee and chocolate flavors are backed by a silky feel, with the wood playing prominent role.",90,14 Hands 2011 The Reserve Merlot (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"The wine opens with an inky dark color and segues to thick aromas of black fruit, espresso, tobacco and spice. Most of the action is on the nose however, because the mild mouthful offers just enough structure and acidity to compliment those foods.",90,Verbena 2008  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"This is made in an unusually light and refreshing style, using grapes from 37-year-old vines. It has aromas and flavors like white pepper, snap peas and lemon, light body and crisp acidity. The overall impression is one of freshness and brightness.",88,Andis 2014 Bill Dillian Vineyard Sémillon (Amador County),,,,
"With only 10 cases imported to the U.S., one suspects that this terrific wine will largely be found in exclusive restaurants. If you can find a bottle at a reasonable markup, jump on it, for this is one of Victoria's finest Shirazes. Hickory smoke, espresso and herbal notes accent raspberry fruit, whose brightness gives the wine extra lift and dimension. It's creamy and lushly textured without ever seeming heavy, and boasts a long, silky finish that echoes with suggestions of cocoa powder and pulverized coffee beans. Drink now–2025.",94,Giaconda 2008 Warner Vineyard Shiraz (Victoria),,,,
"From the granite soil of the northern area of Vinho Verde, this rich, structured and dense bottling is far from the conventional view of Vinho Verde. It is a powerful, ripe, apricot and peach flavored wine that is strongly mineral and concentrated. Drink now, but the wine will improve for several years.",90,Luis Seabra 2013 Granito Cru Alvarinho (Vinho Verde),,,,
"This blend of 89% Sauvignon Blanc, 10% Chardonnay and 1% Muscat is fulsome, lush and rounded, with deep layers of pear, fig and vanilla flavors. Acidity provides a zippy end to its lengthy finish.",90,Bennett Lane 2016 Maximus White Feasting Wine White (Napa Valley),,,,
"Blended with 20% Petit Verdot, this unusual offering brings notes of mushroom, herbs, smoke and dark cherries. It's tightly wound with a firm squeeze of tannins.",89,Gorman 2011 The Albatross Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),,,,
"So sweet and jammy, it's hard not to drink it up now, despite some firm tannins. Displays a rich spectrum of cherries, pomegranates and red currants, with exotic spices and the brown sugary sweetness of toasted oak. The finish is dry and elegant. A real beauty for drinking over the next five years.",91,Fulcrum 2011 Wildcat Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),,,,
"Made from 100% Chardonnay, this sparkling wine is absolutely delicious to drink now. It has vanilla, cream, lemon, lime and yeast flavors, accented with crisp acidity, and the bubbly mousse is soft and fine.",90,Schramsberg 2010 Blanc de Blancs Brut Sparkling (Napa-Mendocino-Sonoma-Marin),,,,
"This simple, no-fuss Prosecco opens with cheery aromas of peach, yellow rose and a touch of bitter almond. This expression also offers mature flavors of melon and apricot on the finish.",86,Bianca Vigna 2010 Brut Millesimato  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
"This wine's fruit is overripe, which spoils the structure that has been built around it.",81,Château Bellevue 2010  Bordeaux Supérieur,,,,
"A blend of half Sémillon and half Chardonnay, this is an aromatic, fully fleshed-out wine that veers into richness without going too far. Swirling in layers of concentrated pear and lemon, it provides a long, substantial finish, ending in balanced acidity.",88,Murrieta's Well 2012 Los Tesoros de Joaquin Chardonnay-Semillon (Livermore Valley),,,,
"Riper and fruitier than last year's release, a big, juicy wine that rewards the palate with layers of blackberry and cherry on top of the usual cola, tomato and rhubarb flavors. Structurally, it's a big wine, with firm tannins. I would cellar this until next year.",92,Talley 2001 Rincon Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),,,,
"Here's solid, everyday red wine here, rugged and fruity, but there's something about it that makes you think of pizza and burgers. The blend is Zinfandel, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah.",83,Kitchen Sink NV Red Table Wine Red (California),,,,
Dry apple and pine-needle aromas are punchy on this blend of 80% Grenache Blanc and 20% Macabeo. An uneventful palate is fresh but simple. This wine tastes mostly of bitter grape skins and almond skins. Modest apple and grapefruit notes show on the finish.,86,Portal del Montsant 2015 Bruberry Blanc White (Montsant),,,,
"Made in the style of a southern Rhône blend (half Viognier and one quarter each Marsanne and Roussanne), this is lightly lemony, with a bit more fat in the middle. None of the three grapes overpowers the others, but the flavors feel a bit generic. Though fermented in stainless steel, it's gold in color and shows some hints of toast.",87,Simple Machine 2013 Leverage White (Rogue Valley),,,,
"Made with 60% Sangiovese, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Merlot, this opens with delicate aromas of black currant, leather and toast. The accessible palate doles out mature black cherry, vanilla and tobacco alongside chewy tannins and modest acidity.",88,Fattoria La Vialla 2012 Casal Duro Red (Toscana),,,,
"87—89 Barrel sample. Plenty of  fresh blackcurrant flavors here, in a wine that is charming, with its ripe fruits and lively acidity. The fruit is open, dominating the tannins. An early developer.",88,Château Latour-Martillac 2006 Barrel sample  (Pessac-Léognan),,,,
"Yeasty, bland, unconvincing aromas make for an unremarkable opening. This is flabby and broken on the palate, with yeasty flavors of canned peas.",81,Falernia 2014 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Elqui Valley),,,,
"Gorges is one of the recently created village crus or village appellations in Muscadet. The wine has richness and a dense character not always found in Muscadets. While it has some age, which has softened the intense fruit, it is still crisp, fruity and ripe with apple, lime and spice. Drink now.",92,Véronique Günther-Chereau 2012 Gorges  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),,,,
"The plush-feeling plum and blue fruit flavors provide much of the appeal on this pleasant, easy-drinking wine. Aromas of tar and berry provide accents.",87,Boomtown 2013 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This is a tightly coiled wine, still firm and packed with tannins as well as fruit. It has a strong dry core that is lifted by the bright acidity. This is going to be a very complete wine, all the elements well in place. Drink from 2026.",94,Château Olivier 2014  Pessac-Léognan,,,,
"Rubber, olive, leather and inky aromas feed into a solid, steady palate. Bold, bulky flavors of black cherry, dark plum and brown sugar finish with moderate depth and structure as well as chocolaty oak. Drink now.",88,Koyle 2012 Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"True to type, this Cab Franc from cool-climate Clarksburg is very herbal and dry, with a back beat of black cherry. Rich on the finish, herb flavors turns to chocolate and clove. A good wintertime wine.",86,Clarksburg Wine Company 2010 Cabernet Franc (Clarksburg),,,,
"Shows some nice qualities such as barrel notes of popcorn and buttered toast, but overall the wine is too soft and tropical to rate higher. The palate is plump, fruity and flush, but also low in acid and soft. Flavorwise, it's pure tropical fruit with a hollow finish.",85,Domaine Jean Bousquet 2007 Grande Reserve Chardonnay (Tupungato),,,,
"This blend of Chardonnay, Grenache Blanc and Roussanne boasts upfront aromas of yellow peach, orange and honeydew, with just a touch of white florals. The round, slightly creamy palate offers additional notes of apple and white plum flesh, with ample acidity to keep the mouthfeel fresh and the finish clean. Well balanced and approachable now.",89,Blanville 2014 Riva White (Pays d'Oc),,,,
"Aromas of stewed prune and fig follow through to the evolved palate along with raisin, licorice and a green note of powdered sage. Austere, astringent tannins leave a raspy finish. You'll also notice the heat of evident alcohol.",87,Val di Suga 2010 Vigna Spuntali  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
Allegrini presents a very likable and smooth Valpolicella with bright berry tones and lively shadings of spice and white almond that appear in the background. Pair this wine wine with grilled sausage or lamb shish kabob.,86,Allegrini 2008  Valpolicella Classico,,,,
"This is a luminous, creamy expression of Coda di Volpe that delivers aromas of stone fruit, pineapple, apricot and yellow rose. The mouthfeel is short and compact, but it does show nice density while it lasts.",85,Sorrentino 2009 Versacrum Coda di Volpe (Lacryma Christi del Vesuvio),,,,
"88-90 Barrel sample. An intensely spicy wine, full of exotic flavors, dried prunes, figs and a powerful layer of cinammon. The wine certainly has character.",89,Château Lynch-Moussas 2008 Barrel sample  (Pauillac),,,,
"This offers fruit cocktail aromas, with canned pears and light honey, making for an inviting if not varietally typical nose. The flavors are light once sipped, closest to nectarine and apricot. This would be a very drinkable lunchtime wine.",86,Esser 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey County),,,,
"Heady cherry and berry aromas are forwardly potent. This young, grippy Toro is tannic and taut on the palate. Gritty blackberry and burnt, toasty flavors finish rough, with grabby, pronounced tannins. Drink from 2017–2023.",90,Elias Mora 2014  Toro,,,,
"The first vintage of this wine from this site, it offers a lot to like, from crisp, pretty aromas and tingly acidity to nuanced whispers of honeycomb, Gravenstein apple and fennel. Light bodied, it has nice firmness and tension to the mouthfeel, and an overall balance of fruit and complexity.",92,Kenwood 2014 Single Vineyard Green Valley Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Tasted in May of 2012, this shows an immaturity, where all the parts haven't yet come together. It has a big, rich black-cherry flavor, with elaborate smoky oak, brisk acidity, firm tannins and heat from the alcohol all vying for dominance. Needs time; cellar it until 2015.",90,Black Kite 2009 Stony Terrace Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),,,,
"This is a concentrated wine—firm and structured with tannins. It has delicious red fruits, spice and a fine bite of acidity at the end. Produced on the Corcelles estate, it is a wine to age a few more months, so drink from 2017.",87,Château de Corcelles 2015  Beaujolais-Villages,,,,
"A rare Pinot Noir rosé from Washington state, this is unabashedly ripe and pink, but not at all sugary. It offers a burst of strawberry and watermelon candy flavors, like a good, long lasting taste of saltwater taffy.",85,J Bell Cellars 2012 Pino Rosé (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Light in body, with a fine backbone of taut acidity, this is a throwback to a time when spätleses were slightly drier than today. Delicate scents of crushed stone and pressed flowers are underscored by hints of green apple and lime. This would make a fine apéritif on its own, or could perhaps partner subtle seafood dishes.",90,Studert-Prüm 2009 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"There is little difference between this and the winery's reserve. There simply is no flavor here. It's a watery, sour wine, with a finish that suggests something went wrong somewhere along the line.",81,Château Bianca 2000 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Soft and easy, this Cabernet has flavors of blackberries, cherries, herbs and sweet oak. It's an easy wine to drink now with steaks and chops.",86,Alexander Valley Vineyards 2007 Wetzel Family Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Just off dry, this is a rounded soft wine that takes its name after the sun god Apollo from the sunny exposure of the vineyard. It has a rounded, generous feel as a foil to its more steely, crisp character. A wine that certainly needs aging for 3–4 years.",91,Cave Freudenreich 2011 Terre d'Apollon Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"One of Italy's best white wines, this is an opulent blend of Friulano, Pinot Bianco and Sauvignon. Honey, stone fruit, light spice and exotic fruit glide over a thick, creamy mouthfeel.",93,Livio Felluga 2009 Terre Alte White (Colli Orientali del Friuli),,,,
"With its light dosage, this is an excellent apéritif style of Champagne. From premier cru vineyards in the Montagne de Reims and Côte des Blancs, it is a full, white fruit and citrus-flavored wine that is ready to drink.",89,Lombard et Cie NV Extra Brut Premier Cru  (Champagne),,,,
"Although this is labeled as Vin de France, its fruit comes from the La Bégude estate in Bandol. With one year's aging, it is full, soft and ripe with generous strawberry flavors. Dark in color, it may not follow the trend in Provence for pale rosés and its taste is rich and full bodied. The acidity at the end gives the necessary freshness.",91,Domaine de la Bégude 2014 L'Irréductible Rosé (Vin de France),,,,
"This friendly red blend, made with Cabernet, Steuben and Ives, starts with aromas of allspice, cherry and pepper followed by flavors of fresh, tart red berry and spice. It's a fun and easy-drinking red that will pair well with myriad dishes, from pasta to grilled steaks.",83,Niagara Landing NV Old Mill Red Red (New York),,,,
"Almost crystal clear in the glass, this bottling is loaded with passionfruit, lime candy and white flower aromas, proving quite fresh and inviting. The flavors start a tad sour, recalling squeezed lime, but then open into tropical notes like honeydew and passionfruit. A perfect party-starting apéritif, with both style and substance.",89,Lucas & Lewellen 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"A fresh and textural wine, this puts a spicy spin on citrus rind, peach and apricot flavors. There's an intriguing hint of white pepper as well, and an overall sensation of density, intensity and exceptional length.",91,Pacific Rim 2011 Dry Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Made entirely with Gewürtztraminer, this opens with aromas of rose petal and tropical fruit. The full-bodied rich palate is loaded with ripe tropical fruit, apricot, acacia honey and candied ginger alongside the warmth of alcohol.",89,Elena Walch 2015 Kastelaz Gewürztraminer (Alto Adige),,,,
"There's not much going on with this soft Moscato except for white sugar and vanilla bean flavors, and only hints of oranges and tropical fruits.",82,Bianchi 2011 Moscato (Paso Robles),,,,
"Slight notes of green beans mix with faint cherry fruit on this light, easy-drinking red. In summer, it can be chilled and would work well as a picnic red. The Zweigelt spice adds more interest.",86,Pratsch 2013 Zweigelt (Niederösterreich),,,,
"This is a smooth-textured, medium-bodied wine that opens with brown sugar and maple aromas, leads to ripe cherry and blackberry flavors and finishes with a hint of sweetness.",86,Kitchen Sink NV Red (California),,,,
"While this wine is a majority varietal, it blends in Syrah, Malbec, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, each co-fermented with the Cab. The tannin weight is pronounced, adding to the richness and concentration of blackberry jam and black pepper, the tannins leathery and lengthy.",86,Kuleto Estate 2012 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"This opens with prickly herbal-plum and red-fruit aromas. The palate feels blocky, with thick tannins, and the flavor profile offers black fruit in front of a resiny, dry finish that comes with overt oak influence.",84,V Norte 2011 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Curicó Valley),,,,
"Nicely balanced and nicely priced, this is a medium-bodied kabinett that would make delicious summertime drinking. It shows hints of wet stone, but also layers of sweet apple, pear and lemon fruit, which ease into a long, harmoniously crisp and clean finish.",90,Peter Nicolay 2009 Bernkasteler Badstube Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"The minerality that seems to come from this quinta makes for a wine that needs time, and this wine is defiantly young. However, its chocolate flavors, bitter toast and dense structure all promise well.",89,CARM 2006 Quinta do Coa Red (Douro),,,,
"Recalling the zesty style from New Zealand, it offers aromas of cantaloupe and crushed tomato vine along with exotic fruit that all carry over to the palate. It has a crisp, refreshing finish.",86,Lechthaler 2012 Torrediluna Sauvignon (Venezie),,,,
"A creamed apple aroma is followed by a creamy palate. It has tight acidity that lends brightness and freshness, with a crisp, fruity finish.",87,Château Jolys 2011  Jurançon Sec,,,,
"This wine offers a pleasing mixture of aromas and flavors of baking spices, pear and apple. Viscosity and weight gives it a sense of gravitas but never gets bogged down.",91,Ashan 2014 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,

"This dry appetizing wine comes from one of Lodi's more adventurous winemakers, Markus Niggli.

"With this wine, Dolce cements its status as California's most consistently great dessert wine. This year's blend is 80% Sémillon and 20% Sauvignon Blanc, and the grapes were infected with the botrytis, resulting in the fantastic sweetness.

"A deftly made wine, this exceptional Roussanne blends fruit into a creamy, luscious blend of tropical fruits, apricots, whole cream, nutmeg and more.

This tastes earthy, oaky and like blackberry, while the finish echoes with those same flavors. Drink through 2023.",90,Ruca Malen 2012 Kinien Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Mild with raspberry flavor and soft, integrated oak and tannin, this full-bodied wine is comprised entirely of Cabernet Sauvignon and imparts a characteristic Rutherford dustiness on the palate.",88,Conn Creek 2013 Rutherford Estate Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),,,,
"This bright, savory wine delivers aromas and flavors of juicy wild cherry, black raspberry, violet, white pepper and mocha. Polished tannins provide the framework. Enjoy through 2020.",90,Castello di Monterinaldi 2011 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"Solid and perfumed, this expresses all the power of Malbec, with a fruitiness that comes through the firm, dry tannins. Notes of new wood and juicy plum combine well in this concentrated, full-bodied effort, which needs several years to age.",91,Château Haut-Monplaisir 2009 Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"Vigna Mandorlo ushers forth sweet-smelling aromas of Christmas spice, nutmeg, ginger and vanilla backed by chopped herbs, anise, licorice and underbrush. There's a layer of smoky mesquite that also appears on the finish. This bright Barolo has a vibrant, sharp feel in the mouth and ends with dusty tannins. Very nice.",92,Giacosa Fratelli 2004 Vigna Mandorlo  (Barolo),,,,
"This blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Petite Sirah, 8% Malbec and 7% Petit Verdot shows grape-candy aromas along with uncrushed peppercorns and blackberry jam. The palate offers fresh olallieberries with chocolate, pencil lead and a touch of dried mint.",87,Santa Ynez Valley Vineyards 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"A firm and tannic wine that will become fine, structured and rich. Blackberry fruits come from the 70% Merlot in the blend, which is perfumed with Cabernet Franc. It is a ripe wine, juicy with acidity and finishing with a solid, concentrated aftertaste. Drink from 2019.",90,Château Tournefeuille 2014  Lalande de Pomerol,,,,
"Masses of cherries and raspberries in this single-vineyard wine, and also lots of acidity. It cuts across the palate like a squeeze of lime juice, tart and mouthwatering. Oak shows up in this equation as sweet buttered toast. Altogether, it's a complex, elegant, delicious wine that will develop bottle bouquet over the next 10 years.",93,Gary Farrell 2011 Hallberg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"A hint of dried apricot underscores the ripe apple aromas in this fresh and appealing auslese. It's sweet but not overly so, with apple and melon flavors that are plesantly round without becoming soft.",86,Rudolf Müller 2006 Auslese Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer),,,,
"Lots of power and richness in this young, vigorous Pinot Noir. With brisk acids and tannins, it shows complex flavors of cherries, licorice, bacon, cola and Chinese Five Spice. Exotic and interesting, it should develop over the next 3–4 years.",90,Goyette 2009 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"This fine wine straddles the border between good and complex. The elements are terrific: pedigreed blackberry and cassis fruit, fine oak nuances, and soft Sonoma tannins. It's just a tad thin in the middle. Drink it with meat.",87,Kunde 1997 Drummond Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"A wine with faults and a few positives. On the nose, it's roasted almost to the point of being overdone. It smells like baked fruit, roasted peanuts and tire tread. Doesn't sound great, does it? But in the mouth its more true and recognizable; flavors of tomato leaf, dried red fruit, vanilla and dill are known entities, while the finish is long and draped with even more dill weed. Drink now. This is not one to save.",85,Ramirez de la Piscina 2002 Selección Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"Toasty and oily smelling, with baked apple aromas for fruit. The palate is medium in intensity and round, with standard peach and apple flavors. Finishes soft, sweet and a tiny bit mealy. Drink soon.",85,Chilensis 2010 Reserva Chardonnay (Maule Valley),,,,
"Here's a structured but elegant wine that opens with aromas of wild berry, mint, clove and a balsamic note. The firm, fresh palate offers dried black cherry, raspberry, menthol, white pepper, grilled herb and a note of well-integrated oak while velvety tannins provide support. It's great now but it will be even better in a few years. Drink through 2020.",92,Isole e Olena 2012  Chianti Classico,,,,
"Spiced cherry, plum and dry oak aromas drive the nose. The palate is plump, fruity and creamy feeling, with woody, resiny flavors of plum and raspberry. The finish is oaky and a bit hot, with mint and pepper notes.",88,Viña Casablanca 2011 Nimbus Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"Importer and Master Sommelier Fran Kysela uses the Maison du Midi label for lots of Rhône wines he selects to bring into the U.S. This effort, from Plan de Dieu, is seriously intense, full-bodied and firmly tannic, showing the character of the vintage. The plummy fruit is powerful, fighting through the tannins on the finish. Try it young with rare beef, or put it away for a few years and see if the tannins soften over time.",89,Maison du Midi 2005 Plan de Dieu Red (Côtes du Rhône Villages),,,,
"The Torrontes character shows on the nose, meaning there's detectable lychee and orange blossom scents. The dowside is that the palate is rather thick and honeyed but devoid of flavor. Seems to be fading into the night.",83,Inca 2006 Torrontes-Chardonnay White (Calchaquí Valley),,,,
"This wine is rich, sweet, extravagant and, finally, elegant. Its ripe fruit flavors, red plums, sweet strawberries and smoky acidity all work together. The wine shows considerable concentration, but never loses sight of freshness. Age for another five years at least.",93,Chanson Père et Fils 2005 Clos des Mouches Premier Cru  (Beaune),,,,
"Dull, waxy and smelling of overcooked vegetables, this admirably full-bodied effort is just too green to be considered good.",81,Zenith 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"At 70% Tempranillo and only 25% Cabernet and Merlot, there's a detectable green core running through the nose and palate. Surrounding that is sizable fruit and oak, the latter of which adds dill to the fray. All in all there's enough body and soul to save the wine, but along the way it's got some issues.",84,Abadia Retuerta 2004 Selección Especial Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),,,,
"Strawberry, sagebrush and graphite show on the nose. The palate offers red fruit that fades quickly into a more sour style, with dried citrus peels.",83,Jackhammer 2013 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),,,,
"This mix of 68% Syrah, 20% Grenache and 12% Petite Sirah offers blackberry jam, lavender and cracked pepper on the nose. Tart berries show on the sip, made more serious with a tarry structure and lifted by light purple flowers and an incense element that carries through the finish.",90,Epiphany 2013 Revelation Rodney's Vineyard Red (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"This blend of 50% Cabernet Franc, 37% Petit Verdot and 13% Malbec is dark purple in color, with rich blackberry and brambleberry tones accented by liquorice and bubble gum. The rich palate carries similar dark fruit tones, framed by silky-soft tannins.",86,Anemoi 2013 Apeliotes Red (Grand Valley),,,,
"Pencil eraser, plastic and vanilla are all reflective of the oak thrown at this blend of Malbec, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot. In the mouth, this is heavy, grabby and hard, while blackened flavors of oak and baked fruits set up a finish with creamy oak, herbal accents and heat.",85,TintoNegro 2011 Co-Ferment Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Overripe and syrupy, Gen7's 2008 Road to Zanzibar—part Zinfandel, part Cabernet Franc and part Carignane—is big and soft, with the fruit in decline.",81,GEN 7 2008 Road to Zanzibar Red (California),,,,
"Add Jaxon to the growing list of Southern Oregon wineries making exceptional Tempranillo. Plump and polished fruit flavors emphasize huckleberry, plum and black cherry. The aging for 21 months in French oak (one new barrel out of six) adds nuances of toasted walnuts, smoke and butterscotch. This is one of those surprising bottles that you just can't stop hitting on.",91,Jaxon 2012 Tempranillo (Rogue Valley),,,,
"In this blend of 68% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc, vanilla, carob, herb, green wood and dark fruit aromas are followed by fruit and oak-derived flavors in equal proportion. It shows restraint but doesn't come together.",88,Matthews 2013 Reserve Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Blended with 18% Merlot, this shows a mix of black cherry, fig and sweet prune fruit flavors. Some smoke from barrel aging comes in, and it's good right up to the finish, which has a gluey undertone.",86,Vin du Lac 2007 Barrel Select Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A sensational varietal Petit Verdot that's rich and velvety, lush and intense, with a hint of Bordeaux's typical herbiness, that evolves into some of the best blackberry, mocha and spicy chocolate you can imagine. Winemaker John Kinney had originally planned to blend the two barrels that eventually became this wine. Be glad he didn't. The grapes were sourced from Ghielmetti Vineyard, the primo vineyard to look for in Livermore wines.",92,Occasio 2008 Ghielmetti Vineyard Petit Verdot (Livermore Valley),,,,
"Morellino is a terrific red wine that is particularly food-friendly, easy-to-drink and delicious. This producer makes one of the best expressions available, characterized by bright blueberry, cherry and pulpy red fruit.",90,Morisfarms 2007 Riserva  (Morellino di Scansano),,,,
"A blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Grenache and Merlot, this delicious red is juicy in blackberry and vanilla swirls of flavor. Tar, sage and tobacco add savory touches that work within its soft rounded frame.",91,Covenant 2015 Red C Red (Sonoma County),,,,
"This Russian River blend rivals Loring's single-vineyard wines for 2014. An elegant and superbly balanced wine, it's the kind that never gets tiring. It has a slightly doughy aroma, complex fruity, spicy and savory flavors, and a particularly engaging mouthfeel that's both gripping and creamy at the same time.",92,Loring Wine Company 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Made from Friuli's classic white grape, this vibrant wine leads with aromas of honeysuckle, baked pear and flint. The elegant, linear palate delivers yellow apple, Bartlett pear and lime zest accented with notes of sage, clove and cinnamon. Fresh acidity gives a bright finish.",88,Collavini 2013 Friulano (Collio),,,,
"This shows clean aromas of blue flower, wild berry and cola, with a touch of moist earth or tobacco. The close is simple and slightly sour.",85,Demarie 2009 Nebbiolo (Langhe),,,,
"This is a stylish wine, fruity with red currants and herbs. It has a delicious crisp character as well as a salty tang, maybe from the nearby sea. The aftertaste is bright, packed with fruit. The wine is ready to drink.",90,Château Léoube 2016 Rosé de Léoube Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"This is a ripe and creamy wine from the great 2008 vintage. Tight acidity and lively citrus are balanced by a more serious richness and texture. The wine, bringing all three of the main Champagne grapes together, is still maturing. Wait until 2018.",93,Pannier 2008 Vintage Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"A crisp, clean wine, with a gentle apple flavor and light acidity. It's a wine that is soft and round, with a spice note as well as a minerally tang on the finish.",86,Hugel 2011 Gentil Hugel White (Alsace),,,,
"The wine is closed and dense, with dark tannins as well as smooth caramel flavors from wood aging. It reveals concentration, black fruits and rich, exuberant potential. Drink from 2016.",90,Herdade da Comporta 2011 Parus Red (Península de Setúbal),,,,
"This shows a mild SB character on the nose. It's citric on the palate, with lime, lemon and tangerine flavors. Just enough crispness and scour make it a worthwhile quaffer.",84,In Situ 2013 Reserva Estate Bottled Sauvignon Blanc (Aconcagua Valley),,,,
"This elegant vibrant red offers aromas of tilled soil, Mediterranean herb, red berry, a hint of leather and a floral note. The polished palate doles out black raspberry, red currant, licorice and white pepper alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. A mineral note lifts the finish.",92,Palari 2012 Rosso del Soprano Red (Sicilia),,,,
"A ripe perfumed wine with fine tannins as well as dense fruit. Blackberry flavors are up there along with the acidity and crisp aftertaste. It's a wine with a good future, ready to drink from 2018.",89,Château Maison Noble Saint Martin 2015 Château Jean de Bel Air  (Bordeaux),,,,
"Although this Chard is less expensive than the winery's Rochioli or Olivet Lane single-vineyard bottlings, it's their equal in terms of richness. Accented with crisp acidity, it shows rich, flamboyant pineapple, papaya and lime flavors, with the buttered toast of oak barrels.",91,Gary Farrell 2011 Westside Farms Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Ruby-violet in color, this wine has aromas of cherry, cola and almond blossom. Smooth and bright on the palate, with soft tannins, shades of cherry, menthol and smoked meat bring nuance to the finish.",89,Diren 2012 Collection Öküzgözü (Turkey),,,,
"The wine is light in color and light in body. Red cherry fruits give freshness, although there is a burnt aftertaste. Drink now.",83,Vieil Armand 2012 Tradition Pinot Noir (Alsace),,,,
"A cheerful Pinot Noir, rich and silky, and perfect for drinking now with lamb chops, steak or grilled salmon. It's dry and crisp, with good flavors of cherries, spices and sandalwood.",88,Kynsi 2006 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),,,,
Nuarè is a bright and cheerful Pinot Noir with fruit sourced from northern Italy that shows pretty nuances of forest berry and blue flower. The mouthfeel is lean and compact but the low price is one of this wine's biggest selling points.,87,Natale Verga 2008 Nuarè Pinot Noir (Delle Venezie),,,,
"This Merlot-based rosé offers up some slightly herbal notes of thyme and bay leaf, then complements those with understated cherry—berry fruit. It's medium in weight, yet finishes with vibrant acidity. Still hanging in there, but drink up.",88,Kate Radburnd 2014 Berry Blush Rosé (Hawke's Bay),,,,
"This is very rich in blackberries and currants, bearing lots of oak that adds caramelized toastiness. While the tannins are thick and fine, there's something rustic on the finish in the form of extracted, candied sweetness and heat. Flashy as it is, you're best drinking this wine now.",87,Nice 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Faint vanilla and lovely creaminess play around the richly contrasting flavors of sumptuous, bright blossom honey cut by zesty, tart lemon-peel notes. Here and there a notion of passion fruit appears, highlighting the linear, zesty and yet totally rich nature of this seductive wine. An intriguing play between two extremes.",93,Schloss Gobelsburg 2011 Eiswein Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),,,,
"This is a very fragrant and floral rosé, reminiscent of peach gummy candies, orange blossom and orange-ginger tea. The palate is surprisingly lush, with round ripe-fruit flavors that are just barely lifted on the finish. Drink now.",85,Vintales 2015 Sunset Rosé (Western Cape),,,,
"Bracingly effervescent bubbles offer aromas of baking soda, chalk and blood orange on this South Coast sparkler made from 82% Chardonnay and 18% Pinot Noir. The foamy palate offers inviting bubblegum and light cotton candy flavors, never sweet but very rounded and approachable in a crowd-pleasing way.",89,South Coast NV Brut Sparkling (Temecula Valley),,,,
"From an estate vineyard, this impressive wine is earthy with tobacco leaf and juicy cherry and cassis notes. Soft, supple and lengthy, it lingers on the palate as a well-integrated, balanced and beautifully crafted expression of the grape.",93,Stone The Crows 2014 Three Twins Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),,,,
"Glossy and structured, this opens with aromas suggesting acacia honey, toasted hazelnut, crushed stone and a hint of light spice. The smooth but firm palate offers mature yellow apple, tangerine zest and a honeyed mineral note while fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors. Drink through 2020.",92,St. Pauls 2013 Sanctissimus Riserva Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige),,,,
"Soft and sweet in Porty cherry, chocolate and raisin flavors, with a burn from high alcohol.",82,Sineann 2008 Sugarloaf Mountain Vineyard Merlot (California),,,,
"A prominent mineral component moves aside after a few minutes to reveal the true treasures of this Sangiovese-Canaiolo blend. Those include the wine's gorgeous renderings of small forest fruit, Spanish cedar, cigar box and rum cake. Breathtaking in evolution and intensity.",96,Bibi Graetz 2004 Testamatta Sangiovese (Toscana),,,,
"Although the nose offers darker notes of petrol, bruised apples and cooked green peppers, the palate on this semisweet wine is prettier with hints of sugar-laced oolong tea and white florals.",83,Debonné 2008 Lot 807 Reserve Riesling (Grand River Valley),,,,
"This delicious wine shows Paso ripeness in the form of blackberry, cherry, anise and chocolate, with soft tannins and just enough acidity to balance the richness. The cool vintage played a part here, giving the wine long hangtime flavors while keeping the alcohol level low.",90,Falcone 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"This new wine from importer Bart Broadbent offers cherry, raspberry and plum aromas along with a touch of well-applied oak. It's a little tannic and biting in the mouth, but with food that should be no issue. Flavorwise, it's dealing slightly burnt notes atop full-fledged black cherry and wild berry. A firm, edgy wine with many good qualities.",88,Broadbent 2009 Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Beautiful oak accents help light up this rich, nicely complex wine. Cinnamon, nutmeg and clove dress up the aromas, while ripe, jammy black-cherry flavors spread nicely on the palate and linger on the finish. It's light on tannins and pretty light in texture for such a flavorful wine.",90,Klinker Brick 2014 Carignane (Lodi),,,,
"This simple, lighter take on the variety belies its ripe fruit, the weight of the wine taking on girth as it goes. Black cherry, spicy cinnamon and toasted oak intermingle on the palate, before a medium-length finish.",85,Beaulieu Vineyard 2013 Pinot Noir (Carneros-Napa Valley),,,,
This brightly colored rosé from northeastern Italy offers aromas of small berry fruit and delicate floral tones. It tastes clean and crisp and leaves a cheerful endnote of fresh berry flavors.,86,Blason 2007 Rosato Rosé (Venezia Giulia),,,,
"A restrained nose gives way to softly etched notes of fruit, hinting at apple, lemon and biscuit. This is mild but dry, easy but elegant, understated but very refreshing. It's an ideal apéritif.",88,Charles Sparr NV Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),,,,
"Imagine all of the scents you associate with a Margherita pizza and that's what this wine smells like. The nose is leafy and full of oregano, basil and leather notes, while the flavor profile is pure tomato sauce, herb and spice. A blend of 75% Cabernet Franc and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon.",84,Oliver Conti 2008 Carlota Red (Empordà),,,,
"It's basically one-third each Grenache Blanc, Roussanne and Viognier, but the Viognier speaks loudest in the finished wine. Apricot and peppery-gingery spice notes mark the nose, while the texture is bolstered by Viognier's phenolic content without becoming bitter. Drink now through 2015.",90,Domaine de la Mordorée 2013 La Reine des Bois White (Lirac),,,,
"A lovely Sauvignon Blanc at a lovely price, this shows characteristic notes of snow pea, cut grass and tropical fruit upfront, followed by hints of pink grapefruit and nectarine. It's medium in weight, with a long, stony finish.",90,Staete Landt 2014 Map Maker Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"While obviously not a “cult” wine, this full-bodied bottling has just what the varietal should offer in terms of ripe fruit, spice, a firm and moderately tannic texture, and a mouthfilling presence. Its strengths lie in good balance, tempting layers of flavor and a lingering finish.",90,CULT 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),,,,
"This is a very good Pinot Noir that shows how well the appellation can balance the variety. It has lush cherry, blackberry, tea, cola and cocoa flavors, and a rich, silky texture. Could develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",88,Estancia 2005 Stonewall Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"This is beautifully crisp, with its acidity cutting the tense, mineral texture. It has a light touch, and is perfumed with green apple and pineapple notes that dance on the palate. Age 2–3 years. Screwcap.",90,Hirsch 2010 Kammerner Heiligenstein Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),,,,
"Despite a good track record producing California Pinot Noir, Tangley Oaks' foray north into the Willamette Valley does not impress. It tastes and smells of mushroom compost, with no hint of any definitive fruit, no suggestion of varietal character. Two bottles tasted, same results.",83,Tangley Oaks 2014 Lot #25 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Gamy aromas lead to a sinewy, lean palate. This funky Cabernet tastes of creamy oak, plum and green herbs. It finishes a bit weedy, with savory offsets.",86,Salentein 2014 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Uco Valley),,,,
"A rare disappointment from Saint Clair—and it's still a good wine, just not up the standards set by the winery's other reserve wines. Ripe, peachy fruit is not so much framed by oak as covered by it, starting and finishing with layers of buttered toast and vanilla.",86,Saint Clair 2006 Omaka Reserve Chardonnay (Marlborough),,,,
"Extended skin contact lends an amber hue and musky exotic tones to this blend of aromatic Gewürztraminer and Pinot Gris grapes. It's fascinatingly complex, suggesting glimmers of spice and bright apple and pear flavors, baked clay and dark herbs. Brisk acidity lends firm structure to the midpalate. It's a delightful wine that would pair well with everything from trout to pork ribs.",90,Brooklyn Oenology 2013 Broken Land White (Finger Lakes),,,,
"A velvety, sinewy blend of 40% Syrah, 40% Grenache and 20% Mourvèdre from estate-grown and nearby vineyards, this wine offers a lot to like, from textured tannins to succulent blueberry and plum. Intense and floral, it finishes with an explosion of white pepper.",90,Mounts 2012 Verah Red (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"No two ways about it, this hot-vintage Gran Reserva is a plush wine. It starts with baked cooked stewed aromas that render the nose asleep. A soupy stewy palate tastes of baked berry fruits, prune and chocolate. Consistent with the rest of the wine, this finishes soft. Drink now.",87,Pradorey 2009 Gran Reserva Finca Real Sitio de Ventosilla Single Vineyard  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"The aromas of lemon, soil and flowers are quite subdued. The flavors are restrained with impressive balance and the variety's often burly tannins well tamed.",89,Cloudlift Cellars 2013 Stratus Petite Verdot (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Zesty lime cuts razor-sharp edges into this buoyant, fruity Riesling full of white peach, apple and honeysuckle notes. Delicately honeyed, it's piercing yet lip-smackingly juicy, finishing on a lingering spray of green florals. It's an elegant, tightly structured wine that's stunning now but will hold nicely through 2020.",92,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt 2014 Kaseler Nies'chen Kabinett Grosse Lage Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Freshly cut apple peel and apple fruit create a very welcoming and lively palate. The fruit is clean and very invigorating, while the dry finish provides cool refreshment.",89,Jean-Marc Bernhard 2014 Vieilles Vignes Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"Yellow in color, with waxy apple and vegetal aromas, this varietal Xarel-lo feels heavy, oily and creamy. Vegetal-leaning flavors suggest canned peas and beans, while a green, oily character persists on the finish.",83,Alta Alella 2014 Privat Lanius Pansa Blanca (Alella),,,,
"The aromas of blueberry, milk chocolate and tire rubber are pleasant enough but the palate distracts with sweet, lightly spritzy blue fruit flavors backed by chalky tannins.",81,Wild Meadows 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Vinified in large wood barrels, the wine is extra rich with a touch of spice and vanilla as well as mango and warm apple flavors. It comes from vines grown on flinty soils, but there is little sign of that in the generous full texture. Drink this ripe wine now.",90,Gitton Père et Fils 2015 Les Fredins  (Sancerre),,,,
"A deeply impressive Bordeaux blend. It comes from this small, but prestigious, appellation, which is a bridge between Sonoma County and Napa Valley. Marked by dryness and a superb tannic structure, it has deep flavors of blackberries, black currants, violets, herbs and cedar. Needs time. Give it 4–6 years in the cellar.",94,Ehret 2006 Bella's Blend Red (Knights Valley),,,,
"Marimar's Don Miguel Pinot Noir typically starts out as a tannic, fairly closed young wine that needs some bottle age. The '05, from a cool vintage, accentuates that tightness, offering a slightly bitter wine housing cherry, currant, cola, mocha and oak flavors. It's very dry and complex, and will easily age for many years.",91,Marimar Estate 2005 Don Miguel Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This dry, balanced aged tawny is both fruity and showing good aging characters. Red fruits are cut with acidity and shaped by the old wood and spice flavors. It has a delicious, ripe aftertaste.",90,Quinta do Noval NV 10-Years-Old Tawny  (Port),,,,
"It opens with aromas of forest floor, porcini mushroom and espresso. The straightforward palate offers bright berry, coffee and grilled herbs alongside firm tannins. Drink 2015–2020.",88,Natale Verga 2010  Barolo,,,,
"Spice and lanolin notes are curious and enticing on the nose and palate of this sunny and sweet, but impeccably balanced Riesling. Juicy, supple, apple jelly and quince flavors are offset by striking acidity and steely minerality that reverberate on the finish.",92,Baron Knyphausen 2010 Erbacher Michelmark Auslese Riesling (Rheingau),,,,
"This full-throated wine has layers of black fruits, firm tannins and a dense texture. It is rich, the black plum fruits partnered by dark chocolate and licorice. Wood aging still shows and the wine needs to broaden out even more as it ages. Drink from 2018.",91,Château Les Trois Manoirs 2010  Médoc,,,,
"This soft wine has a gentle texture and smooth white fruits. It is fruity and lightly perfumed. With its crisp edge of acidity, is totally ready to drink.",85,Cave de Viré 2015 Grande Réserve du Président  (Mâcon-Villages),,,,
"This heavily oaked Garnacha smells largely of campfire and char. A drawing, chunky palate is bold and deep, with flavors of hickory, char and blackberry. With such forceful oak, this finishes woody, meaty and with pushy flavors of clove and mint.",87,Coto de Hayas 2013 Centenaria Garnacha (Campo de Borja),,,,
"Very inviting and familiar aromas of sea salt, squeezed citrus, baked lemons Gravenstein apple and a touch of slate show on this crowd-pleaser from Bill Brousseau and Rob Jensen in Los Gatos. The palate is framed by slightly sour kumquat, tart apple and lime-powered acidity, with a cementy grip that makes the sip as much about texture as flavor.",91,Testarossa 2014 La Rinconada Vineyard Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Clean and firm, with strawberry fruit and an earthy base. Hints of compost and tobacco came through in both the scents and flavors, while tannins were moderately coarse. Drink soon.",87,Hawkins Cellars 2012 Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
"Aromas of jammy, candied berry fruits and wet dog fur amount to a murky whole. This is high in acidity, with a mishmash of berry and creamy, plastic-like flavors. A smear of oak dominates the finish.",84,Albada 2013 Viñas Viejas Garnacha (Calatayud),,,,
"Here's a lovely Verdicchio with an alluring floral fragrance of acacia and hints of Spanish broom and sea breeze. The palate shows peach, citrus and pineapple flavors, along with notes of dried Mediterranean herbs and brine. Hold for 2–3 years to develop complexity.",89,Moncaro 2012 Verde Ca' Ruptae  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore),,,,
"Dominated by toasty, coconutty aromas, with just hints of peach and hazelnut. Hold six months and see what emerges; right now, this wine is defined more by technique (barrel-fermentation and aging) than terroir.",87,Château d'Esclans 2007 Les Clans Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"Assembled from the best barrels of the vintage, this low-alcohol wine is chewy and forward, with strawberry fruit, cola and a whiff of the chicken yard. It all comes together seamlessly and is immediately drinkable. Best enjoyed now through 2019.",89,Thistle 2013 The MacDougall Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),,,,
"Dark and loaded with big black fruit aromas, tobacco, spice and a lot of vanilla from copious oaking. The palate is good and juicy, with a healthy blend of blackberry, fig and chocolate flavors. Toasty, round and chocolaty on an oaky, creamy finish.",89,Marqués de la Concordia 2008 Hacienda Abascal Producción Limitada  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"This big, jammy Syrah is packed with spice, baked plum and blackberry aromas. In the mouth, it's wide and voluminous. Flavors of blackberry are fully ripe, while blueberry and pepper flavors are long and lasting on the finish.",88,Mano A Mano 2012 Venta la Ossa Syrah (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),,,,
"This warm, forward wine has sensations of nail polish remover, underbrush, resin, mature black plum and overripe black cherry. The evolved palate is framed by astringent tannins that dry out the mouth.",86,Il Cancelliere 2007 Nero Né  (Taurasi),,,,
Here's a value wine and a fresh expression of Barbera that can be served with cheeseburgers and fries at an outdoor barbecue. The wine is informal and light and seems to be engineered for immediate consumption.,85,Araldica 2008 Castelvero Barbera (Piedmont),,,,
"Gold in color, this wine deftly balances the sweetness of the orange marmalade flavor with the dry edge that comes from the spirit and the slight tannic character. Ready to drink.",86,Ramos-Pinto NV Adriano Reserva White  (Port),,,,
"Everything about this full-bodied and well-proportioned wine is rich: the spicy, chocolaty aromas from American oak barrels, the vivid boysenberry flavors, the fine but tannic texture and the lingering finish. Yet it all stays balanced, appetizing, palate-cleansing and fresh.",91,Cuda Ridge Wines 2012 Petit Verdot (Livermore Valley),,,,
"This is entirely neutral on the nose, then dull-edged on the palate. Flavors of papaya, green banana and bell pepper don't offer much beyond the basics, while this finishes soft and mildly bitter.",84,Siegel 2014 Crucero Collection Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley),,,,
"Very flavorful and full-bodied but also velvety-smooth in texture, this wine is packed with ripe black plum, cranberry and dark chocolate flavors. It has plenty of tannin to thicken the texture but low acidity, which lends softness.",88,Marietta Cellars 2014 Armé Cabernet Sauvignon (North Coast),,,,
"This majority Sauvignon Blanc also contains almost 25% Sémillon, giving it a tropical, papaya-like bouquet. Layers of medium body and a developing texture provide weight and complexity while a balance of tangy acidity and floral aromas remain pleasing all around.",90,Frostwatch 2014 Kismet Sauvignon Blanc (Bennett Valley),,,,
"On one level this is a straightforward wine, varietally correct with lemony flavors. It's very dry and tart, with some nutty, oily nuances from 12% Sémillon. However, it has that undefinable something that makes it elegant and interesting. You find yourself reaching for it when richer, oakier, lusher wines pall.",89,Merryvale 1999 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (California),,,,
"Aromatic notes of talcum powder and scented candles give this Bordeaux blend from Navarra a light, pleasant bouquet. But the palate is more starching and hard than ideal, leaving a spiky, jagged feel to the wine's raspberry and plum fruit. So rugged and jarring that food is downright mandatory. Ripped but punishing.",84,Tandem 2004 Ars Mácula Red (Navarra),,,,
"Cola, earth, iron and spice flavors rise prominently on this Pinot Noir. The fruit remains secondary, but it's a detailed, tasty effort with appealing minerality.",89,Roco 2011 Clawson Creek Vineyards Pinot Noir,,,,
"Oak, peach and nutty aromas ride on the nose. Dense, creamy and reasonably balanced on the palate, this chunky number offers full melon and peach flavors prior to a briny, long finish.",85,Viña Maipo 2014 Vitral Reserva Chardonnay (Chile),,,,
"Made at an attractive price point, this wine delivers value and plenty of flavor, from blackberry jam to oak and black pepper. It's sturdy and structured, ready for the table or larger gathering.",90,Napa Cellars 2013 Classic Collection Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"Sweet in fruity oak and soft in structure, this easy wine has flavors of red cherries, raspberries, red currants and vanilla honey. Drink now.",85,Comartin 2006 Grenache (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Acacia, beeswax and orchard fruit aromas lead the way on this. The aromas carry over to the ripe round palate along with suggestions of apple and pear.",87,Sandro de Bruno 2015 Terre di Terrossa  (Soave),,,,
"The single-vineyard experts at Testarossa hit a homerun with this wine from a famed property. Aromas of 7-Up, recent rains and minerality kick off a refreshing experience, which is powered by a strong flavor combination of very ripe fruit (à la traditional California Chardonnay), barrel-related vanilla and brisk, lingering acidity (à la Old World).",93,Testarossa 2012 La Rinconada Vineyard Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
Not much going on in this off-dry wine. It has very thin flavors of vanilla and pineapples.,82,Baywood 2006 Vineyard Select Symphony (California),,,,
"An easy-going Ripasso, opening with bright tones of cherry, spice, blackberry and plum. There's a touch of piquant crispness in the mouth followed by soft, easy tannins.",87,Novaia 2007  Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso,,,,
"Spicy, and medium bodied, this has a smoky, spicy nose that recalls charred earth, graphite, black currant and cedar. The smoky quality carries to the palate, along with mature blackberry, allspice, licorice and clove. Firm but fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide an uplifting framework.",89,Alberto Longo 2013 Primitivo (Puglia),,,,
"Soft and lush when first opened, with a fragrant mix of oak and berry, this is broad in the mouth, oaky and liquorous. There is an impression of flatness; it lacks the lift and depth of the other Quilceda reds. But to find any Quilceda at such a modest price must be considered a gift from the wine gods.",90,Quilceda Creek 2008 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Thanks to its bright perlage and sweet floral bouquet, this could be served at an outdoor summer cocktail party. This is an easy wine that expresses the cheer of Italian sparking wine.",86,Scanavino NV Extra Dry  (Prosecco),,,,
"A proud signature of Molise, Don Luigi Riserva is a lovely Montepulciano-based wine—with 10% Aglianico—that opens with dark aromas of leather, tobacco, bitter chocolate and plump blackberry. It delivers solid tannins backed by smooth concentration.",90,Di Majo Norante 2009 Don Luigi Riserva Red (Molise),,,,
"In a ripe and forward vintage, this is an anomaly—a low alcohol, rather gravelly wine with an emphasis on non-fruit flavors. Which is not to say it's faulty—au contraire, it's fascinating, with a well-mixed potpourri of forest floor, moist leaves, gravel and spice. Drink now and over the next couple of years.",89,Vinum Ferus 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
This is classic Vinho Verde from the Quinta das Arcas estate. It balances crispness with light sweetness and sparkle. Acidity and an apple-skin texture give it a dancing quality. Screwcap.,86,Conde Villar 2011 Branco White (Vinho Verde),,,,
"This is a sweet and fruity wine, full-bodied and ripe. It has red cherries and bananas along with some acidity. While there are some tannins, it's meant for immediate drinking and not for aging,",84,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2012 Léon  (Beaujolais-Villages),,,,
"This extremely aromatic bottling shows cola, dark red cherry, black plum, nutmeg, cinnamon and concentrated hibiscus on the nose, which remains light despite all of the aromas. The acid-driven zippy wine leaps onto the palate with exotic plum and mulberry flavors, proving quite amazing in how so many flavors can ride such a light frame.",93,Barbieri 2015 Dromeus Grenache (Central Coast),,,,
"The wine is ripe and warm with generous red-berry fruits and touches of spice. The wine is rounded, full of fruitiness with a layer of tannins that is nicely judged to give support and breadth to the fruit. Drink from 2019.",88,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2015 Vieilles Vignes  (Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Nuits),,,,
"This frothy wine opens with floral aromas that recall acacia flower, dried chamomile and a whiff of honey. The palate offers yellow apple, peach and a hint of bread crust alongside brisk acidity. It ends on a note of bitter almond.",88,La Valle 2007 Naturalis Extra Brut Sparkling (Franciacorta),,,,
"Briary, herbal berry aromas are dry, earthy, foresty and show a note of olive. This Cab is full of life on the palate, with energy and good overall balance. Spicy flavors of baked plum, olive, herbs and tobacco finish long, with amplified oak. Drink now through 2018.",90,Caliterra 2013 Tributo Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"RWT (unromantically derived from “Red Wine Trial”) is 100% Barossa Valley Shiraz, aged in 100% French oak. In some vintages, like this one, the combination is incredibly sumptuous, offering layers of blueberry and blackberry fruit intermingled elegantly with hints of French vanilla. It's long, subtle and complex on the finish—a stunning effort. It's approachable now, but should age well through 2030 or so.",96,Penfolds 2009 RWT Shiraz (Barossa Valley),,,,
"This opens with aromas of oak, toast, sawdust, fennel and espresso. The palate is on the raw side, showing oak extract, anise and powdered sage but not much fruit richness. Astringent tannins give it a mouth-drying finish.",87,Rivetti Massimo 2012  Barbaresco,,,,
"This pink sweet sparkler (made with fragrant Moscato grapes) opens with an intense bouquet of raspberry, jasmine and honey. It's a blush wine with a soft, foamy finish.",83,Tosti NV Rosato Moscato (Piedmont),,,,
"The alcohol on this Cabernet is fairly high, yet the wine tastes and feels dry, supple and balanced in the mouth, with tannins so smooth, they're drinkable now. The flavors offer an interesting mélange of blackberries, black currants, green olives, sage and cinnamon. This is certainly an ageable wine that will reward your patience through 2020 or so.",92,Swanson 2010 Alexis Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Good price for a Cabernet this elegant and classy. It's not an something for the cellar, but offers everything it has now, with ripe blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors that are wrapped into sturdy, smooth tannins.",89,Franciscan 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"This is a crisp, fresh wine. It has attractive red fruits that are cut by juicy lemons. The touch of caramel in this blend of Syrah and Touriga Nacional is lit by the acidity and spiced by a final touch of pepper.",86,Falua 2015 Tagus Creek Rosé (Tejo),,,,
"Aromas of jasmine, herb and stone fruit are followed by medium-sweet, lightly spritzy stone fruit and ale flavors.",86,Kiona 2015 Late Harvest Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Full in the mouth, this is a ripe, rich wine. With acidity, spice and warm yellow fruits, it is generous and has a spicy undertone. Acidity and peaches blend together well at the end.",88,Jean Curial 2014  Mâcon-Villages,,,,
"This wine's apple, melon and pear aromas are bright and appealing. The flavors are taught and focused, with a light creaminess and lemony acidity. It's interesting overall, providing both quality and value.",89,Willow Crest 2016 Pinot Gris (Yakima Valley),,,,
"This is a structured wine, packed with black-currant fruits and fresh acidity. It is already becoming balanced with the finely drawn structure in balance with the perfumed fruits. Drink from 2018.",90,Château Haut Bages Libéral 2013  Pauillac,,,,
"Forest floor, woodland berry, grilled herb and a hint of cured meat lead the nose. On the ripe palate, firm, velvety tannins lace together red cherry, crushed raspberry, anise and sage. This is already accessible and will provide short and near-term pleasure. Drink 2016–2020.",90,Sordo 2011  Barolo,,,,
"Old vines give this ripe and fruity wine both concentration and a fine perfumed character. With a short six months in wood, it's smooth, creamy and rich with apricot and mango flavor, needing some aging. Drink from 2018.",91,Wines & Winemakers 2015 Lua Cheia em Vinhas Velhas Reserva Branco White (Douro),,,,
"Loimer's classic Grüner is delightfully cool, a green apple- and pear-flavored wine, very pure, crisp and layered with intense acidity. The edge is decidedly green, but there is plenty of creamy texture along the way. Screwcap.",88,Loimer 2007 Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),,,,
"Candied but also peppery and herbal, and without much depth or complexity. The palate is tight, acidic, sheering and tastes of snappy, edgy cherry and raspberry fruit. Then an oaky, vanilla dryness sets in. Solid and fresh, but hardly a head-turner.",85,Carmen 2006 Reserva Merlot (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"Classic Carmenère aromas of leafy black fruits come with notes of herbal bath soap, tobacco and cigar box. A full fleshy palate is plump rather than tight or tough. Blackened peppery black-fruit flavors finish chocolaty and slightly herbal.",90,Valdivieso 2012 Single Vineyard Carmenère (Peumo),,,,
"Sugary and thin, this has a light mix of citrus flavors—lemon and lime—and a hint of pineapple. It's a pleasant wine, but not up to previous efforts from Chateau Bianca.",86,Château Bianca 2012 Riesling (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Baked plum, purple flower, vanilla, blackcurrant and mocha aromas unfold in the glass. The concentrated, juicy palate offers ripe, black cherry, licorice, coffee and cocoa framed in round, velvety tannins. It's already accessible and will offer fine drinking over the next several years. Drink through 2022.",92,Nittardi 2012 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"Fresh young cherry-berry aromas, with a kiss of oak, lead to extracted, jammy, full-bodied flavors that explode in the mouth. Soft, luscious and round, there's lots of immediate pleasure here.",85,Kunin 1999 French Camp Vineyards Syrah (Paso Robles),,,,
"This pink stands out for its Ruby Red grapefruit aromas, backed by touches of orange peel and chalk. The mouthfeel is grippy and energetic, recalling again a grapefruit's juice and pith. A perfect breakfast wine.",90,Buttonwood Farm 2016 Rosé of Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Mature plum, baking spice and tobacco aromas lead the way on this structured red. Made with late-harvested grapes, the dense, enveloping palate offers black cherry extract, mocha, licorice and a confectionery note alongside velvety tannins. It closes on a dark chocolate note.",92,Cantine del Notaio 2011 Il Sigillo  (Aglianico del Vulture),,,,
"The Huber Vineyard is one of the few places where this grape grows in America, and the wine is always fascinating. Extremely dark in color, it offers unctuous black currant, graphite and licorice aromas. The palate combines mouth-coating tannins with a surprisingly light, acid-driven frame, showing woody elderberry flavors and the grape's telltale minty lift. Not extremely complex, but a fun and different sipper.",90,Tower 15 2015 Dornfelder (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Strong flavors of raspberry, cherry and oak dominate, with a hint of mushroom in the background. It will appeal to those who like a light, lean style of Pinot Noir. It's ready to drink now.",84,Peacock Cellars 2011 Reserve Pinot Noir (Central Coast),,,,
"A rich, ripe concentrated wine, packed with red plum and cherry fruits, lightly layered with tannins. The wine is immediately attractive, juicy, ready to drink.",88,Pezat 2009  Bordeaux Supérieur,,,,
"Smoky aromas of campfire and clove are blended with high-toned black-fruit scents draped in additional toasty oak. An energetic palate brings its share of resiny, heavy oak, while dark-berry flavors come with woody, toasty, charred accents that suggest clove and black pepper.",88,Pagos del Moncayo 2013 PdM Moncayo Syrah (Campo de Borja),,,,
"At a whopping 17.5% alcohol, this powerful Amarone delivers heat, brawn and loads of mature cherry, ripened blackberry and tobacco. You can feel the burn on the close so be careful to pair this wine with a hearty winter dish that will soak it all up.",87,Monteci 2004 Costa delle Corone  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),,,,
"The fact that there is 60% Cabernet Franc in this blend gives the wine a real perfumed attractiveness. It is fruity and light, with a crisp lively character. Red berries and plenty of acidity leave a fresh aftertaste. Drink now.",86,Château Landereau 2015 La Vie en Rose Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),,,,
"Some Petite Sirahs need serious time to come around, and this is one of them. Right now, it's so strong in primary fruit flavors, so jammy, so tannic and rude, it practically slaps you across the face. It really wants a great deal of time to soften and meld together. Try giving it at least eight years.",92,Stephen & Walker 2009 Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Berry and plum aromas come with notes of woodsmoke and rubber. A fresh but common mouthfeel is pleasant, while red-berry flavors lead the palate and come with a touch of creamy oak. Hence, vanilla and additional cream flavors are key components of the finish.",87,Caligiore 2011 Reserve Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"This is overtaken with unripe flavors of tomato and underbrush. There's little suggestion of fresh fruit. Aged 14 months in one-use French oak, it finishes quickly with earthy tannins.",85,Valley View 2013 Anna Maria Tempranillo (Rogue Valley),,,,
"From one of the most acclaimed up-and-coming wineries in Italy, this wine delivers pure Sangiovese nuances of red fruit, blue flower and wet earth. It shows beautiful density and richness, and the finish offers loads of blackberry flavor.",90,Terenzi 2009 Riserva  (Morellino di Scansano),,,,
"Vibrant aromas of cranberry, raspberry and red currant are followed by full-bodied jammy red-fruit flavors. It drinks quite sweet but overall holds the sugar well and the acid provides a counterbalance.",90,Angel Vine 2012 Stonetree Vineyard Zinfandel (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Cassis, menthol, black olive, and some alfalfa make for a complex bouquet. It's undoubtedly forward—red fruit, chocolate and vanilla on the palate—with a piercing quality that could subside with age. This wine has the stuff to please: it's round, mouthfilling and very correct.",90,Ahlgren 1997 Bates' Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"Toasty, tarry aromas include dark berry and baked plum notes. This offers ample tartaric acidity to cut the wine's weight, while flavors of berry, tea, mint and herbs lead to a good tasting but hollow feeling finish.",86,Viña Casas Patronales 2010 Reserva Carmenère (Maule Valley),,,,
"This medium-bodied blend of Grenache (70%), Syrah (25%) and Mourvèdre (5%) is aged in large oak vats. Leather and spice notes accent modest cherry fruit, then fold in touches of black olive and mocha on the slightly dusty finish. Drink now–2017.",88,Ogier 2012 Héritages Élevé en Foudres de Chêne Red (Côtes du Rhône),,,,
"Aromas of blackberry, black currant and ground black pepper set the scene for flavors of brambleberry, cassis, chocolate and smoke. It is bright on entry, with fruit and acidity making way for savory notes and smooth tannins, ultimately wrapping up with a zesty cranberry finish.",88,Ouled Thaleb 2015 Moroccan Red (Zenata),,,,
"Fresh, and easy, this is the perfect easy-drinking wine to enjoy with weeknight dinners. It offers blueberry, cherry and white almond aromas.",86,Speri 2010 La Roverina  (Valpolicella),,,,
"Earthy aromas of tilled soil, underbrush, leather, purple flower, cedar and ripe black-skinned berry lead the way on this delicious blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Petit Verdot. The smooth full-bodied palate doles out juicy blackberry, red currant, licorice, exotic spice, mocha and a hint of game while tightly knit but velvety tannins lend both structure and finesse. It's already compelling but give it time to fully develop. Drink 2018–2027.",95,Castello dei Rampolla 2012 d'Alceo Red (Toscana),,,,
"A brawny bottling from one of the state's most historic vineyards, this wine offers wild berries, turned earth, shiitake mushrooms and a light cinnamon glaze on the hearty nose. Rich cherry and plum fruit shows on the tip of the sip followed by rising waves of anise, eucalyptus and white sage. The mouthfeel is soft but with aggressive acidity.",93,Testarossa 2014 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Layers of spice and wood dominate what is a young, fruity wine. Although this blend of Baga and Touriga Nacional is made to drink now, it does in fact need another year to balance red fruit and wood. Drink from 2017.",85,Messias 2013 Messias Selection Red (Bairrada),,,,
"Easy, creamy wine, with soft apple flavors and a touch of citrus. There is a light edge of toast to round out the soft, fleshy aftertaste.",85,Kedar's K'orus NV Chardonnay (Vin de Pays d'Oc),,,,
"Tropical aromas of mango, banana and honeysuckle lead the nose on what first seems like a fruity wine. But then the palate is much more restrained, clean and mineral-driven, with steely flavors surrounding the remnant ripe plantain-like tropicality.",91,Peachy Canyon 2013 Concrete Blanc Viognier (Paso Robles),,,,
"Earthy notes of pear mix with the generous sweetness of a late harvest wine. The palate is concentrated and lushly sweet, but full of rich flavors, tinged with pear and orange, caramel and lemon oil, acacia honey and candied lemon peel. Lovely, bright and still totally fresh. Drink 2016–2030.",94,Domaine Schoffit 2007 Rangen Grand Cru Clos Saint Théobald Vendanges Tardives Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"Mumm's nonvintage cuvée is a soft Champagne, although now drier than in the past with attractive apple and pear flavors that are cut by citrus. It is lightly textured, hinting at almonds and with perfumed acidity at the end. This bottling is ready to drink.",87,G. H. Mumm NV Cordon Rouge Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"An attention-grabbing combination of pretty botanicals characterizes the nose of this bottling, with crisp, tonic-like aromas of lime peel and quinine mixing with fresh green pear and citrus flesh. The palate is driven by a zesty line of acidity that unveils chalk, kiwi fruit and cooked apples on the finish. It's tightly wound and fascinating.",92,Chalone Vineyard 2013 Heritage Vines Estate Grown Chardonnay (Chalone),,,,
"This wine comes from a large 300-acre estate on the island's east coast. It has subtle raspberry fruit and plenty of acidity. With its crisp aftertaste, filled out with a touch of caramel, it's ready to drink.",85,Domaine Vetriccie 2016 Rosé (Ile de Beauté),,,,
"Gia Domella scores with another fine Cabernet off this property, although this '06 is $7 more expensive than the '05. It's a dry, 100% Cab that shows an herbaceousness and soft tannins to the sweet oak and blackberry flavors. Now–2014.",90,Gia Domella 2006 E. Passalacqua Heritage Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"The blend includes 3% Cab Franc; which added some aromatics. Normally Chandler Reach wines are pure varietals; in this instance the Franc rounded out the midpalate and ramped up the scents. There's a firm streak of mineral, iron and anise. With cheese and smoked meats, sweetness emerges.",92,Chandler Reach 2004 Parris Estate Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley),,,,
This is an unusual white made from red Touriga Nacional and white Tamarez. Bright lemon flavors are balanced by notes of apricot and richer fruit tones. Drink now.,85,Quinta da Lapa 2012 Tamarez White (Tejo),,,,
"Rich, slightly oxidized notes of red apple and yellow melon are laced with accents of bitter orange peel and herbal tones. Medium weight, with a softness to the midpalate, it's enlivened by ample acidic lift. Flavors of toasted apple and pear fade into notes of sweet spice and beeswax on the finish. Drink now.",90,Vins d'Orrance 2013 Kāma Chenin Blanc (Western Cape),,,,
"It's great to find both lots of fruit and good structure in a Zin, especially at such a reasonable price. Spicy aromas like vanilla and nutmeg precede vivid and ripe fruit flavors and more of those oaky spices on the palate where firm tannins and a bite of acidity give a mouthwatering balance.",89,Cline 2015 Ancient Vines Zinfandel (Contra Costa County),,,,
"The sumptuous nose immediately signals that this is a special treat: layers of fresh and dried apple melded into autolytic notes of fresh brioche, challah and almond-crusted pastry. While the flavors of the palate remain equally sumptuous—introducing an almost salty notion of maple syrup—the spine of fresh acidity pulls an ultratight focus, providing all that richness with a firm, soaring frame. Made from 100% Chardonnay, this is an Austrian take on the absolute pedigree of this grape made into vintage-sparkling, zero-dosage Blanc de Blancs. That intriguing salty, lavish and aromatic length haunts the palate forever.",95,Ebner-Ebenauer 2008 Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (Österreichischer Sekt),,,,
"Lower in price than Cenit's Old Vines, but to me this is a better, more open wine with bacon, spice and bold black-fruit aromas. The palate is full but retains finesse as well as big tannins; flavors of black fruits come with chocolate, coffee and spice. Full-force stuff but still fairly refined. Drink now through 2014.",92,Viñas del Cenit 2007 Demora Tempranillo (Tierra del Viños de Zamora),,,,
"Giuseppe Ciavolich presents a wonderful expression of Pecorino with a dark golden color and intense aromas of apricot and ripe melon. It has a soft, creamy quality and touches of caramel and butterscotch.",89,Ciavolich Giuseppe 2009 Pecorino (Colline Pescaresi),,,,
"The apple, hay and earth aromas and flavors of this Chardonnay from northeastern Spain are in the right range, but lack the liveliness and definition I sought. Medium-weight, it finishes a bit short, a bit dull and uninspired. —M.M.",80,Bohigas 2000 Chardonnay (Catalonia),,,,
"This full-bodied wine just lacks that bit of freshness that would've taken it to the next level. Stewed plums, black olives and espresso notes are rich and complex, ending on a long silky note. Drink now and over the next few years.",89,Dauvergne & Ranvier 2010 Vin Rare  (Gigondas),,,,
"Tart and astringent, this young wine shows good structure but remains a bit tight. Light red fruits, a streak of citrus, and a strong base of cement and chalk-like minerality, this has persistence and complexity. It needs more cellar time to fully express itself.",88,:Nota Bene 2008 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Syrah (Red Mountain),,,,
"Made in a traditional style with no evident new oak, leathery, meaty notes balance dusty earth and sour plums on the nose, while the palate is full, round and richly textured. Finishes with dark, savory notes of coffee and black olives. Drink now–2017.",89,Domaine de Dionysos 2009 La Cigalette Grenache-Syrah-Mourvèdre-Carignan Cairanne Red (Côtes du Rhône Villages),,,,
"This pruney, baked and somewhat sour blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot presents itself as overly ripe.",82,Work 2012 Adrien's Blend Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Castel's Grand Vin is a consistent Bordeaux-style blend that shows good depth and concentration, as well as the promise to age gracefully. Forward oaky notes of vanilla, toast and sweet spice dominate the nose, but the black-fruit core keeps it grounded. Flavors of cassis and black plum flesh out the palate, and a peppery note lingers long on the finish.",90,Domaine du Castel 2010 Grand Vin Red (Judean Hills),,,,
"This is an unusual wine with aromas of damp herbs, bay leaf, chocolate and citrus. The flavors are sweet and chocolaty with a grainy feel.",87,Watermill 2012 Estate Tempranillo (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),,,,
"A blockbuster of a wine, very dense, packed with medicinal flavors and notes imparted by wood aging. It shows the solid structure of the 2008 vintage, and certainly needs aging.",89,Domaine du Prince 2008 Lou Prince Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"While there isn't much subtlety, this is a strong wine, offering dry, oak-inspired pineapple- and orange-jam flavors. Crisp acids and a touch of steely minerals help to ground it. It shows enough elegance to drink with the finest foods.",90,Longoria 2010 Cuvée Diana Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Meant to reflect the three elements of terroir, nature and man, this small-production wine is well represented in compost, dried herb, mild tannin and oak. The acidity is moderate and in some ways disjointed, while the finish features highlights of vanilla and currant.",86,Threesome Cellars 2012 Coombsville Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville),,,,
"A buttery aroma leads to rich butterscotch flavors and a buttery finish, too. But then there's more with each sip. The wine is dry but easy on the palate, and reveals tasty apple, almond and toasted walnut flavors with time. These all add complexity and lift it well above the ordinary. Made with certified Biodynamic grapes.",92,Bonterra 2012 The Roost Blue Heron Vineyard Chardonnay (Mendocino County),,,,
"Bold and brawny, vibrant and intense, this is a hearty wine with hickory tones, smoked bacon, loads of fresh cherry and shadings of black peppercorn and spice. It imparts a velvety texture in the mouth thanks to solid tannins and closes with a sour note that recalls sour cherry.",89,Montipagano 2003 Costamorro  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo Colline Teramane),,,,
"This Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend is supported by 18% Merlot and smaller amounts of Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec. Generous in oak and tannin, this powerful wine is robustly juicy in black and red cherry and dried herb, a complex mix of savory and succulent. The finish is long and thick, accented in coffee and oak.",91,Sodaro 2012 Estate Blend Red (Coombsville),,,,
"Blue fruit, herbs and brown spices vie for attention. The palate brings lighter-styled yet still generous-feeling fruit flavors that linger.",87,Helix by Reininger 2011 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Light, fruity wine, hinting at strawberries, along with a vanilla touch from the Merlot in the blend. It's crisp and ready to drink.",86,Domaine de Lartigue 2012 Rosé (Côtes de Gascogne),,,,
"Lovely aromatics introduce this approachable young Pinot. Scents and flavors of strawberries, raspberries and cherries abound, coming into focus in a generous midpalate. The flavors hang on beautifully, set against framing tannins and supporting acidity. The finish brings a pretty touch of baking spices.",90,Colene Clemens 2013 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Fully ripened in this exemplary vintage, this boasts fleshy cherry and plum fruit, with tasty confectionary highlights. Ten months aging in 25% new French oak contributes to those sweet notes, and a touch of sassafras and cola streaks across the finish.",91,Ribbon Ridge 2012 Wedding Block Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),,,,
"Grown on sandy soils, this cherry-hued Grenache offers up juicy watermelon and red fruit notes, with vanilla, white pepper and a dash of green herbs. The supple yet elegant palate boasts drying tannins balanced by lively acidity and a savory finish.",89,An Approach to Relaxation 2015 Sucette Grenache (Barossa),,,,
"Rhône specialist Andrew Murray has succeeded with this lovely blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre. Drinkable now, it's soft, tannic and bone dry, with tantalizing blackberry, cherry, spice and sandalwood flavors. This is a versatile, elegant food wine.",91,Andrew Murray 2009 Espérance Red (Central Coast),,,,
"Big, fruity wine, with layers of fruit, earth, toast and oak. Spicy cranberry/raspberry fruit leads into toasty, dry tannins. There is a lovely density, buttressed with new oak, but anchored with ripe, firm fruit. Lovely winemaking.",91,Rosenblum 1998 Alegria Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Rich and heady on the nose in petrol and sublime vanilla crème brûlée, the palate is intriguingly more restrained, offering honey and pear balanced by persistent minerality that finds its voice most forcefully on the lean, refreshing finish.",91,JCB 2012 No. 33 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"There's a slight sweetness to this simple sipper but the pretty, ripe strawberries and strawberry-leaf characters, along with a decent lick of acidity, keep it refreshing. For the price, this fizz is one for the ice bucket on a sweltering summer day.",87,Yellow Tail NV Pink Bubbles Sparkling (Australia),,,,
"A fresh wine, with some of the richness of the vintage showing in up-front red berry fruits. The tannins are already well integrated, allowing the wine to show a softer side. It is for medium-term aging.",88,Château Grand Tayac 2009  Margaux,,,,
"It's fun to rattle off a few of the numerous aromas and flavors in this exotic but subtle wine: tangerine, pastry cream, blanched almonds and a touch of honey. The wine is refreshing, dry and nicely braced with acidity, but at the same time rather broad and soothing in texture. In other words, beautifully balanced and wonderfully complex.",93,Terre Rouge 2014 Enigma White (Sierra Foothills),,,,
"Melis is a project backed by wine industry folks from California, but this blend of old-vines Grenache along with Carignan, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon is very European. It's heady but well balanced, with smooth edges and not too much fiery attitude, roughness or scratchy tannins. It's forward and big-boned, but there's enough creamy richness to make it friendly. Needs plenty of air time now; should hold well for five-plus years.",92,Cellers Melis 2005 Melis Red (Priorat),,,,
"This is a lot of heady wine for a relatively affordable price. Aromas of black-cherry syrup, baked black plum, nutmeg, clove and gingerbread make for an attention-grabbing nose. The hearty palate shows similar elements, along with black peppercorn, Christmas spice, dense blackberry paste, chaparral scrub and pine-forest notes.",91,Hahn 2014 SLH Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Made exclusively with Merlot, this opens with aromas of cedar, mint and dark berry. The straightforward palate offers dried black cherry, espresso and a hint of grilled bell pepper alongside somewhat raspy tannins that cut off the finish.",87,Agricoltori del Chianti Geografico 2011 Pulleraia Merlot (Toscana),,,,
"The second wine of the increasingly interesting Château de France is a bold, still-young wine. It shows firm, dry tannins and structure that are currently covering black currant flavors and spicy acidity. The finish shows tobacco and smoky flavors.",88,Château Coquillas 2006  Pessac-Léognan,,,,
"Now in golden maturity, this is a smooth, unctuous and ripe wine. Honey is the dominant character, a perfumed wild flower honey that is layered with intense acidity that lifts the wine in a beautiful way. A sweet wine yes, but one that is so balanced.",93,Domaine des Baumard 2003 Cuvée le Paon Chenin Blanc (Coteaux du Layon),,,,
"There's no denying that this is a heavily oaked Rioja with toast, resin, vanilla and cheesy aromas alongside fully ripe blackberry and prune notes. There's energy to the palate, while previously mentioned heavy oak spawns flavors of vanilla and spice to go with berry fruit. A mouth-coating, woody finish stands out on this compartmentalized Tempranillo-led blend. Drink through 2023.",90,Bodegas Valdemar 2011 Inspiración Valdemar Selección  (Rioja),,,,
"Ripe and fruity, this is a full-bodied, intense wine. It has citrus acidity as well as more tropical fruits, laden with wood. The whole is much more than the sum of the parts, giving a full, ripe and complex wine that will age.",91,Fontes da Cunha 2011 Munda Encruzado (Dão),,,,
"This is a full-bodied wine with a citrus streak of acidity to go with peach and apricot flavors. It is rich, just hinting at minerality, generous in mouthfeel.",90,Josef Ehmoser 2009 Vom Gelben Löss Riesling (Wagram-Donauland),,,,
"Typically spicy, this wine is all about intense perfumes. Very soft, ripe and rounded, it will be better as a sweet apéritif than with food.",86,Henri Schoenheitz 2012 Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"Whole-cluster fermented, this wine offers complexities of baked plum, raspberry and truffled earth. Generous in oak and structure, it also flashes lavender, rose and black licorice around a core of meaty game. Smooth on the palate, enjoy this wine through 2027.",92,Marimar Estate 2012 Método Antiguo Doña Margarita Vineyard Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This is a very ripe, forward wine, saturated in cherries, blackberries, currants and oak. It has Malbec's characteristically sturdy tannins and could use some protein and fat, a grilled steak, perhaps, to play against it.",88,Windsor Oaks 2009 Block 35 Malbec (Chalk Hill),,,,
"Cherry and berry aromas are generic but clean and welcoming. A crisp, fresh mouthfeel is fruity and fairly light for Cab, while flavors of red plum, cherry and red apple skins finish racy and not oaky.",86,François Lurton 2012 Piedra Negra Alta Colección Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"The name of this wine playfully refers to the fact that storks still nest in the chimneys of Alsace. It is rich, full, soft, with notes of pepper and dried apricot, plus ample sweetness. The acidity helps to cut the richness, making it food friendly.",86,Frédéric Mallo 2009 Special Delivery Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"Cool aromas of kola nut and woodsy black fruit suggest ripeness. This blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Petit Verdot is linear and jammy in feel, without much depth. Spicy blackberry and grapy flavors are up a notch from simple, while this finishes with toasty oak and spice notes.",88,Doña Paula 2014 Estate Black Edition Red (Luján de Cuyo),,,,
"From a vineyard on the southern end of the Silverado Trail that's rich in iron and decomposed granite, this 100% varietal red is nicely crafted, displaying elegance and power in equal parts. Silky and inviting on the nose, it's exuberant and expansive on the palate, with cranberry and red currant fruit, the finish soft and intense.",92,Little Giant 2013 Lamonica Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Sultry aromas of dark berries and crushed violets show on the nose of this bottling alongside black sage, clove and fine-grained graphite aromas. Dark pomegranate and cranberry arise on the sip, lifted by white pepper and allspice.",93,Weatherborne 2014 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Quite a good Syrah, dry and robust and full bodied. It has very rich, deep flavors of blackberries, currants and coffee, as well as thick, astringent tannins that make the mouth all sticky. Drink now, with decanting, and over the next six years.",90,Dierberg 2009 Estate Grown Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Oaked up at all points, but still a good basic blend of two friendly grapes. Shows cherry and raspberry aromas along with graphite and barrel spice on the bouquet. The palate is edgy and resiny, with oak-infused raspberry, plum and citrus flavors. Lively and fresh, but the wood is pushy.",85,Tilia 2010 Malbec-Syrah (Mendoza),,,,
"This off-dry bottling shows orange blossom, light honey, tangerine rinds, lemon zest and the slightest hint of petrol on the nose. There is decent zip to the palate, where orange-soda and lime flavors ride a sugary frame.",87,Fess Parker 2016 Riesling (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"This elegantly structured white opens with scents of citrus, yellow stone fruit, chopped herb and a light whiff of oak. The polished palate offers yellow peach, apricot, tangerine zest and mineral alongside fresh acidity. A hint of vanilla closes the finish.",91,Russiz Superiore 2011 Riserva Sauvignon (Collio),,,,
"Blended from Grenache Blanc, Viognier, Roussanne and Marsanne, this is a fine wine for drinking now. It's dry and acidic and even a little tannic, with subtle apricot, tobacco and orange rind flavors.",85,Tablas Creek 2012 Patelin de Tablas Blanc White (Paso Robles),,,,
"A delightful bottle with notes of stone fruit, buttered popcorn and toasty spice. It's light in style, displaying both nuance and delicacy, with enough acidity to keep it all in vivid focus.",90,Meyer Family Vineyards 2012 McLean Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Okanagan Valley),,,,
Aromas of pressed white flower and a hint of stone fruit lead the nose. The simple palate offers subtle green apple and unripe yellow peach alongside bright acidity.,85,Montresor 2014 Campovalentino  (Lugana),,,,
"This wine is full of rich fruit. With apricots, mangos and a layer of caramel, this is a generous wine with enough acidity to sustain its richness. The aftertaste brings in spice, vanilla and a squeeze of lemon.",88,Domaine André Bonhomme 2013 Cuvée Spéciale  (Viré-Clessé),,,,
"This is a big powerful overtly flavorful wine that demands attention. A vivid toasty savory aroma leads to rich spicy buttery nutty flavors that are mouth filling and a smooth, rather soft texture.",86,LVVR NV Blanc de Blancs Sparkling (Lodi),,,,
"Just slightly dilute, but well-made in every other way, this gentle wine is true to variety with flavors of melon and strawberry, hints of citrus and a dusting of cinnamon spice. It has the gentle elegance of village Burgundy, at a comparable cost.",89,Paul O'Brien 2013 Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),,,,
"Full and ripe, the wine has smooth flavors of apricots, ripe apples and pears and a structure that includes wood tastes. It's a rich wine, hinting at spice and showing fresh, juicy acidity at the end. Drink until 2019.",91,Fournier Père et Fils 2010 Grande Fumé  (Pouilly-Fumé),,,,
"With a well-balanced but firm tannic structure, this is a wine that reflects the freshness of the vintage and also gives a feeling of richness. Berry fruits dominate, supported by a dry core that promises aging. Drink from 2014.",87,Château La Barotte 2011 Réserve  (Bordeaux),,,,
"Orange peel, melon, and green aromas are muted by a sulphuric overtone. The palate offers balanced acidity and a grainy texture, finishing on spice and lemon peel tones.",88,Barker's Marque 2016 Arona Certified Sustainable Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"Plum, cassis, floral hints and spicy, charred aromas open this Syrah-led blend. Hailing from a warm year, this feels jammy, dense and full in body. Peppery, chocolaty blackberry flavors end dark and deep, with a strong aftershock of olive and herbal flavors. Drink through 2019.",90,Antiyal 2012 Kuyen Red (Maipo Valley),,,,
"This weighty Malbec is more rough than refined, but what's here is decent. The nose is round and full of plum and berry aromas, while there's a full blast of berry fruit along with detectable oak on the palate. The finish is basic and clean, with some buttery oak on the very back.",84,Château La Joya 2001 Estate Bottled Reserve Malbec (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"This well-aged Cab offers savory and lovely aromas of salted Asian plum, light licorice, dried violets and lilacs, and expertly seasoned beef. The palate retains a tense, chewy structure and juicy acidity that frames flavors of dried blueberry, rose hips and more plum.",94,Cooper-Garrod 2010 George's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"Ben Lomond is a newish appellation in the cooler, western part the Santa Cruz Mountains (the eastern part favors Cabernet Sauvignon). And by the evidence of this luscious wine, it's a great place for Chardonnay. With plenty of winemaker bells and whistles, it's rich and complex, showing tropical fruit, tangerine, lemon custard, honey, buttered toast and cinnamon flavors, brightened with mouthwatering acidity.",92,Beauregard 2012 Beauregard Ranch Chardonnay (Ben Lomond Mountain),,,,
"Late disgorged, this wine combines 67% Pinot Noir and 33% Chardonnay from the vintage, exploding in well-honed, equal flavors of strawberry and white peach. Spicy acidity keeps it fresh and lively as it builds toward a dry, lemony finish.",92,Gloria Ferrer 2008 Royal Cuvée Brut Sparkling (Carneros),,,,
"The nose on this burly red is disappointingly mute. Nonetheless, the palate shows intriguing flavors of earth and fall leaves that linger on the finish. Mouth-coating tannins will benefit from another year or two in bottle.",84,Giacosa Fratelli 2006 San Rocco  (Dolcetto d'Alba),,,,
"There is an obvious vanilla, toasty character to this wine from the wood fermentation. That balances with the lemon and pear fruits and the tight texture. The wine is still young with great fruit potential, so drink from 2018.",88,Domaines Devillard 2014 Château de Chamirey  (Mercurey),,,,
"Dry lime and citrus peel aromas are round and solid, nothing more. That more or less describes the palate, which tastes a little bit wheaty and dull, with a note of bitter melon on the finish. Drink now.",85,Eguren 2015 Viura (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),,,,
"The 2006 d'Arry's Original offers a welcome combination of dark, earthy complexity with notes of cola, plum and black cherry. It's full in the mouth and expansive on the palate, leading into a long finish redolent of peppery spice. Drink now–2012.",90,D'Arenberg 2006 The d'Arry's Original Shiraz-Grenache (McLaren Vale),,,,
"With a yellowish color and round melony aromas that are suggestive of candle wax, this feels oily and a touch viscous, but not fat or out of shape. Dry, slightly salty melon flavors finish strong.",89,Protos 2015 Verdejo (Rueda),,,,
"There's a touch of forest floor funk on this wine, but the nose also shows lots of stewed black cherries, chemise and mint-chocolate chip. The palate is deep and rich but not overly ripe, with raspberry and elderberry fruit cut by herbal seasonings of oregano, thyme, marjoram and mint.",93,Holman Ranch 2010 Hunter's Cuvee Pinot Noir (Carmel Valley),,,,
"Ferrari produces wonderful sparkling wines year after year and this Brut Rosé carries forth that proud Trento (northern Italy) tradition. It opens with a pale pink color and deep layers of yeast, cranberry and savory spice.",90,Ferrari NV Rosé Sparkling (Trento),,,,
"This is a herbal wine with fruit that is firm and austere. It has spice, a touch of wood, berry fruits and dry tannins. It seems on the lean side.",84,Château La Rame 2011 Charmille  (Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux),,,,
"A dense, leathery, richly stylized wine from a great vineyard site, this offers thick layers of dark chocolate, blueberry and plum. Integrated in terms of oak and tannin, it delivers concentration and power, capped off on the finish in a shot of cigar.",90,Patland 2012 Stagecoach Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley),,,,
"Ripe and fruity, this has the right amount of structure to hold everything together. It's a bold, rounded wine, acidity layering red fruits and a darker tannic aftertaste. Drink from 2016.",87,Château du Barry 2012  Bordeaux,,,,
"Earthy notes of slightly bruised, ripe apple peel set the tone of this wine. The palate is taut and clean, shot through with zesty, refreshing lemon juice and peel notes. It has a light-footed elegance and a dry, clean-cut finish.",89,Domaine Gresser 2014 Duttenberg Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"Hot and poorly structured, with o.k. cherry cola aromas but very little on the palate. Tastes tart and of sour plums, with a short, starchy, tannic finish. Raw stuff that's not that good in the scheme of things.",81,Yonna 2005 Red (Campo de Borja),,,,
"Round and soft, this wine opens with an intense fragrance of mint, alpine herbs and whiffs of woodland berries. The fresh palate delivers crushed Bing cherry, cinnamon and clove alongside smooth tannins. Drink now–2018.",90,La Calonica 2010 Riserva  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),,,,
"A soft style of Blanc de Blancs, rounded as much as crisp, this is an attractively ripe and fruity wine. Apple and grapefruit flavors are filled out with perfumed acidity and a lively, fresh aftertaste. Drink now.",88,Chassenay d'Arce 2005 Blanc de Blancs Millésimé Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),,,,
"At $8, this is a great find, and has the exotic Bulgarian label to boot. The nose is all lemon zest and spice, and on the palate there is a lively, minerally punch with soft citrus flavors layered over it. A lovely summer sipping wine, best paired with seafood and salads.",85,Targovishte 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Bulgaria),,,,
"An initial hit of reduction blows off to reveal rich vanilla backed by gentle lemon purity. This clearly needs some time in bottle to find its middle but all the basics are there: freshness, clean fruit, texture and poise. Drink 2028–2025.",90,Gernot and Heike Heinrich 2014 Chardonnay (Leithaberg),,,,
"Conveying a sense of richness, this is a smooth and creamy wine with a tannic structure that emerges out of the ripe apple and pear flavors. Acidity at the end is already well integrated into the crisp texture with its touch of orange zest and minerality. Drink from 2018.",93,Louis Latour 2013 Morgeot Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet),,,,
"Starting out reductive, this wine has aromas of wet copper penny, fresh herbs, woodspice and dark fruit. The coffee and black fruit flavors are high octane, seeming out of balance.",86,Inconceivable 2012 After the Floods Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"You can feel the unctuous, oily richness as soon as this wine reaches the tongue. It is dense and concentrated, with sweet green plums and a creamy texture. The old-vine fruit, enveloping the mouth, just leaves a hint of spice.",91,Bründlmayer 2007 Alte Reben Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),,,,
"Peppery black cherry and blackberry aromas blend in secondary aromas of wet dog hair, candied red fruits and jerky. This blend of 70% Malbec and 30% Cab Franc feels plump and chunky, with leafy, herbal berry flavors. Oak and mild green notes dominate the rustic, spicy finish.",87,Gauchezco 2011 Plata Gran Reserva Malbec-Cabernet Franc (Mendoza),,,,
"A spicy, wood-aged wine with a fine combination of pineapple and citrus fruit. With the spice from the wood, the wine is rich while keeping a line of pure bright acidity. Drink the wine from late 2017.",88,Le Nardian 2014  Bordeaux Blanc,,,,
This bubbly Prosecco Superiore offers vibrant tones of white flower and cut grass followed by light touches of peach and honeydew melon. The mouthfeel is creamy and soft with a subtle touch of sweetness.,87,Bacio della Luna 2012 Millesimato Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
"A blend of vines from different soils, this rich, dense wine has concentration as well as steely, tangy fruits. It is still young and nervy, needing time to open out. Drink this wine from 2018.",88,Domaine de Bel Air 2014  Pouilly-Fumé,,,,
"Toast with apricot jam comes first to mind in this nicely balanced white that begins in richness and evolves in the glass to offer a freshness of lime zest and grapefruit, the minerality well-defined.",90,Robert Mondavi 2013 Reserve Chardonnay (Carneros),,,,
"Made of Kinali Yapincak, a grape native to Turkey, this deep-straw colored wine does not give up much on the nose beyond a touch of apricot and just-washed cotton sheets. It does not seem wholly integrated on the palate, with chewy tannins overpowering flavors of melon, toast and white flower.",84,Suvla 2012 Kinali Yapincak (Thrace),,,,
"This is a young wine, full of fruit and still packed with dry tannins. Its future is good, with layers of juicy ripe black cherry flavors under the tannins that promise a ripe and full-bodied wine. Drink from 2016.",88,Georges Duboeuf 2014 Château de Javernand  (Chiroubles),,,,
"Made entirely with Malvasia Nera, this has subtle aromas of red berry and baking spice. The fresh palate delivers juicy red plum and white pepper along with a hint of cocoa framed in round tannins.",89,Castello di Meleto 2014 Camboi Malvasia Nera (Toscana),,,,
"This wine is powerful enough to serve with wild boar carpaccio, if there is such a thing, or with blue cheese like a Port. The color is unusually dark and opaque, a stark black with a faintly purple rim. It smells spicy and tastes very concentrated, like blackberry jam, wood smoke and black pepper. The texture is almost thick and drenched with fine tannins while the body is quite full as well.",89,Prospect 772 2013 Black Tie Charlie Red (California),,,,
"Epiphany's varietal '04s weren't very good, so how could this Mourvèdre, Grenache and Syrah blend be? It's dry, tannic and dull, with thin, barely ripe flavors.",82,Epiphany 2004 Gypsy Red (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Bottled in March 2010 and released in September 2011, this wine is still drinking young and fresh, with firm, rustic tannins. It's gigantic in mineral-infused blackberries and black currants; the flavors are deep, intense and long-lasting into the finish. An impressive wine whose astringency requires aging, hold this until 2017, at the very least.",94,Duckhorn 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),,,,
"While it certainly has bright acidity and green fruit flavors, this is quite creamy in texture for an Aligoté, its angles softened and rounded. The finale is fresh, with a more citrus character.",85,Domaine Jayer-Gilles 2007  Bourgogne Aligoté,,,,
"This is a wine of great intensity. Its tight texture and citrus fruits work hard to produce a strongly floral wine that has a steely character. It certainly needs some age, so drink from 2019.",89,Véronique Günther-Chereau 2016 Les Greniers du Moulin Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),,,,
"Chemical-leaning aromas jump out on a last-legs nose. This feels dull and low on pulse, with only a hint of acidity. Mealy bitter apricot flavors finish pithy.",82,Borsao 2015 Rosé (Campo de Borja),,,,
"Lush fruits of boysenberry, plump raspberry and strawberry mesh with vanilla, nutmeg and allspice on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard off Drum Canyon Road. Black cherry and more vanilla make for a rich palate, but it's cut by an edge of acidity, darker elderberry, savory shiitake and a bay-leaf character that rises on the finish.",95,Siduri 2015 Dierberg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"This is an Agiorgitiko that starts with aromas of clove, vanilla, cinnamon and mint. On the palate, appealing, deep flavors of tobacco, savory spice, smoked meat and cherry are balanced by an elegant acidity. This is a wine that can age but today, it's drinking well. Pair with lamb, pork.",88,Lafazanis 2010 Epìcus Agiorgitiko (Peloponnese),,,,
"Freshly cut Anjou pear, crisp apple, hints of honeydew and lime skin show on the nose of this vibrant bottling by Greg Brewer. There is bouncy acidity and a fine-grained, chalky grip to the sip, delivering chilled green-melon and lime-sorbet flavors. It's tangy yet laced with stony minerality and intriguing texture.",93,Diatom 2016 Hillard Bruce Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Ripe, jammy pineapple, Meyer lemon and nectarine flavors characterize this Chardonnay. It also shows plenty of new oak and lees notes. Rich and flashy, it's fully ready to drink now.",88,Longboard 2012 Rochioli Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"A spicy, stewy Barbera that's medium in weight, soft and earthy—like a weathered leather saddle. It finishes long and soft, swaddled in plum flavor.",87,IL Gioiello 2008 Barbera (Amador County),,,,
"Comes down on the rustic side, but for the price it's pretty good for a dry Cabernet. Shows the variety's full-bodied fanciness in the blackberry, currant, cocoa and licorice flavors, with a rich steak of vanilla oak.",85,Meridian 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),,,,
"Here's a fresh and clean rendition of Vernaccia with distinct notes of passion fruit, citrus and honey. The wine offers vibrant spice and lively notes of citrus that would pair well with Thai peanut sauce.",85,Mormoraia 2007  Vernaccia di San Gimignano,,,,
"Super smooth and open, this loose and lovely Merlot coats the palate with pretty cherry and raspberry fruit, slathered in tasty milk chocolatey oak. Not a deep wine, but deeply enjoyable, and ready to drink right now.",88,Barnard Griffin 2008 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A ripe, balanced wine this is maturing well. It has a black plum note to go with the underlying tannins. Rich juicy flavors join notes of spice and wood, leading onto the firm finish. Age for another two years.",89,Domaine Pont de Guestres 2008  Lalande de Pomerol,,,,
"Oily citrus and barrel-based smoke aromas set up a palate that's deep and powerful. Flavors of spiced apple, citrus and butterscotch are solid and don't fade over the course of a long, slightly pithy tasting finish.",88,Andeluna 2013 Altitud Chardonnay (Tupungato),,,,
"Yes, it is very dark colored, but this rich wine shows elegance as well as its dense tannins. Flavors of blackberries come through the coffee note and dry core to give a wine that will develop relatively quickly over the next 2–3 years.",89,Jean-Luc Baldès 2009 Clos Triguedina La Chapelle du Clos Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"This lovely sparkling wine has aromas of white peach and bread crust. The palate delivers creamy peach and apricot flavors, along with notes of toasted almond. Crisp, quenching acidity makes for a clean finish.",89,Cola NV Satèn Chardonnay (Franciacorta),,,,
"This Merlot holds estate fruit as well as sourced grapes from several sites, creating a well-blended wine with tiny percentages of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. Aged in both French and American oak, the wine is balanced in cranberry and blackberry, with an herbaceous underbelly.",86,Matanzas Creek 2011 Merlot (Sonoma County),,,,
"The historic vineyard of Casa de Santar in the heart of the Dão region has produced a dense and powerful offering, with rich tannins and black fruits. Its intense, solid blackberry and spice flavors are followed by acidity, contributing complexity. Age for at least four years.",93,Dão Sul 2008 Casa de Santar Reserva Red (Dão),,,,
"This is light, fruity and spicy, with a crisp edge of acidity as well as a soft texture. Ready to drink. Screwcap.",86,Forstreiter 2009 Zvy-Gelt Zweigelt (Niederösterreich),,,,
"Classic, soft, easy and broad Pinot Blanc. There is an attractive buttery character to go with the peach and lime flavors. The wine is ripe, with pure fruit and a final tang of acidity.",88,Mittnacht Frères 2009 Terre d'Etoiles Pinot Blanc (Alsace),,,,
"Sweet and floral with assertive aromas of crushed violets, dark berries and a touch of milk chocolate. Easy in the mouth with a medium weight, round texture and soft tannins. The finish is loaded with juicy black fruit flavors. Drink now.",86,Cederberg 2009 Merlot-Shiraz (Cederberg),,,,
"A dry, tannicly astringent wine that doesn't seem fully ripened. It has green, herb and mint-infused berry flavors. Cabernet, Colorino and Sangiovese.",83,Pietra Santa 2005 Sassolino Red (Cienega Valley),,,,
"Good, rich and earthy, a dark, full-bodied wine with olive, earth, tobacco and plum flavors and dense but accessible tannins. Strikes a balanced note, not a hedonistic blockbuster, but elegantly drinkable tonight. Might soften and improve with a few years in the cellar.",89,Silverado 1999 Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"From vineyards at the western end of the Douro region, this is a densely packed wine, with a dusty and tannic texture that also keeps a firm grip on dark berry and stone fruits. The acidity is less apparent, giving a wine that should be drunk in the next 1–2 years.",89,Douro Family Estates 2005 Quinta dos Poços Grande Reserva Red (Douro),,,,
"Kettle Valley Winery, on the Naramata Bench, is a rising star. This gorgeous, seductive and silky wine is the perfect expression of Pinot Noir. This is what good Burgundy tastes like, with length, purity and a discreet voluptuousness.",92,Kettle Valley 2005 Pinot Noir (Okanagan Valley),,,,
"Lean and streamlined, this has bright aromas of dried rosemary, currant, cassis and spice. There's isn't too much pulpy fruit or extraction, but the acidity is refreshening and bright.",87,Vaona 2009 Paverno  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),,,,
"Dark, dense and delicious, this inviting blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot and a tiny amount of Petit Verdot delivers ripe blackberry, dark cherry, cocoa, clove and cinnamon. Full-bodied but velvety tannins and soft acidity give a smooth texture, making this wine extremely approachable. Enjoy soon.",89,Tenuta Argentiera 2011 Poggio ai Ginepri  (Bolgheri),,,,
"Wound up like a drum, this wine opens to reveal hedonistic aromas of toast, barrel spice, blackberry and light meaty notes. It's made in a full-bodied, concentrated style, with wound-up tannins that would benefit from time in the cellar. Best after 2020.",92,Gorman 2012 The Bully Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),,,,
"Alive and dainty with soft orange blossom notes paired with fresh red apple slices and a touch of nuttiness. The mouth is more of the same, with a distinct peach pit flavor unfolding on the medium-length finish.",87,Domaines Astruc 2009 dA Chardonnay (Vin de Pays d'Oc),,,,
"Another beautiful Chardonnay from this fine vineyard and winery. The wine is drier than past vintages, but rich in acidity and minerals, with a complex array of pineapple, lime and Meyer lemon citrus flavor. Fermenting half the wine in stainless steel and the balance in oak, a third of which was new, seems to be the perfect approach.",93,Suacci Carciere Wines 2008 Heintz Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This is a very fine, high level Cabernet that shows the impeccable nature of Mondavi Reserve. Yet it's also very tannic and far from being drinkable. Shows a vast repository of black currant, blackberry, black cherry and new oak flavors wrapped into a smooth, velvety mouthfeel whose finish goes on forever. Masculine and authoritative, it should continue to improve for many years. Drink now, with decanting, and through 2017, at least.",94,Robert Mondavi 2005 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Aged 14 months in Russian Oak, this is a different kind of Chard with notes of chamomile, fresh mint sprigs, vanilla and cigar tobacco among the more typical melon fruits and lime citrus. Medium-full but a bit flat in the mouth with a solid but quite smoky finish.",84,Comtesse Thérèse 2007 Russian Oak Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"A delicious Sauv Blanc from one of the coolest areas of South Africa, it takes a while for this wine to fully express itself. Green pepper and grass start on the nose, but then subside to allow green fig, lime rind and tart tropical fruit accents to unfold. Balanced and refreshing, with a fynbos herb note that remains through the long finish, almost like fresh hops.",90,Lomond 2010 Pincushion Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Cape Agulhas),,,,
"Medicinal berry aromas are outweighed by a strong blast of clove. While this feels wide and chunky, it's also acidic. Following the nose, this tastes heavily of clove along with plum, currant and raspberry. On the finish, there's no shedding that dominant oak-based clove character.",85,Indomita 2016 Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),,,,
"This is a rich mouthful of a wine, with ripe notes of red apple and green plum. Behind the fruit, there is a soft vanilla edge that adds depth of flavor. It's concentrated and ready to age for 2–3 years.",89,Francine et Olivier Savary 2010  Chablis,,,,
"Soft and round, it offers an attractive white flower aromatic character, yellow fruits and a touch of citrus. It's smooth and already very drinkable.",85,Cave des Grands Crus Blancs 2013 Solaire  (Mâcon-Vinzelles),,,,
This medium-bodied wine has ripe and semisweet flavors like cherry juice and plum jam that give a soft impression on the palate.,84,Hess Select 2014 Treo Winemaker's Red (California),,,,
"Light green in color, with standard Torrontes aromas of acacia and tropical fruits. The palate is simple and delivers solid flavors of lychee, melon and green herbs; somewhat cloying and confected.",83,Tamarí 2006 Reserva Torrontés (Mendoza),,,,
"Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon are the principal components, with smaller amounts of Cab Franc and Merlot, all from one of the estate vineyards located in the Rocks (Walla Walla's soon-to-be newest sub-AVA). Strongly tannic, its core of cassis fruit is anchored in potent flavors of iron, earth and licorice.",89,Beresan 2010 The Buzz Yellow Jacket Vineyard Red (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),,,,
"Aromas of blackberry, plum, chocolate and spice are light, but the palate is fruit-filled and flavorful with a tart finish.",88,6 Under 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington),,,,
"Mature and sound on the bouquet, but more snappy and sharp overall than you might anticipate for a 2001. Aromas of tobacco and bramble lead to flavors that you'd expect: more tobacco, dried plum, sour cherries, etc. Long and lean on the palate and finish, with pulse but a shortage of richness. It leaves you wanting more body and fruit.",86,Resalte 2001 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"A full-bodied, fleshy expression of the variety, this wine opens in aromas of toasted marshmallow and caramel, the oak impressive and memorable. From there it offers a wealth of baked apple and pear, finding its footing along a lush, richly defined path.",90,Michael Mondavi Family Estate 2015 Emblem Chardonnay (Carneros),,,,
"A stony, flinty character leads the nose of this blend of 54% Sauvignon Blanc and 46% Sémillon, followed by scents of ripe peach, nectarine, freshly dried grass and herbs. The medium-weight palate offers more clean fruit flavors that result in a smooth, slightly creamy mouthfeel. Ample acidity lends freshness to the finish, alongside a lingering yellow flower character. Drink now–2019.",90,Delaire Graff 2013 Reserve White (Coastal Region),,,,
"Violet, iris, wild berry, tilled soil and mint aromas mingle in the glass. The structured, elegant palate delivers crunchy red cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper, iron and aromatic herb alongside a backbone of vibrant acidity and firm but refined tannins. This is quite simply a fabulous wine. Drink 2018–2030.",93,Luigi Oddero & Figli 2010  Barbaresco,,,,
"Harsh texture, sharp acidity and green tannins. Won't age.",80,Cantara 2007 Petite Sirah (Lodi),,,,
"Nothing but fruit in this cleverly named, unoaked Chardonnay. The wine shows intense, long hangtime flavors of limes, oranges and exotic tropical fruits, heightened by crisp acidity and a strong minerality that accentuates and delineates the flavors.",87,Carmel Road 2010 Liberated Chardonnay (Monterey),,,,
"A deliberately oxidized style makes for an immensely intriguing wine that falls between the usual Austrian categories—but then we need wines that defy neat boxes. Aromas of toasted cashew nuts and dried orange peel segue into a dryish, citrus-scented palate, with a central, thick slick of salted caramel and racy acidity. The longer you taste, the more facets appear, even as the palate fades into notions of salty, candied mandarin zest. Unusual and uncategorisable, but unforgettable. Despite being called Apéritif, it might be best with cheese and tapas.",93,Tinhof NV Apéritif White (Burgenland),,,,
"Winemaker: Coenie Snyman. A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Syrah, 5% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot, this opens with bright red-fruit aromas, pronounced in waves of cherry, plum and tea rose. The smooth palate boasts medium yet fine tannins, with ample acidity that complements the juicy red-fruit flavors. Drink now–2021.",89,Rust en Vrede 2014 Cape Winemakers Guild CWG Auction Estate Red (Stellenbosch),,,,
"The nose is full of baking spices, cinnamon and nutmeg, as well as blackberry and black currant, with a peppery note lingering under it all. The tannins are taut, with ample acidity lifting the spicy palate. Fruit notes of black plum and black currant meld with raw tobacco leaf. The tannins linger on the finish, with plenty of dark fruit and spice.",89,Sutcliffe 2014 Cabernet Franc (Colorado),,,,
"Ripe and soft. There is an attractive citrus element that gives structure, wih acidity coming through. Delicious now. Screwcap.",87,Domaine Zinck 2009 Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"Decadent and intense, this smells like breakfast toast that has been slathered with red currant jam, mango butter and apricot preserves, topped with a drizzle of honey. The mouthfeel is rich, round and unctuous, with a zing of acidity that keeps it from seeming cloying. Notes of brûléed sugar and spice decorate the finish.",88,Lovingston 2010 El Late Harvest Chardonnay (Monticello),,,,
"Spicy musky notes hover above scents of canned peaches. On the palate, these rich peach notes are framed by pleasantly bitter notes of pith and peach skin. The characteristic 2014 freshness makes this bright and sprightly and creates an off-dry finish to the concentrated palate.",91,Domaine Charles Baur 2014 Pfersigberg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"Full and stocky on the nose, with a mild pine and juniper accent. The palate features good feel and thickness, while the raspberry and plum flavors are complete and juicy. Dry and spicy on the finish, and correct within the global pool of Pinot Noir.",88,Gracia de Chile 2007 Reserva Lo Mejor Sereno Pinot Noir (Bío Bío Valley),,,,
"Chardonnay has not been Silverado's strong suit in recent years and the tight, lean 2008 does not alter that conclusion. The wine is dry and acidic, with citrus and apple flavors that lack charm.",84,Silverado 2008 Chardonnay (Napa County),,,,
"This biodynamic blend of Merlot and Cabernet Franc opens with an inky, dense appearance and super intense aromas of blackberry, dark spice, tobacco and dried rosemary. The wine boasts a polished and direct feel in the mouth with tight, finely structured tannins. Let it age five years or more.",92,Duemani 2009 Altrovino Red (Toscana),,,,
"An aromatic nose of ripe red and yellow apple promises fruit-forward fizz. On the palate, these notes are intensified by the very vivid frothy bubbles as they burst. There is apple crispness and lots of fruit on the light dry palate. It's an ideal and invigorating apéritif.",89,Jean-Baptiste Adam NV Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),,,,
Here is a very likeable Prosecco with lime flavors and aromas of mint leaf and lemon ice sorbet. It has a remarkably creamy and smooth texture in the mouth—like citrus cream—and a nervous touch of crisp acidity on the close.,88,Le Colture 2006 Pianer Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene),,,,
"This tight, rather sharp effort shows pear skin and lemon-oil highlights, with penetrating phenolics. It will benefit from substantial aeration, and/or another year or two in bottle.",88,Amity 2014 Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley),,,,
"A slight majority of Cabernet Sauvignon is blended with 47% Cabernet Franc to offer an explosion of chocolate, blackberry jam and bitter black tea against more classical undertones of brushy sage and cedar. A powerhouse of a wine, it finishes in grippy tannin and oak. Cellar through 2023.",93,Viader 2013 Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Good, rich and spicy Zin from Williams Selyem winemaker Bob Cabral. It's not the most memorable Bacigalupi ever, with a somewhat soft, simple structure. But the raspberry, vanilla, toast and spice flavors are fine for drinking now.",87,Williams Selyem 2009 Bacigalupi Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Good Pinot Noir for the price. It's a little soda-poppy, with raspberry and cherry pie flavors, but the acidity is brisk, and the mouthfeel is nice and silky.",86,Don & Sons 2011 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"This wine is still settling into the bottle, with light spritzy scents of honeysuckle, pear and ripe peach. The off-dry stone-fruit flavors exhibit well-balanced acidity that carries through the finish. The concentration comes off as somewhat light but what's there is good.",87,Jones of Washington 2015 Riesling (Ancient Lakes),,,,
"Peppery leather opens up this wine, blended with 5% Mourvèdre. More savory than fruity, it pleases in big tannin weight and length, with an intensity of brambly wildness and a sagey, smoky edge.",90,Peter Franus 2013 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),,,,
"This wine is a combo of Paso Robles and Edna Valley. The Paso fruit brings slightly cooked, jammy pear and apricot flavors, while the San Luis Obispo grapes provide balancing acidity and a keen lime edge. The result is dry and easy.",86,Martin & Weyrich 2006 Pinot Grigio (Central Coast),,,,
"Five vineyards contribute their best barrels to this outstanding blend, which carries the humble Oregon AVA on its label. It's a testament to the art of blending, as most of the components are also featured in vineyard designates, but here the whole is more than the sum of its parts. It's a showcase of pure, dense, detailed red fruits, set in perfectly matched acid, tannin and mineral elements.",93,King Estate 2013 Backbone Pinot Noir (Oregon),,,,
"Fun and quenching, this crisp, informal sparkler delivers ripe green apple and pear flavors. Vibrant acidity gives it a clean finish.",86,Villa Sandi NV Il Fresco Brut  (Prosecco Treviso),,,,
"The Reveler is Revelry's mainstay blend, a mix of roughly equal parts of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Merlot. Floral and powdered sugar scents lead into a light and pretty palate, showcasing red berry flavors and a touch of minerality.",88,Revelry 2009 The Reveler Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Raspberry, plum and cherry aromas become more thin, cheesy and leathery with time. The palate is hard and narrow, with sheer flavors of generic raspberry and plum. Clacky and rough feeling on the finish.",83,Don Manuel Villafañe 2007 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"Orange peel, fresh flowers, honeysuckle, lemon curd and a touch of creamy vanilla or cinnamon opens the opulent bouquet of this Reserve Gewürztraminer. The wine is soft and creamy with enough sweetness to pair with a thick slice of pâté de campagne.",89,Peter Zemmer 2010 Reserve Gewürztraminer (Alto Adige),,,,
"A crisp wine with intriguing herbal and green fruit flavors that are edged with tannins, and a toasty, mineral finish. Delicious.",88,Clos Triguedina NV Le Sec du Clos Chardonnay-Viognier (Vin de Pays du Comté Tolosan),,,,
"Round and forward, it discloses aromas of mature red berry, plum cake and a whiff of Mediterranean herbs and meat juices. The palate offers ripe—almost sugary—wild cherry, vanilla extract, mint and thyme. It's soft, ripe and ready to enjoy soon.",89,Castelli Martinozzi 2009  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"The vineyard for this 100% Grenache is certified sustainable, organic and Biodynamic. Bright and light in strawberry and mint, the wine has a strong herbal component intertwined with tartness and tingling acidity.",90,Ampelos 2010 Delta The Difference Grenache (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Slightly earthy, savory tones of lanolin and herb lend complexity to a palate that's lavish with peach and quince jelly flavors. Semi-sweet in style, it's quaffable and refreshing with its fruity exuberance offset by a cutting, stark acidity.",90,Fritz Haag 2012 Brauneberger Juffer Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"This concentrated Cabernet offers aromas of cured meat, dried fruit and rosemary. Barbecue spice and teriyaki sauce flavors give the wine a bold, chewy feel.",86,Feudi del Pisciotto 2010 Missoni Cabernet Sauvignon (Sicilia),,,,
"Here is an outstanding stainless-fermented Chardonnay, thick and fruity. It's totally loaded with ripe apple and pear-pastry goodness, and the flavors dive deep into a thoroughly delicious, textural finish.",92,Amalie Robert 2013 Her Silhouette Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),,,,
"With a high proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine has both structured and superbly rich fruit. The tannins are firm, but show a sweet, enticing edge to them, giving a full body and classic, fresh black currant acidity. An impressive wine, which definitely needs to age—five years or more.",93,Château Sociando-Mallet 2006  Haut-Médoc,,,,
"Dense and extracted, this opens with aromas that recall resin, prune, nutmeg and oak. On the palate, licorice, toast, espresso and tobacco accent black cherry extract. Firm but not overly persistent tannins offer support.",88,Battaglio 2012  Barbaresco,,,,
"This ripe offering smells of corn, baked apple and oak. It's creamy and woody in the mouth, with modest acidity. Flavors of creamed corn, caramel and soft melon finish plump, with a baked quality. It lacks vivacity.",85,El Enemigo 2013 Chardonnay (Mendoza),,,,
"This is a huge wine—almost too much so—with superripe tannins and fruit. It tastes concentrated, its black fruit sweet and rounded. A pepper note comes from the alcohol and gives it a bitter edge.",85,Monte Branco 2009 Alento Reserva Red (Alentejano),,,,
"This is a dense and heady blend, made from 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and 17% Petite Sirah. Black-currant leaf, black plum and boysenberry notes lead the nose and mouth, with a light dusting of cocoa, baking spice and sweet oak adding depth to the palate. Medium weight, with a texture like crushed velvet and a bold, flavorful finish. Drink now–2018.",91,1848 Winery 2009 Special Reserve Red (Galilee),,,,
"This young vintage is outside the usual Grande Année range of vintages. Bollinger sees the unique heat of 2003 as a reason to make a special vintage for release early. The wine is rich, but being Bollinger, the richness has translated into the full character of the house style. It is relatively dry, packed with white fruits. Not for aging. Drink now.",92,Bollinger 2003 2003 by Bollinger Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"92-94 This is rounded, ripe, a densely tannic mineral wine, very intense. It is tense, structured, firm, promising long aging.",93,Les Astéries 2010 Barrel sample  (Saint-Émilion),,,,
This is an unfocused wine that has jammy fruit and soft tannins. It tastes overripe. Not for aging.,81,Château de Lavagnac 2011  Bordeaux,,,,
"This is a perfumed wine that is soft, full of red cherry fruit and gentle tannins. It does have a dry core that gives the wine shape and there is plenty of juicy fruitiness at the end. The wine is made for the Hospices, a charity in Lyon.",87,Collin-Bourisset 2014 Domaine des Hospices Civils de Lyon  (Beaujolais-Villages),,,,
"Oak, menthol, mature berry, dried sage and coffee aromas lead the nose. The palate offers black cherry, crushed raspberry, black pepper, licorice, espresso and a balsamic note alongside bracing, teeth-coating tannins.",88,Amalia 2009  Barolo,,,,
"A dry, soft and exceptionally pure Zinfandel. With a light, silky texture, it offers plenty of jammy raspberry, cherry, currant, cola, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors.",87,Alexander Valley Vineyards 2006 Redemption Zin Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,

"Still young with attractive fresh fruits, this wine needs to age. With its bright acidity and white fruits, it's just beginning to hint at the mineral structure behind. Drink from 2018.",89,Domaine Ellevin 2013 Vaucoupin Premier Cru  (Chablis),,,,
"A brilliant Chardonnay, bone dry and crisp in acidity. Almost lean in citrus and mineral flavors, but on further inspection shows complex layers of toast, honeysuckle, peach and stone, with a deft touch of new oak. Feels weighty and important, and finishes wonderfully dry.",94,Talley 2009 Rosemary's Vineyard Chardonnay (Arroyo Grande Valley),,,,
"A slightly darker shade of yellow, this wine from a historic vineyard offers preserved lemon, toasted almond and a doughy character on the nose. It's very tactile on the palate, clinging to the tongue strongly, showing flavors of stone fruit, mandarin pith and underripe tangerine juice.",89,Testarossa 2015 Sierra Madre Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"A fine, brisk Chardonnay, marked by acidity and minerals and a certain elusiveness. But at its core are amazingly ripe tropical fruit, honey and vanilla flavors, with additional richness from oak. Good price for a Carneros Chard of this elegance and complexity.",90,Saintsbury 2011 Chardonnay (Carneros),,,,
"From vines aged between 40 and 80 years, this is a lightly wood-aged wine, with yellow fruits that go with the spicy toast. Full, ripe, and nicely cut with acidity, it has a creamy, smooth texture. Drink now.",91,Château Vitallis 2014 Vieilles Vignes  (Pouilly-Fuissé),,,,
"Aromas of blackberry, spicy plum, grilled herb, Mediterranean scrub and a whiff of pencil shavings lead the nose on this polished wine. The savory palate offers juicy plum, black cherry, clove and white pepper alongside supple, buffed tannins that generate a smooth mouth texture. Drink through 2017.",90,Podere San Cristoforo 2012 Petit Verdot (Toscana),,,,
"Austere, tight and sophisticated, this well-extracted Brunello shows dry aromas of crushed granite along with ethereal tones of dried ginger, black licorice and root beer. Inky appearance with chewy richness. The mouthfeel is round, chewy and packed with sweet fruit and spice. Drink after 2015.",94,Uccelliera 2007  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"This is a fancy Chardonnay. It impresses for the ripe tropical fruit and citrus flavors that are generously oaked, and for the crisp coastal acidity that provides balance. The overall impression is of pineapple-infused crème brûlée. Drink now.",90,Suacci Carciere Wines 2006 Heintz Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Ripe and accessible, this Klipsun Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc includes 20% Sémillon in the blend. Melon and light citrus flavors abound, with enough acidity to keep it fresh and lively.",88,Page Cellars 2010 Sentimental Blonde Sauvignon Blanc (Red Mountain),,,,
"Decidely savory on the nose, aromas of bacon, brûléed sugar, grilled herb and toast highlight the black fruit core. The palate is meaty and currently locked tight with superfirm, grippy tannins. Bone dry on the finish, this should be enjoyed with a chunk of rare beef to help tame the tannic blow.",88,Veritas 2010 Vintner's Reserve Red (Monticello),,,,
"This blend of 60% Pinot Grigio and 40% Viognier offers sharp green-apple candy, lemongrass, candied lime and yellow lily on the fresh and attention-grabbing nose. Grassy tension on the palate highlights lime blossoms, kiwi and apple skins. The interplay between racy Pinot Grigio and riper Viognier is intriguing.",89,Robert Renzoni 2015 Cantata White (Temecula Valley),,,,
"One of the lesser-known of the many Mâcon appellations, Péronne is close to Clessé. The wine is smooth, ripe and fruity, with a creamed pear and lightly lemon flavor. With a hint of minerality, it could age until 2016.",86,Jaffelin 2013 Les Villages de Jaffelin  (Mâcon-Péronne),,,,
"Light structure and perfumes come from the blending of Syrah with Muscat. It's an intriguing wine, providing spice as well as fresh fruits and acidity. Crisp and fruity at the end.",87,Domaine Terre de Mistral 2013 Mireille Rosé (Mediterranée),,,,

"Fermented in oak, this is the second wine from the estate. It has much of the fine concentration, the richness and the dark chocolate and black-fruit flavors of the first wine, just with a softer hue. It is likely to develop relatively quickly and generously. Drink from 2019.",92,Château Lagrézette 2015 Chevalier du Château Lagrézette Malbec-Merlot (Cahors),,,,
"This opens with intriguing aromas of dried tree fruit, smoke, brimstone and acacia. The palate delivers lemon zest, honey, mineral and toasted almond alongside bright acidity.",91,Mastroberardino 2008 Vintage  (Fiano di Avellino),,,,
"A very nice Pinot Noir, made in a style to drink now. Despite the approachability, it shows elegance and style in the crisp structure that frames cherryskin, cola, anise, clove and pepper flavors.",88,Trinitas 2006 Pinot Noir (Carneros),,,,
"Pretty aromas of blue flower, rose, wild berry and graphite lead the way. The firm palate delivers mature black cherry, raspberry, star anise, black pepper and chopped sage alongside bright acidity and tightly knit tannins that need to unwind. Drink 2018–2026.",91,Marchesi di Barolo 2011 Coste di Rose  (Barolo),,,,
"This is a touch mealy on the nose, with ripe stone-fruit and melon aromas. A juicy, direct palate follows, with citrus and green-fruit flavors that finish quick and clean.",84,Zagarrón 2013 Hacienda Zargón Sauvignon Blanc (La Mancha),,,,
"Podere Canalino makes just over 200 cases of Brunello and offers a rustic, but genuine interpretation of the wine. There are dark, vinous aromas of black currants and red apple backed by old spice and pipe tobacco. It's slightly tart and bitter in the mouth and the tannins need a few more years to soften.",86,Podere Canalino 2004  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Light, tropical aromas are mellow and reflect the 15% Riesling that helps out the wine's core of Torrontés. A tangy mouthfeel is citrusy and fresh, while flavors of lime, lychee and tangerine finish lively, clean and not bitter.",87,Amalaya 2012 Torrontés-Riesling White (Calchaquí Valley),,,,
"This medium-bodied, nicely firm and approachable red shows cherry, cassis, tobacco and black olive along a juicy core of grippy texture.",88,Raymond 2013 District Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Calistoga),,,,
"This wine is still tight and crisp. It has plenty of acidity as well as a strongly mineral texture. Taut and tense, the wine needs to develop to bring out the perfumed fruit of the vintage. Drink from 2020.",92,Henri de Villamont 2014 Morgeot Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet),,,,

"Lime peels and lemon pith mix it up with rain on cement, lemongrass, kaffir lime leaf, ocean-spray saltiness and a lemon-pepper spice on the nose of this wine from the appellation's first vineyard. The palate is reminiscent of a perfectly restrained margarita, with the warmth of sea salt, the pungency of squeezed caviar limes and the body of lemon curds, topped with a sprig of mint.",95,Sandhi 2013 Sanford & Benedict Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"This cool climate region is well-suited to this grape, producing aromatic, elegant wines such as this without the over-the-top perfume that can drive consumers away. Subtle aromas suggest light talc, acacia and calla lily, while in the mouth this is soft and smooth. Overall it's just plain pretty, with details of apple and apple skin.",90,Phelps Creek 2015 Gorge Crest Gewürztraminer (Columbia Gorge (OR)),,,,
"Full, rich and fruity, this is a ripe wine. It is finely poised between this richness and a more delicate, fruity character, lively and bright. Age for a few months, although you can drink the wine now.",88,Château Coussin 2012 Rosé (Côtes de Provence Sainte-Victoire),,,,
"Crisp, cutting pineapple and lemon acidity lends raciness this otherwise sunny kabinett full of sweet honeydew, apricot and peach flavors. It's a sprightly, briskly balanced wine with an easy-drinking, approachable feel. Drink now through 2020 to enjoy its freshness.",89,August Kesseler 2015 R Kabinett Riesling (Pfalz),,,,
"This is a simple wine, with orange, lime and vanilla flavors. Despite brisk acidity, it quickly turns cloying.",84,Cameron Hughes 2010 Lot 314 Chardonnay (Atlas Peak),,,,
"Soft ripe raisiny aromas are slightly baked and toasty. A saturated firm palate shows proper balance, while flavors of prune, blackberry, chocolate and spicy oak finish strong and tannic, but not hard. Drink through 2018.",90,Valserrano 2011 Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"Fleshy, ripe notes of yellow pear lead to a yeasty palate that fizzes with citric lift. Lively and fresh, light-footed, concentrated and energetic, this is a sip of Austrian life. The extra dollop of fresh acidity brightens the entire wine and makes for very appetizing, spicy drinking with a zesty finish.",91,Aigner 2014 Privat Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),,,,
"Dark red-violet in the glass, this blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Grenache has a nose of black cherry, green pepper and cocoa. It may be a little too cool for some tastes, but bright fruit and slightly luxurious tannins make up for the fennel and eucalyptus flavors that are joined on the palate by cherry, pomegranate and orange zest. The smooth finish goes completely cool for a second but winds up in a burst of bright fruit.",89,Ouled Thaleb 2013 Red (Zenata),,,,
"A fruity blend of Pinot Noir and Pinot Blanc, this is soft, creamy and balanced with acidity. The relatively high dosage gives the wine a gentle aftertaste. Drink now.",86,Gyéjacquot Frères NV Collection Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"This mix of 62% Pepper Bridge Vineyard Syrah and 38% Klipsun Vineyard Malbec has not entirely come together. The grapey fruit flavors and slightly stemmy tannins may ultimately complement each other, but that will require more bottle age. For the moment, give it a good decanting, or wait a couple more years before opening.",86,Flying Trout 2010 Cutthroat Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This is a good Pinot Noir, although it's a bit off here and there. Dry, crisp and silky, it offers pleasant cherry and cola flavors. But there's just a touch of unripeness that compromises it.",86,Maggy Hawk 2009 Jolie Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),,,,
"This ripe Chardonnay is smooth, showing a subtle use of wood and good acidity to balance. Creamed apple and white peach are given brightness by the acidity. The wine is ready to drink.",88,Château de Santenay 2015  Mercurey,,,,
"Delicately scented, this offers aromas of honeysuckle, citrus blossom and pear while the round, juicy palate doles out white peach, mature apple and Mediterranean herb. A hint of almond closes the clean, lingering finish.",89,Villa Raiano 2015  Falanghina del Beneventano,,,,
"Starts off with a big blast of black-cherry and blackberry fruit that continues on the palate, picking up leather and vanilla nuances. It's full and flavorful, soft without being flabby—just what the doctor ordered for everyday drinking.",88,Element 2001 Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (Western Australia),,,,
"Toasted herbs, pressed violets, cola and a touch of tar frame the nose on this wine from pioneer Pierre Lafond and winemaker Bruce McGuire. The palate offers purple-flower candy flavors, with light elderberry juice and a lifting clove-meets-mint character.",89,Lafond 2012 SRH Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"This opens with a beautiful fragrance of rose, violet, red berry, new leather, turned earth and balsamic notes. The palate delivers Morello cherry, red raspberry, espresso and mint alongside astringent tannins that still need to integrate.",90,Sarotto 2009 Currà Riserva  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Edging towards minerality, this is a textured wine, its acidity penetrating right through. This intense, crisp character is complimented by the balanced fruit with its ripe apricot and kiwi flavors. Age for 2–3 years. Screwcap.",92,Bründlmayer 2010 Berg Vogelsang Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),,,,
"Very rich and fruity, yet it tastes pretty sweet. If you enjoy a candied blackberry flavor, this could be for you.",85,V. Sattui 2008 Paradiso Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Charming aromas of tobacco leaf and strawberries promise good things to come but the palate does not follow through. While some boysenberry flavors appeal, the wine is thin in the mouth. The tannins are a bit overly gripping now but the wine does not have the fruit ripeness or concentration to benefit from cellaring.",80,Catharine Valley 2005 Reserve Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This is the fifth vintage for this rare Washington version of Petite Sirah. It is almost jet black in the center, purple at the rim, tight and tannic with plenty of acid sculpting the earthy, black cherry fruit. Loaded into the finish are layers of earth, iodine, tar and licorice; it's very well made and retains just enough roughness to satisfy lovers of this often rustic grape.",88,Thurston Wolfe 2006 Zephyr Ridge Petite Sirah (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"Minty oak aromas are the greeting on this herbal and foxy Malbec that feels crisp and chippy due to high acidity and grating tannins. Flavors of herbal berry and plum are oaky and a touch hot, while rubbery tannins and herbal berry leftovers drive the finish.",87,Casarena 2014 Estate Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),,,,
"90–92. Barrel sample. This ripe and spicy wine is full of rich fruits. The palate is full bodied and dense, but edged with a fine texture. It finishes warm and opulent.",91,Château Carbonnieux 2012 Barrel Sample  (Pessac-Léognan),,,,
"This wine comes from a single vineyard in the heart of the appellation. It is soft, just hinting at the lime acidity while focused on ripe yellow and green-plum fruits. This wine can develop further and will be at its best from 2017.",88,Cave de Lugny 2013 La Carte  (Mâcon-Lugny),,,,
"Dusty and tannic, this is a solid value for its quality—a wine of freshness and grip that offers complexity and approachability in equal measure. Black-cherry and black -pepper flavors highlight the palate.",92,Raymond 2014 Reserve Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Made entirely with the native grape Negroamaro, this opens with intriguing aromas of Mediterranean scrub, dill and red berry. The vibrant palate shows sour cherry, strawberry, tangerine and dried herb alongside crisp acidity that lends a refreshing finish.",88,Claudio Quarta 2016 Negroamaro Rosato (Salento),,,,
"This balanced, fruity wine has gentle tannins and juicy red fruit flavors. It's fresh with acidity and a floral character that makes it already drinkable.",84,Château Coutinel 2011 Red (Fronton),,,,
"This is three fifths Merlot, the rest spread among the other four Bordeaux grapes. It's very well crafted, showing a bit of herb along with berries and spice. What most impresses is the overall structure, and the impression of ageworthy muscle in the finish.",91,William Church 2010 Sur La Mer Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Named for a barrel that once rolled off a cliff, this forward fruity wine blends numerous sources to craft an easy-drinking, no-frills style. Think a strawberry lollipop in a glass, and you're on the right track. That's not to say it lacks concentration, but its strength is the pretty fruit.",88,Brooks 2015 Runaway Red Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Round and juicy, this offers enticing scents of white flower, mature apple, citrus and pear that carry over to the palate along with honeydew melon and a hint of aromatic herb. Fresh acidity balances the ripe fruit flavors.",88,Donnafugata 2015 Anthilia White (Sicilia),,,,
"There's lots of fresh, green, crunchy fruit and berry flavor in this dry young wine. In this cool vintage, the wine shows zesty flavors of gooseberries, spiced melons and limes, with a touch of feline essence.",86,Greenwood Ridge 2006 Pinot Gris (Anderson Valley),,,,
"Great bursts of red fruits come strongly through the tannins of this powerful and structured wine. It's fruity and ripe, although an herbal element suggests a more green aspect. Tannins need to finish softening, so wait until 2015.",86,Adega Cooperativa do Cartaxo 2011 Bridão Clássico Red (Tejo),,,,
"Hard-spice aromas rest on top of cherry and briar aromas. Fresh and snappy on the palate, this medium-bodied Rioja delivers fully oaked flavors of vanilla and butter along with strawberry and raspberry fruit. A distinct buttery flavor rides high on the finish.",87,Aspaldi 2013  Rioja,,,,
"A wonderful wine at a great price. This is complex and delicious in blackberry and black currant flavors, with a savory minerality on the finish. As it starts off with tough tannins, allow it to decant.",92,Matanzas Creek 2009 Merlot (Bennett Valley),,,,
"A soft, almost sweet version of a typically more crisp varietal, this is fruity, smooth in texture and uncomplicated. It has fresh citrus and apple flavors.",86,Kendall-Jackson 2014 Vintner's Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (California),,,,
"Definitely not Zinfandel-like, despite its Primitivo origins; a rather nondescript wine, as a matter of fact. Light cherry overtones are noted on the nose and palate. The tannins are mouth-drying. This is certainly not a good example of how far Puglia has come with this grape. However, it would work fine with a slice or two of pizza.",83,Terrale 1998 Primitivo (Puglia),,,,
"V. Sattui tries their hand at Grenache, with good results. The wine shows the variety's famed cherry flavors, intense and jammy, along with a good amount of caramelized oak. The winemaker wisely added a bit of Syrah and Petite Sirah, which add body and weight. Ready to drink now.",88,V. Sattui 2011 Grenache (Napa Valley),,,,
"Made with Teroldego from three different vineyards, this offers aromas of truffle, leather, scorched soil, black plum and a whiff of game. Aged and fermented in wood, the savory palate offers ripe blackberry, spiced blueberry, earthy notes of Mediterranean herbs and dark cooking spice. Firm but fine-grained tannins provide support. Drink 2016–2026.",92,Foradori 2011 Granato Teroldego (Vigneti delle Dolomiti),,,,
"Made using a custom crush facility based in Santa Barbara County, this Napa Valley Cabernet is dry and jammy-sweet in cherry and blackberry. The finish is sharp, and the wine isn't age worthy.",84,Prominence 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),,,,
"This full-bodied wine combines spicy aromas with deep fruit flavors like plum and blackberry. The fresh, juicy texture has just enough tannin to make it appetizing. The wine has enough heft to pair well with a lot of savory and meaty dishes.",89,Kendall-Jackson 2013 Vintner's Reserve Zinfandel (Mendocino),,,,
"Soft and creamy, this floral wine also has an attractive touch of toastiness suggesting it has bottle age. Its green-plum and citrus flavors contribute to the crispness of this balanced wine. Drink now.",88,Vollereaux NV Brut Réserve  (Champagne),,,,
"This Riesling specialist strikes a unique chord, with precise yet individualistic wines. Crisp, tart, tongue-tickling flavors of green apple, grapefruit and orange peel are among the penetrating highlights. Concentrated and high in acid, this rocks on through a long finish.",91,Tantalus Vineyards 2012 Riesling (Okanagan Valley),,,,
"This full-bodied wine has a big impact on the palate due to smoky, meaty flavors, very firm tannins and an overall huge personality. It starts with aromas of charcoal and charred oak, goes to ripe, rich but not sweet fruit flavors, and finishes with all that grip as well as lingering smoky nuances.",92,Aratás 2011 Shake Ridge Ranch Petite Sirah (Amador County),,,,
"Tart cran-apple fruit—some of it from 35-year-old vines—is at the heart of this vineyard-designated cuvée. It has a woody/earthy undertone, tart acids and some stiffening tannins.",87,Spindrift Cellars 2013 OSU Woodhall III Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Plum and cherry aromas are riper than might be expected for a cool-vintage 2013 crianza. Chewy, drawing tannins lend grip to the palate that tastes of black plum, tea and dry spices. A bit of oaky chocolate is present on the finish.",89,Marqués de Cáceres 2013 Crianza  (Rioja),,,,
"The beautiful perfume that unites tangerine peel and apple, lemon and blossom makes for an inviting nose. The palate brims with the same generous and utterly fruit-driven flavors. This is Riesling at its most charming. The finish is off dry, but all the more fruit driven for that.",91,Joseph Fritsch 2015 Schlossberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"Green apple, flint and apricot are some of the aromas of this elegant, medium-bodied white. The smooth palate offers layers of juicy white peach, Mediterranean herb and mineral alongside refreshing acidity.",89,Decugnano dei Barbi 2013 Il Bianco  (Orvieto Classico),,,,
"Pale lemony color. Classic Mosel nose of stone, slate, white peach and flower blossoms. Vibrant and crisp, balancing the sweetness on the palate and resulting in a wine with a juicy texture and moderate intensity, turning racy on the finish. Not overly complex, but refined.",89,Nollen 2008 Notorious Rooster Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"White spring flower, citrus and a whiff of tomato leaf lead the nose. Bright and linear, the palate offers juicy white grapefruit, pineapple and a hint of mineral alongside tangy acidity.",90,Andriano 2015 Floreado Sauvignon (Alto Adige),,,,
"The nose is rather closed but this bursts into life in the mouth with lip-smacking citrus freshness and notions of tart stone fruit along a linear, driven palate. Whistle-clean and just a little bracing, this is a textbook Riesling from the fresh 2014 vintage. It's light-bodied but shows lots of verve.",90,Unger 2014 Stein-Terrassen Riesling (Kremstal),,,,
"Not exactly worth 100 points as the label implies, but this wine is ripe and full flavored, smooth on the palate and almost soft in texture. It is medium bodied and very drinkable.",86,Greenwood Ridge 2012 HundredPoint Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino Ridge),,,,
"Faintly nutty notes of toasted grain accent this wine's otherwise straightforward pineapple fruit. It's medium in body, with a fine line of crisp acidity running through it from start to finish. Drink now.",85,Kalbarri 2010 Bin Select 462 Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia),,,,
"At just 12.5% alcohol, this comes across as dry and quite fresh, with vivid grapefruit flesh and acidity. Some mint and lemon flavors sneak in also. The emphasis is clearly on citrus rather than peach or apricot; a fine food wine.",88,Milbrandt 2009 Traditions Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"For a basic Chardonnay, this fits the bill. Citrus and peach aromas are standard and clean. The palate is tight and juicy, with no overt oak feel. Flavors of melon and pear have light spice and vanilla accents, while the finish is crisp.",85,Finca El Origen 2012 Reserva Chardonnay (Mendoza),,,,
"Rooty aromas of baking spices and black fruits are restrained and delicate on the nose. This is full, round and mildly tannic, with baked plum, berry, spice and peppery flavors. Toast, nutmeg and bright acidity carry the finish on this blend of 71% Carmenère, with additions of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Drink through 2017.",91,Estampa 2012 Gold Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"This pretty Riserva Nebbiolo will surely grow softer and finer with age. Those who drink it now will experience smoky, toasted aromas of almond, cigar box, moist earth and powdered licorice. The wine is also elegantly tight and focused in the mouth.",89,Prinsi 2006 Fausone Riserva  (Barbaresco),,,,
"This Bulgarian Pinot Noir offers the nose black and red cherries and dried violets. It is well balanced in the mouth with soft, rounded tannins and flavors of dark cherry, cranberry and dried Mediterranean herbs.",90,Castra Rubra 2013 Nimbus Premium Pinot Noir (Thracian Valley),,,,
"Dusty mineral and dried herb notes lend a savory tone to this elegant semisweet Riesling. The palate is intensely fruity, with ripe nectarine and tangerine flavors. It finishes moderately long, with a wet-stone minerality.",89,Bischöfliche Weingüter Trier 2012 Ayler  Kupp Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"At five years old, this shows green pepper, dark fruit, tar and barrel spice scents followed by restrained fruit and barrel flavors. Its jalapeño-like notes are distracting.",86,Kestrel 2012 Winemaker's Select Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Pink fruited and light, with an attractive herbal character. The crisp acidity cuts right through the rich mouthfeel.Bright and lively, the finish has a grapefruit note that lends lift.",90,Château de l'Escarelle 2011 Les Belles Bastilles Rosé (Coteaux Varois),,,,
"Winemaker/owner Chuck Mansfield is devoted to California Grenache, offering this gem from the Sierra Foothills' subregion of El Dorado County. Light in color and fresh in taste, its layers of slightly savory rhubarb and strawberry are boosted by firm acidity and an enticing finish of spice. At under $20 this is an exceptional deal for the quality.",89,Four Fields 2011 Grenache (El Dorado),,,,
"Fragrant notes of tangerine and yuzu peel abound on this citrusy dry Riesling. The palate is cutting and fresh, full of juicy white grapefruit and lime flavors. Light bodied yet satisfyingly thirst quenching, it finishes long with invigorating minerality.",90,Von Schleinitz 2015 Apollo Dry Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Juicy and varietal, this inexpensive Sierra Foothills Cab has rich texture and layers of dried cherry and currant. Round and well-composed, the finish veers toward flavors of vanilla and cedar.",87,Sobon Estate 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Amador County),,,,
"Aromas of leather, dark-skinned fruit and Mediterranean brush meld together in the glass. The medium-bodied but dense palate offers prune, raspberry jam and licorice alongside round tannins. A note of bitter almond closes the finish.",87,Alliata 2014 Lorlando Nero d'Avola (Terre Siciliane),,,,
"The low alcohol suggests fruit that was minimally ripened, and the flavors seem closer to fresh greens than ripe fruit. There's a splash of gooseberry, again quite tart, and a leesy texture. Drink chilled with a fresh salad.",85,Château Bianca 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Slightly more earthy pear fruit appears on the nose. The palate bounces with freshness and verve, fizzing with a little white pepper here and there. The core is textured and shows some concentration with real citric force. Lovely on its own, even better with food. Simply lovely.",91,Wieninger 2015 Wiener Grüner Veltliner (Vienna),,,,
"This is old vine Lemberger, one of the first red grapes to be widely planted in eastern Washington. It comes from a 1979 planting at the Red Willow vineyard. Raspberry and cherry fruit flavors dominate, pretty and pure, but lacking in depth. Some Lemberger can approach the style of Dry Creek Zinfandel; this is more of a simple red quaffer.",85,Kana 2007 Old Vines Red Red (Yakima Valley),,,,
"A big blanket of oaky, chocolaty, minty aromas sits on top of herbal plum and cassis scents. No surprise that this is a big wine with loud plum, blackberry and spice flavors, but it's also a bit awkward in feel. On the finish, this spreads apart at the seams, leaving no cushion for scorching acidity and hard tannins. Drink through 2021.",90,Agustinos 2013 Escorial Limited Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),,,,
"This is roughly one-third each of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, and their individual contributions work harmoniously to craft a dark, meaty wine with cassis, licorice, smoke and espresso flavors. Suggestions of black tea and black coffee continue the thread, until the fruit trails off and the finish fades, a bit shorter than expected.",89,Goose Ridge 2009 Vireo Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A new effort from DDO, this drops Domaine Drouhin from the name, and puts the vineyard name front and center. It's young and well-crafted, with strawberry and cherry fruit. The potential is evident for an impressive site once the vines get some age under them.",88,Drouhin Oregon Roserock 2014 Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
"At nearly six years of age, this Zin is fully ready to drink. It's dropped its hard tannins and is now soft and supple, offering rich flavors of blackberries, cherries, cola, figs, cedar and pepper. Purists will find it overly sweet.",85,Summit Lake 2003 Estate Zinfandel (Howell Mountain),,,,
"Briny apple aromas are crisp and focused, with side notes of pickle juice and matchstick. A round but firm palate is in fine shape, while this tastes savory, dry and sophisticated, with notes of sea brine, melon and green apple. A touch of salt graces a pure finish. This certified organic bottling dwells at the high end of the Cava spectrum.",91,Alta Alella 2011 Privat Mirgin Brut Nature Gran Reserva Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"Stalky aromas suggest peach, but overall there's hardly any fruit on the nose of this tired wine. A fat palate is low on acidity, while bland citrus, melon and papaya flavors finish in no man's land.",82,L.A. Cetto 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Valle de Guadalupe),,,,
"Compared to the last vintage, which was riper and chewier, this offers a streamlined and focused mouthfeel, with notes of berry fruit and dark spice. Lean and bright, it closes with a thorny, bramble-like flavor.",88,Le Bertarole 2008 Podere Cariano  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),,,,
"Clean, fresh, basic white-fruit aromas are stony. This is lemony, lean and crisp in feel. Flavors of briny citrus turn salty on a finish that tastes of fresh green herbs and scallion.",87,12 Linajes 2016 Verdejo (Rueda),,,,
"The Mourvèdre in this blend gives this wine a distinctive perfumed, structured character. Soft and rich yellow and tropical-fruit flavors are spiced with the edge of tannins and youthful red-fruit flavors. It is intensely ripe and also crisp with acidity. Drink from late 2016.",92,Domaines Ott 2015 Château Romassan Rosé (Bandol),,,,
"This is a wonderful, dense wine, very concentrated, very intensely flavored. At this stage of its development, it is the opulence which is most evident, but there are already hints that it will show pure fruit alongside sweet tannins, and will develop complexity.",94,Château la Fleur-Pétrus 2000  Pomerol,,,,
"Here's a Chardonnay-based sparkler from Piedmont that opens with bright tones of lemon and sweet grapefruit followed by yeasty tones of freshly baked bread. There's some bitter almond as well, which adds tartness to the finish.",87,Borgo Maragliano NV Brut Chardonnay (Piedmont),,,,
"Citrus, mango and animal cracker aromas are mild and easy to like. The palate on this white blend (led by 50% Verdejo) offers melon, apple, mango and a hint of spice, while the finish is clean, smooth and just racy enough. Drink now for max freshness.",87,Naia 2011 Las Brisas White (Rueda),,,,
"Rooty, spicy aromas of black plum are more complex than those of your average Malbec. In the mouth, this shows a heavy, almost reduced mouthfeel that could use more spring. Dark, heavily toasted baked-plum flavors finish peppery and brooding, but without much texture or presence. Drink soon.",88,Maal 2013 Biolento Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Fresh, friendly green pear notes glide all the way from nose to palate and make for easy, inviting summer drinking. The clean finish smacks of lemon. Drink soon.",87,Lenz Moser 2015 Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),,,,
"Packed with red fruits, this is a bright wine. It has fine tannins due to aging half in French oak and half in stainless steel to give a balance to a wine that is crisp and fresh. Drink from 2018.",88,Château du Seuil 2014 Domaine du Seuil  (Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux),,,,
"Extremely ripe and tropical aromas of tuberose, jasmine and apple blossoms prove quite overpowering on the nose of this wine. The palate shows lots of apple juice flavors and trends toward banana and pineapple tropicality.",85,Edna Valley Vineyard 2014 Fleur de Edna Winemaker Series Chardonnay (Edna Valley),,,,
"From a p of Sonoma Mountain exposed to the Petaluma Gap, this wine is spicy in cinnamon and cola, its oak profile reduced and intense. Roses and cherries provide the floral and the fruit around deeper, darker tendencies into Asian spice and black tea. Drink now through 2021.",91,Bailiwick 2013 Silver Pines Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain),,,,
"A smooth and soft wine, this offers gentle red-cherry flavors. The acidity and edge of firm tannins give this attractive wine its shape. It will be ready to drink from 2018.",87,Vignerons de Bel Air 2016  Brouilly,,,,
"This wine is fresh, crisp and still young. Crisp acidity dominates the strongly citrus character and gives a tight aftertaste of lime and pink grapefruit. This 100% Sauvignon Blanc was aged on the lees for six months to enhance aroma. Wait to drink until early 2016.",87,Dourthe 2014 La Grande Cuvée  (Bordeaux Blanc),,,,
"Although this cuvée is 100% Syrah, it's remarkably well behaved, without any reductive or animale scents. Instead, it delivers ripe cherry and vanilla aromas, some creaminess on the palate and a long, elegant finish that ends savory not sweet. Drink now–2016.",90,Michel Gassier 2009 Les Piliers Syrah (Costières de Nîmes),,,,
"This wine seems broad across the palate, but not quite as deep as some Condrieus. The fruit is understated, resembling gently toasted marshmallow and maybe a touch of baked pineapple, rather than flamboyant apricot and spice. Plan on serving it with fish or chicken rather than something rich or extravagant.",90,Jean-Luc Colombo 2013 Amour de Dieu  (Condrieu),,,,
"Blue-fruit and spice aromas are vibrant and expressive. The palate is plush and flavorful with a supple feel, while the oak seems dialed back and the balance spot on.",89,Lone Birch 2013 Syrah (Yakima Valley),,,,
"This has mild, one-dimensional scents of apple and Meyer lemon. The medium-bodied palate has fresh acidity, and shows a touch more depth than the nose with the added note of glazed white apricot.",86,Veramar 2011 Estate Club Reserva Chardonnay (Virginia),,,,
"The producer's first release from this vineyard site, and 100% varietal, this is a sultry wine, generously aromatic in cinnamon and clove. Spicy, soft and elegant, it also offers cassis and currant, finishing in earthy waves that end lean.",92,Davies 2012 Winfield Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Calistoga),,,,
"Aged in a combination of French, American and Hungarian oak for 14 months, Hazlitt's Cabernet balances ripe, rich blackberry flavor with toasty hints of graham cracker and soft velvety tannins that coat the palate. Crisp yet concentrated, it finishes long with soft notes of dried herbs.",89,Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Aromas of dark-skinned fruit, underbrush, mocha, spice and a balsamic note lead the nose on this structured Dolcetto. The full-bodied palate doles out mature blackberry, dried black cherry, licorice and ground pepper alongside chewy tannins. A note of bitter almond signals the close.",91,Pecchenino 2012 Bricco Botti  (Dogliani Superiore),,,,
"Aromas of herb, citrus and mineral are followed by tart, racy citrus flavors. It provides a lot of appeal.",88,Ambassador Vineyard 2015 Boushey Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Fragrant wine, ripely perfumed, its tannins bringing out red berry fruits and a shapely structure. It also has a fresh feel to it from the intense acidity at the end. Age for a year, but drink now.",86,Domaines Devillard 2011 Le Renard  (Givry),,,,
"Another dry, ageable Pinot from this fine winery. The light, silky texture and brisk acidity make it feel especially stimulating and easy. There's tremendous weight to the red fruits and currants. Give it 6–8 years in a good cellar.",92,Benovia 2010 Bella Una Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Good concentration, which gives the fruit more plum and black cherry than red raspberry. It's deep and sinuous, with threads of graphite and smoke, but the fruit is the star here, and the wine has the concentration and acidity to cellar well for a decade or more.",92,Erath 2008 Fuqua Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),,,,
"A blend of Sangiovese, Sagrantino, Merlot and Cabernet, this offers aromas of cherry-berry and dessert spices that carry over to the palate, along with a licorice note. It's ripe and round but also a bit tired, with a drying, tannic finish.",86,Cantina Novelli 2009  Montefalco Rosso,,,,
"Firm and solid, this is a wine marked by blackberries, solid and dense tannins. The concentration will bring all the elements together to give an important wine, while never losing the 2008 acidity.",93,Bouchard Père & Fils 2008 Les Porrets St.-Georges Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),,,,
"This Barbera d'Alba from the 2006 vintage exhibits a slightly brownish, aged color with aromas of candied fruit, dried plums and prunes. There are gritty, thick tannins with flavors of smoked ham or beef jerky on the close.",86,Pertinace 2006  Barbera d'Alba,,,,
"Firm and stalky, this wine has intense black currant fruitiness. A dry tannic core is balanced by the fresh fruits and acidity. It's almost too fruity at the moment and needs to soften, so wait until 2016.",88,Château La Mothe du Barry 2012  Bordeaux Supérieur,,,,
"From one of the top Beaune premier crus, this wine is structured and dense with tannins and with wood aging. At the same time, it has the rich fruitiness of the year, broad red berries and plums. They provide the delicious potential of this fine wine. Drink from 2022.",93,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2015 Les Grèves Premier Cru  (Beaune),,,,
"This is a rich, full-bodied wine that is ready to drink now. It still has a dry core of tannins, although they are overwhelmed by the rich, juicy black fruits and generous texture. It's a concentrated wine, high in alcohol, although that is really balanced by the fresh aftertaste.",91,Terras de Alter 2013 Terra d'Alter Aragonês (Alentejano),,,,
"Lighter in style, this offers notes of brambly blackberries, whole green pepper and dark coffee, with tart acids and dry, gritty tannins.",86,3 Horse Ranch Vineyards 2011 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,,,,
"Sierra Cantabria's wines are usually so good that one that's simple, tasty and regular such as this might get overlooked. But if you want an honest crianza with touches of balsam wood, bacon and rubber as well as dry plum and cherry fruit, this is it. Finishes peppery, with full tannins and oak-driven mocha flavor.",87,Sierra Cantabria 2005 Crianza  (Rioja),,,,
"A deliciously savory wine, brisk in lip-smacking acidity, with the strong, pure flavors of limes, Meyer lemons and kiwi fruits that mark this cool climate region of San Luis Obispo County. Pretty much as good as Edna Valley Chardonnay gets. Drink now.",90,Talley 2008 Oliver's Vineyard Chardonnay (Edna Valley),,,,
"The delicate nose on this reserve Chard offers citrus and flowers with a touch of nutty spice. On the palate, it's a straightforward white with elements of lemon citrus, grapefruit and hazelnut. An easy-drinking Chardonnay with class.",86,Lamoreaux Landing 2007 Estate Bottled Reserve Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This is a ripe, wood aged wine that has great structure as well as ample fruit flavor. It has a touch of toastiness—50% is aged in oak—although it is sophisticated and subtle. Apple, fresh apricot and green plum flavors show through the still young texture. All native grapes—35% Viosinho, 35% Rabigato and other locals from the estate—are the same used for Port blends. To bring out the richer, more rounded side of this wine, wait until 2017 to enjoy.",91,Quinta de la Rosa 2014 Reserva Branco White (Douro),,,,
"Lots of nice blackberry, cassis, plum and new oak flavors in this dry, tannic Cabernet. It hews to an old-fashioned style, with an earthiness that suggests time in the cellar. Try after 2014.",89,Silver Oak 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Aromas of dish soap and fruit salad show on the nose while the palate brings pink grapefruit and orange. A citric finish with a peppery note lacks acidity, so drink now.",85,Alta Vista 2016 Malbec Rosé (Mendoza),,,,
"For a wine without a reputation for aging, this is surprisingly good. It's very lush and honeyed, with a viscous texture and a long, sweet finish. Try it with desserts rather than as an apéritif.",90,Vignobles La Coterie 2006 Balma Venitia  (Muscat de Beaumes de Venise),,,,
"Chocolate and caramel brace themselves against a crisper note of spearmint in this thick and near-syrupy wine, built with tremendous structure and weight, the finish somewhat puckering in coconut flakes.",87,Hersly 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville),,,,
"A light-colored, delicate wine that is smooth and soft. It has a good balance of red-cherry flavors, with a little bitterness, layered over some gentle tannins. Not for aging, but attractively juicy now.",88,Maison Champy 2008  Savigny-lès-Beaune,,,,
"All stainless, no malolactic and widely available distribution make this a pure-blooded warm weather go-to white wine. It's young and still a bit yeasty, aromatic with scents of seeds and grains. Tightly wound fruit flavors of apple and green melon come with good depth and texture.",89,WillaKenzie Estate 2016 Estate Grown Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),,,,
"A lovely counterpoint to Phelps Creek's estate reserve Chardonnay, this comes from just across the river, sourced from a vineyard on the Washington side of this two-state AVA. It got the full malolactic, fermented in French oak treatment, and shows plenty of pleasing barrel toast and spice. The fruit mixes hints of peach and melon with a lemon drop core, and finishes with a lick of butterscotch.",90,Phelps Creek 2008 Celilo Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Gorge (OR)),,,,
"Vibrant and refreshing, this easygoing red offers aromas and flavors of ripe raspberry, crushed black cherry, ground black pepper, smoke and star anise. Bright acidity and supple tannins lift the savory flavors and give it a silky texture.",89,Contini 2013 Tonaghe  (Cannonau di Sardegna),,,,
"A blend containing the major Bordeaux varieties, this has lots of acidity and tannins, plus flavors of sweet cherries, blackberries and pepper. Drink now with robust fare, like Santa Maria barbecue.",87,Happy Canyon Vineyard 2010 Merlot (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),,,,
"This enjoyable wine's fruity black-skinned berry, violet and baking spice aromas leap out of the glass. The full-bodied palate doles out mouthfuls of juicy black cherry and ripe blackberry flavors alongside polished tannins and fresh acidity. Thanks to succulent fruit and freshness, the alcohol is seamlessly integrated.",90,Marchesi Incisa della Rocchetta 2016 Valmorena  (Barbera d'Asti),,,,
"Closed on the nose at first, this wine reventualy reveals black currant and cassis around wrapped tobacco leaf, the midpalate somewhat dry and puckering in tannin. Concentrated and dense, it finishes in dusty mocha.",88,Cornerstone 2012 Black Label Stepping Stone Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"This special Sauvignon Blanc is only being released in top vintages. The first was the 2010; the 2013 is the second vintage. Fermented in oak, it offers up complex aromas of pencil shavings and grapefruit, followed by hints of toast, cedar, red currants and gooseberries. It's a ripe, weighty style, but it carries those traits without a hitch, gliding seamlessly through a long, silky, mouthwatering finish.",94,Brancott 2013 Chosen Rows Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"Comprised of Sangiovese and 5% Merlot, this offers aromas of plum, blackberry, roasted coffee bean and a whiff of toasted oak. The palate offers dried black cherry, prune, licorice and espresso alongside tightly knit tannins. Drink 2016–2020.",88,Viticcio 2012 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"Tastes as sweet as Lifesaver lemon and pineapple candy, with low acidity.",81,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi 2007 Lightly Oaked Chardonnay (California),,,,
"Aromas of watermelon and a dusting of natural vanilla mark the bouquet. On the palate, it's fleshy but still crisp and focused, with nectarine, red apple and strawberry flavors. The finish lasts, with some sweetness.",87,El Coto 2011 Rosado Rosé (Rioja),,,,
"A handful of Cabernet Franc is included in this wine, which is full-bodied and quite robust, indicative of its mountain birth. While violet and rose florals accent dark cherry tastes, the tannin weight hints at meaty and spicy undertones.",90,Sequoia Grove 2012 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak),,,,
"A worthy followup to the splendid 2008 and 2009 vintages, this 100% Cabernet is a blend of grapes from St. Helena, Rutherford and Oakville. It defines Napa Cabernet with lush, intricate and complex favors of blackberry jam, cassis liqueur, milk chocolate and caramelized oak that finish dry and long. The tannins are refined, but thick. This is a wine for the cellar. Start enjoying it after 2017.",94,Hunnicutt 2010 9-3-5 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Intensely perfumed, this wine shows both strength and great elegance. The raspberry flavors float over a light structure of some dry tannins. The acidity is there, but it is the generosity of the fruit that is most obvious, going right through the wine to the sweet, jammy finish.",92,Domaine de la Vougeraie 2005 Les Cras Premier Cru  (Vougeot),,,,
"Produced for the owner of Château Cos d'Estournel in Bordeaux, this wine was wood-aged before undergoing its second fermentation. That gives it a rich, creamy character, attractively oxidative while also having fresh apple and citrus flavors. It's an intense, complex wine that has been bottled ready to drink, marking a very fine launch.",94,Michel Reybier NV Brut Premier Cru  (Champagne),,,,
"This is a wine to watch as it develops slowly. It is all structure, concentrated and solid. Dense tannins vie with the black-currant fruits from the high proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. Drink this wine from 2024.",92,Château Ferrière 2014  Margaux,,,,
"There's an unripe, vegetal note that interferes with the enjoyment of this Pinot Noir. Although the wine is nicely dry, crisp and elegantly structured, with some good raspberry and cherry fruit, that taste of asparagus is hard to get over.",82,August West 2011 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Situated in Eguisheim, the Emile Beyer winery is based in a former inn, hence the name L'Hostellerie. This wine is rich and very spicy, with a good cut of acidity. Yellow fruits are balanced with citrus to give a ripe, full-bodied wine. Drink now.",88,Emile Beyer 2012 L'Hostellerie Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"A blend of Touriga Nacional and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a firm, tannic wine, with juicy fruit and black-currant-like acidity that lends freshness. Wood influence shows subtly through the forward fruitiness. Age this three years or more.",88,Casal do Conde 2011 Reserva Red (Tejo),,,,
Aromas of white flower and peach pulp reinforce this sparkler's overall softness and creaminess.,88,Val d'Oca 2010 Uvaggio Storico Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
"Enormously rich, a powerhouse Syrah packed with ripe red and black currant, cassis, blueberry, chocolate, coffee, cedar and spice flavors. The structure earns the wine extra points, with ultra-refined tannins and crisp acidity. Decadent, and at its best now, in its flashy youth.",93,Lookout Ridge 2005 Marco DiGiulio Syrah (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"This blends Dijon clones 76 and 96, and is partially barrel fermented. The spicy nose sharpens the palate with pine needle aromas, and the flavors follow. It's a precise wine, showing pine and mineral more than fruit.",89,Township 7 2014 Reserve Chardonnay (Okanagan Valley),,,,
"Firm and dense, this wine has solid tannins as well as the potential of ripe black fruits. It has been firmly extracted, although the fruit is there to give the balance. Drink from 2018.",85,Château Franc Couplet 2015  Bordeaux,,,,
"A big oaky can't-miss blast of clove and wood spice is more dominating than secondary berry aromas. This is resiny and full in body, with ample acidity. Oak plays a lead role on the flavor profile, which includes toast, mint and herbal black plum. A peppery toasty finish benefits from moderate juicy acidity. Drink through 2021.",89,Tamaral 2011 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"Taste history in this Rhône varietal made from the oldest vines in Lodi, and one of the few plantings of Cinsault in the state. It is so smooth and polished it could almost be a Pinot Noir. Full-bodied but soft textured, it offers ripe fruit aromas, generous and satisfying fruit flavors and a rich, lingering finish.",90,Michael David 2012 Ancient Vine Cinsault (Lodi),,,,
"Made with 80% Sangiovese, 10% Merlot and 10% Canaiolo, this opens with subtle aromas of blue flower and baking spice. On the fresh palate, teeth-coating tannins support wild cherry and white pepper. Drink through 2016.",88,Nottola 2013  Rosso di Montepulciano,,,,
"Sourced from mature plantings in cool sites, this exemplary Riesling is technically off dry, but retains its apple-fresh snap and tang. The sweet/tart fruit flavors include abundant peaches, nectarines and apples, and the mouthfeel is ripe and full, the finish lingering.",90,Seven Hills 2012 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This tastes sweet and hot, which gives the flavors of blackberry and raisin a Port-like character.",81,Tin Barn 2010 Gilsson Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Tropical, soapy aromas are yeasty and flat. Flavors of lychee and melon have no follow-through and finish mealy.",80,Tres Exilios 2013 Chardonnay (Mendoza),,,,
"The palate is subdued with modest apple and lemon notes, but brisk lemon-lime acidity and a hint of white florals adds some complexity. Dry and full bodied on the palate, it's an easy white to accompany everyday dinners of fish or chicken.",84,Baiting Hollow Farm Vineyard 2010 Horse Rescue Angel Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"The third vintage of this wine is 100% varietal, with the fruit coming from Stone Tree, Cold Creek and Beverly vineyards. Aromas of coffee, vanilla, clove, dark plum and spice lead to concentrated, layered but still elegant fruit flavors.",91,Northstar 2011 Premier Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Milk chocolate and dark plum combine to nice effect in this majority-Merlot, blended with almost 25% Cabernet Sauvignon. Dry, savory and spicy in cinnamon and clove, the wine is substantially dense and thick on the palate.",87,Verse & Chorus 2012 Mat Kearney Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"If there's nothing special to recommend here, there's also nothing awry. Leather and earth join modest tart berry flavors. Finishes dry and tough; it's an austere wine that probably needs food to come alive. —J.C.",83,Campbells 1998 Bobbie Burns Shiraz (Rutherglen),,,,
"This smooth blend of Nero d'Avola and Merlot opens with aromas of dark berry, blue flower and a whiff of Mediterranean scrub. The soft, round palate doles out juicy black cherry, ground pepper and a note of star anise framed in supple tannins.",89,Duca di Salaparuta 2011 Triskelè Red (Sicilia),,,,
"Flat and gaseous smelling, with sulfur and no fruit to speak of. Tastes like bland nectarine and tangerine, and the body and finish are almost flabby. Borderline in terms of its acceptability.",80,TorresManur 2008 Pindal Verdejo-Viura (Rueda),,,,
"Flinty notions of (good) reduction still grace the closed nose and bring memories of Burgundian cellars. The palate has a masterfully light touch. The fruit is tart and red, hinting at red currant and crushed cranberries with a pleasant, inviting tartness that exudes aroma and focuses the palate with its preserving freshness. Yet there are notions of fragrant and ripe raspberries. This is a silky babe in arms, so wait for the wine to unfold fully from 2017 to 2020.",94,Loimer 2013 Anning Pinot Noir (Niederösterreich),,,,
"Cherry and plum aromas are lean and citrusy, while the palate on this high-reaching Garnacha is loud and raw, with punishing tannins. Plum skin, cherry and oaky coconut flavors finish with heat and aggression. This is not easy to drink at this point; give it until 2016–2017 and revisit.",88,Scala Dei 2011 Masdeu Garnacha (Priorat),,,,
"Something different and almost irrestible, this red dessert wine is high in alcohol but still comes off as a table wine in flavor, but with obvious, tasty sweetness. Beyond that the flavors and slight grip of tannins seem like those of a big red wine.",92,Hawk and Horse Vineyards 2011 Latigo Dessert Wine Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills Lake County),,,,
"Straightforward and fresh, this delivers aromas and flavors of black cherry accented with baking spice. Fresh acidity and supple tannins provide an easy-drinking framework.",87,Cecchi 2013 La Mora  (Morellino di Scansano),,,,
"Quite a bit of Tempranillo is being planted in southern Oregon, and it shows considerable promise. The flavors here suggest cherry cobbler, with ripe fruit at the center. There are streaks of citrus and a touch of toast in the mix, with drying tannins.",87,Melrose 2012 Tempranillo (Umpqua Valley),,,,
"For a lighter-bodied Cabernet, this is good for its fresh, clean outlook and mild oak. Cherry and berry aromas set the stage for a juicy wine with mild cherry and raspberry flavors that come before a spunky, quick finish.",86,Altocedro 2011 Año Cero Cabernet Sauvignon (La Consulta),,,,
"Dark plum and black currant fruit meet light licorice spice, violet and cedar aromas on the dense and dark nose of this bottling. The flavors are very wound-up and shy still, with char, loamy earth and floral notes. A core of cassis hides behind a veil of stiff tannins, and acidity pops on the finish.",89,San Simeon 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"Banana, pear and loads of pineapple characterize this fruity Greco that would pair well with most Mediterranean foods. The wine has a light, clean feel and ends with fresh citrus notes. It doesn't have deep dimension, but it is easy-drinking and refreshing. A Marc de Grazia selection, various American importers.",86,Cantina del Taburno 2007 Greco (Campania),,,,
"This is a rich yet soft and perfumed reserve-tier wine. It offers an explosion of dense black fruit, oak and tannin atop a singular foundation of clove and cinnamon-cola spiciness. Full bodied, it's youthful and not quite approachable, finishing in a muddle of cranberry crispness on the finish.",90,Amici 2013 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"96–98. Barrel sample. This powerful, impressive wine is comprised of 90% Cabernet Sauvignon. It's seriously structured, with loads of black currants and dark tannin, and revels on the finish with the juicy, fresh acidity of this vintage. A fine Mouton, this is the first vintage produced in the chateau's new cellar.",97,Château Mouton Rothschild 2012 Barrel Sample  (Pauillac),,,,
"Light cherry and raspberry aromas are subdued but fresh. This blend of 85% Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon has a medium body, while plum and cherry flavors are straightforward. A lightly baked flavor and spice notes help the finish along, as does the jolt of Cabernet.",87,Vicente Gandia 2012 Hoya de Cadenas Reserva Privada Red (Utiel-Requena),,,,
"The nose is initially subdued but eventually reveals inviting aromas of spiced plum, leather, vanilla and a whiff of blue flower. The structured but elegant palate conveys blackberry, dried cherry, mint, savory herb and clove alongside bracing but fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. The lingering finish ends on a licorice note. Drink 2016–2023.",91,Tormaresca 2012 Masseria Maime Negroamaro (Salento),,,,
"The winery has a good track record with Sauvignon Blancs from this vineyard. Now, they've produced a very good Syrah. It's a big, thick, Aussie Shiraz-style wine, with firm tannins housing flavors of blackberries, currants, mocha, sweet oak and black pepper. Dramatic and delicious.",89,Carica 2007 Kick Ranch Syrah (Sonoma County),,,,
"Despite the relatively high alcohol, this comes across as a fairly classic Coonawarra Cabernet. Mint accents chocolate and cassis, and the wine is full bodied yet still seems a bit restrained on the palate. Firm tannins frame the dusty, appropriately drying finish. Drink 2016–2025.",91,Penley Estate 2009 Reserve Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra),,,,
"From a cooler section of the Napa Valley, this Chardonnay offers simple, crisp and creamy aromas and flavors of apple and pear, toasty oak and vanilla.",87,Piña 2012 Low Vineyard Chardonnay (Oak Knoll District),,,,
"Still very young, this ripe Merlot-dominated wine is packed with dark plum and rich damson fruit flavors. They balance the serious amount of wood influence that gives it its spice and ageability. Drink from 2023.",91,Château Tour Grand Faurie 2015  Saint-Émilion,,,,
"Here is a smooth, supple sparkling wine, with bright aromas of citrus, stone fruit, apricot, baked bread and even a touch of piquant white peppercorn. The mouthfeel is full and generous, with fine, tonic perlage on the finish.",91,La Montina 2007 Brut Millesimato Sparkling (Franciacorta),,,,
"Ripe and forward, this brings brambly berry fruit and plenty of Dr Pepper soda flavors front and center. It's a smooth ride to a quick finish. Both scents and flavors show a hint of pine needle.",88,Longplay 2012 Lia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),,,,
"Perfumed wine, from a blend of Tannat and Cabernet Franc. Here is a powerful expression of intense terroir. Very concentrated and dense, with the tannins just beginning to soften, the wine is packed with black ripe fruits, solid and chunky.",92,Château Peyros 2006 Tannat-Cabernet Franc (Madiran),,,,
"Savory oak, mint and leather aromas accent basic blackberry and plum scents. This feels round, full-bodied and oaky, and that character carries onto the flavor profile, which includes minty wood and blackberry. Toast and resiny oak lead the way on a bulky, generous finish.",86,Viña Requingua 2011 Toro de Piedra Grand Reserve Single Vineyard Carmenère-Cabernet Sauvignon (Maule Valley),,,,
"The slopes below the Stift Gottweig monastery are the source of this attractively crisp, light wine, its acidity and fresh fruit a pure pleasure to drink. There is a twist of minerality here, just to add extra interest. Screwcap.",86,Malat 2008 Gottweiger Berg Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),,,,
"Lime zest and freshly cut grass lend a particularly invigorating cool to this dry, delicate Riesling. It's brashly mineral on the palate, finishing tightly with a bracing shower of acidity.",88,Weingut Georg Albrecht Schneider 2013 Hummerthal Niersteiner Paterberg Trocken Riesling (Rheinhessen),,,,
"Struck flint and tomato leaf notes add welcome complexity to this wine's grapefruit aromas and flavors. For a wild-ferment Sauvignon Blanc, it's reasonably clean, with moderate body and a long, dry finish.",90,Greywacke 2013 Wild Sauvignon Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"At first, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Tannat and Syrah smells so baked and oaky that it seems overripe. In the mouth, the tannins are like sandpaper, while oaky flavors of rooty, baked berry fruits end timid, with a heavy slathering of residual barrel flavors.",85,Intipalka 2010 Valle del Sol No 1 Gran Reserva Red (Ica),,,,
"Stoic and reserved on the nose, this blend of Roussanne, Grenache Blanc, Bourboulenc and Clairette expands on the palate, delivering ample weight and richness. Melon and anise notes emerge on the finish. Drink now.",86,Domaine des Anges 2010 White (Côtes-du-Ventoux),,,,
"Made in a style to appeal to today's Chardonnay fans, this has flavors of buttered toast, popcorn, vanilla, pineapple and Key lime pie, with crisp acidity.",85,Chronicle 2010 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Here's a beautifully evolved Brunello di Montalcino (from Agricoltori del Geografico) that shows both elegance and harmony within layers of fruit, spice and earth. The wine articulates many of the most pleasurable characteristics associated with Sangiovese Grosso: elegance and liveliness.",90,Geografico Castello Tricerchi 2005  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Nutty, oaky and tart, this stainless steel-fermented white shows a shock of acidity wrapped around freshly cut grass and tropical flavors.",84,Geyser Peak 2016 River Ranches Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This elegant, lithe little wine is ready to drink. Leather, dried fruit, black olive and cocoa notes fade into a softly dusty finish tinged with lingering espresso nuances.",89,Vignobles Guy Mousset et Fils 2015 Domaine de Clairfont Red (Vin de Pays de Vaucluse),,,,
"With fruit from three Portuguese regions including Dâo and Douro, this herbal and mint- dominated wine is a blend of Touriga Nacional and Syrah. It has elegance, a touch of spice from wood, sweet juicy damson fruits and a lingering finish.",91,Messias 2007 Triunvirato No 2 Red (Vinho da Mesa),,,,
"The rich style of a Setzer wine is here, married to tight acidity, a mineral edge and ripeness. Pepper and white currant flavors come together in a mellifluous whole. Age for a year.",91,Setzer 2010 Die Lage Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel),,,,
"Here's a refreshing white made with Zibibbo grapes that opens with scents suggesting ripe apricot and wild rose. The bright palate offers juicy yellow peach, citrus and a note of Mediterranean brush. It has a crisp clean finish.",88,Donnafugata 2016 Lighea Zibibbo (Sicilia),,,,
"Chardonnay, Grillo, Insolia and Catarratto are blended in equal measure to provide a fresh yet complex wine. It bears a drying mineral tone, backed by notes of citrus, sweet peach and pear. A soft touch of fruity sweetness gives it roundness and depth.",87,Baglio del Cristo di Campobello 2011 C'D'C' White (Sicilia),,,,
"Clean and sleek on the palate, this wine has brisk Central Coast acidity, which highlights the complex flavors of green melon, lemon, lime, Asian pear and white pepper. Made without oak, it shows the wonderful terroir of its vineyard.",90,Tangent 2011 Paragon Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Edna Valley),,,,
"This much-sought-after, estate-grown Viognier is in short supply in 2011, but it's exemplary for its structure and class. Flavors of lime skin and grapefruit, wet stone and citrus abound. The cool vintage led to low yields—under two tons per acre. All neutral oak was used.",91,Abeja 2011 Viognier (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"An open, ripe and fruity wine made to be drunk young, this has black currant and spice flavors, plenty of acidity to keep it crisp and balanced tannins. The aftertaste is bright and lively.",86,Falua 2015 Tagus Creek Shiraz-Trincadeira Red (Alentejano),,,,
"Aromas of roasted coffee bean, ripe plum and dark kitchen spice waft out of the glass. The forward palate offers mature wild cherry, licorice, sage and espresso that carry through to the firm finish. Drink through 2019.",89,Melini 2011 Vigneti La Selvanella Riserva  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"Delicate but alluring scents of spring flower and orchard fruit lift out of the glass. The palate is linear and rather lean but still refreshing, offering pear, yellow apple and mineral alongside bracing acidity. It closes crisp and clean.",87,St. Pauls 2014 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),,,,
"There is some ripe melon fruitiness that gives the wine richness. By contrast, there is little structure or crisp acidity to give it life.",84,Vignobles Carreau Selection 2015 Château la Croix Saint-Pierre Blanc de la Croix Saint-Pierre  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),,,,
"This expression of Sangiovese is dominated by wood-driven sensations. It opens with aromas of toasted oak, espresso and underbrush that carry through to the palate alongside a dense black-fruit flavor that stays just behind the oak. It finishes on an astringent, tannic note.",88,Argiano 2010 Suolo Sangiovese (Toscana),,,,
"A Livermore Valley sourcing a Portuguese red grape variety from a Lodi vineyard. Does it work? The wine's dark purple yet subdued at first in flavor, opening slightly into tones of blueberry, raspberry and sour cherry, a smidgen of spice on the finish. Worth trying.",85,Fenestra 2007 Silvaspoons Vineyard Alvarelhão (Lodi),,,,
"This is the inaugural release from this winery that focuses on the expression of Cabernet in a different site each year. It's dazzling, rich with blackberry, black currant, herb, dark chocolate and barrel spices. The full-bodied flavors are candy-bar sweet with some chewy tannic heft that bodes well for its potential in the cellar.",93,Maloney 2012 Single Vineyard Elephant Mountain Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rattlesnake Hills),,,,
"This is rich and dry yet also fruity. Perfumed in character, it is full, soft and smooth, allowing the acidity a place on the finish.",85,Quinta do Portal 2011 Colheita Rosé (Douro),,,,
"A rich, mid-weight red blend of 48% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Petit Verdot, 23% Malbec and 5% Petite Sirah, Murrieta Well's The Spur is balanced, soft in tannins and makes for a tasty midweek wine.",87,Murrieta's Well 2010 The Spur Red (Livermore Valley),,,,
"From a producer that knows its way around the variety, this Reserve-tier wine shows off its burly pedigree in leather and tobacco, strapped around huge tannins. Crisper, high-toned red fruit makes itself felt midway through on the palate, finishing in handfuls of distinct black pepper.",90,St. Francis 2012 Reserve Merlot (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"This wine has attractive acidity as well as ripe tannins. It is perfumed and offers structure as well as fresh black-currant fruit. It's still young, with layers of wood still very obvious. This medium-weight wine will need time to develop. Drink from 2019.",92,Château Beychevelle 2013  Saint-Julien,,,,
"This citrus flavored wine is fruity and crisp with bright acidity and just a hint of herbal character. The wine is light, bright and ready to drink.",86,Mas de la Dame 2012 La Stèle White (Les Baux de Provence),,,,
"At first, this wine tastes overworked, with very ripe pineapple, lime and mango flavors elaborated with sweet new oak. But then acidity washes in, drying it out, and letting a minerality hit that grounds the wine. If it finished drier, the score would soar.",87,Signorello 2009 SETA Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"Stalky aromas suggest animal hide and roasted fruit. The wine is rubbery, firm and leathery in feel, with plum, berry, raisin and other dark-fruit flavors. On the finish, it feels earthy and tastes like stewed black fruits and prune. Drink sooner rather than later.",87,Mas de Subirà 2010 Red (Priorat),,,,
"The opening of green apple and honeydew melon says Rueda all the way. The feel is cleansing and fresh, with piercing but proper acidity pushing flavors of green citrus, melon and green apple. Stony on the finish, with zest. Solid for near-term drinking; don't let it sit around for long.",87,Verderol 2009 Spring in a Bottle Verdejo (Rueda),,,,
"Dark in color, with minty oak on the nose, this is a medium-to-full, resiny wine with cinnamon and clove outmuscling plum and cherry flavors. Resiny oak, modest acidity and tertiary fruit flavors work the finish.",85,Llai Llai 2011 Pinot Noir (Bío Bío Valley),,,,
"The clean look, nice bead and good mouthfeel are the saving graces here, because it smells strange, almost like steamed ballpark hot dogs, and it tastes odd and innocuous, like papaya juice. The look and feel are good but the smell and tastes are not so great.",83,Medanos NV Extra Brut Chardonnay (Mendoza),,,,
"Scents of waxy honeycomb and crushed minerals waft from this off-dry Pinot Gris. On the palate, lush, ripe peach and melon flavors penetrate. It's unabashedly fruity and forward with a bold, heavy mouthfeel.",85,Red Newt Cellars 2012 Curry Creek Vineyards Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes),,,,
"The wine is rustic, full of barnyard flavors and tannins. The fruit doesn't come through at all.",82,Herdade da Malhadinha Nova 2012 Monte da Peceguina Red (Alentejano),,,,
"This young wine brims with fresh acidity and primary cherry, blackberry and cola flavors. The complexity is considerable and so is the elegance. It feels graceful and silky in the mouth, despite the power of the fruit. Should hit its peak in two or three years.",90,Ampelos 2010 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"A tight, crisp wine from vineyards that face across the river to the town of Chablis. The wine has delicious yellow fruits, intense acidity and an opulent character. The vines of the vineyard face east giving warmth while keeping a strong mineral texture. Drink this wine from 2019.",93,Jean-Marc Brocard 2015 Montmains Premier Cru  (Chablis),,,,
"Mt. Difficulty winemaker Matt Dicey has made another fine Otago Riesling, this from a single vineyard whose name is Gaelic for ""Hill of Gold."" It smells of honey and marmalade, with strong citrus overtones and a sweet attack. Zesty acids on the long, crisp finish provide balance.",88,Alexandra Wine Company 2001 Crag an Oir Riesling (Central Otago),,,,
"Fresh fruit aromas are a delicious part of this crisp, fruity wine. It is well balanced, with lively acidity sharing the stage with the ripe pear and pineapple flavors. It's ready to drink now.",92,Domaine Ferret 2015  Pouilly-Fuissé,,,,
"Suggestions of soft spice and bark jazz-up the dark fruit center of this blend, made with 75% Syrah, 13% Cinsault, 7% Mourvèdre, 4% Carignan and 3% Grenache. Mouthwatering black cherry and raspberry sauce flavors flood the mouth and stay through the solid finish. Drink now.",85,Goats do Roam Wine Co. 2010 Red Red (Western Cape),,,,
"It's a treat to find a well-priced Merlot that has some gutsy tannin and dark fruit to go along with its sweeter flavors and mild texture. This wine has concentrated black cherry, clove and oak spice flavors, with a firm structure and lingering finish.",89,Château Souverain 2014 Merlot (California),,,,
"The wine is a blend of several vineyards in the Green Valley. It shows its cool origins in the brisk acidity and tannins, and the overall delicacy, so balanced and refined in the mouth. Bone dry and zesty, it conveys intricate flavors of cranberries, cola, persimmons and red cherries. It's beautiful now, and should develop well through at least 2020.",92,EnRoute 2012 Les Pommiers Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"A spicy, full, fat wine, with a good citrus touch, this is made lively by the green fruit flavors, the edge of honey and the rounding toast.",89,Louis Jadot 2006 Charmes Premier Cru  (Meursault),,,,
"An easy to drink Pinot for its dryness, exceptionally low alcohol, and cleansing acidity. It has cherry, red plum, cola and herb flavors, framed with sweet, smoky sandalwood. Decant for a while.",90,Old World 2006 Sterling Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"From the tiny island of Salina off the north coast of Sicily (where the Tasca family runs a beautiful boutique hotel called Capofaro), comes this excellent expression of Malvasia. This dessert wine shows exactly what this versatile white grape variety is built to do best: The bouquet is redolent of honey, golden vanilla cream, candied apricot and sweet almond marzipan.",93,Tasca d'Almerita 2009 Capofaro Malvasia (Salina),,,,
"With a dark, weird red-orange color, this rosé feels heavy and candied in raspberry and orange fruit. It's a little sweet.",84,Merriam 2010 Rosé (Sonoma County),,,,
"Tastes too sweet by far, with sugared black cherry, currant, prune and tobacco flavors. The sweetness may be partially attributed to high alcohol. With thick tannins, this Zin is just too rustic to merit a higher score.",86,Ridge 2009 Pagani Ranch Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"Light but juicy aromas of white grapes, sandalwood and cinnamon show on the nose of this bottling by Irvine-raised, Cal Poly-educated, Paso Robles-residing Ryan Render. There is a flinty touch to the palate, with rounded green pear, baked apple and nectarine fruit, though the savory sea-salt touch is what makes this wine shine.",91,Rendarrio Vineyards 2014 Baja-Ha Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Herb, spice, smoke and a whiff of roasted meat lead into a wine that is balanced and deep. This puts a focus on the dark side: black fruits, tar, coffee and smoke. It's grainy and tannic, and the tannins and toast may eventually outrun the fruit. But it's a good effort in a Washington style, that captures the black olive and herbal leanings of the Bordeaux grapes.",88,Fall Line 2005 Horse Heaven Hills Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"A fuller, richer, more broadly fruity version of the winery's Two Vines offering, this crowd-pleasing Chardonnay slathers the palate with buttery brioche, apple and Asian pear. A little more acidity would help; give it a chill to compensate.",86,Columbia Crest 2008 Grand Estates Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"From a 2,500-foot elevation site, this Cab Franc is intriguingly peppery, light in oak and resplendent in raspberry liqueur aromas and a trace of pine forest. Moderate in tannins and silky in texture it's ready to be enjoyed now with cheese and charcuterie.",91,Easton 2011 Monarch Mine Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Sierra Foothills),,,,
"The spirit of South Africa's Swartland region shines through on this rustic but fun Shiraz. On the nose, red fruit and a spicy edge lead into big flavors of spice, smoke and fruit. Sturdy tannins give the wine an ageworthy appeal. Pair with grilled meat and heartier flavors for extra enjoyment.",87,Spice Route 2005 Shiraz (Swartland),,,,
"Rich, ruddy peach and tangerine scents are fleshy and ripe on this lavishly fruit-forward Riesling. Semi-sweet in style, it's unctuously juicy, but a jolt of grapefruit acidity adds balance and vibe. The finish is marked with a spray of citrus blossom.",91,St. Urbans-Hof 2012 Leiwener Laurentiuslay Erste Lage Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Strident apple and lime aromas are pure and pretty in this wine. This isn't a complex or complicated white, but rather friendly and easy to like. Flavors of peach, apple and apricot finish minerally and clean. This is a textbook quaffing wine.",88,Beronia 2012 Viura (Rioja),,,,
"Black pepper and rosemary aromas join forces with black cherry and blackberry flavors in this well-balanced, moderately tannic wine. It has a refreshing quality, tasty fruit and medium body, all of which will make it versatle with food.",87,Bridlewood 2015 Pinot Noir (California),,,,

"Merlot is certainly one of the real strengths at Fidélitas, and two different versions are offered. This broad and flavorful effort has pretty cherry fruit backed with pleasing baking spices. The finish is focused and precise, adding streaks of cinnamon and chocolate.",91,Fidelitas 2009 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Pure Merlot from the Red Willow vineyard, this does not skimp on the scents and flavors of green herb. It's true to the vineyard's style and will require further bottle age to flesh out a bit and show its best strengths.",87,Barrage Cellars 2010 A.K.A. Merlot (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Fresh plum and berry aromas are cut from a common mold. This is a good but typical juicy Rioja with clean fruit, crisp acidity and nice cherry and raspberry flavors. A touch of bitterness comes up at the tail end of the finish.",87,Monte Clavijo 2012  Rioja,,,,
"A rich Sauvignon Blanc, with powerful, complex flavors of Meyer lemons, limes, lemongrass, tart green apples and white peaches. It's very dry and crisp in acidity. Shows an extra level of textural complexity that raises the score.",90,David Arthur 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"Fresh-pressed blackberries and graphite comprise the aromatic entry to this bottling from a vineyard about 2,000 feet high in the hills west of Paso Robles. It features plenty of wild thyme, black licorice and other garrigue-like herbals on the nose as well. The palate is minty, with a strong tannic tension and rising acidity.",90,Asuncion Ridge 2013 Barrel Select Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),,,,
"This has a slightly copper hue and is delicately scented with aromas of hawthorn and orchard fruit. Its racy palate shows subtle notes of tangerine zest, lime and a hint of apple while a mineral note marks the finish.",87,Primosic 2014 Poderi di Carlo Gmajne Pinot Grigio (Collio),,,,
"With a rusty salmon color, this Pinot Noir Cava offers citrus and red-fruit aromas along with earthy funk. The palate is generally well balanced, while smoky, earthy flavors of red fruits and citrus finish mild.",86,Segura Viudas NV Aria Pinot Noir Brut Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"You've got to love the exotic aromas, great balance and firm texture of this complex Pinot. It's medium bodied, tangy and delicious due to good acidity and fresh, vibrant raspberry and red cherry flavors. It has appropriate fine tannins for a gripping mouthfeel, and a lingering finish.",94,Freeman 2013 Akiko's Cuvée Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"The nose is shy and does not want to show its fruit. The very frothy, light palate displays hints of ripe yellow apple and glints of citrus. This is balanced and shows its fruit reluctantly but comes together beautifully on the dry finish.",88,Domaine Ansen NV Struch Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),,,,
"A succulent, almost thick mouthfeel and subtle doughy, nutty flavors give this full-bodied wine a lot of impact on the palate. The good viscosity seems to coat the sides of the mouth and help extend the finish.",89,Fenestra 2015 Silvaspoons Vineyard Verdelho (Lodi),,,,
"Fresh, enticing notes of grass and nettle meet with freshly cut slices of green pear. This zippy Chardonnay, called Morillon in Styria, is full of the characteristic 2014 freshness and slenderness and is strikingly scented. Drink soon.",88,Sattlerhof 2014 Gamlitzer Morillon (Südsteiermark),,,,
"Sultry, silky and sexy on the nose with rich baking and red-spice notes, this appellation blend by Brian Loring also shows ripe but acidic raspberry fruit, rose buds and cooked berries. The palate is bursting with cranberry and black raspberries, enhanced by graphite, nutmeg and black peppercorns. It finishes tight and clean, with a camphor lift.",92,Loring Wine Company 2014 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Cherry-vanilla and cola provide a voluptuous, full-bodied outline for this estate-grown wine, given 20 months in French oak, one-quarter of it new.",88,Nicholson Ranch 2013 Estate Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Lifted notes of dried pear, dried chamomile flowers and dried lemon peel have a strong impact. The palate comes in with lovely generous sweetness that amplifies that chamomile-tisane notion and boosts the dried-fruit notes. Against the distinctly medium-sweet fruitiness stands a clarion line of acidity. The evolution of fruit flavors weaves a colorful tapestry of aromas. This is carefully balanced and quietly intense. It holds immense strength at its core that radiates flavor and fruit. Made from a field blend of Alsace varieties, each adds something: aroma, texture, freshness and body. The finish is endless and very fruity. Have this with cheese or a subtle dessert. Drink now through 2035.",95,Domaine Marcel Deiss 2009 Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru White (Alsace),,,,
"This is a nicely integrated wine with good balance and structure. Though the finish could be a bit longer, the forward red currant and plum flavors mingling with hints of tomato, tobacco and spice create just enough complexity.",84,Recanati 2004 Kosher Reserve Cabernet Franc (Galilee),,,,
"Lithe and lean in style, this light-bodied dry Riesling offers up loads of blossomy, citrusy delight. Spine tingling lemon-lime acidity is balanced neatly against concentrated tangerine and honey flavors. The finish lingers on a pleasantly waxy cling.",91,Thörle 2016 Trocken Riesling (Rheinhessen),,,,
"Notes of dried dark berry, leathery spice, sweet tobacco and chocolate-covered cherry fill the nose of this wine. The satiny texture pairs well with the dusty tannins, and additional flavors of prune, sweet smoke and fresh caramel linger through the medium-length finish.",87,Les Clos de Paulilles 2009 Rimage  (Banyuls),,,,
"This is still a bit closed, but scents of rose, berry, white spices and underbrush slowly emerge. The savory flavors include bright berry, black cherry and white pepper supported by lively acidity and firm tannins. Young and tightly wound, it needs time to unfold. Drink after 2022. Chigazola Merchants, Domenico Valentino.",93,Sobrero 2010 Ciabot Tanasio  (Barolo),,,,
"Sestina celebrates old-vine Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc from the Red Willow and Bacchus vineyards. The initial punch and power gives way to a wine with sharp acidity and somewhat constrained, leafy fruit flavors. For those who crave old-vine complexity and embrace the herbal side of Cabernet, this wine will be a revelation. Tight and focused, it responds well to several hours of decanting.",91,Avennia 2011 Sestina Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Sometimes, you just want a white that's dry, crisp and mouth-cleansing, to wash down that chicken salad sandwich or drink with savory hors d'oeuvres. This Sauvignon Blanc-Chardonnay blend fills that need admirably. It's dry and rich in citrus fruits, with stimulating acidity. Sommeliers, buy this one up.",87,Bedarra 2008 Beachfront White (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Bosco Faiano is a hearty, masculine wine, aged 18 months in large oak casks to deliver dark notes of dried fruit, black currant, cured meat, leather and spice. At first, this tastes bold and raw, but after a few minutes in the glass, it shows a nice evolution toward elegance.",91,I Capitani 2006 Bosco Faiano  (Taurasi),,,,
"Light white peach and apple aromas show off this boutique bottling from one of the few commercial projects in Ventura County. There'a plenty of tension on the palate, with tangy citrus and buttery nut flavors, which ultimately feel a little soft.",86,Clos des Amis 2015 Olivelands Vineyards Chardonnay (Ventura County),,,,
"Fresh and pretty, this has a bright, refreshing palate that offers flavors of cranberry and raspberry. It's smooth and fruit forward, with medium aging potential.",88,Illahe 2010 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This Pouilly Fumé works well, balancing the ripe yellow and pineapple fruits with toast and spice notes to give a rounded, richly textured wine. It is now mature, while retaining a fruity character on the finish.",91,Joseph Mellot 2007 La Grande Cuvée des Edvins  (Pouilly-Fumé),,,,
"Crisp, tight and full of fruit, this is a lively apéritif style of wine from Vignobles Siozard. A tangy texture gives the wine great lift and adds to its drinkability. Drink now.",87,Domaine du Claouset 2016 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),,,,
"Exceptionally smooth for such a young wine, this deeply-fruited red blends pretty raspberry and cherry flavors with seductively-delicious milk-chocolaty barrel notes. Happily, there is enough natural acidity to keep it lively and fresh.",90,Dumas Station 2009 Estate Cabernet Franc (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Yealands is based in the Awatere Valley, a subregion of Marlborough that offers generally cooler, later ripening than the main (Wairau) valley. This is a fresh, sappy, medium-bodied Pinot Noir, featuring notes of cherry, vanilla and herb. It should provide easy quaffing over the next few years.",88,Yealands 2014 Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Awatere Valley),,,,
This is an appealing Cabernet with spicy cola and plum notes and a consistent flavor through the midpalate. It finishes with a hint of toasty oak.,87,Jason-Stephens 2007 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Clara Valley),,,,
This wine brings aromas and flavors of pear along with light tropical accents. The concentration dips toward the finish.,86,Boomtown 2015 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,

"Delicate aromas of spring flower, nut and yellow fruit guide the nose on this linear white. Delineated flavors of Golden Delicious apple and citrus fruit, accented with a light vein of mineral, are balanced by bracing acidity.",87,La Lastra 2013  Vernaccia di San Gimignano,,,,
"This wine is opulent and rich without losing sight of the freshness of the vintage. Layers of new wood (100%) are blended with rich and perfumed fruits. At the same time, the acidity goes right through the wine, indicating an impressive future. It comes from a tiny patch of vines that gave two barrels. Drink from 2022.",95,Domaine Jacques Prieur 2014  Chevalier-Montrachet,,,,
"This wine is half Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest Merlot and Cabernet Franc (22% each), topped off by Petit Verdot. The aromas of fresh herbs, flowers and blue fruit are still wound up. The palate shows more tannic heft than this vineyard is often known for, needing some time in the cellar to soften. Best after 2020.",91,Pepper Bridge 2013 Seven Hills Vineyard Estate Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"One of the best Californian Pinot Gris currently available, this is rich, creamy and complex, and it would make for a great alternative to Chardonnay. This wine traditionally ages in used oak, which imparts just a hint of wood-driven sweetness to the pear, peach, mango and lime flavors.",90,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2010 Trenton Station Vineyard Pinot Gris (Russian River Valley),,,,
"A little too dry and tannic, with earthy flavors of tobacco, sage, pepper and dried leather, which only partially relieve the modest blackberries and black currants. Way too astringent all the way through.",84,Bella 2007 Lily Hill Estate Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"A ripe wine from the Real Companhia Velha, this shows a rich character, its tannins ripe and generous. It's not a huge wine, but it does show a fine, full-bodied flavor of sweet plum. The final feeling is smooth and opulent.",88,Royal Oporto 2009 Vintage  (Port),,,,
"Underbrush, mint, graphite, leather, mocha and tobacco are just some of the aromas of this full-bodied red. The palate offers dried black cherry, tobacco and a hint of coffee alongside mature, buffed tannins. This is at its ideal drinking window so enjoy over the next few years.",90,Montemercurio 2008 Messaggero  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),,,,
"Tané is a beautiful barrique-aged blend of Nero d'Avola and Syrah from southeast Sicily that shows rich intensity and a velvety feel in the mouth. The fruit is dense and smooth, and the wine's bright flavors last a long time on the palate.",91,Valle dell'Acate 2006 Tané Red (Sicilia),,,,
"Smoke, cedar and plum aromas are followed by a focused palate of pepper and berry flavors. Poised and sophisticated, this wine is great for fans of drier style reds.",89,Semeli 2004 Grande Reserve Agiorgitiko (Nemea),,,,
"This Chardonnay is rich and decadent with plenty of ripe fruit and oak. It's a crowd pleaser with flavors of mangoes, pineapples, limes, buttered toast and vanilla, all brightened by acidity.",88,Highflyer 2010 Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
This ripe wine is still young. It has a taut texture that's dominated by the lively white fruit and crisp acidity. There's a mineral streak that cuts through the wine to give a steely texture that will soften over the next year. Drink from the end of 2018.,93,Voirin-Jumel 2010 Millésime Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),,,,
"This captures the essential flavors of Washington Sauvignon Blanc. There are no aggressive grassy-herbal flavors, none of the vegetal or canned pea flavors that show up in other New World Sauv Blancs. Here it's all about clean melon and yellow fruit flavors, backed with bracing natural acids, round and ripe.",90,Ardenvoir 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A big, deep, impressive wine that feels flashy from the first sniff to the last swallow. A Merlot-based Bordeaux blend, with a splash of Petite Sirah, it's enormously rich in berries, cherries and dark chocolate, with a pleasantly earthy note of olives and herbs. The finish is bone dry. This is a very fine value in a full-bodied red wine of such charm.",92,Reid Family Vineyards 2008 Hannah's Blend Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Easy, slender and fresh, this bright Chianti (85% Sangiovese with Merlot) reveals green notes of olive and herb followed by wild berry and spice.",85,Straccali 2011  Chianti,,,,
"The naturally ripe, yellow fruits and perfumed character of Viognier is well expressed here. It is smooth, bringing out ripe fruitiness that is lightly cut with acidity. Drink now.",85,Casal do Conde 2014 Viognier (Tejo),,,,
"Baking spice, dried flower, dark-skinned berry and a whiff of coconut lead the nose on this straightforward Barolo. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, toast and vanilla alongside firm, tightly knit tannins.",89,Tenuta Rocca 2011  Barolo,,,,
"Still young, hard and sharp-edged, the wine reveals dark flavors of charred toast and espresso, set around a core of tight cranberry and raspberry fruit. It's built to age, and has some pleasing mocha and spice notes rounding out the finish.",90,Rex Hill 2011 Jacob-Hart Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Baking spice wraps around sizzling acidity in this well-made, full-bodied red from the heart of the appellation's Westside Road. Dark fruit is represented within a stemmy, brooding and slightly carbonic texture that's complex and rewarding.",93,Zoetic Wines 2014 Block 21 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This wine is all about perfumes and spice. It's ripe, fruity and already drinkable. Bergamot and fruity candy dominate the light acidity and soft texture.",84,Arthur Metz 2013 Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"Yellow flower and natural rubber come forward first and are followed by peach, apricot, pear and delicate mineral nuances. There's a creamy, warm quality to the mouthfeel, but this bright Inzolia ends clean and fresh.",86,Caruso & Minini 2007 Terre di Giumara Inzolia (Sicilia),,,,
"Here is an austere Pinot Noir that's both elegant and high-toned. The flavors mix black cherry and blueberry, while the finish is blithely earthy and herbal. A nice choice for mealtimes of an equally elegant nature, or an easy lunch of BLTs.",90,Lost Canyon 2011 Morelli Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Named after the stones in the vineyards, this wine is all crisp fruit and steely acidity. The racy palate dominates, showing bright acidity laden with citrus fruits. Drink this wine now.",88,Jean-Max Roger 2015 Cuvée les Caillottes  (Sancerre),,,,
"This is adequately pungent on the nose, with a touch of the veggies. The palate is modest in acidity but not flat or flabbby. Flavors of green fruits mix with a hint of asparagus, while controlled capsicum and bitterness work the finish.",86,Anakena 2013 Tama Vineyard Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),,,,
"Attractive aromas of violets, perfumed berries and a whiff of sandalwood unfold in the glass. The vibrant palate doles out ripe, juicy black cherry and cranberry, while accents of white pepper, toasted oak and cinnamon add backup. It's well balanced, with firm tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2015–2025.",94,Castello Vicchiomaggio 2010 Vigna La Prima Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"Wood spice, vanillin and blackberry aromas are followed by rich, fleshy black-fruit flavors. The warm vintage shows but it's undeniable in its appeal.",90,Revelry 2013 Aerial Series D11 Dionysus Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Citrus and pear notes lead the way in this bargain-priced Chardonnay from Down Under. It's reasonably tight and crisp for a wine in this bracket, carrying hints of well integrated vanilla through the lemony finish. Drink now.",85,St. Kilda 2009 Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia),,,,

"This is one of the grand wines of the Douro, from the last estate to be founded by the legendary Dona Antonia Ferreira in the 19th century. This is a long-lasting wine showing a fresh character, with dense, dark tannins and intense floral fruit. This will age for many years, so don't drink before 2020.",97,Quinta do Vale Meão 2012 Red (Douro),,,,
"Blackberry jam and plum cake aromas lead the nose of this simple but well made semisweet sparkling wine. The palate mirrors the nose, while bright acidity lends freshness.",86,Cantina di Sorbara NV Il Duomo Amabile  (Lambrusco di Modena),,,,
"Morgan's been on a roll the last couple of years, now that they've figured out how to make this wine from fruit grown in a cool part of the Highlands. Aged in older oak barrels, the wine shows no wood at all, but has a creamy softness that modifies the crisp lemon, lime, grapefruit, pear and wildflower flavors. This is one of the best Pinot Gris in California.",91,Morgan 2007 R&D; Franscioni Vineyard Pinot Gris (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Made with 15% Cabernet Franc, which adds a welcome cherry tart richness to the earthy blackberries and herbs, this Merlot is priced well for an elegant restaurant wine. It's dry and crisp and smooth, and so easy to drink with a fine steak.",89,Gainey 2007 Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Old vine Petite Sirah fortified with brandy in the Port style, this very sweet wine could benefit from some time in the bottle. It's quite rich in chocolate, black currant and spice flavors wrapped into smooth, thick tannins, with a burn of alcohol on the finish.",87,Gemella 2005 L'Anima Petite Sirah (Mendocino),,,,
"Very different than the 2005 vintage, Barolo Le Coste from Giacomo Grimaldi opens with a brownish-amber color and ripe berry or candied fruit aromas. There are beautifully fine aromas of tar, asphalt and licorice in the background that help balance it out. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers.",92,Giacomo Grimaldi 2006 Le Coste  (Barolo),,,,
"Rich while also structured, this big, ripe wine comes from an estate owned by the Càlem family since the 1820s. It has concentration both from the tannins and from the black-plum fruits, and offers good potential. Drink from 2019.",91,Quinta do Sagrado 2013 Tinto Red (Douro),,,,
"Aromas of oak, toast, underbrush and ripe berry lead the nose. The palate offers dried black cherry and black pepper alongside dusty, drying tannins. The fruit is drying up quickly and there's the warmth of alcohol on the finish.",86,Teanum 2012 Alta Nero di Troia (Puglia),,,,
"This wine includes 8% Petite Sirah and smaller amounts of Petit Verdot, Syrah, Zinfandel and Merlot, fleshing out a rich, full-bodied embrace of chewy tannin and extracted blackberry and brick tar. Let it hang in the glass awhile and swirl a time or two to get it to speak.",90,Michael Mondavi Family Estate 2013 Emblem Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"A fresh, slightly green nose is followed by angular red berry and spice flavors in this Merlot. The wine has good structure but is a touch acidic and tart—pair it with richer, rounded dishes to soften it out.",82,Taking Root 2006 Bastardo-Merlot Red (Cahul),,,,
"This is a concentrated, well-oaked Cabernet with blackberry, cassis, leather and woody aromas. The palate is fairly tight and tannic, with good structure, while flavors of toasty, spicy plum and berry finish woody and with elasticity.",87,Tilia 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"Here is an unabashedly earthy, old-school Oregon style. The fruit suggests wild raspberries, with a dash of cola. The flavors are a bit dilute, and that earthy character dominates.",87,Lundeen 2014 Z'ivo Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
"This red blend offers a nose of spiced wood, tobacco and pepper, and on the palate, light, simple flavors of red fruit and cigar box. There's a lot of oak here, venturing into a maple syrup character, and overall, the wine is a bit clunky, but it's reasonably priced and from a unique location, giving it a fun spin.",82,Vivác Winery NV Red Hot Mama Red (New Mexico),,,,
"Aromas of toast, oak, espresso and a whiff of smoke lead the nose. The palate offers oak extract, coconut, coffee and vanilla but there's not enough fruit richness to support the oak. It's already reached its ideal drinking window so enjoy sooner rather than later.",86,Cantine Leonardo Da Vinci 2010 Da Vinci Riserva  (Chianti),,,,
"Aromas of citrus blossom, chamomile and a whiff of tropical fruit waft out of the glass. The lively, delicious palate offers ripe white peach, apricot, pear, chopped herb and a light mineral note alongside bright acidity.",90,Contini 2014 Pariglia  (Vermentino di Sardegna),,,,
"Jammy berry and raisin aromas are compact and tell a lot about what's coming next. That's a saturated but rough and tannic palate with extremely ripe flavors of prune, licorice and blackberry jam. A peppery, syrupy finish is anything but lean.",85,Lamadrid 2013 Single Vineyard Reserva Malbec (Agrelo),,,,
"Ripe, mature, easy Champagne, maintaining the Clicquot style of bottle maturity, with toast, sweet pastry and a rich, full-in-the-mouth character of white fruits. The finish is relatively soft.",89,Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin NV Yellow Label Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"An elegant, pale-golden color leads to subtle but refined aromas of bread dough and lime, and a tantalizing hint of—what? Mint? Raspberry? White chocoloate? The same flavors commingle in the mouth. It’s very dry and acidic now. A year or so might soften it.",88,Roederer Estate NV Brut  (Anderson Valley),,,,
"Balancing fruit and ripe spice, it merits a place at the table rather than just serving as an apéritif. It has peach, lychee and a just off-dry character that allows for acidity. Drink now",87,Gustave Lorentz 2012 Réserve Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"This bottling, which is leveled a bit by the inclusion of 13% Zinfandel and 12% Grenache, shows blackberry jam, black cherry and concentrated lilac aromas on the nose. The palate is nicely layered with just enough tannic structure for optimal drinking now, combining flavors of blueberry and black cherry with caramel, milk chocolate and plum-skin tartness.",89,Proulx 2013 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),,,,
"There's just something about this 50-50 Sangiovese-Merlot blend that makes it absolutely irresistible. The fullness, the harmony, the intensity of aromas and the long, fruity persistency on the finish work together to produce one of the great modern super Tuscans.",94,Mazzei 2004 Castello di Fonterutoli Siepi Red (Toscana),,,,
"High in acidity and low in oak, this is a white that pushes the limits, reflective of the extreme, cool-climate vineyards from which it sources. Fresh-squeezed lemon is the star, the wet-stone minerality razor sharp.",86,Red Car 2013 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"It's rare to find a Sémillon in Portugal, let along the Alentejo. And yet the wine works beautifully. Wood aging has given it sophistication while the natural creamy texture of the grape is enhanced by the ripe yellow fruits that are lightly lifted by a herbal, citrus aftertaste. This wine could well age, so drink now or, better, keep until 2017.",91,Herdade do Esporão 2014 Esporão Private Selection White White (Alentejano),,,,
"This is a rounded and ripe wine, with generous black fruits and a full, fruity texture. It shows balanced acidity, hints of wood and a fine integration of fruit and tannins. It can be enjoyed now, but will be better from 2016.",90,Porca de Murça 2012 Reserva Tinto Red (Douro),,,,
"Made from Syrah, this is a heavy, fruity wine that offers cherry, orange and mushroom flavors. It's very dry, with pleasant acidity.",82,Flocchini 2010 Rosé (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Aromas of spice cake, licorice, moist earth, pie cherries and kirsch, with flavors that follow suit. A luxurious wine, bursting with flavor, tannic and just a bit pruney. This is a love it or hate it style; you pick.",89,J. Scott Cellars 2008 Syrah (Rogue Valley),,,,
"Black plum and elderberry conspire with smoky cola, shaved chocolate and rustic licorice aromas on the nose of this bottling. The sip starts softly before stiffer tannic structure takes hold, bringing forth flavors of dried plum, reduced soy sauce and a slightly bitter charcoal touch, all lifted by buoyant acidity: very dark without being overly ripe.",91,Westerly 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),,,,
"This old-vines wine is really clean and light on the nose, with aromas of red apple, fresh-cut white sapote and blanched almonds. The laser-focused palate is dominated by a refreshing texture, like sipping an ice-cold martini or licking a steel knife, with sea salt and lemon peel flavors most prevalent.",92,Foxen 2013 Old Vines Ernesto Wickenden Vineyard Chenin Blanc (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"Just lightly structured, this is a delicious, fruity wine. With soft tannins and rounded black fruits, it's fresh and fragrant. Wood flavors support the fruitiness. Full-bodied and ripe, it's ready to drink.",86,Companhia das Quintas 2012 Pancas Red (Lisboa),,,,
"Too much acidity on this Syrah and Mourvedre blend feels like a knife through the palate. But the cherry, cola and spice flavors are good, and the wine is fully dry and moderate in alcohol.",84,Mosby 2008 Roc Michel Fremir Vineyards Red (Monterey County),,,,
"Lush and opulent as are Stonestreet's other Chards, with potent flavors of ripe mashed pineapples, crème brûlée, vanilla custard, vanilla and smoky sandalwood. Dramatic and compelling. The crisp acidity and tightness suggest short-term ageability. Now–2013.",93,Stonestreet 2007 Red Point Chardonnay (Alexander Valley),,,,
"The wine has a dark, still-young color. Freshness brings out bright red and dried fruits as well as acidity. It's attractive, soft and fruity, a young-tasting 10-Years-Old.",86,Offley NV Barão de Forrester 10-Year-Old Tawny  (Port),,,,
"Winemaker Kevin Riley's fascination with resurrecting the Mission grape vines on his property is starting to pay off. This pink, which includes 18% Zinfandel and 7% Grenache, shows ripe watermelon and strawberry aromas. Red plum and red apple flavors show on the palate, enlivened by mandarin orange accents.",89,Proulx 2016 Willow Creek Farm Rosé of Mission (Paso Robles),,,,
"This blend of Sangiovese, 10% Canaiolo and 10% Merlot offers aromas of violet, black plum and a whiff of baking spice. The simple but fleeting palate offers black cherry, raspberry and a hint of clove alongside mild tannins and fresh acidity.",86,Coli 2013 Pratale  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"A blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Viognier and Petite Sirah, this is dry, brisk and straightforward, with red currant and pepper flavors. Drink it now with roasted or grilled meats and stews.",85,Bridlewood 2011 Blend 175 Red (Central Coast),,,,
"Pretty rich and full-bodied for Pinot Noir, this is a big wine that grabs your attention. It floods the mouth with flavors of sour cherry candy and spicy persimmons, with a rich overlay of toasty oak and exotic spices. The acidity lends a nice bite. It's too young to appreciate now, but it should gain traction after 2014.",92,Maggy Hawk 2009 Unforgettable Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),,,,
"This ultraripe and fruity effort tastes of raspberry compote. There are drying tannins and a hint of bark or leaf, with just a bit of warmth on the finish. The fruit comes from two of Red Mountain's finest sites—Kiona and Ciel du Cheval –",89,Gorman 2009 The Pixie Syrah (Red Mountain),,,,
"The delicate pétillance and soft, lingering mousse of this wine exemplify Sparkling Pointe's house style. Crisp apple, pear and lemon flavors are approachable and fresh but nuanced by shades of cream, nut and pastry. Zesty acidity highlights a brisk, impeccably clean finish.",89,Sparkling Pointe 2013 Brut Sparkling (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"This dry style of Pinot Gris brings out a strong acidity as well as ripe fruitiness. The wine is structured, tangy with surprising amounts of lemon as well as pear flavors. It is still too young and needs time. Drink from 2016.",87,Domaine Léon Boesch 2013 Le Coq Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"The Greco Bianco grape (a native variety of Calabria in southern Italy) offers compelling aromas of pear, Golden Delicious apple and stone fruit. Librandi does a great job with this wine that shows density and creamy spice on the close. Pair it with white meat or fish.",87,Librandi 2009  Cirò,,,,
"This is quite a nobly structured Pinot Noir. It's tempting to describe it as thin, because it trades opulence for dryness and a certain spicy minerality. But that would seriously underestimate its considerable appeal, not to mention the subtle hints of wild cherries and raspberries. The more you sip, the more you like it. At this price, a terrific value.",93,Alta Maria 2008 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"Fruity and lemony, this is a bright and fresh wine with just a touch of steeliness. Almonds come through at the end.",88,Coteaux da Murta 2012 Quinta da Murta Arinto (Bucelas),,,,
"Intense aromas of red cherry and wildflower open this bright, elegant red. The easy-drinking palate offers crushed cherry, strawberry, orange zest and a hint of white almond alongside refreshing acidity and ultrafine tannins.",89,St. Pauls 2013 Missianer Vernatsch Schiava (Alto Adige),,,,
"Only occasionally produced, this reserve-level wine is a bit of a mystery in this new vintage. It's tart and shy, its black fruit laced with assertive acidity and its finish excessively astringent.",88,Chehalem 2014 Statement Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),,,,
"Here is another stunningly good Oregon Chardonnay, this one sourced from Oregon's oldest certified biodynamic vineyard. It strikes a perfect, harmonious chord, with ripe tree fruits, juicy citrus flavors and a lingering impression of madeleine cookies. There are skin flavors of lemon and orange, contributing to a dense, lingering finish with marvelous texture.",94,Fullerton 2014 Cooper Mountain Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Made from vines that are over 55 years old, this refined wine has concentrated flavors of white peach, citrus, yellow apple, exotic fruit and white spices alongside energizing mineral accents. The creamy palate is brightened by firm acidity. It closes on an almond note.",90,Tenuta Roveglia 2011 Vigne di Catullo  (Lugana),,,,
"Roasted herb, red berry and underbrush aromas come together on this. The tart palate offers sour cherry, strawberry, white pepper and dried sage alongside youthfully austere tannins. Star anise caps the finish.",90,Beni di Batasiolo 2012 Bussia Vigneto Bofani  (Barolo),,,,
"Enormously attractive, this has a rich, creamy texture and complex flavors. Notes of raspberries, cherries, Dr. Pepper and persimmons flood the palate, riding a wave of spice, smoky oak and a beautiful touch of mushroomy earthiness. This is a first class Pinot Noir, with food-friendly elegance.",93,Boheme 2009 Taylor Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Aromas of violet petal and gamy berry fruits come with a strong oak-based whiff of sawdust. This feels blocky and generically big, while saucy berry flavors taste roasted, with a strong hint of clove. On the finish, this remains roasted and saucy tasting.",89,TintoNegro 2013 Finca La Escuela La Piedra Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Hard and showing an herbal edge, this single-vineyard Merlot will require some further bottle age and/or decanting. It drinks more like a Cabernet than a Merlot, with a green slant to the tannins.",87,Tertulia 2008 Pepper Bridge Vineyard Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"A flagship wine for this producer, this is rich and seductive, opulent even. Bold yellow fruits, ripe apples and pears are surrounded by a youthful texture that will allow it to age. The fruit and the touches of wood are still present, but will integrate beautfully. Drink this wine from 2023.",95,Louis Latour 2015  Corton-Charlemagne,,,,
"With a hot-pink color and aromas like a light red wine, this rosé has enough heft in the texture and complexity of flavor to substitute for a Pinot Noir or Sangiovese at lunch or dinner. It's medium bodied, has red-cherry and raspberry flavors and a smooth rather than crisp mouthfeel.",89,Uvaggio 2016 Rosé (Lodi),,,,
Pecorino is a fascinating white grape from Central Italy that deserves a special look. This expression bursts open with tones of acacia flower and stone fruit and delivers medium density and richness on the finish.,88,Talamonti 2012 Trabocchetto Pecorino (Colline Pescaresi),,,,
"This is a beautiful wine, from its onion-skin pink color onward. It is, of course, mature, but still exhibits vibrant red and citrus fruits. It is very dry in style, a paean to delicious acidity. This great wine does not need to age longer, but still has some potential to improve for the next few years.",95,Ruinart 1998 Dom Ruinart Brut Rosé  (Champagne),,,,
"This is a solid Chardonnay for a great price. It has full body and an oaky, buttery personality that will make few enemies. It's richly textured, with an almost-sweet quality to its fruit.",87,Dark Horse 2014 Chardonnay (California),,,,
"Sweet oak notes of almond, vanilla and honey edge over a portion of the fresh fruit. They also provide a modern approach that will go down well with the international palate. At the same time, the wine has background notes of blue flowers and delicate perfumes that remind you of the beautiful Tuscan territory.",88,Ruffino 2005 Riserva Santedame  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"Made with organically farmed fruit, this bright Vernaccia di San Gimignano would pair with appetizers or elaborate salad lunches. It's a lively, crisp expression with aromas of kiwi, green apple and dried grass.",86,San Quirico 2009  Vernaccia di San Gimignano,,,,
"The wine has weight, is warm and spicy, with bold fruit flavors. A fine wine from Angludet, it is ripe, the wood judiciously balanced, finishing with tight acidity.",89,Château d'Angludet 2009  Margaux,,,,
"Composed on the nose, this has a berry aroma and a controlled herbal-olive scent. It feels solid and round, with berry and herb flavors. The finish shows a hint of oak and chocolate.",87,Viña La Fortuna 2010 Culpeo Made with Organic Grapes Carmenère (Curicó Valley),,,,
"Intense and tightly wound, this Riesling gradually unfolds layers of white pepper, green plums and Key lime pie. The lingering quince-flavored finish is mouthwateringly crisp but not quite dry. Try with mushroom pasta. Drink now for the youthful fruit or wait a few years for more complexity.",88,D'Arenberg 2008 The Dry Dam Riesling (McLaren Vale),,,,
"A blend of Merlot (62%), Cabernet Sauvignon (23%), Malbec (6%), Cabernet Franc (5%) and Petit Verdot, this wine opens with aromas of cocoa powder, spice, dark cherries, savory herbs and flowers, displaying pleasing complexities. The palate is full of exquisitely balanced red and black-fruit flavors that sail off into the distance on the finish.",91,Brian Carter Cellars 2012 Le Coursier Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This wine's classic Albariño aromas of white flowers and stone fruit are simple and nice. It feels round and true but a touch flat. Thompson grape, melon and ripe apple flavors hold steady on the finish. Drink now.",88,Condes de Albarei 2016 Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"Campo del Tìtari Riserva is an incredibly intense and meaty wine with ripe berry notes, barbecue smoke and exotic spice. You'll also get some chalky, mineral notes at the back and the wine is velvety in the mouth with drying tannins.",92,Brunelli 2003 Campo del Tìtari Riserva  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),,,,
"By its very name, this is the top wine from this estate in the Tarn region, which is close to Gaillac. It is powerful, with a medicinal and bitter chocolate edge. The fruit is firm, darkly tannic, rich and worth aging.",90,Domaine D'en Ségur 2007 Grande Réserve Red (Côtes du Tarn),,,,
"Heaps of earthy compost provide seductive intrigue to the opening of this wine. It continues satisfactorily on the palate, a piquant expression of black cherry, black tea and lingering acidity wrapped in a medium, softly layered body.",92,Expression 38 2013 Sun Chase Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Fragrant blue flower, red berry and balsamic notes set the tone for this delicious red. The elegantly structured palate delivers wild cherry, crushed raspberry and chopped mint flavors, a potpourri of dark spice lingering through the finish. It's enjoyable now but promises fine drinking over the next several years. Drink through 2022.",92,Le Potazzine 2015  Rosso di Montalcino,,,,
"With scents and flavors of chocolate-covered cherries, this pretty and accessible Pinot Noir promises a bit more than it delivers. The light cherry fruit turns a bit earthy and tannic as it winds into a quick finish.",86,Silvan Ridge 2010 Freedom Hill Vineyard Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"For a Bordeaux rosé, this is an unusual blend with 80% Cabernet Franc. That gives the wine its fine perfumed character and light touch of tannin. It makes for a fresh attractive wine that is drinkable now.",85,Monsieur Touton 2015 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),,,,
"This complex, tightly wound effort from a four-acre block planted to a single clone tastes of luxurious caramel and toasted oak, its flavors superimposed over a backdrop of forest-like scents.",90,Iron Horse 2014 Winery Block Pinot Noir (Green Valley),,,,
"Very pale in color, this soft and gently fruity wine is almost ethereal in its lightness. It's fresh with attractive acidity, a touch of red currant and orange and refreshing at the end.",87,Chateau Peyrassol 2014 Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"It opens with pretty aromas of orange blossom and tropical fruit. The palate offers lemon zest, nectarine and white peach with a mineral undertone.",88,Valle dell'Acate 2013 Zagra Grillo (Sicilia),,,,
"Focused in the mouth with just a touch of creaminess, the Logan offers pear and nutmeg flavors, and a hint of green apple on the finish. It's not a mouthfilling, overly flashy wine, but this could be a good thing if you're pouring it with dinner. Try it with your first-course seafood dish.",86,Logan Australia 1999 Reserve Chardonnay (Orange),,,,
"Bright tangerine and wet stone notes kick off the palate in this light-bodied Chardonnay. As it opens, those notes develop into more defined lemon and tart green apple flavors. It's nice, vibrant and ready for salty food.",91,Brick & Mortar 2015 Fort Ross Vineyard Chardonnay (Fort Ross-Seaview),,,,
"Though Grüner doesn't have a reputation in Austria for ice wine as do other varieties, based on the strength of this wine, maybe it should. It has a great balance between toffee sweetness and high acidity, the intensity softened and broadened by spice and toffee.",90,Schloss Gobelsburg 2006 Eiswein Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),,,,
"This medium-sweet, fruity wine is both light and crisp. Attractive acidity contrasts with the sparkling texture and the sugared citrus. It's very ready to drink.",84,Casa de Vilacetinho 2013 Vilacentinho White (Vinho Verde),,,,
"This is a tight, structured wine that shows more tannin than fruit. It has a lean austere character that needs to soften. Acidity at the end does show evidence of red currant and berry fruits. It will certainly be better if drunk after 2017.",85,Falua 2012 Tercius Touriga Nacional (Tejo),,,,
"One wants to be kind to this wine, which seeks to be affordable to everyone who desires a Pinot Noir. It's dry and silky, with simple cherry candy and cola flavors.",83,Insatiable 2012 Pinot Noir (California),,,,
"The vintage as well as the vineyard gave this hugely rich wine. It has weight, concentrated fruit and toast flavors, the acidity on line right through the center. Peach, pineapple and grapefruit combine to give an impressive, textured fruitiness. Age for 2–3 years.",93,Olivier Leflaive 2009 Charmes Premier Cru  (Meursault),,,,
"This is a fancy Pinot Noir for drinking now with upscale fare such as lamb or steak. Vibrant in acidity, its light to medium body frames delicate, complex flavors of cherries, heirloom red tomatoes, persimmons and savory spices.",88,Sonoma-Cutrer 2011 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This 57-43 blend piquantly shows off the varietal characters of both grape varieties in its combination of citrus and pepper notes. It's like a collision of lime and jalapeño, but the wine's modest intensity makes it more of a fender-bender than an ambulance call, and the finish fades a little too quickly.",86,Leeuwin Estate 2005 Siblings Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Margaret River),,,,
"This ripe, concentrated and structured wine is produced from old vines. Blackberry fruits and rich tannins give it a dry core. The acidity and the final balance suggest that this wine should age further. Drink from late 2017.",90,Casa Santos Lima 2013 Reserva Red (Lisboa),,,,
"This very ripe and full-bodied wine has aromas like vanilla and baking spices, sweet cherry flavors and a smooth and rounded texture. A luscious cherry-pie impression lingers on the finish.",88,Deaver 2012 Zinfandel (Amador County),,,,
"Exquisite lightness and weightless charm are the two obvious hallmarks of this wine. The merest touch of citrus appears on the nose. The palate has the same restraint and lemony fruit, pitched against a light froth of tiny bubbles. It's lithe and bright, with a dry, brisk finish.",91,Arthur Metz NV 1904 Cuvée Spéciale Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),,,,
"A high-toned, brisk Chardonnay, packed with aromas and flavors of minerals, saline, umami, tropical fruit and spices. Feels rich and opulent in the mouth, with fine oak and a touch of leesy cream. A Chardonnay of great craftsmanship.",91,Sanguis 2009 Ode to Sunshine Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"Aromas of rose, fragrant blue flower, pressed powder, perfumed berry and a whiff of leather emerge on this delicious red. The smooth, succulent palate delivers a great depth of flavor, including juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper, star anise and chopped herb. Silky tannins provide the framework.",94,Il Macchione 2009 Riserva  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),,,,
"Crushed sea shells, candied lemon rinds and wafts of petrol greet the nose on this wine by widely respected vintners Greg Brewer and Steve Clifton. The tight and pithy palate shows Key lime and pear flesh but leans toward tropical, with hints of pineapple and guava. It's quite stony at first, then opens toward honey on sourdough toast. Drink 2017–2027.",92,Brewer-Clifton 2012 Acin Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"An earthy, smoked meat and plum nose leads into luscious berry and pepper flavors in this affordable Shiraz. Balanced acidity and fruit offer freshness and zest with dimension. The mouthfeel is full and pleasing. Pair with smoked meat or grilled spicy chicken.",87,Blue Cove 2007 Shiraz (Western Cape),,,,
"Opaque in color, with heady aromas of berry fruits, copious oak and minerality, this is a generous and fiery red blend. In the mouth, the feel is hot and edgy; flavors of molasses, roasted berry fruits and smoked meat finish hollow.",88,Las Vertientes 2011 Benchmark Reserva Red (Mendoza),,,,
"Honey blossom and grassy aromas are all right, but struggle to offer much fruit. An oily, full palate is home to honeyed flavors of peach, nectarine and melon. Bitterness is a major player on a chunky finish. The blend is 45% Riesling, 43% Chardonnay and 12% Viognier.",84,Anakena 2013 Ona Special Reserve Riesling-Chardonnay-Viognier White (Leyda Valley),,,,
"This small-production wine features light but potent aromas of lychee, orange, honey, wild flowers and spice. It's fairly lean and elegant on the palate, with exotic spice and tropical fruit flavors. Short and pithy on the finish but nice for Chilean Gewürztraminer.",87,Matetic 2011 Corralillo Gewürztraminer (San Antonio),,,,
"From one of the state's most highly regarded vineyards, this boasts beguiling aromas of milk chocolate, plum, barrel spice, vanilla, herb and coffee. Lightly smoky, sensuous fruit and barrel flavors follow, showing more elegance than this often brawny appellation is known for.",90,Januik 2014 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),,,,
"The second vintage of this specific block, Home is spicy in notes of orange oil and peel, with a hint of rose water. Soft, integrated tannins and a touch of graham cracker play off of juicy blackberry and plum flavors, finishing with glimmers of black and red licorice.",93,Iron Horse 2013 Home Block Pinot Noir (Green Valley),,,,
"Savory, dusty notes of bramble wood, earth and mineral lend an unusually rustic shadow to this Gewürztraminer. It's quite lean on the palate but brisk lemon and tangerine flavors are refreshing.",85,Bedell 2013 Gewürztraminer (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"A light-drinking, high-acid white that's crisp with layers of floral-laced citrus and herb. An enjoyable sipping wine or one that'll pair easily with fresh seafood.",86,Monte Volpe 2012 Sesso White (Mendocino County),,,,
"Fermented and aged briefly in wood, this is dry, intense and toasty while still giving space for white fruits and some citrus. Richly endowed, spicy, and tangy, its structure and tight texture mark it out as a Champagne for long-term aging. The aftertaste is brisk, packed with acidity and with reminiscences of the oak-aging in the vanilla finish. Drink this bottling from 2018.",95,Billecart-Salmon NV Brut Sous Bois  (Champagne),,,,
"This is a heavily oaked Carmenère, so aromas of caramel, vanilla and licorice share space on the bouquet with stewed, foresty notes. Plump and saturated in feel, this is more mellow and soft than tough or tannic. Roasted blackberry, toast and spicy oak flavors end big and heavily, with leftover oak and herbal notes. Drink through 2018.",90,Santa Rita 2011 Pehuén Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"Grassy white-fruit aromas are basic. This feels soft and easy, with mild acidity. Basic white-fruit flavors are undistinguished and are mellow on the finish. Everything about this brut strikes as good but standard.",87,Mistinguett NV Brut Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"Forced together and not happily married is the only way to describe this dysfunctional coupling of sweet, tropical Torrontes and heavy, cloying Chardonnay. Too sweet for most palates, with a heavy dosage of melon, lychee and table sugar.",80,Caligiore 2007 Grazioso Chardonnay-Torrontes White (Mendoza),,,,
"This attractive, bright white opens with aromas of orange, green apple flesh and barely-ripe white peach. The light-weight mouth offers more of the same, alongside notes of melon rind and soft brioche. A slight creaminess is countered by brisk acidity, ending clean and refreshing. Drink now.",89,Morgenhof 2011 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Simonsberg-Stellenbosch),,,,
"The only rosé made from Durell Vineyard, this one employs 100% Pinot Noir for a subtle, light, dry wine that's refreshing in strawberry and peach. Having spent six months in neutral French oak, it's structured and midweight, just right for the table.",88,Dunstan 2013 Durell Vineyard Rosé (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"This is one of the most exciting wines of the vintage for this label, a blend of 68% Bien Nacido and 32% from its sister vineyard, Solomon Hills. It shows Meyer lemon pith, chalk, pencil lead, grapefruit pith and a slight touch of yogurt on the nose. The chalk-driven, tingling-with-acidity palate opens onto brine-laced flavors of yellow grapefruit pith and expertly restrained pineapple and peach.",94,Liquid Farm 2014 La Hermana Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"Here is a straightforward Malbec that offers the expected mix of berry and herb flavors, plus a suggestion of minerality and a whiff of sweatiness. It's a good companion for a burger or a steak.",86,Seven Bridges 2008 Reserve Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This broad-textured, complex and indulgent Rhône-style blend has cedar, cola and blackberry aromas and concentrated fruit, earth and spice flavors. Milk chocolate richness emerges on the midpalate and plays through the finish.",90,Terra d'Oro 2013 No 735 Red (Amador County),,,,
"Should you be looking for a bright, low alcohol, fully dry, sappy, sassy and affordable Oregon Chardonnay, here it is. All stainless steel fermented and aged, it layers in lemon, grapefruit and apple, backed with ample crisp acidity.",90,Stoller 2016 Chardonnay (Dundee Hills),,,,
"This is mild and lightly oaked on the front end, with peach and apple notes. It feels narrow and focused, with honeyed apple, pear and melon flavors that aren't too sweet or candied. Light and simple feeling on the finish, with elegance.",87,Zuccardi 2011 Q Chardonnay (Mendoza),,,,
"For an entry-level bottling, this is a little stern at first. Hints of char and licorice issue forth after lengthy swirling, followed by vaguely berry-like flavors and mocha notes. Finally, dark fruit and spice emerge on the finish. Worth splashing in a decanter to wake it up prior to serving.",89,Carrick 2012 Unravelled Pinot Noir (Central Otago),,,,
"This Italian-inspired blend from Brutocao gets better every vintage. The 2005 contains Primitivo, Sangiovese, Dolcetto and Barbera. With a rich earthy, mushroomy, leathery quality to the cherry-blackberry fruit, it has a great balance of acids and tannins, and finishes bone dry. Ideal across a wide variety of foods.",91,Brutocao 2005 Quadriga Red (Mendocino),,,,
"This Cabernet Franc (70%) and Merlot blend brings aromas of green herbs, dark chocolate, flowers and a mixture of red and black fruit. It's soft in feel with polished fruit and barrel flavors that linger.",88,Columbia Crest 2013 Limited Release Gold Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Deep, dense raisin, prune and blackberry aromas set up a chunky palate that follows the nose. Blackened, slightly bitter flavors of baked berry fruits and licorice finish with some chop and heat along with a continuation of the wine's licorice flavor.",88,Bodegas Fabre 2014 Phebus Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"This is Riesling done in a forward and fruity style, showing a mix of peach, apple and pear flavors. Broad and accessible, it finishes with a sweet dusting of powdered sugar.",87,Thomas O'Neil Cellars 2010 Fahrenheit 100 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A quick first nosing suggests a vegetal quality, and yes, the wine does have a green streak to it. But overall it rounds out and opens to show herbal black-fruit flavors, tobacco, coffee and earth notes. It's tannic and clacky, maybe a touch aggressive, but it does improve with airing. Good Chilean Cab with typical Maipo herbal notes.",86,San Pedro 2008 1865 Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),,,,
"There's a forward lush, toasty character to this wine, which opens with smoky, oaky notes alongside fruity tones of pink apple and rich melon. The round, broad palate offers more of the same, with flavors of creamed pear and buttery baked apple that are balanced by ample acidity, lending freshness to the close.",91,Capensis 2013 Chardonnay (Western Cape),,,,
"This Syrah-Xinomavro blend offers notes of clove and blueberry on the nose, followed by flavors of smoked meat, black fruit and cedar on the palate. It feels big, and it finishes with a clean, spirited flourish.",84,Alpha Estate 2008 Syrah-Xinomavro Red (Florina),,,,
"Compact, minerally aromas include notes of leather and licorice. Round and generous across the palate, this ripe, rooty tasting Malbec features flavors of blackberry and chocolate in front of a mildly raisiny finish. Drink this warm-vintage Malbec through 2019.",92,Terrazas de Los Andes 2009 Single Parcel Los Castaños Malbec (La Consulta),,,,
"Young, yeasty, almost to the point of being beery, this thin Sauvignon Blanc recalls a Vinho Verde. Cucumber and fennel flavors dominate, along with plenty of acidity.",85,Springhouse Cellar 2008 Drawing A Blanc Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Gorge (OR)),,,,
"This wine is comprised of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Pinot Noir, 7% Malbec, 2% Petit Verdot and the remainder Syrah and Zinfandel. Neutral oak and stainless steel both played a part in housing its mix of juicy charcuterie and nutty robust amounts of cassis and baked strawberry.",85,Rose & Thistle 2016 Rosé (Napa Valley),,,,
"Sunbaked plum and currant aromas are a touch spicy. In the mouth, this blend of 50% Monastrell, 25% Syrah and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon is full, tannic and mostly well balanced. Dense spicy plume and black-fruit plum flavors finish with rubbery grabby tannins.",88,Hacienda del Carche 2015 Taus Selección Red (Jumilla),,,,
"Gritty, oaky aromas of black cherry and herbs come with a heavy covering of forced, fake-smelling oak. This is blocky and chunky on the palate, with flavors of mint, plum and herbal berry fruits. Raisin, green-herb and spicecake flavors control the finish.",84,La Playa 2014 Block Selection Tinga Reserve Carmenère (Colchagua Costa),,,,
"This is a bright, effusive, estate-grown, unfiltered white, delineated by high-toned acidity and gorgeously floral aromatics. Planted originally in 1975 to heritage Wente clone Chardonnay by owner/winemaker Tom Dehlinger, its generosity of fresh apple and pear ride a voluptuous, balanced texture that's wholly satisfying, before meeting deeper hues of spicy, exotic tropical tones on the finish.",95,Dehlinger 2013 Unfiltered Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Notable for balanced elegance, this Cabernet is dry and complex in blackberry, currant, cassis and plum flavors. Oak gives it a lovely jacket of smoke. It's tough in tannins, and unlikely to age, so drink over the next 2–3 years.",89,St. Supéry 2010 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Only two acres in size, this southeast facing vineyard has produced a ripe, spicy wine. Soft peach and pineapple flavors are rich and opulent. A tang of acidity over the wood aging gives the wine shape. It is still young, so don't drink before 2018.",92,Château de Lavernette 2013 Vers Châne  (Pouilly-Fuissé),,,,
"Although known in the Douro as an increasingly essential component of Port and table wines, the Touriga Nacional is equally at home in the Dão. As here, it produces linear wines, very mineral, full of acidity with a perfumed elegance. This is a wine for aging over 4–5 years.",90,Borges 2009 Touriga Nacional (Dão),,,,
"Fresh and textural, with a leesy, mineral-soaked base, this pretty young wine showcases raspberry and cherry fruit, backed with supporting, refreshing acidity. The tannins are light, perfectly ripe, and nicely balanced against the juicy fruit flavors.",90,Patton Valley 2012 The Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This wine is stalky with wild blackberry fruits and spicy acidity. It has a crisp edge, with a fresh character that comes through the herbal tannic flavors. It is all youth and fruit, so will be better from 2016. Chill lightly before drinking.",85,Les Rocailles 2014 Saint-Jean-de-la-Porte Mondeuse (Vin de Savoie),,,,
"This field blend of 50% Grenache 32% Syrah and 18% Mourvèdre, the lots co-fermented, impresses with dense blue fruit and meat and lavender accents. Big and brawny on the palate, it reveals more leather and black pepper intrigue as it opens in the glass.",92,Abbot's Passage 2014 Points Unknown Red (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"Grapy, balsamic aromas of blueberry and wild brush come with a hint of animal fur. Hard, edgy and compact in feel, this tastes punchy, with a note of vinegar and plum skins to an otherwise black-fruit flavor profile. Shallow, raw and tannic on the finish.",87,Encanto 2012 Roble Mencía (Bierzo),,,,
"From one of the properties followed by the Marmande cooperative at the northern end of the Southwest region, this wine has black currant fruits that are filled out with some firm tannins. After five years, it is obvious that the tannins will remain, leaving a wine that is dry and stalky in character.",85,Cave du Marmandais 2011 Château de la Côte de France Red (Côtes du Marmandais),,,,
Aromas of corn on the cob and spice lead to lightly sweet-seeming medium-bodied fruit flavors that bring a sense of balance. It provides easy drinking appeal.,87,Shooting Star 2014 Aligoté (Washington),,,,
"A touch of passion fruit plays around the peach aromas on the nose. There is a lovely touch of smoke, too. The palate is off dry and the fruit is made richer, riper and more intense by the residual sweetness. Zesty lemony freshness acts as counterpoint. This is lovely, compact and full of fruit.",90,Frédéric Mallo 2015 Cuvée Saint-Jacques Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"Much better than the 2009, this Malbec opens with menthol, leather and herb aromas along with notes of berries. It feels deep, with a medium body and sweet, friendly, flavors of blackberry, brown sugar and chocolate. The finish tastes slightly candied.",88,Casarena 2010 Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Primitivo is a close relation to Zinfandel, and it slides easily into the Angel Vine lineup which includes four other Zins. This carries a touch more earthiness than the others, with darker fruits and a distinctive streak of espresso. Good grip and density mark this as the most muscular wine among the 2011's.",91,Angel Vine 2011 Primitivo (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Here's a clean and fresh selection, with bright citrus, grass, melon rind and pineapple core aromas. White peach and nectarine flavors flesh out the medium-weight palate, with ample acidity to keep the finish crisp and lively. Drink now.",88,Spier 2012 Vintage Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Coastal Region),,,,
"Ripe and full-bodied, this opens with aromas of mature black-skinned fruit, leather toast, licorice and menthol. The round, forward palate doles out juicy black cherry nutmeg, mocha and grilled sage offset by loosely knit tannins. Drink 2017–2022.",89,Il Valentiano 2011 Campaperi  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"This ripe, boldly made wine offers a rich tease of Dr Pepper that pleases the palate, before complex characteristics takes over. Black tea, forest floor, currant and spicy acidity are memorably interwoven with dense black fruit.",92,Peter Paul Wines 2014 Mill Station Road Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Richard Sanford and winemaker Nick de Luca are making wines to stand the test of time, including this bottling that offers dried roses, rust and light cranberry on the nose. The palate combines turned earth, dried fennel and chipped sandalwood with delicate raspberry and strawberry fruit. That ethereal lightness will concentrate with time and last decades. Drink 2019–2033.",93,Alma Rosa 2013 Barrel Select Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"There is something sonorous but restrained about the pure ripe pear notes on the nose of this wine. The palate falls into step: Lovely, pure and resonant pear fruit gently fills nose, mouth and mind. The finish is medium sweet and sustained—a very grown up wine that treads a very fine line between Pinot Gris' inherent generosity and freshness. Totally moreish. Drink 2017–2030.",93,Domaine Saint-Rémy 2015 Ehrhart Brand Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"From a vineyard once planted to Golden Delicious apples, this 100% varietal wine is herbal and a touch green, thin with chalky tannins and a taste of dried cranberries.",82,Toad Hollow 2012 Richard McDowell Vineyard Merlot (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This impressive blend of Sangiovese and Merlot offers rich softness and a smooth texture backed by ripe aromas of red fruit, cinnamon spice, chocolate and mocha. The tannins also show softness and the wine would pair with choice cuts of succulent meat.",93,Canneto 2007 Filippone Red (Toscana),,,,
"Good price for a Chardonnay that's as good as many others costing far more. It's rich in pineapple, pear and oak flavors, brightened with zesty acidity.",86,Sawbuck 2009 Chardonnay (California),,,,
"Big tannins give this wine a powerful structure. It has a dense texture that is slowly revealing the sweet-tasting fruit. Powerful and concentrated, it has a long future.",93,Château le Bon Pasteur 2009  Pomerol,,,,
"Baking-spice, dark-chocolate, vanilla and cocoa aromas resonate on this barrel-forward wine. The palate brings luscious dark-fruit and dark-chocolate flavors, with grainy tannins backing it up. It shows some warmth on the finish.",87,Mount Si 2013 Arianses Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Wahluke Slope),,,,
"The nonvintage blend from this producer reveals the house style with its crisp character, tangy citrus fruits and great acidity. It is floral, fruity while also sitting on the dry side of Brut. Drink this finely balanced wine now.",89,Boizel NV Brut Réserve  (Champagne),,,,
"A blend of 20 varieties from the Mediterranean and the Caucasus, the wine's aromas are muddled: There's a bit of blackberry, plum, horsehide, cow pasture, tar and old leather in here. But this primordial brew offers a fascinating glimpse at the roots of wine.",86,Podere Guado al Melo 2004 Jassarte Red (Toscana),,,,
"A gamy, slightly stemmy and rubbery style of Bonarda that reflects the variety, Mendoza's terroir and the vineyard. Which doesn't mean that it's great; far from it, the wine is good but stemmy, with green-ish notes and reedy accents infiltrating the red-fruit flavors that control the palate. Solid and structured, but still it leaves something to be desired.",85,La Posta 2006 Estela Armando Vineyard Bonarda (Mendoza),,,,
"This wine is on the sweet side of crisp, with ripe strawberry and plenty of acidity. It is a wine to chill, with its bright aftertaste and slight prickle on the tongue. Drink now.",84,Enoport 2016 Mapreco Rosé (Vinho Verde),,,,
"Dry and tannic, but a bit raw and hard in the mouth, and doesn't seem to be an ager. You'll find modest flavors of black currants, cherries and cola. Drink now.",85,Silverado 2005 Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"Lighter in color than many 2012s from Santa Barbara County, this wine begins with an inviting nose that offers scents of strawberry-infused balsamic vinegar and sandalwood. Once sipped, it's light and crisp, but surprisingly powerful, with cranberry, pomegranate and a leather finish.",90,Lucas & Lewellen 2012 Goodchild High 9 Vineyard Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"If this Merlot had greater flavor intensity, it would be spectacular. It's a very nice photocopy of a great Merlot, meaning that the berry and spice fruit is soft in focus but pleasurable. A great value—dry and classy in its own way.",86,Oak Grove 2010 Reserve Merlot (California),,,,
"Among an outstanding lineup of well-defined, beautifully refined Pinots from Le Cadeau, the Diversité takes top honors. Sourced from the winery's vineyard in the Chehalem Mountains, it shows excellent varietal character, with exceptional depth and detail. It beautifully melds the notes of mixed red fruit, light earth, and sensitively-applied barrel.",94,Le Cadeau 2010 Diversité Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This opens with crisp and attractive spice and almond flavors. They go with the acidity, lemon and apple notes to give a balanced, complex wine. Drink from mid-2018.",88,Château Dubraud 2016  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,,,,
"Air-dried Moscato Giallo grapes are pushed to the extremes in terms of their intensity and staying power. This opulent selection offers thick layers of candied fruit, apricot, honey, caramel and marzipan. The flavors are delicious and long-lasting.",93,Kellerei Kaltern Caldaro 2008 Serenade Passito Moscato Giallo (Alto Adige),,,,
"This is a well-priced white that shows Trebbiano's easy and fresh side, with notes of cut grass, citrus and honey. Great for pairing with grilled tuna or salad.",85,Talamonti 2011 Trebì  (Trebbiano d'Abruzzo),,,,
"Bruised apricot, lemonade and citrus rind-laden marzipan notes hit the nose on this wine, which is showing just a touch of nutty, honeyed oxidization. The macadamia nut element arises on the palate too, alongside intriguingly peaty flavors reminiscent of Scotch, with almond liqueur on the outro. It presents decent acidity throughout.",88,Wrights Station 2012 Reserve Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"The nose is rather shy but eventually reveals aromas of dried black fruit, sunbaked earth, pressed flower and a touch of menthol. The solid medium-bodied palate offers black cherry, coffee and clove framed in close-grained tannins. Drink soon.",88,Barone Cornacchia 2011 Vizzarro  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo Colline Teramane),,,,
"Green pear, candied lemon rinds, sharp lime pith and a bit of struck-match smoke arise on the nose of this appellation blend from the veteran winemaker, one of the few working inside the city limits of San Luis Obispo. There's lots of clean, fresh energy on the palate, powered by flavors of green apple skins, Mexican lime juice, a pinch of dill and a flash of butter on the finish.",91,Stephen Ross 2013 Chardonnay (Edna Valley),,,,
"This is a 100% Cabernet. It has deep, ripe flavors of black currants, licorice and raspberries, with hints of dark chocolate and toast. The tannins and acids are a bit fierce, suggesting that a few years in the cellar are warranted.",89,St. Francis 2010 Lagomarsino Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This cuvée, named after a statue in the vineyards, is dark and dense. There is a strong chewy character to this wine which is obviously much too young to drink now. The dark fruits are surrounded by considerable tannic structure. It is powerful and concentrated, perhaps all too much. Drink from 2020.",91,Domaine de Cause 2012 Notre Dame des Champs Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"The aromas of mineral, spice, toast, yellow apple and lemon pith are light but enchanting. The palate is medium bodied and refined, demonstrating judicious use of oak and a lengthy finish that shows some warmth.",90,Efeste 2014 Lola Evergreen Vineyard Chardonnay (Ancient Lakes),,,,
"This is a bold, very ripe and full-bodied wine that has a good frame of firm tannins and acidity to give it an appetizing texture. While packed with plump, almost sweet flavors like blackberry jam, it is nicely dry and well balanced, leading to a lingering finish that last for 30 seconds.",92,Uvaggio 2015 Radix Vinea Zinfandel (El Dorado),,,,
"Darkly rich, this is a smooth, sophisticated wine that packs a punch of tannin under all its opulent black fruit. From a single parcel of the La Rosa vineyard named for the intense heat there in summer, it's concentrated and dense, with a great future ahead of it. Drink from 2022.",94,Quinta de la Rosa 2014 Vale do Inferno Reserva Red (Douro),,,,
"Crushed violet, baking spice, scorched earth, ripe black-skinned fruit and a whiff of leather meld together on this velvety red. The round, ripe palate doles out raspberry jam, dried black cherry, raisin, ground pepper and licorice accompanied by firm, polished tannins. Drink 2016–2021.",90,Tenuta Santa Maria alla Pieve 2009  Amarone della Valpolicella,,,,
"Electric acidity penetrates through this sumptuously fruity wine full of rich white-peach and grapefruit flavors. Vibrantly fresh and floral, it's sharpened by a razor's edge of minerality that lingers through the finish. It's gorgeous now for its ebullience and youth but should improve well into the 2020's.",93,Balthasar Ress 2015 Schloss Reichartshausen Spätlese Riesling (Rheingau),,,,
"This is three-quarters Pinot Noir, 15% Pinot Meunier and 10% Chardonnay. It's a thoroughly captivating rosé, with Champagne-like finesse. Concentrated flavors deftly mingle cherry, green citrus and herb, with a lovely mineral base.",92,Argyle 2012 Brut Rosé Sparkling (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Invigorating sprays of fresh green herbs perfume this dry, richly structured Silvaner. Concentrated with ripe gooseberry and green melon flavors, it's pleasantly plump and clingy on the palate. A spray of lime acidity highlights the finish.",90,Michael Fröhlich 2014 Escherdorfer Lump Erste Lage Silvaner (Franken),,,,
"Aromas like cedar and mint are attractive and tempting. Concentrated black-cherry flavors fill out a broad mouthfeel and lingering finish. A fine-grained layer of tannins adds structure, keeping everything balanced.",91,Langtry 2012 Tephra Ridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Lake County),,,,
"This atypical Chilean red hails from the Maule Valley and eschews oak and ripeness and instead delivers wiry raspberry, currant and dried-earth aromas in front of a high-acid, racy palate that's medium in body. Snappy, spicy red plum and raspberry flavors are fresh and edgy, with scraping acidity creating a zesty, scrubbing finish. Drink through 2020.",90,Clos des Fous 2012 Cauquenina Viñas Viejas de Cauquenes Red (Itata Valley),,,,
"Big and earthy, with char, savory spice and black fruit aromas. The palate is full and bold, with ripe tannins and delicious flavors of herbs, baked berries, integrated spice and leather. Smooth, long and muscular; made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère and Syrah.",91,Anakena 2008 Ona Red (Rapel Valley),,,,
"Intensely dark aromas of black currant, char, roast beef and a slight bit of gamy funk show on the very masculine nose of this bottling by San Jose-based vintner Adam Comartin. There is bountiful acidity on the sip and thick mouthcoating tannins, allowing the black fruit and caramel flavors to penetrate deep into the finish.",91,Comartin 2014 Rodney's Vineyard Petite Sirah (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Simple floral and sweet-fruit aromas are good, while the palate runs creamy and thick, with dull-edged plum, berry and chocolate flavors. This is a round, uncut wine that fits the description of your basic country crianza. Imported by USA Wines Inc.",84,Viña Altaba 2003 Crianza Bobal (Manchuela),,,,
"Red fruit dominates in this tightly woven, firmly tannic wine, blended with 9% Petite Sirah. Hints of charred campfire oak support black pepper, cinnamon and berry, the texture smooth and soft.",88,Decoy 2014 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),,,,
"After a low period, Siran has come back in 2010 with this solid, tannic, firm and serious wine. There is plenty of blackberry flavor to flesh out the structure, resulting in a wine for medium-term aging.",92,Château Siran 2010  Margaux,,,,
"A blend of Sangiovese and Canaiolo, this is a richly concentrated red that would pair with pork, lamb or hearty lasagna with beef sauce. An easy dinner wine to share with friends, it is redolent of blackberry, spice and cured meat.",88,Arnaldo Caprai 2008 Anima Umbra Red (Umbria),,,,
"On display are the requisite Cayuse flavors of funk, savory herb and composted earth, with moderately ripe black fruits in the background. A whiff of pine needles and plenty of forest floor accents complete the picture.",93,Cayuse 2011 Armada Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),,,,
"Hard, stringy tannins give a tough astringency to this 100% Cabernet. Partly they're from grape skins and partly from 100% new oak barrels. There's a huge core of black currants, however, and the finish is dry and balanced. Will it age? Almost certainly. Give it at least eight years in a good cellar, and it could go well beyond that.",90,Meander 2009 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),,,,
"This is a light wine, with fresh berry fruits and acidity that delineate the structure. It's already an easy wine to drink, hinting at minerality and finishing softly.",86,Casca Wines 2011 Monte Cascas Colheita Red (Douro),,,,
"Chunky, slightly rubbery aromas revolve around black fruits and oak. This is a dense, thick wine with blackberry, plum, fig and bitter chocolate flavors. The finish is dark and weighty in this meaty Malbec.",90,DiamAndes 2011 de Uco Malbec (Uco Valley),,,,
"Made from 100% Cabernet, this is a great house wine for the price. It's dry, full-bodied and tannic, with proper black currant, blackberry, mocha and oak flavors. Easy to find, with 20,000 cases produced.",86,Alias 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),,,,
"Like many Chilean Pinots, this starts out funky as a three-legged llama. The bouquet pumps bramble, dusty country road and roasted berry fruit. But with time it settles and unfolds, and in the end there's sweet herbal fruit flavors along with spice and vanilla. Voilà! It's honest PN from Chile.",87,Montes 2006 Limited Selection Pinot Noir (Casablanca & Leyda Valleys),,,,
"Could almost be Zinfandel, it's so spicy and briary, with wild berry, red currant and tobacco flavors. But it's lighter in body, with the silky texture of Pinot Noir, and drier than any Zin could be. A lovely, complex and food-friendly wine.",90,Quivira 2007 Wine Creek Ranch Grenache (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"The primary aromas of ripe strawberry and raspberry preserves are of mild intensity, and a touch of faded vanilla adds dimension. Succulent acids and dusty tannins lend the medium-bodied palate support.",87,Fabbioli Cellars 2011 Cabernet Franc (Virginia),,,,

"Based in Vértus, at the southern end of the Côte des Blancs, Colin is a family-owned grower.

There is some tight minerality and the wine is finely in balance.",90,Colin NV Blanche de Castille Premier Cru Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),,,,
"Aromas suggest underbrush, coffee and a hint of meat juices. The palate delivers dense black raspberry accented with grilled herbs, vanilla and light toasted notes alongside the heat of evident alcohol. It's monolithic and ready so drink soon.",86,Fornacina 2012  Rosso di Montalcino,,,,
"This stalky and fruity wine has fresh red-currant flavors that are backed up by dry tannins. It is a light wine, as much fruit as texture, and is likely to age quickly. Drink from 2017.",86,Château Hauchat 2013  Fronsac,,,,
"Entirely varietal, this wine is simple in its embrace of peach, pineapple and guava flavors, leaning ripe and bright atop a direct hit of freshness.",88,Folie à Deux 2016 Pinot Gris (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Gritty aromas of charred beef and tar lead to a tight, drawing palate with hard tannins. Balsamic flavors of roasted plum, blackberry and green herbs finish tight, grating and with residual tannic bite. If you know Chilean Carmenère, this fits the mold.",88,Viña Bisquertt 2014 Ecos de Rulo Single Vineyard El Chequén Estate Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"A lovely Syrah. With its touch of spicy bacon, it shows lush flavors of blackberries, black pepper and sandalwood, wrapped into firm but gentle tannins. Easy to drink with garlicky roast lamb.",89,Newsome-Harlow 2006 Syrah (Calaveras County),,,,
"A wisp of smoke lends a sultry tone to fresh pear in this dry, supple wine. It's ripe and rich on the palate, but maintains the lean, steely acidity ubiquitous to this vintage. Finishes long with rolling mineral notes.",91,Schloss Johannisberger 2013 Silberlack Trocken GG Riesling (Rheingau),,,,

Cranberry and fennel elements entertain the nose on this widely available wine. Raspberries and black licorice show on the light and easy palate.,85,Magnolia Court 2013 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),,,,
"Nothing fancy about this dry, plummy wine, but it gets the job done. Shows ripe currant, tobacco and herb flavors wrapped into firm tannins.",84,Sobon Estate 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Amador County),,,,
"Extra sweetness and density give this wine a full and generous personality. Dry Proseccos usually show a little extra peach juice and nectarine, as this wine does, without being heavy or cloying.",87,Bortolotti NV Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
"Blueberry, plum and cardamom aromas include a whiff of wood smoke. A balanced palate has energy along with brambly berry and chocolate flavors. A chewy, solid finish is good but less lively than the palate.",88,Rubus 2014 Icon Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"A more traditional type of crianza with vanilla, spice, dry berry fruit and a quiet, subtle approach. The mouthfeel is Old World with it's clean, dusty weight and proper acid-tannin balance, and the flavors of spice, cherry, dried currant and earth don't overstep their place. Very nice wine for under $20.",89,Valserrano 2006 Crianza  (Rioja),,,,
"This white wine from Serbia has aromas of caramelized pineapple and elderflower. It is lively and energetic, with flavors of Japanese apple and ripe pineapple.",87,Milijan Jelić 2011 Morava (Pocerina),,,,
"Herbal and peppery, with a brambly character to the cranberry/raspberry fruit, this seems to be hiding the influence of aging in 25% new French oak. Extra time in the bottle could bump up the score.",87,Purple Hands 2012 Barron Wahl Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),,,,
"A pleasant surprise, this budget-priced Viognier shows plenty of plump fruit without getting overly big or blowsy. Citrus and pineapple flavors reflect the moderate alcohol levels, finishing on a juicy, succulent note. Drink now.",87,Tall Poppy 2006 Reserve Viognier (South Eastern Australia),,,,
"In a three-pack of 2014 Pinots from Saffron Fields, this shows reserve-level density and extra complexity. Tart and juicy berry fruit gathers into a concentrated midpalate, buoyed with a refreshing, mineral-laced acidity. The raspberry and cherry fruit resonates well into a citrus-tinged finish. Tuck this away for awhile longer, and drink 2020–2028.",92,Saffron Fields Vineyard 2014 Pinot Noir,,,,
"Rich, elaborate and layered. If this Cab were a fabric, it would be suede. Shows the tannins and minerals of Diamond Mountain, with potent flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, cola, anise and sweet smoky oak. The finish is wonderfully dry, firm and long. Should develop for at least eight years.",94,Wallis Family Estate 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),,,,
"Light and ethereal in color, this vineyard-designated wine has a thinness. It's also marked by a funky herbal taste that can best be described as bouquet garni, but especially sage, veering into tomato leaf.",85,Bailiwick 2012 Sangiacomo Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"A good Zinfandel, dry, crisply acidic and rugged in tannins, with cherry-berry and spice flavors with a hint of tobacco and leather. But there's a green, vegetal streak that detracts. Drink now.`",84,Lake Sonoma 2007 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"This is all about the essence of red cherry, made complex with layers of violet, sweet tobacco and red licorice. There's plenty of toasty new oak, too. It's one of the prettier California Grenaches out there.",90,Melée 2010 Grenache (California),,,,
"Pretty straightforward Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, but done well, featuring passion fruit, pink grapefruit and melon aromas and flavors that end on a gently herbal note.",90,Framingham 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"More flush and generous than the Vertus 100% Tempranillo, this blend of 50% Tempranillo and 50% Cabernet is bold but not heavy, with a medium body and clean, direct flavors of red berry and plum. It shows dashes of pepper and spice on the medium-long finish.",86,Bodegas Iranzo 2010 Vertus Wine Made with Organically Grown Grapes Cabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo (Utiel-Requena),,,,
"A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% Merlot and 4% Petit Verdot, this wine offers a bouquet that is equal parts black plum and green pepper.

"Made of 48% Sangiovese, 35% Montepulciano, 10% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has black-skinned fruit and baking spice aromas.

"A healthy mix of boysenberries and strawberry preserves form the core aromas, with touches of spiced toast and purple flower.

The flavors would benefit from a boost of concentration.",83,Gadino 2010 Antiche Viti Reserva Cabernet Franc (Virginia),,,,
"Subtle oak, toast, espresso and mature black fruit aromas lead the nose. The youthfully assertive palate displays coffee bean, crushed dark cherry, vanilla, black raspberry and black pepper alongside drying wood tannins. Drink after 2018.",89,Boroli 2010  Barolo,,,,
"This opens with rose petal, red-skinned berry and cake spice aromas. It's bright and easy drinking on the palate, with Morello cherry, raspberry jam and cinnamon flavors. Vibrant acidity and smooth tannins lend easygoing support. Enjoy through 2020.",88,Caldera 2015  Barbera d'Asti,,,,
"Welcoming but basic cassis and berry aromas carrry a leathery accent and a hint of rubber. The palate is mildly creamy and comfortable, with cassis, cherry and plum flavors but little beyond that. A clean finish cements this well-made wine's value position.",87,Santa Helena 2011 Selección del Directorio Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"Blended from Umpqua Valley and Eola Hills grapes, this is forward and fruit-driven, with a pleasant mix of apple and pear. Along with the fruit comes a base of minerality and an unusual streak of spearmint.",88,Seven Hills 2012 Pinot Gris (Oregon),,,,
"Hints of menthol and cherry cough drop are upfront on the nose. Flavors of red currant, rhubarb and sour raspberry appear on the crisp, tart palate, finishing clean yet short.",83,Patriarche Père et Fils 2014 Pinot Noir (Vin de France),,,,
"Aromas of woodspice, char, pickling spices and herbs are out in front of red and black fruit. The flavors are light and appealing, but ultimately the oak provides distraction.",87,Gordon Estate 2013 Estate Grown Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This alluring red blend start with aromas of cherry, blueberry, cedar and spice and leads into pretty layers of red berry, cherry and violets on the palate.

"Falcone's fourth release of this non-vintage blend solidifies its placement as a fine, complex wine to drink over the next several years.

"A rich wine, full and fruity up front, then opening up into a much more mineral, textured character. It is a great explosion of citrus, pear and green apple, the wood aging showing with subtlety. It's a wine for aging, complex and tight at the end.",95,Domaine Leflaive 2010 Les Pucelles Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),,,,
"Il Drappo is a ripe, smokey and chewy expression of Nero d'Avola with plump fruit notes backed by blackberry and cherry nuances. The mouthfeel is rich, velvety and very soft. Pair this wine with spicy pork with barbecue sauce.",90,Benanti 2005 Il Drappo Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),,,,

"You can't compare Borobo to anything else because what else is a blend of Carmenère, Cab Sauvignon, Syrah and Pinot Noir? Overall, this is a polished wine with tobacco, balsam wood and cedary berry aromas. The palate is soft and rich, with mellow tannins. Flavors of spice, berry and plum are slightly baked, and the finish keeps the mellow, fruity vibe going. Drink through 2018.",92,Lapostolle 2010 Borobo Red (Rapel Valley),,,,

"Basic everyday Pinot Noir. It's dry, with simple cola and cherry flavors, and a grating acidity.",83,Five Rivers 2008 Pinot Noir (California),,,,
"This is a smooth, intense wine that's very complex in its balance between acidity, green fruits and minerality. It's full of delicious fruit flavors, but shows a fine tension as well. Pepper just hints at the end. Screwcap.",91,Josef Jamek 2012 Ried Achleiten Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),,,,
"Sharp and candied, with Lifesaver sweet-and-sour cherries and cola softened with smoky wood notes. The tannins are sandpapery and firm. Drink now with rich beef and lamb.",87,Zepaltas 2008 Nunes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
With its typical perfumed fruit and firm tannins this is a ripe structured wine. It does suffer from the one-dimensional character that can come with a mono-varietal Touriga Nacional. That keeps the wine firm with good fruit although without great depth and complexity. Drink from 2017.,88,Quinta do Vallado 2013 Touriga Nacional (Douro),,,,
"This wine is absolutely what fans of traditional Rioja should be on the lookout for. It's smooth, elegant and complex on the bouquet, the perfect introduction to a firm yet classy palate, with berry, plum, spice, tobacco and vanilla flavors. Dry, toasty and just right on the finish.

Concentrated and dense, it finishes in dusty mocha.",88,Cornerstone 2012 Black Label Stepping Stone Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,

"The second vintage of this wine comes from a great Douro year. It gives structure, dark fruits and a serious tannic structure that has been rounded by wood aging. Spice, berries and mint flavors all contribute to this powerful, ageworthy wine. Drink from 2017.",92,Muxagat 2011 Cisne Red (Douro),,,,

"A spicy oaky nose is low on fruit, scattered and chocolaty. In the mouth, creamy oak and high acidity clash, while a lead flavor of chocolaty oak struggles to blend with tart saucy red-fruit notes. A milk chocolate flavor is most prominent on a hollow finish.",85,Taron 2014 4M  (Rioja),,,,
Black-cherry fruit and a soft tannic structure give this wine its fruity but firm character. It has plenty of ripe generous fruitiness that is sustained by the acidity and by the solid core of the wine. Drink starting from 2017.,92,Albert Bichot 2014 Domaine de Rochegès  (Moulin-à-Vent),,,,
"Aromas of toasted oak, vanilla and butterscotch carry over to the palate together with red apple skin and pear alongside fresh acidity. Not much fruit richness, but it's crisp and linear.",86,La Cappuccina 2011 San Brizio  (Soave),,,,
"The wine is rustically spicy, peppery and briary, with sandpapery tannins, but hey, it's Zinfandel, not Cabernet, and it's a really good one.

"This vineyard, just behind the Bourgeois winery, has the steepest slope in Sancerre. With a brilliant exposure to the sun it is capable of producing totally ripe rich wines. This example, packed with mango and apricot flavors, is far removed from an herbal character. Instead, it is exotic, ripe and likely to be ready to drink from 2019.",93,Henri Bourgeois 2015 La Côte des Monts Damnés  (Sancerre),,,,

"This Cabernet-dominant blend is drinking young, with firm, gripping tannins and a tight structure. There's plenty of black fruit flavors to flesh out the palate, along with complex nuances of licorice root, creme de cassis, cigar-box spice and a touch of bitter chocolate. Give it a few years in the cellar for the tannins to mellow a bit.",89,1848 Winery 2009 Reserve Cabernet Merlot (Galilee),,,,

"Labeled as a regional wine rather than as a Douro wine because of the Syrah in the blend, this is still a wine from the Noval estate. Dark in color and still showing firm tannins, this second wine of Noval is made to develop relatively quickly and is ready to drink now. Ripe blackberry flavors are already evident, followed by juicy acidity and some spice tannins.",89,Quinta do Noval 2011 Cedro do Noval Red (Duriense),,,,

"Among the four vineyards used by Angel Vine, the Avery stands apart for its detail, grip and length. Blue fruits take center stage—plums and berries—along with a tasty lick of coffee and chocolate.

"Massolino's Parafada Barolo is a stunningly beautiful wine with bold, confident aromas of black fruit, tobacco, cigar box, cherry cola, clove, nutmeg and vanilla bean.

"A complex blend that moves this wine into an international style. The wine is smooth, generous, almost opulent. It emphasizes rich red plum flavors, rounded out with jelly sweetness, the acidity coming with the a final burst of freshness. Unlike some of Heinrich's other reds, which need aging, this is ready to drink now.",89,Johann Heinrich 2006 Terra O. Red (Mittelburgenland),,,,
"Here's a good, robust red wine. It's not particularly Merlot-like, with its pepper, herb, cherry, red currant and cola flavors, wrapped into sticky tannins. But it's very dry and elegantly structured, and the alcohol is moderate. Fine with a nice steak or chop.",88,Murphy-Goode 2007 Merlot (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Earthy and perfumed berry aromas get this off to a good start. The palate is chewy and medium in size, with straightforward blackberry flavors backed by a blast of coffee. The finish dries out quickly, leaving a peppery aftertaste.",88,Carlos Serres 2011 Old Vines  (Rioja),,,,
"88-90 Barrel sample. The smoothest of ripe fruit with an exuberance of wood spice. The wine has generous tannins, but the finish feels a little rustic.",89,Château Reysson 2009 Barrel sample  (Haut-Médoc),,,,

"Lime, slate and floral aromas lead to an off-dry palate, with generous amounts of stone-fruit flavors. Floral notes persist on the finish.",89,Ryan Patrick 2015 Olsen Brothers Vineyard Riesling (Yakima Valley),,,,
"This Catalonian blend is a concentrated number with a narrow, fruit-forward nose and cheesy leather on the side. The palate is full, grabby and ripe; flavors of blackberry and cassis are jammy and dark. It finishes sweet in flavor and ultraripe in feel, with a syrupy aftertaste. Another year or two in bottle will help this settle down; drink through 2020.",90,Vinyes del Terrer 2010 Terrer d'Aubert Red (Tarragona),,,,

"This is the first time a Cabernet Franc has been made at Spring Valley since 2003. It's rich and earthy, tannic and concentrated, with plum and black cherry dusted with light mocha. Smooth and supple in the mouth, it glides into a tasty finish with toasted almonds.",91,Spring Valley Vineyard 2007 Katherine Corkrum Cabernet Franc (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"This is toasty and vanilla-laden, but stands out for its full-bodied, lush character and intense fruit, which powers through on the finish.",90,Château d'Esclans 2007 Garrus Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"Underbrush, tobacco leaf, leather, truffle and blackberry aromas take center stage along with whiffs of toast and fig. The palate shows black cherry, carob, bitter cocoa, white pepper and sage alongside bracing tannins that leave a drying finish.",92,Rivetto 2008 Leon Riserva  (Barolo),,,,
"Seemingly sweet and mellow, this tastes like white toast that has been spread with raspberry jam and butter, sprinkled with cinnamon and brown sugar. It's already drinking well.",86,Flocchini 2008 Saddle-Up Syrah (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"This Pinot Noir-dominant sparkler is nutty and perfumed, its honeysuckle scents bringing lightness and brightness to a meaty core of body and weight.",88,Mumm Napa 2012 Devaux Ranch Blanc de Noirs Sparkling (Napa Valley),,,,
"A blend of Zinfandel (41%), Sangiovese (34%), Lemberger (9%), Malbec (11%) and Merlot, this appealing wine suggests plum, currant and red fruit. It's supple in feel with cranberry and raspberry flavors backed by tart acidity.",90,Owen Roe 2013 Abbot's Table Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"No question the flavors are right on, erupting in mouthfilling blackberries, cassis, cherries, cola and chocolate, with anise and cinnamon-dusted smoky oak. Yet it feels a little soft and melted, and could use greater structural integrity. Drink now.",89,Obsidian Ridge 2006 Obsidian Ridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills Lake County),,,,
"This supple, easy-drinking Cabernet features appealing ripe cassis and vanilla shadings. Hints of black cherry and graham cracker add nuance, while the texture is a bit creamy on the midpalate, turning dusty on the finish. Drink now–2020.",89,Howard Park 2012 Miamup Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River),,,,
"This straightforward Amarone offers aromas of tobacco leaf and raisin. The palate presents prune and plum flavors accented by a hint of chocolate. It also shows the heat of the vintage and is evolving fast, so enjoy this soon.",89,Delibori 2009  Amarone della Valpolicella,,,,
"A crisp wine that's full of acidity, this has flavors of green fruit and pepper. It feels rich while still showing its fruity and lively aftertaste. Screwcap.",88,Felsner 2010 Rohrendorfer Gebling Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),,,,
"Bordeaux blends show promise in this region. This combination of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37.5% Merlot and 12.5% Cabernet Franc reveals rustic, leathery aromas of crushed Italian herbs, dried red cherries and fresh dill. Once sipped, flavors of fresh-ground coffee, oregano and bay leaf spice a base of cranberry fruit.",88,Falkner 2011 Meritage (Temecula Valley),,,,
"Try this bold and concentrated wine for a change of pace. Enormous aromas of fully ripe plums and cherries mix with savory, herbal accents. The flavors are rich and mouthfilling, dripping with prune, boysenberry and anise.",90,Fenestra 2011 Touriga Nacional (Livermore Valley),,,,
"Using grapes from the Taittinger brand's first vineyard at Château de la Marquetterie, this wine is a blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay aged partially in wood. It is rich and beautifully structured, with a sense of ripe fruit as well as the beginnings of maturity. A mineral edge adds to the complexity. Drink now.",95,Taittinger NV Folies de la Marquetterie Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"Initially a bit shy, this slowly opens in the glass to reveal aromas of ripe berry, leather, baking spice and a hint of scorched earth. The palate offers suggestions of raspberry compote, dried black cherry, vanilla and licorice alongside tightly wound tannins. A marked espresso note closes the finish. Drink after 2019.",89,Poderi Luigi Einaudi 2012 Terlo  (Barolo),,,,
"Red berry, tobacco and sweet oak lead on this exemplary Pinotage, whose mocha, red fruit and smoke flavors offer South African character with an elegant edge. It's balanced and smooth but still hearty enough to stand up to dishes like grilled, sliced meat and stew.",88,MAN Vintners 2007 Pinotage (Coastal Region),,,,
"Exotic spice and cedar notes mingle amidst plump red cherries and raspberries on the nose of this perfumed Pinot Noir. Firm tannins form a taut foundation to crisp, tart raspberry and currant flavors and savory nuances of dried herb and crushed granite. It's a remarkably elegant, squarely structured wine that should meld beautifully over the next decade.",94,Salwey 2012 Estate Dry Pinot Noir (Baden),,,,
"Red berry fruits great freshness and brightness to this fruity wine that has tight acidity as a balance. The wine is crisp, young and layers light tannins at the end.",85,Fiuza 2013 3 Castas Red (Tejo),,,,

"Produced in one of the estates belonging to the Lapalu family, this wine is soft, rounded and ready to drink now. Gentle tannins give shape and structure to the black currant-fruits that finish on a fresh, crisp note.",86,Château Lacombe Noaillac 2013  Médoc,,,,
"Aromas of violet, wild red berry and dark cooking spice lift out of the glass. The aromas carry over to the soft, straightforward palate accompanied by mellow but rather fleeting tannins.",87,La Braccesca 2014 Sabazio  (Rosso di Montepulciano),,,,
"Neutral, slightly briny aromas are fresh but low on fruit. This has a slightly plump feel but not a lot of length or depth. Short basic white-fruit flavors match the nose, while this Xarello finishes dry in feel and mildly briny in flavor.",87,Albet I Noya 2015 El Fanio Xarel-lo (Penedès),,,,
"This bottling shows rich kumquat, peach, pear and mango flavors, along with the brisk acidity of a well-grown Santa Maria Chardonnay. Yet it has the extra features of minerality and flintiness that make it especially memorable.",93,Alta Maria 2012 Bien Nacido Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"Very dark, iron-oxide-tinged fruit lures you in. There also is a lot of pepper on the nose. The palate is full of dark crushed fruit: juicy blackberry, aromatic blueberry and red cherry. The tannins are supple and there is lovely freshness to the palate. This is vibrant, juicy, smooth and aromatic. Drink now–2022.",91,Heinrich 2015 Vom Weingebirge Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),,,,
"Unusually, Tibouren (a red grape more often found further east near Nice) forms part of the blend of this wine along with white Clairette. The mix gives a spicy, very perfumed wine that has ripe apricot and raspberry fruits. A strong peppery undertow suggests this is more of a food wine.",91,Château Roubine 2015 Inspire Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"This medium- to full-bodied wine features hints of struck flint on the nose, then backs those up with round, ample flavors of fig and melon. It's a relatively soft, easy-drinking style with just enough complexity to satisfy.",88,Mohua 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"Penfolds' 2009 Yattarna blends fruit from Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia, but remains a lean, taut Chardonnay. Flavors are crisp and citrusy, primarily kumquat, lemon and lime at this young age. Give it several years to see if it comes around.",88,Penfolds 2009 Yattarna Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia),,,,
"Smoked beef and pork aromas with hints of flint, licorice and black currant show on the nose of this 45% Syrah, 43% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Petit Verdot blend.

Drink 2019–2033.",94,Daou 2013 Mayote Red (Adelaida District),,,,
"From a very hot and difficult vintage, this Chianti Classico has unusual aromas of dill, thyme and toasted oak that carry over to the palate. It's already evolved with a short finish.",85,Vignavecchia 2011  Chianti Classico,,,,
"High in acidity and upfront in pineapple, lemon, lime, green mint tea, vanilla and white pepper flavors, this Sauvignon Blanc has a sweet-and-sour taste. Made without oak, it's brilliantly clean and savory, but just a little too sweet.",86,Steelhead Vineyards 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),,,,
"Silky and delicate in texture, this nearly weightless Pinot Noir offers red cherry-berry aromas and flavors, laced with hints of blossoms and herbs. The tart finish lingers sweetly in an intriguing, paradoxical juxtaposition. Drink now–2025.",91,Two Paddocks 2015 The First Paddock Proprietor's Reserve Pinot Noir (Central Otago),,,,
"A delightfully light, crisp and well-rounded expression of the variety—aged in stainless steel—this has a beginning, middle and end, all well defined. The bouquet is part lime and part mint and cilantro, while the middle traffics in peach. The finish accents the acidity that's been there all along, refreshing and well balanced.",88,Geyser Peak 2014 River Ranches Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Truly herbaceous and aromatic, this is a crisp, clean, easy-drinking wine, with a fresh, bright line of acidity. Ready to drink now.",86,Domaine Laporte 2011 Le Bouquet Sauvignon Blanc (Val de Loire),,,,
"Light dried herbs, cigar box and cranberry aromas arise on the nose of this bottling from the Broken Earth team. It's zesty on the sip, with raspberry and cooked red-plum flavors that are spiced up by pepper and more dried herbs. It's a tad thin.",86,Pull 2012 Merlot (Paso Robles),,,,
"A huge Zinfandel, with ultraripe, powerful berry, cocoa, bacon and spice flavors. That tremendous power comes at the cost of exceptionally high alcohol, which gives the wine a chili pepper burn. Forewarned is forearmed.",88,St. Francis 2009 Montecillo Vineyard Kaarin's Terrace Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"Smooth, rich and mellow, this has flavors of chocolate, raspberry, cherry and buttered toast that almost taste sweet. The tannins and acids eventually kick in, and the finish turns nicely dry. Drink now.",87,White Oak 2009 Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"Earthy cranberry, black tea and spicy clove deliver a combination of savory and herb, the tannins of the wine soft and subtle. The finish is lean.",86,The Winery SF 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Dusty, earthy and herbal defines the nose on this minty Cab. There are also whiffs of animal and pickle on the bouquet. This feels raw and tight, with crisp acids and peppery, lightly herbal flavors of plum and berry. A minty, dry finish is slightly harsh.",83,Tamarí 2011 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"In honor of the firm's 130th anniversary and made in limited quantities, this enticing sparkler offers ethereal scents of fragrant wild flower, apple and pear that follow through to the vibrant, focused palate, alongside a lemony note. It's clean and crisp, with a pristine bone-dry finish.",90,Mionetto NV Cuvée Anniversario Brut  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
"Rubbery smelling at first, then earthy cherry and stewed fruit aromas emerge. Juicy and a bit pointed in terms of acidity, so it shocks the palate and pierces the cheeks. Tastes pulsing and ripe, with big red fruit flavors, candied sweetness, coconut and chocolate.",89,Ricominciare 2008 Altísimo Cabernet Franc (Uco Valley),,,,
"Textbook Napa Merlot. Flavors of green olives, blackberries,white chocolate and herbs, with a slight meatiness, are wrapped in delicate, fine tannins. The wine is very dry and feels great in the mouth. Has the stuffing to improve in the cellar for a few years.",91,Barlow 2000 Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"Smells and tastes like caramel and stewed cherry and blackberry flavors that taste overtly sweet. However, this rustic blend of Syrah and Sangiovese may have its fans.",80,Millésimé 2005 Scoprire Red (California),,,,
"Made with very old, ungrafted vines, this intense wine opens with aromas of toast, leather, espresso, ripe blackberry, spice and tobacco. The concentrated palate delivers ripe black cherry, dried plum, clove, leather and licorice alongside solid tannins and the warmth of alcohol.",92,Cantina Santadi 2010 Terre Brune  (Carignano del Sulcis),,,,
"Brisk and refreshing in the mouth, with stimulating acidity. But it's a little too sweet in the combination of jammy citrus fruit and smoky oak.",84,Cobblestone 2007 Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),,,,
"Spice, leather, pepper and plum mingle in this medium-weight effort. Purple fruits and intimations of ginger cookie are in play, with pretty baking spices on the finish.",88,Iris Vineyards 2014 Aroha Vineyard Syrah (Umpqua Valley),,,,
"All the elements are present in this young wine. It has plenty of red fruit, touches of plum and spice. The tannins are firm while leaving plenty of room for the fruit. A wine that will be comfortably drinkable from 2018.",89,Château de Parenchère 2014  Bordeaux Supérieur,,,,
"This wine is light in body but heavily perfumed. Clean fruit shows on the palate, with an addition of geranium aromas.",87,Quinta do Vale Meão 2015 Vintage  (Port),,,,
"Aromas of black raspberry, black cherry and a cinnamon spice are laid across a slate-driven minerality on the nose of this bottling. It's plush on the sip, with hibiscus and raspberry notes, lifted by pepper, camphor and white sage elements.",92,Mignanelli 2013 KW VIneyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"The aromas from this Dijon clone-planted vineyard start with sweet ripe peach until a touch of flint and sage emerge. The plush, creamy palate leans toward tropicality, also with peach and lime, plus a slight mustard bitterness.",91,Joullian 2012 RogerRose Vineyard Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),,,,
Initial tight acidity in this crisp wine gives way to smooth rich black fruits. This already has a fine balance with its ripe juiciness and delicious red-berry flavors. It is going to develop into a very fine wine. Drink from 2024.,95,Château Haut-Bailly 2014  Pessac-Léognan,,,,
"Flat, gritty aromas are a tad volatile. This nonvintage red feels oaky and raw, with prodding acidity. A rough mix of scouring red-berry fruit, briny notes and oak make for a marginal flavor profile, while the finish tastes briny and pickled.",83,Ignacio Marín NV Gabarda Red (Cariñena),,,,
"Quite dry on the palate, this seems less ripe than the previous vintage. The opening flavors are dominated by earth and stem—rather than fruit—followed by notes of baking spice, coconut and caramel.",87,DiStefano 2008 R Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This wine features a bouquet of cherry, pomegranate and freshly ground black pepper. It is well-balanced on the palate with flavors of pomegranate, strawberry, mace and anise. Smooth tannins are present into the bright yet lasting finish.",90,Tulip Winery 2013 Espero Red (Galilee),,,,
"Complex, integrated aromas of cola, herbal berry fruits, earth and oak are smooth and inviting. This blend of 50% each of Cabernet Sauvignon and Carmenère feels saturated, dense and right on. Exotic, oaky flavors of charred wood, coffee and chocolate are draped over berry and cassis fruit, while this is woody as well as long and graceful on the finish. Drink through 2021.",92,Neyen 2013 Carmenère-Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"Plump blackberry and ripe black cherries meet with caramel sauce and a hint of slate on this nonvintage exploration of Petite Sirah, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon. A sip reveals blackberry, dark chocolate, cola and a bit of smoke flavorings, proving plush yet brisk, ripe yet restrained with a rocky minerality.",94,Falcone NV Annate VI Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"The fruit flavors here are very good but simple: a wash of blackberry slathered in coffee, vanilla and sweet spice.",87,Dusted Valley 2009 Malbec (Wahluke Slope),,,,
"Rich and full-bodied, it starts with aromas of stone fruit, citrus and slate. The palate is loaded with ripe white peach, mineral and almond. Lively acidity brightens up the creamy texture.",88,Antonio Caggiano 2012 Devon  (Greco di Tufo),,,,
"Aromas of dried white flowers and citrus fruits are mild. This feels round pulpy and good. Flavors of melon and papaya aren't complex, but they satisfy. On the finish, this everyday Chardonnay is round in feel and tastes a touch salty.",87,Finca Sophenia 2016 Altosur Chardonnay (Tupungato),,,,
"Far and away the best of the newly released single vineyard red wines from Mercer Estates, this tightly wound Petit Verdot sports firm plum and cassis fruit, wreathed in smoky earth, black tea, licorice and dark chocolate. Delicious now, or cellar it for a few extra years.",91,Mercer 2008 Spice Cabinet Vineyard Petit Verdot (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"Richly textured and plush on the palate, with a broad array of raspberry, black cherry, plum, spice, coffee, herb and cocoa flavors, all couched in firm, ripe tannins and sweet oak. Only 200 cases made from this relatively new producer high in the hills of Napa.",92,Versant Vineyards 2001 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
This will divide the Zinfandel community. Some will find its earthiness and herbaceousness an attractive complication to the briary berry and spice notes. Others will think it's not quite ripe enough and lacking richness. The score reflects the wine's complexity and adaptability to a wide range of foods.,91,Ridge 2010 Ponzo Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Black as a moonless night, dense in structure, tannic, bone dry and super-peppery, this Syrah isn't offering much relief right now. In all likelihood it will emerge from its cocoon in a few years to offer a wealth of ripe blackberry, currant and carob fruit.",88,Kenwood 2005 Jack London Vineyard Syrah (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"This is a dark and tarry wine, perhaps a tad early for release, showing condensed purple flowers, beef jerky, charcoal and plum peels on the nose. The palate is tart and chewy, with asphalt, sour black fruit and tobacco notes. Wait a year and this may sing much more strongly.",86,Fess Parker 2013 The Big Easy Red (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Yalumba's western outpost has been steadily improving the quality of its wines, and the 2010 21 Barriques represents its top wine to date. The dark fruit flavors are accented by ample amounts of charred oak, but the fruit ultimately wins out. The result is a very drinkable, silky textured wine with a long, toasty finish. Drink now–2020.",91,Ringbolt 2010 21 Barriques Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River),,,,
"There's an herbal undertow to this wine, with suggestions of dill and sage to the pineapples, green apples and buttercream. It's also soft, lacking the clean vibrancy that a rich Chardonnay requires. Drink now.",86,Frog's Leap 2008 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),,,,
"This dark, inky expression of Sagrantino offers jammy aromas of strawberry jam and blackberry preserves, followed by notes of prune, dark chocolate and spice. Expressive and structured, it would pair with roasted pork or grilled prime rib.",88,Còlpetrone 2006  Montefalco Sagrantino,,,,
"Smoky aromas of jerky, bacon and ham blend with plum and raspberry. As you should expect from higher-end Malbec, this feels full and earthy but also chunky and undefined. Flavors of baked berry fruits carry a mild herbal hint, while the finish is earthy and chocolaty.",89,Marchiori & Barraud 2011 Malbec (Perdriel),,,,
"A blend of Cabernet Franc (80%) and Petit Verdot, this is a perfumed wine with high-toned aromas of violets, herbs, baking spices, pencil eraser, barrel notes and plum. The flavors are broad in feel, with bright acidity that stitches it all together nicely.",90,Armstrong Family 2013 Fronk Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Light, fresh and soft, this is a perfect starter for an evening for two. It has attractive sweet lime and peach flavors, with attendant acidity.",85,Pommery NV POP Extra Dry  (Champagne),,,,

"This is a pretty taut wine that combines a rich style with good, vibrant acidity. Yet it is described as 100% fermented in stainless steel rather than oak barrels. The aromas resemble toasted baguette, butter and toasted walnut, while the flavors are like ripe apple and almonds.",87,Chatom Vineyards 2013 Chardonnay (Calaveras County),,,,
"This has a shy nose, offering subtle whiffs of white stone fruit and spring wildflower while the simple palate offers orchard fruit, citrus zest and bitter almond flavors. It's fresh, with zesty acidity.",85,Tenuta dei Mille 2015 Anita Grillo (Terre Siciliane),,,,
"Strong and oaky but not particularly subtle or complex. It's impressive for its sheer power, offering blasts of buttered toast, butterscotch, pineapple and orange jam and vanilla, wrapped up in a creamy texture.",86,Sobriquet Winery 2010 Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"This Malbec is strangely exotic, with unusual floral aromas that blend in Middle Eastern spices including cardamom. Massive and borderline over-extracted, this tastes earthy and baked, with herbal blackberry flavors. A blackened, peppery flavor dominates a finish that comes across as stewed.",89,Trapiche 2012 Terroir Series Finca Orellana Single Vineyard Malbec (La Consulta),,,,
"Savory whiffs of clay and smoked nuts belie the pristine white peach and grapefruit flavors that flood the palate of this semidry Riesling. It's juicy and primary, but irresistibly so, finishing on a lingering note of spice and saffron.",89,Leonard Kreusch 2013 Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Fully ripened, this shows spicy highlights of cinnamon and hot red pepper candy. Plums and cherries are also here in abundance, and the wine sails into a smooth, satisfying café crême finish.",90,Quady North 2011 Cabernet Franc (Applegate Valley),,,,
"Fresh and inviting on the nose, this wine is redolent with strawberries and hibiscus as well as cinnamon candy, fennel and chaparral. A sip grips the palate with polished tannins, offering baked black cherries in licorice sauce, rhubarb, smoke and earthy flavors.",92,Anglim 2013 Grenache (Paso Robles Willow Creek District),,,,
"Jammy, candied raspberry and cherry fruit marks this simple but pleasurable wine. With a soft mouthfeel and an oaky finish, it's ready to drink now.",84,Plungerhead 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Subdued notes of blackberry and dark cherry, cigar box and undergrowth lead the aromas on this Bordeaux-style blend. It has a supple core, which is framed by sinewy tannins and balanced acids. The finish is medium in length and grippy, ending on a spiced-cherry flavor.",87,Muse 2009 Red (Shenandoah Valley),,,,
"This is the inaugural vintage for this producer, a husband-and-wife team in partnership with winemaker Maayan Koschitzky, who also works with Philippe Melka. The vineyard-designate is lush and powerful, a full-bodied, tannic representative of an amazing growing year. Mint, black olive, blackberry and cigar highlight the sensual texture, enriched in dark chocolate.",92,Brilliant Mistake 2013 Taylor Family Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),,,,
"This is a jammy, fruity Valpolicella Classico with strawberry and blackberry aromas followed by coffee and mocha. It shows a soft, mature mouthfeel with some heat on the close.",85,La Giaretta 2009 Volpare  (Valpolicella Classico),,,,
"Almost all varietal with just a dash of Cabernet Sauvignon (5%) to fill it out, this is an intriguing wine with notes of cherry cordial, chocolate and herbs. With very little new oak influence, the soft, supple fruit flavors are allowed to shine through, giving this wine a real sense of polish.",87,"Cascade Ridge 2011 95% Merlot, 5% CS Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))",,,,
"Only very slight citrus notes appear on the nose. The palate opens into soft fruitiness with slight hints of apricot and peach. The chief attraction, though, is a central, vivid theme of white pepper. This is light bodied but full of subtle charms.",89,Nastl 2015 Klassik Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),,,,
"A classic blend of Cabernet and Shiraz, this is cedary and complex upon opening, easily mixing cassis, plum and blackberry with vanilla and baking spices. On the palate, it's dense and concentrated yet slightly reserved, suggesting rather than screaming its potential. A long, mocha-tinged finish wraps things up, combining dusty tannins with mouthwatering acids. Drink 2020–2030+.",94,Yalumba 2013 The Signature Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz (Barossa),,,,
"This Cabernet has a rather bubblegummy, candied, gassy taste. It's exuberantly ripe in cherries, red currants and mocha, and fun to drink, but expensive.",85,Cimarone 2011 Three Creek Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),,,,
"Solidly in the Bonterra Zin style, the '06 succeeds with polished flavors of cherries, blackberries and cola. The wine feels lightly gentle and silky in the mouth, with the weight and body of a Pinot Noir.",85,Bonterra 2006 Zinfandel (Mendocino County),,,,
"A unique blend of spice and blueberry sets this Shiraz apart from the pack, and it pulls away even further due to a lush, creamy texture and long, mouthcoating finish. There's great purity to the fruit, but enough peppery spice for complexity. Drink now–2016.",91,Yangarra Estate Vineyard 2006 Single Vineyard Shiraz (McLaren Vale),,,,
"This big, bold blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Petit Verdot and smaller amounts of Malbec and Merlot is powerfully built, with firm, integrated tannins that feel chalky and dusty. Black currant and cherry flavors dominate, with waves of tobacco and dark chocolate leading to a soft, lingering finish. This will cellar well, to be enjoyed 2023–2028.",92,Von Strasser 2013 Reserve Red (Diamond Mountain District),,,,
"The spicy aromas resemble black pepper and anise. Fruit flavors are ripe and delicious, and the creamy texture seems to melt in the mouth. This wine offers lots of personality and very good balance.",89,Francis Ford Coppola 2013 Votre Santé Pinot Noir (California),,,,
"As the name of this cuvée indicates, the grapes for this bottling come from sandier parcels within the appellation. The result is a fruitier expression of Tavel, one that morphs ceaselessly between red plum, yellow peach and mixed berry flavors. Crisp and firm on the finish, this needs a little time to show its best; drink throughout 2017.",91,Les Vignerons de Tavel 2015 Terroir des Sables  (Tavel),,,,
"This wine is a blend of 50% Syrah aged for 40 months in new American oak, with the other half Cabernet Sauvignon aged in new Slovakian oak. Aromas of cardamom, green pepper, cherry, vanilla and anise are followed by abundant baking-spice accents backed by tart fruit flavors. Barrel notes take over the finish.",88,Liberty Lake 2012 Heritage Reserve Red (Red Mountain),,,,
"The aromas show notes of game, vanilla and grape Jolly Rancher, with the volatiles amped up. The flavors bring a mixture of sweet and tart, tussling through the finish.",82,Oak Knoll NV Toasted Cow 5th Edition Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"The dense tannins of this wine balance the ripeness. With concentration and generous blackberry fruits, it is a rich wine, broadly structured and with swathes of opulent fruit. It will need plenty of time, so drink from 2026.",93,Viera de Sousa 2015 Vintage  (Port),,,,
"A bouquet of white flowers kissed with honey and stonefruit, this ebullient ice wine bounds from the glass with its sunny, sweet pleasures.

"Very soft and simple, with candied flavors of blackberries, cocoa, spices and oak. Perfectly fine for drinking now.",84,San Simeon 2006 Syrah (Monterey),,,,
"Quite dark in the glass, this bottling has a nose that suggests boysenberry, blackberry and black cherry. The dense aromas are livened up by iron, black loam, Indian spice and black-tea notes. The same range of dark fruits power the palate, especially black plums, and the rich and tangy flavors are nuanced with black sage, bergamot and eucalyptus notes.",93,Testarossa 2013 Doctor's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Yeasty, toasty aromas come with notes of brown sugar and baking spices. Lively and good on the palate, this tastes of dry citrus fruits and nectarine. A fresh-feeling, citrusy finish is clean and firm.",87,Sabartés NV Brut Rosado Sparkling (Cava),,,,

"Winemaker: David Nieuwoudt. This is an interesting Sémillon that's quite distinct and expressive of it's terroir, with prominent herbal notes of fynbos, fresh herbs and lime leaf grounded by green plum and fig fruit tones, all laced with a pronounced saline accent. The palate is light-plus weight and immensely refreshing, with mouthwatering acidity and more herbal characteristics that finish bright and clean. It seems to be in its infancy now, so hold it until late-2017 and enjoy through 2020.",91,Cederberg 2015 Cape Winemakers Guild Ghost Corner CWG Semillon (Elim),,,,

"The most forward of Cristom's 2009 single-vineyard Pinots, this shows flavors of strawberry preserves and candied orange, suggestive of marmalade. It has a streak of root beer and pleasing spice, with a quick finish.",90,Cristom 2009 Marjorie Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
"A beautiful and compelling Sauvignon Blanc that gives the acidity and citrusy brightness you want in the variety, but contains extra layers of complexity. Offers waves of fresh green grass, Meyer lemon, sweet lime and mineral flavors that don't appear to have any oak. Brilliant with crab cakes, toasted sourdough bread with goat cheese, or on its own as a cocktail sipper.",91,Long Meadow Ranch 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford),,,,

Age for another year for final integration.",94,Château Tour des Gendres 2007 Anthologia Sauvignon Blanc (Bergerac Sec),,,,
"Shows a rich blend of citrus and stone fruits on the nose and on the palate, easily combining grapefruit, passion fruit and nectarines into a cohesive package. Finishes long, with tangy, lip-smacking acids that beg you to give this wine some time in the cellar. It's tasty now, but should be better in 2005.",90,Jermann 2001 Vintage Tunina White (Venezia Giulia),,,,
"Concentrated in black currant and clove, this is a soft, silky wine, lengthy and substantial without ever becoming overbearing in terms of power or oak. Lovely anise accents the crisp fruit, providing a worthy example of the appellation and clean winemaking coming together in an elegant way.",94,Regusci 2012 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),,,,
"The heritage clones referenced here are Pommard and Wädenswil, yielding fresh and forward fruit flavors of strawberry with a cherry-popsickle kick.

It's a harmonious and texturally resonant Pinot Noir ready for near-term enjoyment.",92,Saffron Fields Vineyard 2013 Heritage Clones Pinot Noir,,,,
"Lush and tasty, this is strikingly affordable for the alluring layers of aromas and flavors present. It begins with cherry pie on the nose alongside black licorice, bay leaf, roasting meats and mushrooms, and continues on the palate with soft and jammy berries. Yet it has a serious side too, with flavors of menthol and stewed tomatoes delivering the umami factor.",92,Sextant 2011 Wheelhouse Zinfandel (Paso Robles),,,,
"Green apple and greengage on the nose turn into white peach and lemon on the palate. The mousse is frothy and lively and there is a wonderful depth to these tart fruit flavors that takes you to juicy, green pastures and white blossom.

"Fresh yet focused aromas of pressed boysenberries, white pepper, beef jerky, teriyaki and wet stone greet the nose on this bottling by winemaker Fintan du Fresne.

"Varietally correct aromas of peach and melon form a good opening to this mostly fresh but fading Albariño. Flavors of melon, papaya and peach are typical for the grape, and the finish is holding on but showing signs of maturation. Drink immediately.",87,Pazo Torrado 2013 Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"From a single vineyard in the Vinho Verde sub-region of Monção and Melgaço, the heartland of Alvarinho, the wine is rich and smoothly textured.

Drink now.",91,Quinta de Paços 2015 Casa de Capitão-mor Alvarinho (Vinho Verde),,,,
"Aromas of rose, blue flower, wild berry and a hint of forest floor lead the way along with a balsamic note.

Give the tannins a few years to unwind then drink.",89,Cascina Adelaide 2012 Cannubi  (Barolo),,,,

"Whiffs of white mushroom, saffron and caramel lend complexity to this concentrated elixir of apricots and orange peels.

The palate is quite subtle, with nectarine, brioche and airy watermelon flavors. Altogether it's very clean and fresh.",89,Bonny Doon 2016 Vin Gris de Cigare Rosé (Central Coast),,,,
"A tough wine to like. Mourvèdre needs warmth, and this wine appears to have lacked enough of it to ripen. Shows an earthy, green herb and mint tug to the sweet oak and cherries. Drink now.",84,Jalama 2007 Camp 4 Mourvèdre (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"A 100% varietal wine, this offers upfront structure and gravelly texture, its tannins robust. The medium-bodied ripeness allows plenty of room for dried herb and cedar, accents to the bolder notions of black raspberry jam and coffee.",91,Padis 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"This variety, not usually used on its own, has produced an inky dark wine of considerable power and ample tannins. The blackberry and rhubarb fruit has great depth, and is very dry. It's not a bad wine, but seems better suited as a blender to Cabernet Sauvignon. It just might be interesting in 6–8 years. —S.H.",86,Yorkville Cellars 1997 Petit Verdot (Yorkville Highlands),,,,
"From small-batch, handcraft producer Stark-Condé, this unfiltered Cab offers personality and elegance. Berry, herbs, fennel and spice on the nose lead into a red that's extremely pretty in the mouth. Good integration of tannins and fruit, and a light minerality throughout give the wine a soft, balanced appeal. Though it will pair well with spiced meat and bolder dishes, the wine is great on its own.",89,Stark-Condé 2005 Unfined and Unfiltered Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch),,,,
"Cocoa, vanilla and baking spice aromas intertwine with cranberry, black licorice, herb and dark fruit on a wine with a very distinctive aromatic profile.

"Quite austere, with citrusy, appley, minerally flavors and tart acids. This is not your usual fruit monster, although oak and lees do their best to add nuance and complexity. A good wine that is versatile at the table.",85,La Crema 2000 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Cheesy oak, vanilla, licorice and herb aromas accent an otherwise ripe-fruit bouquet. Like many of Chile's top 2012s, this is a heavy, ripe wine with a jammy wall-to-wall feel.

"Beautifully pure and creamy notes of golden apple dominate the nose. The palate has a similarly gentle apple note that harmonizes perfectly with the light, dry body and the fine bubbles. This elegant pink sparkler will give lots of pleasure before and during a meal.",91,Bestheim NV Anne de K Brut Rosé Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),,,,
"Shy honeyed aromas of tropical fruits wind up at banana. This feels fleshy and not direct, while soft powdery flavors of leesy melon and papaya finish with notes of oxidation, as if this is already starting to fade.",85,Luna Beberide 2014 Godello (Bierzo),,,,
"This smooth and creamy wine has ripe fruit and only light acidity. It's full-bodied and on the heavy side, showing its weight. Drink from 2018.",86,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2015  Meursault,,,,

"A heavy smoke aroma and similar smoky, toasty flavors dominate this medium-bodied wine. The mouthfeel is velvety and a modest amount of cherry flavor bolsters the oaky, smoky character.",86,Bailiwick 2013 Borderline Pinot Noir (Marin County),,,,
"In a recent lineup of Australian sparklers, Clover Hill's 2003 Brut was a standout, showing convincing toasty, autolytic notes layered over crisp apple and citrus flavors. It's medium-bodied and slightly creamy in texture, with a long, crisp finish.",89,Clover Hill 2003 Brut  (Tasmania),,,,
"Jaboulet bought this 7.3-acre estate in 1998, and this is the first full vintage. It is a huge wine, with all the true inky blackness and density of a Cornas. Firm, dry and concentrated, it also has generous ripe black plums, a hint of sweet jelly. It makes an excellent mix of the traditional foursquare Cornas style, with modern sophistication.",93,Paul Jaboulet Aîné 1999 Domaine de Saint-Pierre  (Cornas),,,,

It is ready to drink, although it will be even better from 2016.",86,Herdade da Comporta 2014 Private Selection White (Península de Setúbal),,,,
"From the Aegerter domaine, this wine is full of spicy red fruits. It comes from a vineyard in the hills above Nuits Saint-Georges, and the cooler elevation shows in the acidity and fresh fruitiness. The wine is ready to drink.",88,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2014 Les Dames Huguettes Vieilles Vignes  (Hautes Côtes de Nuits),,,,
"A pretty coppery color reminiscent of the rosés of southern France, this unusual blend of Mourvèdre, Syrah, Malbec and Viognier is done via the saignée (bleeding the tanks) method. Muted flavors of dried peach, banana and cantaloupe combine in an interesting way, but the finish has off-flavors.",85,Eleven 2012 La Primavera Rosé (Washington),,,,
"This single-vineyard wine, rounded and rich, is smooth, spicy and full of quince and lychee flavors that are developing well. Concentrated and dense, it will be best in late 2014.",89,Gustave Lorentz 2011 Schofweg Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,

"Almost all varietal (with 2% Malbec) from one of the state's premier sites, this wine draws you into the glass with aromas of coffee, scorched earth, herb, spice and dark fruit. The palate shows a beguiling sense of restraint and detail, with the tannins combed to a fine sheen, perfectly framed acidity and a lengthy finish.

"With seven years in bottle, this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is what it is. The nose is stewy and raisiny, with baked berry notes. Like the nose, it feels raisiny and heavy. Flavors of raisin, fig and chocolate keep the theme going, while the finish is herbal and earthy in flavor, with heat.",86,Cesca Vicent 2008 Abat Domènech Red (Priorat),,,,
"The aromas explore Cabernet's greener side, with overt notes of bell pepper along with vanilla and other barrel spices. The black-fruit flavors show richness, with grainy tannins backing them up.

"This Chardonnay—one of the best tasted in months—is light in the glass and shows clean, refreshing, yet compellingly rich sea salt, toasted sourdough, key lime and daffodil aromas.

"Whiffs of smoke, wet earth and pressed apples seem subtle on the nose of this dainty auslese, belying the shock of sweet tangerine and grapefruit flavors that flood the palate.

Prüm 2012 Bernkasteler Badstube Auslese Riesling (Mosel),,,,

"Smells oaky, with smoky vanilla and sweet, charred notes riding high over flamboyant tropical fruit aromas, including guavas and breadfruit. This is a big wine, but the pieces aren't all in place. It's like a symphony orchestra playing different tunes. Give it a few months to knit together.",87,King Estate 1998 Reserve Chardonnay (Oregon),,,,
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (65%), Merlot and Sangiovese is tad jammy and cooked. The wine delivers tight, tart tannins with impressive structure and length.",85,Grattamacco 2003  Bolgheri Superiore,,,,
"Oatmeal, chalk and bread crust form the first impression. On the palate they play upon a tart and lively freshness and round out crisp, green apple fruit.

Restraint is the central theme here.",90,Jenkyn Place Vineyard 2010 Blanc de Noir Sparkling (England),,,,

"This is dry and brisk in acidity, with firm tannins and great structural integrity. At the same time, it's vast in blackberry and cherry-jam flavors, while the oak overlay is strong but perfectly matched with the wine's volume.

"This vineyard-designate blend of Montonico, Greco and Malvasia opens with bright freshness and simple aromas of stone fruit and Golden Delicious apple. This easygoing wine feels soft and smooth on the close.",85,Spadafora 2009 Vigna Fiego White (Donnici),,,,
"Aromas suggest red berries, white pepper and clove. The round, robust palate delivers juicy wild cherry and hints of Mediterranean herbs alongside dusty tannins. You'll also notice the warmth of alcohol on the midpalate. Drink now.",87,Pietranera 2012  Rosso di Montalcino,,,,
"As in 2003 this is a blend of Stillwater Creek and Sundance Vineyard fruit. Some complex aromas of cured meat and smoke are added to an underpinning of berry and currant fruit. This is a graceful wine that will need decanting, but well worth taking the extra time to see what it's all about. Retasted 24 hours after being opened, the wine had blossomed into full-blown flavor.",90,Arbor Crest 2004 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Dark fruit, leather, tobacco and spice aromas lead the way on this elegantly structured red. On the palate, notes of cocoa, vanilla, anise and espresso accent a core of fleshy black cherry, while firm, fine-grained tannins provide support. A licorice note signals the close.",93,Josetta Saffirio 2011  Barolo,,,,
"Sweet berry aromas offer touches of marzipan and leather. The palate is ripe, vibrant and grabby, with full tannins framing plum and berry flavors along with accents of tobacco and earth. Lightly oaky on the finish, with a vanilla note and dryness. Shows good weight and clarity; Drink now through 2015.",90,Marqués de Cáceres 2004 Gran Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"There's a hit of green gooseberry flavor in this dry, tart Sauvignon Blanc. It has enough citus and tropical fruit ripeness to make it tasty, but it's still a bit green and unripe on the palate.",83,Asuncion Ridge 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (San Luis Obispo County),,,,
"This wine is made from two exceptionally cool coastal sites: Platt, a single-vineyard in its own right; and Martinelli Charles Ranch Vineyard. The wine follows suit, allowing for a concentrated take on golden apple and stony minerality, the nose crisp and focused in salty, floral notes.",90,Ramey 2014 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Dainty aromas of wild strawberry, red cherry and peach pit lead the nose of this playful rosé. The palate is light and lively, with flavors of citrus peel and white melon rind that carry through to the mouthwatering finish. Drink now.",87,M. Chapoutier 2014 Bila Haut Rosé (Pays d'Oc),,,,
"All six Bordeaux grapes make an appearance in this well-oaked spicebox of a red. It's just plain delicious, from the first sniff on through. The firm mid-palate shows pretty blue, purple and black fruits, a touch of black olive, black tea, and those oh-so-tasty baking spices.",91,Nodland 2008 Private Blend Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Sharp and jammy, like Lifesaver cherry and blackberry sour candy. Finishes sweet in fruity extract.",83,Cerro Prieto 2006 Reserve Merlot (Paso Robles),,,,
"The barrel toast carries a lightly charred edge, while the strawberry fruit comes up front and center with flavors of sweet pastry. There's a lick of licorice running through it as well, and the overall structure suggests drinking it up now through 2020.",90,Benton-Lane 2014 First Class Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Dry, scratchy and rooty smelling, with balsam wood and earthy berry aromas. Medium-bodied, with gritty tannins, herb and spice flavors, and basic but solid cherry and berry fruit. A touch oaky and hot on the finish.",86,Torres 2008 Coronas Tempranillo (Catalunya),,,,
"The thin, tart palate displays cranberry-plum fruit and the nose is of newsprint, driftwood and currants. This sensory combo is not as odd as it sounds, but the wine could use more depth.",84,Sinnya 2001 Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon (Robertson),,,,
"Pretty and pale, this wine is already showing some sunset shades around the rim, and drinking like a wine with more than just a couple of years under its belt. That works in its favor, as it offers cherry-pie fruit, cut tobacco, some minerality and a chocolate/coffee kiss in the finish.",88,Brandborg 2007 Love Puppets Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),,,,
"There's great personality here thanks to the wine's bright fruit flavors, vibrant color and penetrating balsam notes that add depth and dimension. Bright cherry, blueberry, vanilla, sweet almond and menthol notes color a wine that will definitely pair beautifully with lamb, beef and most pasta dishes. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied but firm and showcases the pure fruit characteristics of Sangiovese.",90,Agricoltori del Chianti Geografico 2005 Riserva Montegiachi  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"Juicy hibiscus and pomegranate fruits converge with dried fennel stalks, purple flowers and a flinty smoke character on the fresh and inviting nose of this bottling from Rick Longoria's own vineyard. The energy that emerges on the sip is amazingly persistent, which guarantees long aging, presenting flavors of raspberry, pomegranate, dried sagebrush and black licorice. Drink 2017–2028.",93,Longoria 2013 Fe Ciega Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Grenache (53%) takes the lead on this Rocks District wine followed by Syrah (37%) and Mourvèdre. The use of stems is apparent with aromas of cooked asparagus and green olives followed by earth, smoke, herbs, mineral and cherry. The flavors are rich, focused and mesmerizing, with a velvety feel and a hyperextended, savory finish. It has a distinctive, love it or hate it style.",93,W.T. Vintners 2013 Stoney Vine Vineyard Red (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),,,,
"Toasty, inviting aromas of apple and melon lead to a balanced palate with layered flavors of resiny oak, pear and peach. The finish continues with resin and oak, but by then it has already established itself as a well-balanced wine, with tasty flavors of white and tropical fruit.",88,Undurraga 2010 Sibaris Reserva Especial Chardonnay (Maipo Valley),,,,
"This bottling shows its 88% stainless steel aging with bountiful tropicality, including guava and tuberose on the nose as well as toasted nuts and honeydew. Crisp lime peels start the sip, and then come more guava touches as well as mango. It's quite fruity.",87,Lucas & Lewellen 2016 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Mature, definitely dry in character, with attractive wood acidity. Dark gold in color, it has just enough sweetness, but the style is certainly a sipping Port, not a mixer, giving an intriguing finishing austerity.",91,Wiese & Krohn NV Dry White  (Port),,,,
"Made of 80% Sangiovese, 10% Colorino and 10% Canaiolo, this opens with violet and redcurrant aromas. The straightforward palate delivers ripe black cherry and underbrush notes with a fine layer of smooth tannins. Enjoy soon.",88,Tenuta Forconi 2015  Chianti,,,,
"A powerhouse of rich Merlot, big, ripe, with black plums, sweet figs and only light acidity. A wine for lovers of big Merlots, this rolls generously around the mouth. Because of this immediate richness, it seems likely to age quickly.",91,Château Clinet 2006  Pomerol,,,,
"A beautiful young Cab that continues Salvestrin's unbroken track record of the last several years. Dry and rich in tannins, it shows enormously concentrated fruit flavors of currants, blackberries, black cherries, mocha and spice. Gorgeous now, and should improve over the next decade.",92,Salvestrin 2005 Salvestrin Estate Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),,,,
"This is a fresh-tasting wine with great balance that doesn't have oaky flavors or a thick texture. It has refreshing acidity, subtle apple and spice notes and a palate-cleansing texture. Fine enough and subtle enough to drink frequently.",91,Saracina 2015 Unoaked Chardonnay (Mendocino County),,,,
"Floral aromas of wild flowers, wisteria and a whiff of white tree fruit float out of the glass. The vibrant, refined palate delivers crisp apple, succulent pear and a note of citrus zest alongside bright acidity and an elegant perlage. A light mineral touch marks the finish.",90,Terre di San Venanzio Fortunato 2014 Extra Dry  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
"This easy Prosecco opens with aromas of honey and peach with a hint of lemon candy or lemon soda on the finish. It's fresh, clean and should be served at informal occasions with friends and close family.",83,Plozner NV Brut  (Prosecco),,,,
"Take Souverain's basic Chardonnay, released last year, oak it up, and you get this reserve. Buttered toast, butterscotch, apricot, tropical fruit and honey flavors are prominent. Ready to drink now.",87,Souverain 2010 Winemaker's Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Strawberry flavor dominates this light and crisp wine. With its brisk acidity and slightly herbal character, it's fresh edging towards green.",85,Cave de Kientzheim-Kaysersberg NV Rosé Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),,,,
"This fortified red blend was aged in wood for 20 years. That has taken away fruitiness and, as with an aged Tawny Port, has given the wine flavors of dried prune, spice and old wood aromas. The wine is for sipping and savoring, ready to drink now.",93,Global Wines NV Cabriz Impar Red (Vinho Licoroso),,,,
"This wine offers notes of sugared plum, herbs and tire rubber. It's lighter in style with plump, slightly sweet blackberry and cherry flavors with a wash of tannins.",85,Castle Rock 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This dry interpretation of the Cartizze cru shows chalky mineral notes with background tones of peach, honey, wild flower and lemon zest. The soft sweetness feels great next to the naturally foamy quality of the mouthfeel.",88,Andreola 2009 Cartizze Dry  (Valdobbiadene Superiore di Cartizze),,,,
"Sourced from the Conner Lee vineyard, this reflects the cool, difficult vintage, with a preponderance of herbal flavors. Cabernet Franc is given to showing an earthy, woodsy character in any event, and here it seems to rule. Highlights of baking spices, from aging 15 months in one-third new French oak, add flavor interest. With extensive breathing, the black cherry fruit comes up nicely. It should benefit from additional bottle age.",89,Buty 2011 Merlot-Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A wine that is well balanced with attractive ripe berry fruits and generous tannins. It has weight and richness, allowing room for the development of both the structure and the fruits. Drink from 2017.",88,Château La Roche Bazin 2012  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,,,,
"Spaghetti con vongole (clams) is an appropriate pairing partner for this luminous white wine from northern Italy. Aged only in stainless steel, this Soave Classico delivers clean aromas of peach, citrus and honey.",87,Inama 2009 Vin Soave  (Soave Classico),,,,
"With ripe aromas of cough syrup, baked berry, cherry and smoke, this Malbec offers a bit of everything. The palate is full but has energy, and the flavors of boysenberry, blueberry and chocolate come in a big, pounding wave. Finishes chunky and jammy, with adequate freshness.",87,Benegas 2009 Juan Benegas Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"86-88 Barrel sample. Firm, with a bitter, tight edge, this has high acidity, spice, and a tight layer of tannins. For a second wine, this is not that accessible.",87,La Chapelle de Potensac 2008 Barrel sample  (Médoc),,,,
"One of Chile's best red blends is back with a vengeance. The nose is a wonderful mix of almond candy, fine leather, baked pastry, prune and licorice all bundled up in a comfortable blanket, while the palate is mouthfilling and loaded with cassis, coffee, herbs and pepper flavors. Excellent structure and depth, with power and balance. Drinkable now but ageable through 2014.",93,Altaïr 2005 Altaïr Red (Cachapoal Valley),,,,
"From the Pritchard Hill section of the vineyard, this wine consists of 75% Syrah and 25% Grenache. A hearty, fruity and big-boned explosion of blueberry and strawberry, it's rimmed in coconut flake and black, leathery pepper. Dense and full bodied, the minerality should allow it to cellar and integrate through 2020.",91,Kale 2012 Broken Axle Stagecoach Vineyard Syrah-Grenache (Napa Valley),,,,
"Pungently earthy in red strawberry and cherry, this is a seductively textured wine from a fine vineyard, made in tiny amounts. Fresh-cut roses and black tea provide a savory element, balancing exuberant fruit and complex notes of cola.",92,Fulcrum 2013 Landy Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Decadent cherry, vanilla and baked plum meet a mouthful of cinnamon in this generously full-bodied and weighty wine. Earthy undertones of forest floor and shaved truffle add complexity and savory components that complement well.",89,Ektimo Vineyards 2014 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"This is a very perfumed wine, with the addition of Moscatel in the blend, adding the lychee flavor. It's textured with a crisp edge that allows the wine to retain its fresh character. This is a wine to be drunk young.",85,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal 2012 JP Azeitão Branco White (Península de Setúbal),,,,
"Affordable and exuberant, this Pinotage/Merlot blend starts with cherry, vanilla and cedar aromas followed by bright flavors of fruit and spicy pepper. The finish is spicy and assertive. A great wine for grilled meats and more robust cuisine, and a fun introduction to Pinotage.",85,Herding Cats NV Merlot-Pinotage Red (Western Cape),,,,
"Three-quarters Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest Syrah, Merlot and Malbec, it brings notes of bell pepper, herbs, plum and black currant. The flavors are sugar sweet and plump with distinct residual sugar remaining.",83,Canoe Ridge 2012 The Expedition Canoe Ridge Estate Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"The aromas of citrus peel, stone fruit and soda water are elusive on this wine, while the palate brings dry flavors with a fleshy feel. Some interesting things are going on but they don't come together.",86,Two Vintners 2014 Olsen Vineyard Roussanne (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Bitter cherry fruits and firmer tannins dominate this serious, concentrated Pinot Noir. It has weight and a youthful bitterness that needs time to round out. The juiciness and the structure are both there for aging.",90,Johanneshof Reinisch 2010 Grillenhügel Pinot Noir (Thermenregion),,,,
"Medium in build and high in minerality, this fruity, dark-cherry wine is tethered by sizable oak and tannin. It finds its balance midway through, before offering a substantial finish.",90,Isabel Mondavi 2012 Estate Pinot Noir (Carneros),,,,
"Dark red violet in color, this wine has a nose of cranberry, lingonberry and juniper. Luxuriant tannins provide a backdrop for flavors of cassis, cherry pie, eucalyptus and freshly ground black pepper. There is a pleasing interplay of fruit flavors and cool notes, but the fruit stands out through a slightly minty finish with a closing burst of orange zest.",90,Pelter 2012 Matar CB Red (Galilee),,,,
"Made in an earthier style. Not that there aren't exuberant flavors of apples, pears and peaches, but they're conjoined with notes of tobacco and herbs. Not especially oaky, but the smoke and vanilla complexities are just right.",86,Handley 2001 Chardonnay (Sonoma County),,,,
Aromas of roasted savory berry fruits and baked beans are solid. This Merlot exhibits good grip on a medium-bodied palate. Salty earthy flavors of berry fruits and dry oak finish leafy and spicy.,87,Viña Chocalan 2014 Reserva Merlot (Maipo Valley),,,,
"From the producer's original, own-rooted 1965 plantings, this light, dry and lovely wine offers citrus and apple skin flavors, along with hints of leafy greens. The fruit skin flavors persist through its lingering finish.",89,David Hill 2016 Estate Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Very much in the vein of a super-oaked, ripe Chardonnay, bursting with peach and tropical aromas and flavors, but with a distinctly nutty, minerally, almost steely note and an electric jolt of acidity. Judging from the very long, sweet finish, it's got quite a life ahead of it.",91,Chalone Vineyard 1999 Pinot Blanc (Chalone),,,,
"This wine is firm and structured, with complex tannins and dark black-fruit flavors. Under the tannins, juicy fruit with considerable acidity gives signs of great potential. The aftertaste again comes back to the structure. Drink from 2019.",89,Chanson Père et Fils 2013  Gevrey-Chambertin,,,,
"This full-bodied white opens with aromas of ripe yellow peach, Spanish broom, chamomile and Mediterranean brush. The round, creamy palate doles out juicy pineapple, baked yellow apple, saline, mineral and candied nectarine zest alongside soft acidity.",91,Argiolas 2014 Is Argiolas  (Vermentino di Sardegna),,,,
This shows apple and pear flavors in a soft shell of a body. The finish is light and gently fragrant.,83,Wunsch & Mann 2011 Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"Right out of the bottle, this single vineyard Pinot is rich. The flavors of raspberry and cherry pie, sprinkled with cinnamon and brown sugar, are delicious and direct. You can certainly drink it now, but the acid-tannin balance suggests the wine will develop and improve over the next 5–6 years.",90,De Loach 2010 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Dark gold in color and intensely cradled in oak, this wine maintains a balance of complex, well-defined flavors of honey and apple, with lurking minerality that keeps it fresh and lively. It's lush and yet layered, a complete package. Drink now through 2020.",93,Vermeil 2014 Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"From the old vineyard in back of Don Hartford's house, this 15.7% alcohol Zin is big—but it's no brute. It's full of dark, rich blackberries, layered with chocolate and black pepper. The velvety texture carries through the long finish, picking up hints of black licorice. Editors' Choice.",93,Hartford 1999 Hartford Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This is mellow on the nose, with a mix of minerality and standard apple aromas. The palate feels fresh due to cutting acidity, while apple, peach and melon flavors lead to a mild, healthy finish. Frankly, there's not much difference between this and Trivento's basic 2012 Reserva Chardonnay, which costs $10 less.",87,Trivento 2012 Golden Reserve Chardonnay (Uco Valley),,,,
"How about a pizza with prosciutto, mushrooms and mozzarella cheese with this dry, tart Chardonnay? The keen acidity will cut through the richness, while the suggestion of sweet, toasted oak will play well with the meat's umami smokiness.",88,Tolosa 2010 Estate Tolosa Vineyards Chardonnay (Edna Valley),,,,
This blend of Gamay and Pinot Noir is soft and ripe with red fruits. The wine is all fruit: red cherry and raspberry with a light touch of spice and tannins. The wine is ready to drink.,85,Vignerons de Buxy 2015 Buissonnier  (Coteaux Bourguignons),,,,
"This starts with subtle aromas of wild rise, lemon zest and forest berry. The blend is based on Glera, with 15% Cabernet Sauvignon added for color.",86,Il Follo NV Brut Cuvée Rosé Sparkling (Veneto),,,,
"This winery is approaching cult status, and for good reason. Rather than compete with over-extracted competitors, this bottling shows a medium richness that pairs black plum and dark chocolate with light mint and dried herbs. Oregano, thyme, sage, bay leaf and black pepper power the palate, where boysenberry fruit and pencil lead complete the fresh but layered experience.",93,Tanner DaFoe 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"This is a light and cheery wine, with cherry and raspberry fruit. It suggests hard candy with a hint of the barnyard; forward, round and fruity.",86,Cubanisimo Vineyards 2012 Rumba Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Fruity, juicy and packed with red berry fruit, this is an attractive, easy-drinking wine. It is rich, with good dense flavors that are balanced by raspberry-like acidity on the finish.",86,Caves Bonifacio 2009 Aragonez (Lisboa),,,,
"Here is an intensely fragrant Greco from Molise with notes of banana, peach, passion and exotic fruits backed by salt water taffy. The aromas keep coming and give this wine an extremely cheerful and upbeat personality. It is polished and smooth but it also offers density and texture.",87,Borgo di Colloredo 2007 Greco (Terra degli Osci),,,,
"This has a soft entry, its fruit beginning to show secondary flavors of bakery pastries. Mulberry and prune, soft and spicy, make for a pleasing, accessible wine that finishes with a lick of cinnamon. It is already drinking well.",88,Airfield Estates 2010 Pinot Noir (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Dense, dusty tannins dominate this rich wine that has structure as well as plenty of ripe black-currant fruits. The balance, ripe and with great tannins and acidity, is already there. Drink from 2026.",90,C. da Silva 2015 Quinta de Ventozelo  (Port),,,,
"This is a rich, thick and confectionery-feeling white wine, that's full bodied and brawny in style. Pineapple, marshmallow and green olive ride the midpalate before finishing simply.",85,Hanna 2015 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This wine has the solid tannins the mountain is known for, and ripe flavors of blackberries, currants, cherries and chocolate, enriched with new oak. At twenty bucks, and with a low production, it's a stunning value. With real elegance and even ageworthiness, it's one of the best at its price point available now.",91,Cameron Hughes 2005 Lot 47 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),,,,
"Whiffs of nuts, dusty mineral and lemon are demure on the nose, but become more concentrated on the palate of this dry white. A blend of Chardonnay, Riesling and Grüner Veltliner, it's more minerally than fruity, but refreshing and brisk.",85,Inspire Moore 2014 Gratitude White (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This single-vineyard wine, packed in its grossly heavy bottle, is big in every sense. It has great power and concentration, flavors of chocolate extraction that just escape overwhelming the fruit. Rich black-plum flavors are balanced by a series of tannic waves. This impressive wine is still all potential, so drink from 2018.",94,Magnum Vinhos 2011 Ribeiro Santo Vinha da Neve Red (Dão),,,,
"Tentative notes of pebble and strawberry show shyly on the nose, on the palate they dominate the light body with its barely-there tannins and slender frame. This is a light-footed Pinot Noir that brings you a welcome dollop of refreshing red fruit.",86,Weingut Mayer am Pfarrplatz 2011 Pinot Noir (Vienna),,,,
"Black cherry, licorice, loamy soil and a touch of roasted beef show on the nose of this bottling from a beautiful estate in the eastern Santa Ynez Valley. Black cherry, dried dill and fennel, coffee bean and slightly bitter dark chocolate come across on the palate that is still quite young with sticky tannins, though very easy to sip already.",91,Grassini 2013 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),,,,
"Sage and anise characterize the nose of this single-vineyard offering. On the palate, there is a distinct element of elderberry, a native fruit to the Central Coast, as well as the expected balance between slightly grippy tannins and a bright acidity.",91,Stephen Ross 2012 Chorro Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),,,,
"A light golden hue, this richly aromatic wine offers notes of toasty barrel spices, apricot and dried mango. It's full bodied, almost unctuous in feel, with abundant, sweet stone-fruit flavors and a lingering finish.",90,Gordon Estate 2013 Reserve Estate Grown Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This Traminer brings out all the spice associated with the grape, adding pepper, quince and some toastiness. If you want to drink lychees, this is where to come, but there is more to the wine, because the acidity adds its element of freshness, and there is considerable richness.",90,Neumeister 2006 Steintal Roter Traminer (Südoststeiermark),,,,
"Aromas of flowers and dried orange peel rise up from the glass, with the notes not seeming entirely fresh. It drinks medium sweet with abundant mandarin orange flavors that show a slight spritz.",86,Vino 2015 Moscato (Washington),,,,
"Decadent yet finessed, this intensely ripe, concentrated wine brims with fleshy flavors of black plum and cassis. Tart cranberry acidity and complexities of olive, savory spice and granite push the palate into greater depths. The finish is long, marked by fine firm tannins. It's lovely already, but should meld beautifully from 2020–2030 and further.",93,Paumanok 2013 Assemblage Red (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"On the paler side of the the Chardonnay scale, the nose is subtle, with light touches of cream, butterscotch and smoke. There is a decent tension between ripe, lemongrass-like fruit and a bitter, grapefruit rind acidity in this wine from the team at Terravant Wine Company in Buellton.",88,Silver Spoon 2011 Chardonnay (Central Coast),,,,
"Woody blackberries meet with freshly plucked violets and lilacs on the snappy nose of this wine. The palate shows very tart berry fruit, but is driven more so by the asphalt and peppercorn elements.",89,Brave & Maiden 2012 Estate Limited Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Pear, vanilla and butter aromas are at the fore. The Sémillon blended in (11%) gives the palate added richness and heft.",87,Buried Cane 2014 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Steely at first sip, and then oaky and midweight, this white reflects the vintage and the region, providing ripe creaminess and plenty of oomph. Made in a heavier style, it remains well-balanced in acidity, with a lengthy, tropical finish.",87,Clos Pegase 2013 Mitsuko's Vineyard Musque Clone Sauvignon Blanc (Carneros),,,,
Unusual hints of mango hint at very ripe fruit. The slender palate counters this aromatic abundance with tenderly fresh notes of lemon zest and wood sorrel. The result is both delicious and refreshing.,90,Forstreiter 2015 Neuberg Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),,,,
"The wine is soft with a lightly toasty character to go alongside the bright acidity. Its grapefruit and gooseberry flavors are right up front, giving a fruity aspect to the steely texture. Drink from 2018.",87,Jérôme Gueneau 2016 Domaine J. Gueneau  (Sancerre),,,,
"The nose of this 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot cuvée shows prune and vanilla scents. On the palate, it's simple and easygong, delivering cocoa and black cherry jam flavors. Drink soon.",85,L'Oca Ciuca 2014 Riserva  (Chianti),,,,
"Sweet oak and lightly tropical fruit flavors characterize this young, tight, full-bodied Chardonnay. With another year or two in bottle, the fruit should emerge from behind the new oak flavors and enhance the overall balance. In the meanwhile, decanting is a good idea.",88,Arbor Crest 2008 Connor Lee Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"In this big proprietary blend, winemaker Kirk Venge pits 70% Zinfandel and 14% Petite Sirah against 11% Charbono, a rare find in the Napa Valley, and 5% Syrah. The results are complex in deep cherry and milk chocolate, with plenty of grip and drinkable tannins, the finish soft and rich. This wine delivers a great value for the quality.",92,Venge 2012 Scout's Honor Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"This wine shows dark spice, ripe fruit, teriyaki sauce and savory notes of black pepper and leather. It's a dark, penetrating Sangiovese-based wine that will pair with grilled meat or sausage.",89,Terre di Talamo 2007 Tempo Riserva  (Morellino di Scansano),,,,
"Subtle yeast spice plays on the nose of this light-bodied wine and gains far more currency on the peppery, spicy palate. Fruit comes in the form of slender, lemony citrus but the peppery spice fizzes on beneath the surface creating an immensely lively and refreshing wine with real zip.",91,Kurt Angerer 2014 Eichenstaude Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),,,,
"This wine is chock full of freshly crushed black pepper and blackberry jam flavor. It's big in tannins, but large proportions of aging in new French oak gives it hints of toast and a caramelized touch. The wine is disappointing given the bottling's history, but it's likely the chilly vintage that undermined it.",87,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2010 S.L.V. Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Take an acidic grape like Sauvignon Gris and combine it with a cool year like 2011 and what you get is a tart, tight, steely wine like this. It's neutral on the nose, then sheer and scouring on the palate. Tastes of lemon and sour apple before ending in an acidic wash.",83,Casa Silva 2011 Sauvignon Gris (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"Old vines give an extra concentration in this intensely spice- and green plum-flavored wine. With its considerable freshness it should age well, its rounded character likely to develop. For now, enjoy its beautiful purity of fruit.",92,Bründlmayer 2010 Alte Reben Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),,,,
"Passo del Lupo Riserva delivers personality and surprises thanks to its extremely polished aromas of Indian spice, red berry, natural rubber and cola. The wood integration is lovely, and the wine is both spicy and fresh on the close.",90,Fazi Battaglia 2006 Passo del Lupo Riserva  (Conero),,,,
"Aromas of balsam wood, dry leather, and slightly herbal berry fruit are generally appealing, while the palate has size, balance and a healthy feel to it. More woody and spicy than outright fruity, with a touch of zesty raspberry and strawberry at the core. Nice but simple red wine.",86,Pago de la Jaraba 2007 Azagador Viñedos Propios Crianza Red (La Mancha),,,,
"This is a rich, full-bodied Champagne showing hints of bottle age but mostly crisp, fresh apple and apricot flavors. It's a ripe, fruity wine, from the southern vineyards in the Aube, but with a apple-skin astringency and brisk texture. Drink now–2019.",89,Veuve Doussot 2009 Cuvée Ernestine Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"This is bright, hot, spicy and (initially at least) showing some high tones that lift the flavors but also attenuate the midpalate. It's aromatic, with sweet cherry fruit, hot and spicy tannins and enough new oak (60%) to add butter and butterscotch to the finish.",90,Gorman 2006 The Pixie Syrah (Red Mountain),,,,
"Harmonious and smooth, this ruby-colored Nebbiolo from the 2001 vintage shows an excellent evolution of aromas. Fresh fruit notes have turned into dried berry and the smoke and wood elements are well integrated. The wine ends with polished tannins and bright acidity.",91,Travaglini 2001 Trevigne  (Gattinara),,,,
"Mineral, lime and crisp apple aromas give it a precise, pure nose. And that same character exists on the palate and finish, where white peach, green banana and melon flavors are full and forward. Shows good concentration and quality for a large-production bubbly at this price.",88,Segura Viudas NV Aria Estate Brut Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"Normally grown in the Dão region, this grape needs poor soil to flourish. On its own, it makes a powerfully fruity wine packed with red fruits and some flavors of dark chocolate. The acidity is intense, and needs another few months to settle down.",85,Adega Cooperativa de Borba 2006 Alfrocheiro (Alentejano),,,,
"Nice and fragrant, with citrus and passion fruit at the heart of the zesty bouquet. Still fresh courtesy of core acidity, with green melon, passion fruit, grapefruit and citrus flavors. Right now it's showing the right blend of maturity and liveliness; a fine Verdejo that may be benefitting from 5% Sauvignon Blanc. Drink this year.",89,Condesa Eylo 2009 Verdejo (Rueda),,,,
"Using grapes sourced from the Klipsun Vineyard, this disappointing effort is stemmy and tannic, with a bitter finish.",83,Page Cellars 2007 Syrah (Red Mountain),,,,
"“Old vines” means different things to different people. In this case, the fruit comes from vines that average 25–30 years old in the Côtes du Bourg and the Côtes du Blaye. The wine is fruit-focused (black cherries and cassis) but relatively light-bodied, finishing with lemony acids.",86,Malesan 1999 Vielles Vignes  (Bordeaux),,,,
"Lovely structure amplifies all the best qualities of this estate-grown wine. A tight core of pear, lemon and tangerine fruit sets up a long finish. The acidity is clean and in perfect proportion, with no chalkiness. Drink now through 2027.",93,Domaine Serene 2015 Clos du Soleil Vineyard Chardonnay (Dundee Hills),,,,
"At first, this comes across as raisiny and maybe even overripe. With airing, it settles on baked black fruits and density. Flavors of ripe berry, baked plum and raisin are undeniably chunky and deep, while oak and prune take over on the finish. Drink sooner rather than later.",89,Celler Dosterras 2011 Vespres Red (Montsant),,,,
"Sourced from select barrels drawn from five estate vineyards, the reserve spent 10 months in oak. It is only made in exceptional years, and 2012 was certainly among the best in memory. Berry, cherry and toast components are here in full measure, with a sumptuous mocha-infused finish. Still young, this wine will show best with aeration, or tuck it away for some extra bottle age.",94,Elk Cove 2012 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This is a soft and perfumed wine, the red fruits hanging out easily with the acidity and gentle structure. It has a juicy character, hints of banana in the background and a fruity aftertaste.",85,Ferraud et Fils 2013 Les Merrains  (Beaujolais-Villages),,,,
"At more than four years of age, this Cabernet is as good as it will ever be. It's soft and gentle in black raspberry and cherry jam flavors, with a sugary sweet finish.",85,Wilson 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Blended with small amounts of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec, this is an austere, unfussy red made in modest quantities that has crisp red currant and cranberry flavors interwoven with cedar and dried herb.",86,Tin Barn 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"Aromas of roasted coffee beans, baked dark fruit and baking spices lead the nose. The tightly wound palate delivers black cherry, mocha, espresso and a confectionary note while a hint of licorice closes the finish. It's still wound up with assertive tannins that need to soften.",90,Monti 2011 del Comune di Monforte  (Barolo),,,,
"Scents of fresh dill, toasted coconut and buttery pastry pair well with flavors of fresh apple, lemon and sea brine on this full-bodied Chardonnay. This is savory in style, with a slightly muted palate.",84,Brooklyn Oenology 2009 Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"Herbal plum aromas are oaky and lactic on the nose. This Pinot is juicy on the palate, with cool-climate acidity. The flavor profile includes distant red fruit notes and a heavy topping of oak resin on the finish.",86,Bodega Volcanes de Chile 2011 Tectonia Pinot Noir (Bío Bío Valley),,,,
"A widely available offering from Concannon, this Cab is rich in jammy cherry and vanilla, with a backbone of oak, a nice choice for midweek dinners of rib roast and steak.",84,Concannon 2010 Selected Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (California),,,,
"From the extreme wilds near Annapolis, this vineyard-designate is rapaciously earthy in all the right ways, a taste of its environs, sauvage and demanding. Dark cherry and blueberry exude on the nose and follow through on the palate, in between jolts of baking spice and dried herb. Medium bodied, the wine is on the money right now, but should also do well in the bottle for years to come.",93,Couloir 2013 Campbell Ranch Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Juicy pear mingles into a savory, almost soy-spiced midpalate. Round and rich, it leads to a pleasantly bitter and ultra-clean finish.",90,Schloss Gobelsburg 2012 Renner Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),,,,
"Enticing aromas of rose, violet, perfumed berry, baking spice and mint waft out of the glass while ripe black cherry, licorice, crushed herb and a hint of tobacco drive the full-bodied, structured palate. Firm, velvety tannins provide the backbone. Drink through 2026.",92,Livio Voghera 2009 Basarin  (Barbaresco),,,,
"This blend of Stillwater Creek and Conner Lee vineyards conveys aromas of pear, yellow apple, pineapple and butter. The concentration is light yet creamy with a warm finish.",87,JM Cellars 2013 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Deep cool aromas of cola and toast blend with sweeter notes of maple and blackberry on this lush full-bodied Malbec. Flavors of blackberry, boysenberry, coffee, mocha and black pepper finish nicely on a well-cut, well-proportioned finish. Drink through 2020.",91,Fincas Don Martino 2013 Old Vine Reserva Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),,,,
"This is a full, ripe, rich and structured wine. It brings out great fruitiness as well as a textured, dry and solid character. Balanced and concentrated,  this imposing wine needs a couple of years to develop. Drink from 2015.",89,Quinta da Alorna 2010 Portal da Aguia Tinto Red (Tejo),,,,
"Lean and angular on the nose, with crisp cherry and rhubarb aromas. Surprisingly elegant in the mouth, with citrus notes, zesty raspberry, clean cherry and a lightness of being. Nice in an unassuming way, with a touch of complexity.",87,Bodega NQN 2010 Malma Pinot Noir (Patagonia),,,,
"This classically styled Barolo has hallmark Nebbiolo scents of rose, violet, spice, leather and forest floor. The creamy palate delivers wild cherry flavors, layered with spice, mint, licorice and eucalyptus notes. It's well balanced, fresh and structured. While it's already enjoyable, drink it after 2018 for more complexity.",94,Brovia 2009 Ca' Mia  (Barolo),,,,
"This is a nicely fragrant Rosso that shows bright nuances of raspberry, wild strawberry and pressed rose petal. The wine is smooth and silky to the end.",88,Belpoggio 2010  Rosso di Montalcino,,,,
"A certain faint spiciness hovers over everything, recalling honeysuckle. The textured palate is fresh and equally pepper-spiced. This has freshness and verve, a certain ease and tons of lemony crispness. If you wanted to hold a party to welcome summer, this would be the perfect wine.",90,Josmeyer 2015 Mise du Printemps Pinot Blanc (Alsace),,,,
"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this seven year-old is showing some age. It opens with aromas of prune, resin, toast and vanilla that all carry over to the dense palate along with blackberry extract and oak-driven spice. It lacks fruit richness while astringent wood tannins leave an abrupt, drying finish.",88,Fattoria Lavacchio 2008 Ludiè  (Chianti Rufina),,,,
"With 60% Mourvèdre, this blend is rich and spicy. It has great acidity, still fresh and accented by red and citrus fruits. Minerality and an herbal element come from the garrigue that surrounds the vines. The wine has certainly benefited from a year's aging.",90,Domaine de la Bégude 2014 Rosé (Bandol),,,,
"This wine is bright and crisp in strawberry and red licorice flavors, with a depth of juicy plum that adds softness and velvety texture. Tawdry earth complements the exuberant fruit.",90,Siduri 2014 Lingenfelder Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Dark plum, herb and charcoal aromas give this Carmenère a very sound bouquet. The palate is ripe and smooth, and when you take in the fact that it costs but $9, the value factor skyrockets. With pure berry fruit, a smack of fresh herbs and even a hint of silk to the feel, this wine overdelivers.",88,Calina 2007 Reserva Carmenère (Maule Valley),,,,
"Give this wine some time in a decanter, because right out of the bottle it smells a little dusty. After a while, that recedes into the background, and the flavors are very nice, suggesting ripe cherry and cola. Fine tannins and classic coastal acidity provide good balance.",89,Patz & Hall 2010 Jenkins Ranch Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"This exquisitely crafted model of balance offers lemon-bar meringue and baked pear on the nose before revealing a tightrope of minerality and lush concentration on the palate, weighted perfectly against each other. Fleshy and delicious, the wine has so much fine fruit to offer now it'd be shame to wait, yet it will clearly hold onto its beauty with age.",95,Paul Hobbs 2012 Richard Dinner Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Mountain),,,,
"A touch of wood helps the wine's light fruit to deepen and become richer. The wine is well balanced, with fresh acidity giving a good lift.",85,Château Grand Jean 2009 Elevé en Fûts de Chêne  (Bordeaux Supérieur),,,,
"Very tight and shy aromas of lime zest, gray slate and white rocks show on the nose of this wine from the pioneering Niven Family and their winemaker Christian Roguenant. The palate shows some grassiness, Mexican lime and an interesting warmth on the back end, proving quite lean and sharp.",88,Baileyana 2013 Firepeak Chardonnay (Edna Valley),,,,
"Here's a fragrant white that opens with aromas of spring blossom, orchard fruit and a whiff of brimstone. On the bright juicy palate, a savory saline note energizes yellow apple, Bartlett pear and lemon zest.",88,Cantine Astroni 2015 Imperatrice Falanghina (Campi Flegrei),,,,
"This Cabernet-based blend is reminiscent to an old-fashioned Paso style that's soft, ripe and simple. It has candied cherry and blackberry flavors. Drink up.",85,Midnight 2007 Mare Nectaris Reserve Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"A generous wine, but one with good backbone and structure. The black fruits are beginning to meld into the sweet tannins and flavors of black cherry compote and spices. It is approaching maturity, but could age another 2–3 years.",90,D & R Dubois 2005 Arthus  (Côtes de Castillon),,,,
"This is a simple, sweet blush wine, with jammy raspberry and cherry flavors. It finishes with a swirl of spices.",85,Benessere 2011 Rosato Rosé (Napa Valley),,,,
"There is an almost tropical touch to the apple and lemon fruit: this is almost like vanilla-spiced apple tart with lemon zest. Very appetizing with that unusual vanilla-edge and more of that tropical lychee. Overall, this is balanced and very fruit-driven.",89,Domaine Moltès 2014 Steinert Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"French oak, vanilla, coconut, menthol and berry aromas lead the nose and carry over to the bracing palate along with close-grained tannins that leave a rather astringent finish.",87,Monchiero Carbone 2011 Printi Riserva  (Roero),,,,
"Jammy in blackberry, raspberry and mulberry flavors, this Pinot has more exotic notes of sautéed wild mushrooms sprinkled with soy sauce, anisette, pine tar and pepper. But its dominating qualities are dryness, acidity and tannins. Feels too young and unresolved for pleasure now. Give it a few years.",89,J Vineyards & Winery 2006 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"As in 2003, the blend is 78% Syrah, 22% Sangiovese, all from the Seven Hills vineyard, and aged in 70% new Hungarian oak. The wine looks and tastes a bit oxidative, the fruit is soft and simple, the finish lightly toasty.",86,Covington 2006 Starr Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"A full-bodied, rich wine that combines extra juiciness with delicious red-berry fruits. It is structured while being immediately attractive. It's a great wine to go with pasta dishes.",85,Quinta da Alorna 2009 Portal da Aguia Red (Tejo),,,,
"The rather faded hue of this wine indicates some evolution. On the nose, it offers an unusual but intriguing combination of aromas including sweet black fruit, A.1. sauce, thyme and sage. The palate offers ripe red and black cherry accented with notes of espresso and black pepper, but the fruit richness is already fading.",87,Tassi 2009 Franci  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"Nice aromas of smoked meat, coconut, dried berry fruit and pepper set up a nice palate of concentrated, snappy raspberry and plum flavors. Clean, mildly herbal, nicely spiced and with good mouthfeel and follow through. Shows the mildest touch of creamy oak flavor.",87,San Pedro 2007 Castillo de Molina Reserva Shiraz (Maule Valley),,,,
"Be careful when you look for thense wines, the labels at Aschieri are a little confusing;  a small white strip label at thumb level distinguishes the Sorano ordinaire from the special Costa Bricco. The wine, itself, is thick and quite poerful, with very ripe dark fruit, roses and earth flavors. It is beginning to show its age, and did not seem quite as fresh as the Sorano, but it proved to be more intense and extracted.",89,Giacomo Ascheri 2001 Sorano Coste & Bricco  (Barolo),,,,
"Rich flavors and a juicy texture make this dark-colored but medium-bodied wine fun to drink. It smells like ripe boysenberries, tastes almost jammy, and has a nice grip on the palate. It comes with a very reasonable price tag for the quality.",88,Avant 2013 Rich Silky Smooth Red (California),,,,
"Jasmine, spice and honey on the nose lead to a balance of lemon zest, mandarin orange and fresh fruit on the palate. The wine has a good balance and a zesty finish.",89,Nasiakos 2015 White (Mantinia),,,,
"From a year in which only single quinta vintage Ports were produced, this is a hugely concentrated toffee and dried fruit wine. It is rich with sweetness and a dense texture that is balancing complex flavors against the drier wood-aging flavors. It has been bottled just at the right stage of its development, rich and dense. Drink this beautiful wine now.",94,Kopke 1965 Special Edition Tawny  (Port),,,,
"Toasty vanilla and cinnamon aromas mingle with densely packed note of blueberry, blackberry and plum. The weighted midpalate is supported by structured yet ripe tannins and an interesting meaty streak. Drink from 2015.",90,Markowitsch 2011 Rosenberg Red (Carnuntum),,,,
"A great value, this Merlot-dominant blend, with splashes of Cab Sauv and Cab Franc exudes ripe aromas and flavors of rich dark fruit and berries jazzed up with layers of cigar tobacco, leather, savory herbs and tree bark. Concentrated and mouthfilling, with a velvety texture, it's a well-balanced wine with fine, but persistent tannins and a lengthy finish.",90,Constantia Glen 2008 Three Red (Constantia),,,,
"This firm wine is solid with tannins while also having the fruitiness of the year. A dry element will allow the wine to age balanced, with bright juicy fruits shining through. It comes from one of the lesser-known premier cru vineyards in Beaune. Drink from 2018.",92,Château de Santenay 2013 Montée Rouge Premier Cru  (Beaune),,,,
"Initial aromas of aged cheese, gym shoes and overall funk are more complicated than easy. This is lacks a center point on the palate, while flavors of briny stone fruits are drawn, buttery and oxidized. A briny apricot note rises up on the finish.",87,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L. NV Buleria Fino Sherry (Jerez),,,,
"Already entering its maturity, this offers flavors of dried cherries, cherry tobacco and rather tough, chewy tannins. It seems to have a hole in the midpalate, and may be moving quickly past its prime. Drink up.",86,VinStrata 2008 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"A roasted rich note of espresso and grilled pumpkin appears first. The palate is still dense with rich dark-berry fruit. This is full bodied but pervaded by freshness. The finely woven tannin structure is still very firm, very grippy, even though the fruit underneath it begins to show. This is now five years old and has barely begun its trajectory. Lovely now if you like full-bodied wines. Drink now through 2030.",93,Heinrich 2011 terra o. Red (Burgenland),,,,
"This medium-bodied Cabernet shows some of the variety's hallmark austerity in its firm structure. Cassis, sage and red currant aromas and flavors finish crisp and lingering. Drink now with rare beef or lamb, or hold and drink 2020–2025.",88,Wakefield 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Clare Valley),,,,
"This is a lush Chenin, with upfront toasty scents of wood-grilled peach, yellow melon, roasted nuts and orange oil. The medium-weight mouth is round and full in feel, with just enough acidic lift to keep the palate refreshed. The finish is all toasted spice and peach pit. Drink now.",88,Luddite 2013 Chenin Blanc (Overberg),,,,
"Dark and weighty, this is a dense wine, very firm in its tannins as well as bringing out rich blackberry fruits. The wood shows through strongly, while there is a pepper edge from the high alcohol.",85,Château Carignan 2011 L'Orangerie de Carignan  (Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux),,,,
"Subtle and elegant, this opens with a smoky aroma that underscores delicate scents of orchard fruit, citrus and botanical herb. The aromas follow through to the linear palate along with a racy mineral vein. A note of cured meat closes the racy finish.",89,Villa Raiano 2014 22  (Fiano di Avellino),,,,
"A blend of 70% Marsanne and 30% Roussanne, this is unusually aromatic for a white Hermitage, with perfumed notes of pineapple and melon underscored by hints of graphite. It's plump on the midpalate and custardy-rich in texture, yet focused and long on the finish. Drink now, or sometime after 2017.",93,Maison Nicolas Perrin 2009 White (Hermitage),,,,
"Fresh and fruity, this wine is full of black currants and acidity that is structured by a core of dark tannins. While it is firm at the moment it's likely to fill out, with the fresh fruitiness emerging. Drink from 2017.",85,Château du Moulin Rouge 2013  Haut-Médoc,,,,
"Aromas of pressed acacia flower, nut and smoke lead the nose. The lively, lean palate doles out unripe Bartlett pear, yellow apple skin and a flinty mineral note alongside zesty acidity.",85,Agricola Bellaria 2014 Ottant'anni Coda di Volpe (Irpinia),,,,
"Enticing aromas of blackberry, coffee and roasted fennel in a pork au jus mark the nose. The palate shows dark purple fruits, chai spice and cinnamon latte foam.",89,Concannon 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"Jacopo Biondi Santi hits a home run with this beautiful Morellino. The wine is smooth and dense, with lively cherry notes, soft spice and tobacco. It's straightforward and plush, but elegant at the same time.",90,Jacopo Biondi-Santi 2008 Castello di Montepò  (Morellino di Scansano),,,,
"This is a fun and quaffable kitchen sink blend of 32% Syrah, 22% Cabernet Sauvignon, 18% Merlot, 15% Petit Verdot, 9% Zinfandel and 4% Malbec. Sea salt caramel and cherry candy aromas lead into a palate full of red currant and strawberry jam flavors. Serve with cheeseburgers.",88,Cirque du Vin 2014 Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"Briny aromas of lime, jalapeño and minerals filter into a juicy, acidic palate with flavors that match the nose: briny citrus, lime and bell pepper. A narrow feeling finish turns pithy and bitter the longer this sits.",86,Arboleda 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Aconcagua Valley),,,,
"This intense, slightly sour Zinfandel combines herbal/menthol aromas with a taste of vanilla-toasted marshmallow, the fruit jammy and minty.",84,Mazzocco 2011 Zinfandel (Sonoma County),,,,
"Much like the 2006, this is an excellent effort, combining ripe melon and fig flavors with leafy notes of fresh garden herbs and crisp citrus. It's a touch viscous on the palate, finishing with superb length and freshness. Drink now.",91,Eradus 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"A funky nose of wet dog and medicinal cherry is no place you want to begin. The palate is high in acidity and scratchy, with tart plum, berry and cheek-starching tannins. Tastes reasonably good but fails in the bouquet and mouthfeel departments.",83,Calcu 2009 Malbec (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"Baked, rooty aromas of sandalwood, exotic spices and berry fruits are attractive. Though slightly grabby on the palate, this shows the right structure and build. Flavors of up-front oak, herbal plum and raspberry finish dry, with firm, pinching tannins. Drink through 2021.",90,Bodegas Muriel 2011 Fincas de la Villa Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"Coming from high terraces above the River Lot, this wood-aged wine is cool, collected and stylish. It has ripe blackberry and currant fruits along with just the right amount of firm tannins. Acidity keeps everything fresh and fruity while guarding the structure. Drink from 2017.",91,Château Lagrézette 2012 Château Chevaliers Lagrézette Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"One of the consistently finest Rieslings from the state, this is technically off dry, but feels dry given its exceptional acidity. Elegant citrus and floral aromas introduce a dense, textural midpalate. A showcase of style and panache, its layered citrus and stone fruits bring both skin and flesh flavors into focus.",93,Poet's Leap 2013 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"The aromas of dried flowers and green herbs have yet to fully blossom, seeming light and elusive, with green pepper providing accents. The blackberry and black currant flavors are light and layered, with well-balanced tannins and an extended finish.",90,àMaurice 2013 Owl & Crown Estate Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"This is a dark, huge Pinot Noir, so rich and opulently fruity that it might almost be a Grenache. It has a thick, soft mouthfeel, and is explosive in cherry jam, red licorice and mocha flavors that are utterly delicious. However, there's a certain direct appeal that lacks complexity and nuance. Drink now and over the next few years.",88,Etude 2006 Deer Camp Pinot Noir (Carneros),,,,
"With aromas reminiscent of moist soil after a summer rain, this wine also offers notes of dark coffee, cola cherry, black licorice and herbs. It's tightly wound, with dark fruit and coffee flavors and a hyperextended finish. Its best days are still in front of it.",91,Full Pull & Friends 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Corona Majore is a meaty and intense red wine, with slightly cooked notes of cherry syrup and blackberry pie, followed by tangy layers of spice and leather. The finish shows sour fruit and generous texture.",87,Tenute Soletta 2009 Corona Majore  (Cannonau di Sardegna),,,,
Way too sweet and soft to qualify as a dry table wine. Okay for big parties where everyone's drinking happily from paper cups.,81,Morro Bay 2009 Split Oak Estates Cabernet Sauvignon (California),,,,
"This medium-bodied Pinot Noir shows tasty varietal characteristics such as complex aromas of tea, plums and forest floor, almost-sweet cherry flavors, refreshing acidity, moderate tannins and a lingering finish. It earns its points with charm rather than weight.",93,FEL 2012 Ferrrington Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),,,,
"Aromas of char and toast are quite up front, though they smooth out over time and give way to lemon meringue. The tropical fruit, butter and spice flavors are broad and well balanced, with a creamy feel and a lingering finish. The oak gets out front, but there are good things going on.",88,Cloudlift Cellars 2014 Bacchus Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Pear drop and some citrus are the aromatic markers of this soft, light and very easy-drinking wine. The finish refreshes with green pear flavors.",87,Müller-Grossmann 2014 HM9 Helma und Marlies Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),,,,
"This wine is rich, rounded and smooth. It has enough citrus flavor to give a lift while also having ripe, apricot and red-apple tastes. Fresh at the end, it's also a wine to age, so drink from 2018.",88,Domaine de la Loge 2014  Pouilly-Fumé,,,,
"Rich, with restrained intensity, this has aromas of toasted graham-cracker crumb, spiced orange marmalade, peach preserves and wilted rose. It feels slightly pudgy on the midpalate, with a tapering finish that ends on a buttered-caramel note.",87,Tarara 2010 Late Harvest Petit Manseng (Virginia),,,,
"You can't beat the price versus quality ratio on offer here. Yes, this is an easy and thin wine, but it also delivers just enough fruit freshness and personality to pair with easy vegetable dishes or salads. Great for pool side parties or barbecues.",85,Cantina di Soave 2011 Re Midas  (Soave),,,,
"A soft, approachable Sauvignon Blanc with aromas of yellow florals, ruby red grapefruit and yellow pepper. Riper peach flavors unfold in the mouth supported by solid acidity and a clean finish, Drink now.",84,Robertson Winery 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Robertson),,,,
"Quite light aromas of talc, lemon zest and mineral along with whiffs of tropical fruit lead to sleek, bright, focused and lemony flavors backed by zippy acidity. It should shine paired with ceviche or oysters.",90,Efeste 2016 Feral Sauvignon Blanc (Ancient Lakes),,,,
"Briny stone-fruit aromas are sweetened by notes of apple blossom. A full, slightly foamy palate is lively but brusque, while this tastes of yeasty peach and apricot in front of a mildly bitter finish.",88,Casa Valduga NV 130 Brut  (Brazil),,,,
Appetizing notes of apple and yellow plum reach the nose. The palate is fizzing with freshness and redolent of fresh red-apple peel with overtones of honey. The mousse is creamy and accentuates the dry refreshing finish.,90,Domaine Fernand Engel NV Tradition Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),,,,
"This is a ripe structured wine produced by the Pelvillain family at their 30-acre vineyard in Prayssac, to the west of Cahors. It is a fresh wine with tannins that will soften quickly and easily. Fresh berry fruits and a touch of minerality are combined with acidity to form a fine, ripe and balanced wine. Drink from 2017.",90,Domaine du Théron 2014 Prestige Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"Hearty and rustic, this is a blend of several varieties—including Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah—it's an all-purpose, slightly sweet red wine for drinking with spaghetti and meatballs, burgers and chili.",83,St. Francis 2007 Red Splash Red (Sonoma County),,,,
"This wine has a deep-gold color, attractive baking-spice and buttered popcorn aromas, appealing apple and pear flavors and medium body. The texture is soft and easy and the acidity tastes low.",85,Earth's Harvest 2014 Organic Grapes Chardonnay (California),,,,
"Earthy, gritty, animal aromas are a bit raw as they blend with currant and red-plum scents. This wine lacks depth on the palate and flavors of tomato, red plum, herbs and oak finish choppy, drawing and tannic.",86,Consejo de la Alta 2013 Alta Río Crianza  (Rioja),,,,
"A rich and medium sweet wine, full of spice, lychees and ripe fruits. There is a tangy texture, a strong sense of minerality as well as herb, yellow fruits and nutmeg flavors. It is still young and needs time. Drink from 2017.",91,Boeckel 2012 Zotzenberg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"Bellezza is now labeled Chianti Classico (through 2007 it was labeled only as Toscana), based on Sangiovese grapes that deliver aromas of cherry, toasted almond, chocolate, rum cake and exotic spice. The wine is long, fresh and intense in the mouth and would pair well with steak and grilled porcini mushrooms.",91,Castello di Gabbiano 2008 Bellezza  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"A softly layered, elegant estate wine, this slowly reveals shocks of cherry, vanilla and coconut. A tanginess to the tannins gives it an oomph of verve and freshness on the palate.",90,Benessere 2013 Estate St. Helena Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),,,,
"Touches of toast from the wood aging give a spicy character. The toast brings out acidity at this stage rather than sweetness, with lemon and lime flavors dominant over the honey and botrytis in the background. Drink from 2018.",90,Château Broustet 2011  Barsac,,,,
"Made with 85% Sangiovese, 10% Merlot and 5% Syrah, this opens with aromas of brimstone, allspice, dried black-skinned fruit and a whiff of olive brine. The full-bodied palate delivers ripe black cherry, plum, vanilla and white pepper alongside chewy tannins.",90,Diadema 2012 Red (Toscana),,,,
"Though the alcohol level on this Pinot Noir is modest, the heavy handedness of the oak is high, with the wine taking on a burnt flavor—almost akin to barbecue-flavored CornNuts.",82,LangeTwins 2010 Pinot Noir (Clarksburg),,,,
"At 50,000 cases imported, this must be one of the most ubiquitous New Zealand Pinots in the United States. It's medium bodied and tightly wound, with a crisp core of mouthwatering acidity that adds zest to the flavors of dark cherry, earth and leather. Drink now.",86,Oyster Bay 2011 Pinot Noir (Marlborough),,,,
"This sweet red wine shows aromas of toasted hazelnut and ripe plum on the nose. The nutty character continues to the palate, with additional tones of chamomile tea and aromatic herb.",91,Bibich NV Ambra Red (North Dalmatia),,,,
"Cabernet Sauvignon (71%) makes up the majority of this blend, which also includes Merlot (25%) and pinches of Malbec and Petit Verdot. Complex aromas of potting soil, green pepper, graphite, herbs, blackberry, licorice and barrel spices are followed by focused black-fruit flavors with light coffee accents.",91,Pamplin 2012 JRG Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"The caramel, candy corn and peach aromas are rich and nectarous. The palate meanwhile shows delicacy and restraint. At times the concentration isn't all there but what is present is interesting.",87,Aluvé 2014 Lewis Vineyard Chardonnay (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"A spicy aroma of ginger cookies meets dark, blackberry flavors on the palate of this medium-bodied, pure-tasting wine. The gushing fruit flavors are compelling and palate-cleansing, with light tannins and acidity keep it fresh and lively.",88,Matchbook 2013 Dunnigan Hills Cabernet Sauvignon (Lake County),,,,
"There's a medicinal cherry hint to the nose of this Syrah-based rosé, with additional notes of ripe peach and melon. It's fleshy and full-fruited on the palate, with just enough acidity to keep the ripeness in check.",84,Les Costières de Pomerols 2016 Beau Vignac Rosé (Pays d'Oc),,,,
"Zesty lemon peel and blossom notes are invigorating and fresh on this dry, delicately framed wine. It's concentrated with tropical mango and melon flavors, yet zippy with lime acidity. It finishes long with an elegant mineral touch.",89,Hosmer 2013 Dry Riesling (Cayuga Lake),,,,
"A bit spicier than the other R Wines Shirazes, the 2007 Boarding Pass features mainly McLaren Vale fruit, offering blackberry tinged with coffee and peppery spice. Turns tart, tangy, almost a bit citrusy on the finish.",87,R Wines 2007 Boarding Pass Shiraz (South Australia),,,,
"After wading through some burn and heat on the nose, things settle on basic red fruit. The feel is fresh and zesty, while flavors of plum and berry are about as average and normal as they come. Feels racy, slick and quick on the finish.",85,Castillo Clavijo NV  Rioja,,,,
"The wine is so pale in color, you could read a newspaper through the garnet hue. That suggests its silky and delicate texture. The flavors are classic Sonoma Coast, suggesting perfectly ripe raspberries and strawberries, persimmons and cola, with a rich jacket of smoky sandalwood. You can enjoy this lovely Pinot Noir now, and it will age interestingly through 2024.",93,Les Voleurs 2012 Hurst Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Aromas of espresso, oak, vanilla, prune and mocha follow through to the warm palate along with dried black cherry, fig, roasted coffee bean, powdered sage and evident alcohol. It's already evolved, with fleeting but drying tannins.",85,Bocale 2011  Montefalco Rosso,,,,
"Aromas of apricot, pineapple and banana aromas all carry over to the palate, along with ripe peach, green apple,  grapefruit and mineral. Lively acidity gives structure and a vibrant, clean finish.",89,Vesevo 2012  Greco di Tufo,,,,
"Fans of toast, butterscotch and butter will gulp this down happily, but these reviewers are sad to see the wine's fruit get lost beneath it all. Finishes like caramel candy; smells like buttered whole wheat toast. Will certainly have its appeal, but we'd like to see the fruit center stage next vintage.",83,Heathfield Ridge 2000 Reserve Chardonnay (Limestone Coast),,,,
"Brunello Madonna Nera is a new product (this wine represents consulting enologist Carlo Ferrini's first stab at this particular project) with plush fruit and tobacco backed by brimstone, crushed granite and black pepper. The wine's personality is dark, brawny and rich.",92,La Madonna 2008 Madonna Nera  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"This sparkling wine opens with oak aromas. It has a frothy palate that reveals tropical fruit, citrus and oak notes, sprinkled with Mediterranean herbs. Despite the creamy texture, the flavors are lean and close on a bitter walnut note.",86,Il Mosnel 2009 Brut Satèn Chardonnay (Franciacorta),,,,
"A very light Syrah, with pleasant watermelon and raspberry fruit, that hangs in there until the fairly soft tannins take over.",84,Lake Chelan 2008 Rivers Bend Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A blend of Sangiovese and 5% Merlot, this fragrant wine opens with aromas of purple flowers, ripe plum, sage and sweet baking spice. The juicy palate offers fleshy black cherry, blackberry, licorice and clove accompanied by velvety tannins. It's already open and generous but will age well for a few more years. Drink through 2018.",90,Carobbio 2012  Chianti Classico,,,,
"This is an extraordinary, golden dessert wine with intense and penetrating notes of honey, marron glacé, dried apricot, marzipan, candied lemon, dried mint and jasmine. It's smooth, rich and long lasting in the mouth. The wine has personality and power and boasts magnetic appeal across the board.",94,Di Majo Norante 2006 Apianae Moscato (Molise),,,,
"This is a dense bottling of the Italian grape, with salt-and-pepper touches spicing up the baked raspberry, cranberry and ginger cake aromas on the nose. The palate shows deep flavors reminiscent of dried strawberry, rust, leather and shaved chocolate. Firm tannins provide structure.",92,Pianetta 2014 Sangiovese (Paso Robles),,,,
"Harsh and acidic and bone dry. Not much going on, beyond cherry and currant flavors, with lots of charred oak.",83,Roche 2007 El Nino Vino Red (Carneros),,,,
"This ripe, fruity wine has a hint of wood, fine acidity, a soft, creamy texture and an attractive burst of lime juice flavor. The finish is warm and rich, marked by good acidity.",88,Campolargo 2010 Diga? Branco White (Bairrada),,,,
"The subtlest overtones of pine and mint hover above the rather citrus-focused nose that also comes with a good dose of white pepper. The palate reverberates with savory, herbal spiciness. A cooler vintage has turned the usually very nutty and rounded Neuburger into a spicier but equally interesting food companion. Lemon zest and pepperiness provide a lasting finish.",92,Tinhof 2014 Neuburger (Burgenland),,,,
"Strawberry, vanilla and smoke overlay deep blue fruit in this seamless, velvety wine. Light-bodied, it wields vibrant acidity and moderate, spicy highlights.",88,Martin Ray 2015 Pinot Noir (Green Valley),,,,
"Crisp and cool, this shows a vanilla flavor that softens the attractive tight, acidic fruit. It's light in texture, with a prominent tang of citrus.",86,Château Philippe-le-Hardi 2010 Clos Philippe-le-Hardi  (Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Beaune),,,,
"Nutty and doughy, this amazingly complex offering mixes in plenty of citrus fruits, plums, and mineral and floral notes. The juxtaposition of creamy texture and delicacy of weight leaves you wondering, “How do they do that?” It’s hard to believe such an ephemeral sip can carry so much flavor.",94,Delbeck 1990 Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"Coming from vines planted in 1979 or earlier, this wine offers aromas of yellow apple, melon, honey and starfruit. It's lightly spritzy and drinks off dry, with a textured feel.",89,L'Ecole No. 41 2014 Old Vines Chenin Blanc (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"This red comes from one of the appellation's most important vineyards. Immense amounts of black peppercorn and raw beef show on the nose of this awesome bottling, which also offers soy-crusted meats that are gamy but not harsh. Rosemary oil, pine needle and peppercorns decorate the palate. It has a meaty lamb-roast richness at its core.",94,Stolpman 2015 Hilltops Syrah (Ballard Canyon),,,,
"Bright, forceful and slightly reductive, this white is aged less than a year in neutral French oak, allowing the fruit to speak and offer richness on the midpalate. Gingerbread and lemongrass flavors accent its essential core of green apple fruit.",91,White Rock Vineyards 2014 Estate Chardonnay (Napa Valley),,,,
"Well-ripened fruit flavors and full body define this big, smooth wine that was aged in French oak for 18 months—longer than is usual for Pinot Noir. It shows black cherry, blackberry and mild spices on the palate, with an appropriately tannic mouthfeel and warm, lingering finish.",92,Blue Oasis 2014 Costa Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino County),,,,
"The wine is packed with fruit (including red berries) and attractive acidity. It has tannins that are still very present, although they are now supporting the bright fruitiness of the wine. It's almost ready to drink; just wait until 2018.",85,Château Jeanguillon 2014  Bordeaux Supérieur,,,,
"Intense fruit shines through the toast and youthful acidity of this opulent wine. A generous structure will develop in concentration, bringing out the rich apricot and pear flavors. This is a grand wine, waiting to age. Drink from 2018.",94,Olivier Leflaive 2012 Les Pucelles Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),,,,
"Luscious, rich, balanced and intensely fruity, this stunning effort may well be the best Chardonnay ever produced in Washington. Two-thirds old- vine Celilo vineyard grapes are blended with estate-grown fruit from even older vines that were planted in 1976. Candied citrus, especially Meyer lemon, lemon verbena and other fruity herbs, stone fruits and subtle layers of caramel and toast burst from the glass. But the most amazing thing is that this wine stays fresh after being opened for literally days, much like a grand cru Burgundy.",96,Woodward Canyon 2009 Chardonnay (Washington),,,,
"This wine from southern Italy is made with native grape Greco di Tufo. It has aromas of oak and mineral with hints of candied fruit. The restrained palate shows wood and hints of lemon peel, but it lacks fruit richness.",85,Donnachiara 2011 Ostinato Greco (Campania),,,,
"This entry-level look at the family vineyard that overlooks Ballard Canyon and beyond brings scents of graphite, pepper, blackberry and dried, slightly dank herbs. It's tight and tart at first on the palate, with skins of black cherry and plum unwinding into pencil shavings, oregano, wood and emergent mushrooms. The tannins are best for drinking 2017–2025.",91,Beckmen 2012 Purisima Mountain Vineyard Syrah (Ballard Canyon),,,,
"Aromas of cherry cola, exotic spice, dark forest berry and black currant open the bouquet of this lively Recioto dessert wine. This expression is not as hearty and thick as others, and its slender brightness is its greatest strength.",88,Le Bertarole 2007 Podere le Giarette  (Recioto della Valpolicella Classico),,,,
"The freshest fruit is balanced with vanilla and spice flavors. Crisp apples have light, bright acidity, freshened further with lemon and lime fruitiness that leaves an open, full and generous aftertaste. The wine will be better in 2016.",86,Herdade do Rocim 2013 White (Alentejano),,,,
"Something different, the fruit for this wine comes off 80-year-old Carignan vines. The result is an intensely concentrated wine that mixes raspberry and blueberry fruit with delicate herbal shadings. It's full-bodied, but supple and easy to drink, ending on a note of dark chocolate. Drink now–2018.",90,Château d'Or et de Gueules 2012 Qu'es aQuo Red (Costières de Nîmes),,,,
"Kudos to Brian and Stephy Terrizzi for introducing this fascinating grape from southern Italy to Paso Robles. Rich white peach and poached pear aromas are edged with sharper mineral scents and boosted by vanilla undertones. The palate leads with bright acidity then explores red apple, cantaloupe and stone fruit flavors, proving easy to like but also tempered with restraint.",90,Giornata 2015 Fiano (Paso Robles),,,,
"A bold Chardonnay that embraces new oak barrels and has the flavor profile to show for it. Hovey fermented it in 50% new oak barrels, matured it on the lees and bottled it a few months after harvest. The scent and flavor of toasted oak comes through from the first sniff to the finish. But enough fruit, butter and almond flavors lie beneath the toasty overlay to make us come back for another sip.",89,Hovey 2013 Duende Chardonnay (Calaveras County),,,,
"With Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, this is a strongly structured wine. It is dark and tannic, acidity laced with dark plum flavors. This firm wine is still young and should be aged for at least a year, so drink from 2017.",87,Casa Santos Lima 2014 Portuga Red (Lisboa),,,,
"This well-crafted reserve boasts a solid core of blueberry and black cherry fruit, thickly accented with dark chocolate notes. Produced from heritage (Calera, Swan and Mt. Eden) clones, it's textural and dense, with dark char, espresso and black licorice flavors.",93,Le Cadeau 2015 Merci Reserve Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),,,,
"Juicy wine, just beginning to change from pure fruit to maturity. The tannins are still there, but more gently rounded with red berry fruits. The wine is ready to drink.",86,Château d'Ourbenac 2005 Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"Here's a classically crafted Brunello, with nuanced aromas of violet, iris, tobacco and clove on the nose. The palate delivers a core of black cherry flavor punctuated with nutmeg, eucalyptus and truffle. It's tight and tannic now, but should develop great complexity with time; drink 2016–2023.",92,Castelli Martinozzi 2008  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"This offers subdued aromas of elderflower, sage and a slight whiff of tomato vine while the crisp palate shows notes of mint and tropical fruit. Vibrant acidity gives it a clean, racy finish.",87,Poggiobello 2014 Sauvignon (Friuli Colli Orientali),,,,
"So crisply tart, so mouthwatering, it's just a pleasure to drink. Harvested at a brix of only 21.3, with alcohol of just 12.4%, the wine is completely dry, yet offers rich, forward flavors of citrus fruits, white peaches, green apples, honeysuckle flowers, minerals and spices.",90,Longoria 2008 Clover Creek Vineyard Albariño (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Strong tarry and asphalt notes show on the nose of this wine, with a touch of boysenberry. Similar elements play into the somewhat rough palate, where tarry tannins interplay with tart boysenberry, bolstered slightly by a touch of soy.",85,Balderdash 2012 Brakelight Reserve Syrah (Paso Robles),,,,
"A spicy note of cinnamon or bitter almond opens the nose of this tangy Soave. In the mouth, it delivers layers of stone fruit, honey, pineapple and pear. Pair this vineyard-designate white with roasted eggplant in curry sauce. The high alcohol does stand out.",87,Latium di Morini 2011 Campo le Calle  (Soave),,,,
"This Cab Franc is simple and jammy, like a wine version of melted black cherry jelly enhanced with an infusion of sweet, smoky, vanilla oak. It sure is fruity, but not very interesting in terms of complexity.",84,Titus 2007 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),,,,
"This dry Moscato Giallo from Lodi is delicious, with an intensely perfumed nose that follows through in the taste, alongside Meyer lemon, jasmine and cantaloupe. Very unusual, incredibly well priced and modest in alcohol, this lush, ginger-tinged Moscato is this taster's desert-island white.",94,Uvaggio 2010 Secco Moscato Giallo (Lodi),,,,
"Tight yet inviting aromas of honeysuckle, cement and green banana show on the nose of this ready-to-drink though possible-to-age wine. It's a lively sipper, with fresh-squeezed lime and tangelo flavors laid across an incredibly chalky texture.",90,Holus Bolus 2014 Blanc Roussanne (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"Reductive on first pour, this wine opens to display aromas of freshly sliced red apple and melon. It drinks a hair off dry, with a fleshy, full feel.",86,Wind Rose 2014 Pinot Grigio (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Rubber band, almond skin and dry citrus aromas feed into a tight, raw, rubbery feeling palate with a low fruit quotient and more brine and bitterness than expected. This is quite dry, salty and pithy but also fresh and lively on the finish. Drink immediately.",87,Telmo Rodríguez 2011 Sierras de Málaga Blanco White (Málaga),,,,
"There is good balanced intensity here. The varietal character shows through in the lychee and white peach flavors, with sufficient acidity lacing through. It is rich, packed with ripe flavors, hinting at a terroir-driven mineral character.",90,La Cave des Vignerons de Pfaffenheim 2008 Steinert Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"Flat and somewhat disjointed, this wine offers a strong taste of eucalyptus in a light-bodied, simply structured frame.",82,Kirkland Signature 2014 Pinot Noir (Carneros),,,,
"This is 80% Cabernet Sauvignon blended with 16% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc. It shows a nice interplay of fruit and barrel with notes of cocoa, cherry, dry chocolate and toast supported by well-integrated tannins. The mid-palate still needs some time to fully come together but when it does, it will be a beauty.",91,Januik 2010 Weinbau Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Wahluke Slope),,,,
"The overall impression is of under-ripe fruit, with flavors of rhubarb, cranberry and very sour cherry. It's tannic as well, and set on a thin frame. Drink up.",85,Amalie Robert 2012 Satisfaction Syrah (Willamette Valley),,,,
"There's lots of ripe, pure fruit in this wine, suggesting sour cherry candy, cranberries and red licorice. Texturally, it's softly silky, and the finish is dry. High alcohol shows up on the finish as a not unpleasant jalapeño-like warmth.",89,Windsor Oaks 2007 2 Dijon Clones Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"A heavy dose of petrol is the aromatic greeting, and it comes with hints of rubber, latex and waxy white fruits. Feels tangy and fresh due to blazing acidity, while it tastes both of tropical fruits and diesel. Long and chiseled on the finish.",86,Meli 2010 Riesling (Central Valley),,,,
"Kudos to Derby for holding this Cabernet Franc-based blend back for so long before release. The years have mellowed it, giving it a soft, rounded quality. Drink now for the lush cherries and currants.",87,Derby 2008 Implico Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"Scents of honey and freshly pressed apples waft from this delicate sweet Riesling. Bright, sunny peach flavor dominates the palate, but is pierced with a startling vein of lemon acidity. Finishes a savory with lingering notes of pollen and spice.",91,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch) 2012 Berncasteler Doctor Auslese Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"This blend of 80% Malbec and 20% Syrah from Tolliver Ranch Vineyard shows blackberries, violets and loam on the nose. Red juice flavors entertain the lean and lithe palate, which offers decent tannic grip.",87,Force of Nature 2012 The Fiend Malbec-Syrah (Paso Robles),,,,
"As the producer's first 100% Syrah, this impressive wine shows the vibrancy of cool-climate influence in distinct notes of saddle leather and white pepper on the nose. Integrated in oak and smooth on the palate, it takes time to come around in floral raspberry.",91,Marimar Estate 2012 Don Miguel Vineyard Estate Grown and Bottled Unfiltered Syrah (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Lots of ripe raspberry, cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors in this Pinot Noir. It has elegant, silky texture, with bright acidity, but you do want to drink it now before the fruit fades away.",87,Testarossa 2012 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"This ripe, wood-aged wine has fragrant red-cherry flavors and good acidity. It's still young, so it does have some bitterness, although the rich fruits and structure all point to a good future. Drink from 2017.",87,Chavet Fils 2013 Cuvée Exception  (Menetou-Salon),,,,
"A worthy followup to the 2007, perhaps not as immediately flamboyant, but a major Pinot Noir to age in the cellar. Shows flashy cherry and raspberry fruit, with tantalizingly rich spices and a perfect coating of sweet, smoky oak. Fine and delicious now, after decanting, and should develop over this decade.",94,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2008 Saralee's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"The distinctive nose on this bottling is tight yet tropical, with mango, pineapple, pear skins, orange rinds, dried lime peels and a gin-like juniper all converging. The palate offers a balance between tightly woven texture and ripe tropicality, with lime rinds, mango and petrol touches.",87,R2 2013 Camp 4 Vineyard Grenache Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Clean and inviting, but simple, with apple and fresh-herb aromas. The palate is properly crisp yet not sharp, and the flavors of green apple and white grapes are snappy. Regular and a little better than good in every way, but ultimately more basic than special.",87,Mont Paral NV Brut Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"Power and grace combine in this great fortified wine. Already 10 years old, it will age gracefully through at least 2030 if kept in a cool cellar. The aromas combine ripe, vivid cherry and blackberry with caramel accents. Flavors are very ripe but tangy at the same time, echoing plum jam and toffee on the finish.",95,Quady 2006 Starboard Dessert Wine Port (Amador County),,,,
"This sources grapes from the oldest (1972) blocks at Sagemoor, yielding a deep, rich and intense wine saturated with black cherry, cassis, licorice and barrel flavors. It's perfectly balanced, drinking beautifully, and fit for cellaring over a decade or longer.",92,Walla Walla Vintners 2010 Sagemoor Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Consistent with past vintages, this still-young wine has a yeasty nose, textural mouthfeel and light pear fruit flavors, gently dappled with cinnamon spice. There is just a hint of sweatiness in the finish.",89,Left Coast Cellars 2009 The Orchards Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Perfumed in dried herb and cigar, this is a supple, round, high-toned wine, made from largely Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with smaller additions of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Dolcetto. Red cherry dominates, almost like a kirsch, while the restrained oak makes it easy to enjoy now.",90,B Side 2014 Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Alluring aromas of white flower, orchard fruit and Mediterranean herb mingle in the glass. The delicious, linear palate offers a nice depth of flavors including juicy yellow peach, tart green apple, nectarine and a hint of ginger alongside tangy acidity. The lingering finish closes on a mineral note.",92,Marangona 2013 Trecampane  (Lugana),,,,
"The name “Not so little” is a joking reference to its appellation. This is a pleasure, a delicious unoaked Chardonnay with green fruits, a touch of caramel and kiwi fruit flavors.",86,La Chablisienne 2006 Pas si Petit  (Petit Chablis),,,,
"The Meritage term would indicate that this is a mix of Bordeaux grapes. It's juicy and forward, with red wine fruit flavors, as well as significant streaks of coffee and vanilla from the oak treatment.",86,Grandmaster 2010 Red Meritage (Washington),,,,
"An earthy touch of yeast plays promisingly on the nose. The palate then comes in with a concentrated load of ripe peach, bright lemon and rounded rose perfume. An edge of dark fir honey adds even more spicy richness. This brims with flavor, showing rich fruit against fresh lemon. There is lots of excitement here but also balance. This is a rich warming generous wine. Drink 2017–2027.",94,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2015 Steingrubler Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"Dark and brooding, this is characterized by a plum skin note, plus firm tannins and a solid structure. It's concentrated and dense, a wine that is serious and needs to age for 4–5 years. The finish has a firm feel.",87,Château Montet 2009 Cuvée Prestige  (Bordeaux Supérieur),,,,
"This is an expressive Sauvignon Blanc with almost vegetal aromas announcing coastal origins. The palate is chiseled and lemony, then minerally flavors of grapefruit, tangerine and lemon give way to passion fruit and stony finishing notes. Laser-beam acidity and minerality are what drive this.",90,Luis Felipe Edwards 2012 Marea Fumé Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),,,,
"Produced from vines that are up to 80-years-old and now organic, this concentrated wood-aged wine is perfumed, rich and firmly structured. Dark tannins line the wine supporting the black plum and cherry fruits and acidity. Richard Rottiers, new on the scene in 2007, created a cru that is going to be a very fine wine. Drink from 2018.",94,Domaine Richard Rottiers 2015  Moulin-à-Vent,,,,
"Still firm, this wine is dominated by tannin and dark fruit, with a dry core typical of this Pommard vineyard. The red and dark plum-fruit flavors are developing slowly and the wine needs time to balance. Drink from 2019.",91,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2013 Les Rugiens Premier Cru  (Pommard),,,,
"While fresh pink grapefruit and Meyer lemon notes shine brightly on the nose and palate of this off-dry Riesling, there's a touch of savory allium that distracts. It's a juicy easygoing wine with approachably soft, sunny acidity. Drink now.",86,Schäfer 2014 Mettenheimer Kabinett Riesling (Rheinhessen),,,,
"This wine boasts a heavy wooden overlay, but the final result is a full-bodied, lushly textured Shiraz powered by caramel, vanilla, leather, cedar and baking spices. There's sufficient length and tannin on the finish to think it might even improve over the next 10 years or so.",90,Syan 2005 Shiraz (Pyrenees),,,,
"This wine has a glorious floral nose highlighted in honey and wildflowers, revealing richer gingerbread and toasted oak undertones as it opens. Its creamy texture provides a sense of unctuousness, complemented by tart green apple and lemon on the finish.",91,Duckhorn 2013 Toyon Vineyard Chardonnay (Napa Valley),,,,
"A bitter, caramel-flavored wine, this is tight and peppery. A lean character leaves a sharp aftertaste.",81,Château Jean Faux 2014 Jean Faux Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),,,,
"This is a fairly big, muscular Pinot Noir, with beefy black-cherry fruit and oaky overtones of brown sugar. Give it a year or more to smooth out, because the long, intense finish filled with berry fruit shows tremendous promise. Drink 2013–2020.",92,Carrick 2009 Pinot Noir (Central Otago),,,,
"Bricco delle Viole has a thorny, slightly nervous personality that needs a few more years of cellar aging before softening. Aromas include dill, dried herbs, turmeric, forest berry and bramble. The mouthfeel is sharp and polished with bright berry nuances and crisp acidity. Drink this wine with cream- or butter-based dishes.",88,G D Vajra 2004 Bricco delle Viole  (Barolo),,,,
"Grapy aromas and tart fruit flavors make this a lean, edgy wine that's not overtly fruity or rich. But the smell of wood smoke and blackerries, and the tart black cherry flavors are vivid, energetic and mouthwatering.",89,Donkey & Goat 2012 Fenaughty Vineyard Syrah (El Dorado),,,,
"Green pear and balm-like hints of aloe vera appear first on the palate then are followed by softly spiced and slightly peppery citrus notes that also provide some welcomed texture. A lovely, easy-drinking Grüner.",88,Hugl-Wimmer 2015 Hugl Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),,,,
"This rosé needs to age. It has a zesty, crisp and mineral texture that is tight and nervy. As it softens, more red fruits will come to the front, although the structure will remain, making this a serious rosé for drinking with food.",92,Domaine des Diables 2013 Bonbon Rosé (Côtes de Provence Sainte-Victoire),,,,
"This is a fresh and easy to drink white that's perfect for pairing with salads or citrus-based grilled fish. Medium weight with prominent tart flavors of lemony citrus and green berries, and the finish offers a hint of fresh hay.",86,DeWaal 2009 Young Vines Sauvignon Blanc (Stellenbosch),,,,
"A beautiful wine, dry and classically structured, showing the elegant balance for aging. Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, it's long and deep in blackberries and cassis. Give it a brief decant if you open it now, but it should develop over the next six years, at least.",93,Corison 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Hints of ripe peach creep in with the yellow plum notes on the nose. The palate adds a generous if frothy creaminess to these flavors, making them fizz and fill the mouth with their fruity freshness. Behind all this lurks a grown-up backdrop of biscuity richness that allows for a restrained dosage and a very dry finish. Lovely now, will benefit from bottle age. Drink 2016–2019.",91,Joseph Cattin 2010 Grande Cuvée Brut Millesimé Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),,,,
"Soft, with a light texture and approachable acidity, this is a bright wine that has plenty of apricot and pear flavors. The wine is fresh and ready to drink, with an orange zest finish.",84,DFJ Vinhos 2014 Portada Winemaker's Selection Branco White (Lisboa),,,,
"This is a great example of a lower alcohol, somewhat underripe Pinot Noir that shows solid depth and lovable freshness. Lively aromas of black-raspberry sorbet and dark strawberry show on the nose, while the palate picks up a tart cranberry character. White pepper, thyme and juniper enliven the fruity flavors.",92,Tessier Winery 2015 Saveria Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"This wine is round and ripe. It offers spice and acidity along with warm apple flavors, with a light touch of minerality at the end. Drink now.",85,Vins Auvigue 2014  Mâcon-Fuissé,,,,
"This is a fashionably pale rosé, as light and bright in color as it is on the palate. Fruity, attractive and ready to drink, it has zesty orange peel and crisp wild strawberry flavors.",86,Quinta Nova de Nossa Senhora do Carmo 2015 Rosé (Douro),,,,
"Aragonês, a k a Tempranillo and Tinta Roriz, is the source of this smooth, rich wine that shows great elegance despite its high alcohol. It has concentration, very dense fruit flavors and a gorgeous ripe finish.",90,Herdade da Malhadinha Nova 2008 Aragonês de Peceguina Aragonês (Alentejano),,,,
"Hugely delicious, just a joy to drink. So soft and velvety, so rich in blackberry jam, cassis and chocolate flavors, with the tannins so smooth and round. Really wonderful over the next few years, although the softness and high alcohol suggest it's not an ager.",93,Pride Mountain 2008 Vintner Select Cuvée Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Lots of good flavor in this dry wine, with blackberries, black currants and herbs. But it's very hard in tannins, with a drily astringent mouthfeel that no amount of age is likely to mitigate.",84,Williamson Wines 2006 Seduce Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"A lovely wine, made even more attractive by the value price. It has flavors and lemons and limes and a ripe, sweet edge of honey, although it's technically dry. The acidity is clean and refreshing.",87,Bridlewood 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Light, fresh, raspberry-flavored wine, with a hint of spice and great lines of acidity. The wine is fruity, delicious.",84,Château Beauregard-Ducourt 2010 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),,,,
"Made using organic fruit, this has aromas of pineapple, apricot and candied lemon. There's a sensation of stickiness on the palate that resembles ripe fruit and honey.",86,Roccafiore 2010 Bianco Fiordaliso Grechetto (Todi),,,,
"More thickly structured and granular than the producer's vineyard-designates, this wine is medium in body and weight with a nice backbone of acidity. It veers into forest floor and sandalwood characteristics amid dense, dark cherry.",88,WesMar 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Yellowing in color and smelling waxy and peachy. This has become fleshy and sweet, with a syrupy feel. Drink it now or wait for a fresher vintage.",83,Bodegas Borbore 2008 Martin Fierro Torrontés (Tulum Valley),,,,
"This crisp wine is currently tightly closed. It is textured and mineral, with apple and citrus flavors coming through slowly. This perfumed wine needs to age. Drink from 2017.",91,Alex Gambal 2014  Puligny-Montrachet,,,,
"Made from dried Albana grapes, this dessert wine opens with ripe yellow peach and apricot aromas that carry over to the savory palate together with acacia honey and toasted hazelnut notes. Fresh acidity balances the sweet flavors.",90,Tre Monti 2012 Thea Passito Albana (Romagna),,,,
"This fun blend of Barbera, Merlot and Albarossa drinks easily and would pair with a long list of foods including pasta, chicken and spicy ground beef. Aromas include cherry, blackberry, cola and chocolate and the wine's finish is smooth and soft.",87,Tenuta La Marchesa 2007 Saula Red (Monferrato),,,,
"Oaky flavors of caramel, honey and butterscotch dominate. It's dry and crisp in acidity, with suggestions of limes and mangoes.",85,Balverne 2012 Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Aromas of lemon-lime soda, chalk, underripe nectarine and kumquat show on the nose of this bottling from Southern California. Tangy citrus and a wet-cement minerality show through on the sip, where ripe Gravenstein-apple flavors trend toward sour stone-fruit rinds on the finish.",87,Falkner 2015 Chardonnay (Temecula Valley),,,,
"This blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, easily recognizable for its fun label showing antique cars and cyprus trees, has earthy aromas that suggest leafy underbrush, wet soil, woodland berries and plum. The palate delivers black cherry accented with black pepper, espresso and menthol. Tightly woven and tannic, it will benefit with a few more years aging. Drink 2015–2019.",88,Querceto di Castellina 2009 Belvedere Riserva  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"This traditionally crafted Barolo shows earthy sensations of truffle, underbrush and leather along with delicious spice and ripe cherry flavors, along with uplifting mineral notes. The ripeness demonstrates the warmth of the vintage.",92,Giuseppe Rinaldi 2009 Brunate Le Coste  (Barolo),,,,
"88—90 Barrel sample. A spicy, wood laden wine, kept afloat with ripe blackberries and fresh tannins. Excellent acidity to keep the wine buoyant.",89,Château Rahoul 2006 Barrel sample  (Graves),,,,
"The Négrette wines come mainly from a small area northwest of Toulouse although they are also found in pockets elsewhere in the southwest. This is a light and deliciously fruity wine, full of rosewater aromas and a bright aftertaste.",86,Lionel Osmin & Cie 2015 La Vie en Rose Negrette (Vin de France),,,,
"A bold, muscular, striking wine with nerves of steel, this offers a dense, demanding array of black fruit threaded with veins of espresso, smoke, tar, tobacco and iron. As it bursts with exotic barrel flavor, the fruit seems a bit buried, but time after time these wines unfold over the course of decades into glorious maturity. These are arguably the most long-lived and cellarworthy wines in Washington—if not in the entire country.",98,Quilceda Creek 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"It shows an altogether riper aspect of Grüner. Yellow pear, yellow plum and notions of peach appear and give way to a rounded, generous palate with lots of phenolic backbone and structure. It can definitely shine with substantial food.",88,Fritsch 2013 Steinberg Grüner Veltliner (Wagram-Donauland),,,,
"Pretty and floral, juicy and substantial, this wine delivers in flavor and texture, conveying caramel, baked pear and pineapple. Notable oak wraps around the fruit, ending with hazelnut and nutmeg.",90,La Crema 2015 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"A ripe, smoky and still-tannic wine, this is solidly structured. A dense, dry core shows some sign of extraction although the blackberry fruits are developing well. As the wine ages, it will bring out the balance between acidity and structure. Drink from 2017. Owner Cyril Trias works with Alliance Bourg co-operative on his wines.",90,Château Chantemerle 2012  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,,,,
"This taut, tight wine is impressive. The mineral texture and crisp white fruits combine into a harmonious wine that is full of apple and pear flavors. It comes from the Grand Cru village of Avize, reflecting the chalk soil in its structure. Drink from 2019.",91,Waris Hubert 2011 Blanche Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (Champagne),,,,
"Vintage after vintage, this wine impresses for its complexity and balance, and the 2009 won't disappoint on those counts. It may not be the biggest, baddest Dry Red No. 2, but it features blueberry fruit and espresso and black olive shadings, a lovely supple texture and a softly lingering finish. Drink it over the next few years.",91,Yarra Yering 2009 Dry Red Wine No. 2 Shiraz-Viognier (Yarra Valley),,,,
"Solid and sturdy up front, with earthy berry and cassis aromas. Feels lively and a bit grabby, with plenty of red fruit in the plum and berry range. Finishes with a hint of smoky oak and toast. A good wine from a cool vintage.",87,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite) 2010 Los Vascos Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"Fragrant white flower, yellow stone fruit and dried herb aromas open. The vibrant, elegant palate offers mature yellow apple, creamy white peach and mineral alongside bright acidity. A white almond note closes the lingering finish.",91,Citari 2015 Conchiglia  (Lugana),,,,
"Marked by jammy citrus and tropical flavors and crisp acidity, this is a standard Chardonnay. It shows the oaky, caramelized notes that Americans love in this most popular white wine.",84,Taft Street 2009 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Dusty, earthy plum and cherry aromas are a bit scratchy but enjoyable and powerful. A smooth, plummy palate entertains flavors of toasty black fruits and peppery spice, while the finish is meaty and full, with easy tannins. Drink through 2017.",91,Montgó 2012 Monastrell (Alicante),,,,
"Sweet, simple and fruity, this light-bodied wine smells floral, tastes appley and feels soft and sugary to sip.",84,Naggiar 2016 Estate Muscat Canelli (Sierra Foothills),,,,
"A rich, thick, inky purple Petite Sirah with a small amount of Syrah blended in, offering aromas of baked plum, boysenberry and leathery spice. Elegant for the variety, the wine is concentrated and structured with a long finish of dark coffee.",88,Di Arie 2009 Estate Grown Petite Sirah (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),,,,
"High-pitched leather, chewing tobacco and desiccated black-fruit aromas lead on the nose. On entrance the wine feels loose and easy, but a medium amount of chewy tannins give footing to the second half of the palate.",86,Page Springs 2010 Estate Vineyard Yavapai County Petite Sirah (Arizona),,,,
"Light colored and light flavored, this has just hints of fruitiness along with the acidity. It is a crisp wine, very dry in character, bright and tangy at the end.",84,Château Haut Bessac 2014 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),,,,
"This is the winery's Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux blend, containing all five of the major Bordeaux grape varities. Superripe and high in alcohol, it lacks subtle complexity or ageworthiness. Forward jam, chocolate and oak flavors are undeniably delicious though.",87,St. Supéry 2010 Elu Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"What this mature, ripe wine has lost in fruit, it has gained in richness and complexity. Its toasty, nutty character attracts, along with its tight acidity and taut, nervy texture. Nicely evolved and well-balanced, it is ready to drink now.",94,H. Blin 2008 Millésime Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"Grapefruit and lemon aromas entice with this mouthwatering Sauv Blanc from respected producer Simonsig. Refreshing, balanced flavors follow and a spin of minerality gives the wine a food-friendly edge. Enjoy with grilled fish or salad.",86,Simonsig 2007 Sunbird Sauvignon Blanc (Stellenbosch),,,,
"The Jura's Savagnin grape gives fruity wines with a strong yeasty, salty character. That's very evident in this fine example. With its rich apple fruit and hints of almonds, it's full, spicy, tangy and aromatic. Drink now, although it will age at least until 2020.",92,Domaine Dugois 2015 Auréoline Savagnin (Arbois),,,,
"Made from Cabernet Franc, this opens with scents of purple flowers, toasted oak, exotic spice and red currants. The firmly structured palate doles out blackberries, black cherries, ground black pepper, clove, vanilla and mocha alongside velvety tannins. Drink through 2020.",92,Amantis 2010 Iperione Red (Toscana),,,,
"It shows great depth of flavor, with delicious fresh berries, black fruits, balanced acidity and fragrance. The tannins are present, but given a great lift by the fruitiness. A wine to drink over the medium-term, from 2016.",90,Château Laforge 2011  Saint-Émilion,,,,
"This has enormously high alcohol, but the fruit is curiously thin, with some unripeness. The amount of new oak doesn't seem to help.",82,Hug 2010 Starr Ranch Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"This smells of burnt match and soap, with flavors of very tart citrus and hints of pear and orange. There's plenty of acid but not much weight to the mid-palate.",83,Bridgeview 2006 Blue Moon Pinot Gris (Oregon),,,,
"Steely lemon and low oak star in this unfussy wine, which remains light bodied in spirit despite a rich finish of marshmallow and vanilla.",87,JAQK Cellars 2013 High Roller Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"This ripe wine's delicious sweetness comes from the delicious honey, ripe apricot and mango flavors. Delicate acidity is balanced against these notes, giving the palate a citrusy edge.",92,Château Filhot 2009  Sauternes,,,,
"This leads with aromas of dark raspberries, toast and woodspice, seeming to still be in its shell. Flavors are high-octane, rich and sweet, with enough tannins to go the distance. It doesn't seem entirely integrated right now, but it will go up a notch or two if it comes together.",91,Pedestal 2012 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This Carricante offers aromas of citrus, white almond and cut grass. There are pretty touches of drying mineral and brimstone on the finish.",87,Barone di Villagrande 2011  Etna,,,,
"Stewed and vegetal, with hard, bitter tannins. This does not taste as if the grapes ripened sufficiently, and the extraction is such that green, bitter tannins are the main flavor.",81,Cathedral Ridge 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (OR)),,,,
"This wine is a unique blend of Grenache (63%), Syrah (19%) and Cabernet Sauvignon. Aromas of raspberry, garigue, blueberry and herb give way to palate-coating red and blue-fruit flavors that persist on the finish. It shows a lovely sense of balance, poise and polish.",92,Rasa 2015 Tilting at Windmills XL Vineyard Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"This is for you, if you like your Zins in a sweet, soft style. It tastes like the filling from a black­berry and cherry pie, dusted with exotic spices, like cinnamon and black pepper.",84,Twisted Sisters 2010 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),,,,
"Sweet cantaloupe and yellow apple flavors lend a plump, voluptuous feel to this sweet Riesling. Soft acidity accentuates its broadness on the palate. The finish lingers on a sunny tropical note. Drink now.",87,St. Michael Weinkellerei 2013 Auslese Riesling (Rheinhessen),,,,
"Black cherry, chipped slate and an earthy nutmeg character show on the nose of this stylishly labeled bottling. Medium in weight, it offers energetic and tart cranberry-cherry flavors as well as a menthol element on the palate, which is tangy throughout and wipes up clean.",87,Liberated 2013 Pinot Noir (Monterey County),,,,
"Dusty apricot, peach and citrus aromas come in front of a snappy, basic palate with racy acidity. Citrus, banana and pineapple flavors finish fresh and modest. This is nice and perfectly appealing. It's ideal for patio sipping.",88,Marqués de la Concordia 2015 Federico Paternina Verdejo (Rueda),,,,
"M.C.K. stands for Motor City Kitty, and along with the winery's Milbrandt Syrah, this is the entry-level offering in a vast portfolio of single vineyard bottlings. Tasty, toasty, supple and fruity, this carries slight hints of citrus, earth and stem and wraps its appealing, forward flavors in a light coating of milk chocolate.",90,K Vintners 2010 M.C.K. Syrah (Washington),,,,
Totally pale in colored this wine has delicate hints of red fruits as well as a tight crisp mineral texture. There is a salty edge with touches of spice and pepper. The aftertaste is bright and fruity.,87,Domaine Sainte-Marie 2016 Tradition Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"This generous, fruity and lightly sweet wine should please a crowd with its butter and vanilla aromas, rich apple, pear and baking-spice flavors and rounded mouth-filling texture.",87,Save Me San Francisco 2014 Calling All Angels Chardonnay (California),,,,
"Klipsun vineyard grapes are fermented in stainless steel to produce this crisp and refreshing Sauvignon Blanc. In 2010, a cool vintage even at this Red Mountain site, the grassy side of the grape is in the spotlight. A little sweatiness blows off with airing, then the lemongrass and light melon flavors come through, with plenty of acid backing.",87,Stevens 2010 AnArtisticThought Sauvignon Blanc (Yakima Valley),,,,
"This ripe, medium-sweet Champagne is balanced and attractively fruity. It offers good contrast between acidity, rich apple and pear flavors, and a modicum of sweetness. It would work well as an apéritif or with some fish dishes.",86,Bertrand-Delespierre NV Elixir Dix Vins Premier Cru Demi Sec  (Champagne),,,,
"Black currant leaf and juicy plum guts abound on the nose of this Bordeaux-style blend, and those aromas transition into the dominating flavors of the palate alongside suggestions of pepper and sweet smoked meat. Balanced, with fine tannins and a clean but lingering finish.",87,Doolhof 2008 Lady in Red Red (Wellington),,,,
"Odd aromas of clove are smoky but mostly come across as weird and forced. This has a lactic, creamy mouthfeel with soft edges. The flavor profile is all wood, and resiny, clove-driven wood at that. A severely sweet, cloying, resiny finish is a lot to deal with.",81,Coto de Hayas 2012 Fagus Selección Especial Garnacha (Campo de Borja),,,,
"Aromas of plum cake, spicy blueberry and cocoa unfold in the glass of this structured wine. The palate delivers black cherry, vanilla, graphite, ground black pepper and well-integrated oak alongside assertive but refined tannins. It has muscle but also shows elegance and restraint. Drink 2015–2025.",91,Falesco 2010 RC2  (Montefalco Sagrantino),,,,
"Seltzer and sauerkraut are off putting on the nose. It's scattered and salty tasting, with citrus and celery notes.",82,François Lurton 2013 Hermanos Lurton Verdejo (Rueda),,,,
"Iris, mature berry, menthol and Mediterranean herb aromas emerge on this full-bodied red. On the ripe, chewy palate, notes of clove, vanilla and mocha accent juicy Morello cherry, crushed black cherry, star anise and tobacco. Firm, fine-grained tannins provide the framework. Drink 2019–2026.",91,Tenuta La Fuga 2011  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"This wine opens with ripe aromas of black plum and boysenberry fruit, accented by hints of licorice root and menthol. The fruity core continues to shine on the smooth, round palate, alongside accents of purple violet, black tea and oak-driven spice that linger through the close.",89,Carmel 2009 Sha'al Single Vineyard Merlot (Galilee),,,,
"Smooth, rich and soft, this is an attractively balanced blend. It shows black berry fruits, sweet acidity and a very soft, dense and velvety texture.",86,Hafner 2003 Dornröschen Kosher Red (Burgenland),,,,
"The former race car driver hired Doug Margerum to make his wine. Though quite pale in color, this offers fragrant aromas of sea salt, rounded nectarine fruit, wisps of white flowers and the slightest show of almond macarons. Stone fruit pops out on the salty palate, but the bright acidity and chalky minerality slice deeply, ending on a dollop of vanilla cream.",92,Jamie Slone Wines 2013 Aloysius Sierra Madre Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"An oaky, earthy aroma and lots of deep, jammy fruit flavors define this full-bodied but very smooth Zinfandel and Barbera blend. While fairly big in impact, the tannins are not very prominent so the mouthfeel and finish are gentle.",87,Borjón 2012 Diferente Red (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),,,,
"A pliant, medium- to full-bodied wine, this deals ripe stone fruit and golden raisin flavors, plus toasty, oxidative tones.",86,Shenandoah Vineyards 2011 Blanc White (Shenandoah Valley),,,,
"Rich but refined, it opens with an enticing floral fragrance of white roses and stone fruit. The fresh palate offers white peach, tropical fruit, pineapple and pink grapefruit accented with clove and nutmeg.",92,Klaus Lentsch 2012 Fuchslahn Gewürztraminer (Alto Adige),,,,
"Blush wines from Pinot Noir can be all over the map. But this one lands squarely on the dry, balanced side, offering crisp flavors of cherries, rose petals, orange tea, cloves and cinnamon. Superversatile with a wide range of foods, it's a good by-the-glass wine for restaurants.",87,Kenwood 2007 Pinot Noir Rosé Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Sour plum, dried herb, pepper and tar scents show on the nose of this bottling from the widely available brand. The palate is tightly wound with sticky tannins, which are like to mellow with time, allowing the coffee, asphalt, elderberry and black currant flavors to shine more brightly.",87,Estancia 2014 Reserve G-S-M (Monterey County),,,,
"Aged in stainless steel, this wine comes from a new wine-growing region in the cataracts of the North fork of the Walla Walla River. The aromas are quite faint initially. The palate is on the lighter side of medium bodied, with tart flavors. It lacks a sense of clear direction.",87,Tertulia 2016 Elevation Estate Vineyard Marsanne (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"This is very flavorful, fruity and full bodied. It maintains a sleek texture in spite of considerable tannins that keep it feeling dry. Aromas are like wild berries and cherry blossoms, the flavors are exotic and very ripe, and the finish keeps adding more fruit nuances.",88,Vinedos Aurora 2010 Don Victor Reserva De La Casa Red (Lodi),,,,
"Fruity and attractively wood aged, this is soft and round, with a bright edge of acidity that brings out the taut, refreshing finish.",85,Albert Bichot 2010  Bourgogne,,,,
"Marcillac is a tiny appellation tucked away in the France's elevated Massif Central region. Made from the local grape Mansois (also known as Fer Servadou or Braucol in neighboring Gaillac), this wine is finely perfumed and ripe with berry fruits. With a cool, tannic structure, the wine is firm while fruity. It is not going to take long to be ready to drink, so just wait until the end of 2016.",87,Lionel Osmin & Cie 2014  Marcillac,,,,
"Raw oak, herb and floral aromas are complex and on the light side of the fence. This feels tight, tannic and edgy, while resiny oak gives off a lactic flavor to accompany core red plum and currant. This stays tight, punchy and drying on the finish. Drink through 2021.",91,Bodegas Berceo 2010 Viña Berceo Crianza  (Rioja),,,,
"There's a delicate and light quality to this Inzolia, a native grape of Sicily, that resembles white flower and stone fruit. The wine is generous and round in the mouth with peachy flavors of mature fruit but it also has enough acidity to keep the palate refreshed.",86,Tasca d'Almerita 2008 Inzolia (Sicilia),,,,
"Lots of alcohol in this Zin, but it wears it well. It's a fat, unctuous wine, sweet in raspberries and cherries, with just a touch of savory raisins that give it a porty finish. Defines the Dry Creek style.",89,Mill Creek 2010 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Blending Cabernet and Merlot, this is a caramel-flavored dry rosé, with good berry fruitiness. There's a fine final burst of acidity.",85,Château les Arromans 2010 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),,,,
"Brightly perfumed wine, its acidity coming from a delicious array of white fruits, citrus and green plums. It has some sweetness, making it a fine apéritif style.",89,La Cave des Vignerons de Pfaffenheim 2009 Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"A fruity and fragrant selection, with upfront aromas of ripe strawberries, banana and peaches and cream. There's a bit more tension on the palate, with bracing acidity and flavors of small, tart red berries and white cherry.",85,Vignobles Sarrail 2013 Esprit de Sarrail Rosé (Vin de Pays Cité de Carcassonne),,,,
"An immediately attractive, quaffable wine with clean, fresh flavors. This is a light, fresh wine designed to go with summer foods.",84,Zonin 2002 Classico  (Soave),,,,
"Friendly, pure notes of freshly cut yellow apples have a minty, fresh aspect that enlivens nose and palate. This is fresh but comes with softened, slightly rounded, creamy edges. A very friendly, clean-cut light-footed but full-fruited Chardonnay showing some lovely midpalate texture and lots of freshness.",91,Strauss 2015 Gamlitzberg Chardonnay (Südsteiermark),,,,
"There is ripe, soft fruit on this gently rounded wine. It has good depth of blackberry flavors, given an edge of minerality and concentrated fruit juice acidity. This could benefit from another 2 years' bottle aging. Screwcap.",88,Feiler-Artinger 2006 Umriss Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),,,,
"The residual sugar is a hefty 54g/L. Soft flavors of canned peaches and apricots fill the mouth immediately, then turn watery as the wine quickly slides into a lighter finish.",85,San Juan Vineyards 2012 Les Vignes De Marcoux Riesling (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Aromas of coffee, gravel and boysenberry are followed by pillowy-soft fruit and barrel flavors. It displays delicacy and nuance.",89,Columbia Crest 2013 Reserve Grenache (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"Quite ripe and juicy, serving up a rich blend of black-cherry, plum and herb flavors. It fans out on the palate to reveal hints of licorice, smoke and even chocolate. More muscular than your average Pinot, it's plush and smooth on the finish.",91,Laetitia 1999 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Ripe blackberry, blueberry, violet and cooking spice aromas all come together on this blend of Sangiovese and a small amount of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The palate offers up juicy black cherry, plum steeped in spirits, white pepper and clove while firm, chewy tannins hold it all together. Drink through 2018.",88,Le Fonti 2012  Chianti Classico,,,,
"Aromas of jammy berry fruits, licorice gum drop and warm earth are scattershot and precede a palate that's chunky but flat in feel. Buttery oaky berry and raisin flavors are solid but not direct or focused on the finish.",87,Bodegas Peñafiel 2015 Baron de Filar Roble  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"This Demeter-certified Biodynamic Chardonnay has nice color and full apple aromas, as well as a lot of depth and texture. The finish veers into caramel and vanilla, no stranger to oak.",88,Jeriko 2010 Dijon Clone Chardonnay (Mendocino),,,,
"Waxy, stalky aromas provide little to no varietal familiarity. This is acid-driven, with lemon and underripe pineapple flavors along with wheaty, stalky aftershocks. The fresh and tangy feel turns bitter on the finish.",80,Marichal 2012 Premium Varietal Chardonnay (Canelones),,,,
"One of a series of single-clone offerings from Kason, this suffers from a sameness of flavors. Black fruits are soaked in aggressive and bitter oak flavors that push the smoke and char to the forefront, leaving bitter tannins as a result.",86,Kason 2014 Dijon 115 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Smooth baked apple aromas work well, and the peach and vanilla side notes are equally good. Plump and easygoing on the palate, with honeyed apple and banana flavors, and then creamy on the finish, with vanilla and spice. Sweet, good and easy to enjoy.",88,Finca Agostino 2008 Chardonnay-Viognier (Mendoza),,,,
"Red sparkling wine is always an acquired taste, especially when it is a tannic, tart version like this. But this is as fine as a red sparkling Vinho Verde can be. Pair it with sardines.",85,Casal Paço Padreiro NV Aphros  Super-Reserva Bruto Vinhão (Vinho Verde),,,,
"Juiced rhubarb, plump sour cherries, ripe cherry tomatoes and essence of violet combine for a distinctive nose on this ambitious wine by Eric Laumann. The palate shows tart boysenberry fruit, a graphite minerality and whole black peppercorns, as if a wave of spice is just a bite away. It's tasty and balanced, but leaves the mouth wanting an even more full delivery.",89,Cambiata 2012 Tannat (Monterey),,,,
"This is so heavy it's nearly a solid and not a liquid. Maximum ripeness is on display at all check points, especially the palate, which is syrupy, raisiny and viscous on the finish. This is as rich and ripe as it gets, like spineless Port. Tasted twice with inconsistencies; this review more greatly reflects the better bottle.",82,Nieto Senetiner 2010 Reserva Limited Edition Bonarda (Mendoza),,,,
"More delicate and dainty in mousse than other bottlings from Château Frank, this blanc de blancs calibrates gossamer layers of pristine apple, pear and citrus flavors against spine-tingling acidity. It's breathlessly vivacious and penetrates long with a touch of sugar cookie crumbles.",90,Château Frank 2010 Blanc de Blancs Methode Champenoise Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Crushed peppercorn, black plum, leather, dried violet, game and cedar touches show on the nose of this bottling from Ryan Roark. Sandalwood and pine notes emerge on the palate, accenting its black pepper-laced cranberry fruit. A vibrant and chillable red wine for summer.",91,Roark Wine Co. 2015 Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Initial charred aromas yield to aggressive cherry and maple scents. This is a wide, fully tannic load of a Malbec with toasty flavors of burnt wheat bread and maple to go with blackberry and cassis. Toast remains on the finish, which also tastes of licorice. Drink through 2023.",91,Luigi Bosca 2014 Terroir Los Miradores Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"A full 13 years old, the aromas are still vibrant, with notes of cranberry sauce, leather, vanilla and baking spice. The palate displays a beautiful sense of balance between the fruit and barrel flavors. It's in an absolute sweet spot right now but still has life in front of it.",92,Lawrelin 2004 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Just a subtle whiff of orange scents this dry, intensely mineral Riesling. It's delicately framed, invigorating the palate with cutting lime and lemon flavors, but fleeting.",86,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler 2013 Dry Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Voluptuously tropical in shaved coconut and silky layers of peach and pear, this is a complex, age-worthy white from a stellar vineyard site, a knockout version of the variety. Smooth and round, it maintains a core of acidity that buoys the experience, finishing with a flourish. Drink now through 2022.",94,Paul Hobbs 2012 Ulises Valdez Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"The wine has blackberry fruits that give attractive acidity and add to the light structure. It is fruity, juicy and ready to drink.",88,Wines & Winemakers 2016 Capitão Rayeo Red (Alentejano),,,,
"This wine comes from a vineyard owned by the Gagey situated in the northern part of Nuits-Saint-Georges, close to Vosne-Romanée. It has firm structure and a perfumed character that is already enticing. Richly fruity with juicy acidity, it will be impressive as it ages. Drink from 2023.",93,Louis Jadot 2014 Les Boudots Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),,,,
"Third in Three Brothers' series of four Rieslings, this bottling is accurately labeled as semi-sweet, although certainly sweeter than the 1st Degree. There's a consistency through the series with a savory nose of anise, fennel and petroleum. The mouth is full of ripe fruit—this time juicy honeydew and tangerines—and a hint of jasmine tea that adds astringency to the finish.",84,Four Degrees of Riesling 2009 2nd Degree Riesling (Seneca Lake),,,,
"This has a lovely entry that explodes with scents of toasted almond and espresso. The black cherry and sour plum flavors command your attention, with texture and balance throughout. Drink soon.",91,Boudreaux Cellars 2007 Merlot (Washington),,,,
"Sassello is Sangiovese from a high hillside vineyard that offers pretty spice renderings and good dimension overall. Its blackberry, Amaretto, natural rubber and moist earth aromas and flavors offer plenty of complexity.",89,Castello di Verrazzano 2004 Sassello Sangiovese (Toscana),,,,
"This soft and approachable Merlot brims in smoke and oak, with subtle plum fruit. A slight layering of spice on the back of the palate is pleasing.",86,Twomey 2010 Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"Full in the mouth, this is a ripe, currant- and gooseberry-flavored wine. It has a bright, forward, fruity feel that makes it delicious to drink. Very refreshing in character. Screwcap.",86,Baron Philippe de Rothschild 2012 Mouton Cadet  (Bordeaux Blanc),,,,
"The aromas are generous, with notes of spice box, blue and purple fruit, pencil lead, barrel spice and vanilla. It's silky and sumptuous, showing a pleasing sense of texture and an extended finish.",92,Northstar 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Aromas of plum, violet and a whiff of spice emerge on this extremely simple red. The short diluted palate suggests red cherry and a hint of vanilla alongside frail tannins.",84,Castorani 2014 Le Paranze  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),,,,
"This white's nose offers waves of fresh-cut grass, herbs and spices, with tropical fruit, gooseberry and citrus flavors that follow. The wine has a dense, full-flavored character, but its crisp mineral backbone keeps it aloft. The finish is lingering and rich.",86,Spice Route 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Darling),,,,
"There is an attractive spiciness here, yielding a wine that is warm and rich. It has flavors of tropical fruits, lychees and rosewater. It's full bodied, concentrated and dense in texture, but maintains a freshness through the finish. Drink now.",88,Cave de Kientzheim-Kaysersberg 2011 Exception Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"Blueberry, pepper and cedar aromas and flavors dominate in this structured, elegant red. The wine finishes long with spice and dark cherry notes. A collectible wine that will pair well with poultry, game.",87,Ktima Driopi 2005 Reserve Agiorgitiko (Arcadia),,,,
"Fiery and clipped on the nose, but then it settles onto red fruits and candy notes. The palate shows good grip and a proper but basic feel, with generic red berry and currant flavors. Solid on the finish; good in a common way.",85,Alma del Sur 2009 Colección Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"Aromas suggest pastry crust, almonds, spice, and lemon zest. The vibrant palate doles out Golden Delicious apple, white grapefruit, clove and toasted walnut alongside smooth, persistent bubbles.",90,Il Mosnel 2009 EBB Extra Brut Chardonnay (Franciacorta),,,,
"Ruby in color, this wine offers intense aromas of clove, dried fruit and prune. Aged in clay pots, it shows character and a unique personality that will resonate with lovers of natural wine.",90,Frank Cornelissen NV MunJebel 8MC  (Etna),,,,
"Subtle smoke notes accent tangerine, lemon and lime in this invigorating dry Riesling. Fermented via ambient yeast, its refinement and restrained elegance sets it apart from Casa Larga's other Rieslings. The finish is lingering yet fresh.",89,Casa Larga 2014 Wild Ferment Riesling (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Basic Cabernet Sauvignon, with all its goods up front. Opens with some nice cassis aromatics but there’s just not much on the palate. The finish is short and there’s a greenness to the fruit that reflects the tremendous difficulty of the 1998 vintage. Not up to previous efforts.",82,Santa Rita 1998 Medalla Real Special Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),,,,
"The Volcanic Hill section of Diamond Creek's vineyard on Diamond Mountain is, as advertised, influenced by volcanic soils. The wine imparts a chalky consistency to some extent, rounded out by dark, ripe plum and mocha, with a long, intense finish. Age through 2025.",94,Diamond Creek 2011 Volcanic Hill Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Too bad the vineyard owner is pulling out the Sauvignon Blanc, because this is a fresh, vibrant, juicy one, crisp in acidity and rich in citrus, figs, pears and melons. Just a touch of tart gooseberry shows up in the finish.",89,Breggo 2006 Ferrington Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Anderson Valley),,,,
The Lucas 2007 Limited Reserve Syrah shows the potential the Syrah grape has in upstate New York. Dense raspberry and strawberry fruit vie with aromas of barbecued meat on the nose while a thick layer of vanilla cushions the fine tannins and smokey notes in the mouth. The juicy finish throws up an enticing licorice note. Nicely done. Drink now to 2011.,87,Lucas Vineyards 2007 Limited Reserve Syrah (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Bright, fleshy dark-fruit flavors of plum, blackberry and boysenberry all unfold on the nose and in the mouth of this value-priced wine. Hints of mocha and pepper add interest to the palate, with approachable tannins and a balanced, easygoing structure.",87,Penya 2011 Rouge Red (Vin de Pays des Côtes Catalanes),,,,
"Starting with beautifiul aromas of cassis, cocoa and coffee beans, this wine has a velvety texture and deep, ripe layers of black fruit. It does a great job of combining layers of black cherry, blackberry and cinnamon on a full body but without seeming heavy.",93,Mirror 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Well-balanced, this medium- to full-bodied Zin offers spice and berry aromas and plummy flavors. The noticeable, firm tannins are a good thing in Zinfandel, which can sometimes be too soft.",85,Winery by the Creek 2012 Lyman Vineyard Reserve Zinfandel (Fiddletown),,,,
This is an easy Pinot Grigio that can be employed during informal drinking occasions. Bright citrus and melon ride an easy and somewhat short finish. Try it with Chinese take-out.,85,San Giuseppe 2011 Pinot Grigio (Veneto),,,,
"This is Chris Gorman's first white wine; it has been babied and it shows. The wild yeast fermentation in 100% new French oak really piles on the rich, butterscotch flavors, along with toast, spice, nutmeg and caramel. But there's fruit to match, powerful and thick, with impressive length and weight.",92,Gorman 2006 Big Sissy Conner Lee Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Blending the earthy elements of the low-alcohol movement with the characteristic ripeness of California fruit, this wine by Trey Fletcher offers rhubarb, wet strawberry leaves, pencil shavings, rose hips, wild berries and anise on the nose.

"Boscarelli offers a dark, meaty and sophisticated expression of Vino Nobile with gritty tannins, dark berry fruit and plum, followed by loads of spice, tar and resin. Softer oak tones of vanilla and cinnamon appear on the close.",90,Boscarelli 2005 Riserva  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),,,,

"These old vines produce a powerful wine, that retains strong flavors of stem and earth despite the extra ripeness in 2012. The red berry fruit slides into suggestions of tomato juice.",87,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2012 Tualatin Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
Lovely red-apple fruit beckons on the nose while the palate plays a game of tart freshness against rounded fruit. There is spiky lemon freshness and lively frothy fizz.

"Juicy but crisp, textbook Syrah aromas of meat and game mix with plum and floral aromas on the nose, while the palate shows a pleasant core of cherry, which persists on the medium finish. Try with barbecued meat.",84,Jean-Luc Colombo 2006 La Violette Syrah (Vin de Pays d'Oc),,,,

"Polished and crisp, this offers enticing scents of cut grass, gooseberry, tomato vine and a whiff of green bell pepper.

"Briny citrus, match stick and yeasty aromas are a bit jumbled on the nose. The palate is minerally and nicely textured, with grapefruit, passion fruit, tarragon and lemongrass flavors. A lingering lime note hits on the finish.",87,Bodega Volcanes de Chile 2014 Summit 2900 Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),,,,
"Aromas of lead pencil, cassis, violet petal and smoky chocolate are complex and attractive. The palate of this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is tight, pure and rich, and the flavors of toasty black fruits carry accents of licorice and coffee. The finish is spicy, with a licorice note, and the wine's tannic composition suggests that aging is appropriate. Drink from 2014–2020.",92,Lagar de Bezana 2010 Aluvion Gran Reserva Ensamblaje Red (Cachapoal Valley),,,,

It's elegantly styled with a soft feel, trailing toward the finish.",87,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2011 Cold Creek Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Aromas of dried rose, mature berry and dark kitchen spice lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. The palate offers more spice than fruit richness, with dried wild cherry, licorice and black pepper, while firm refined tannins provide the framework. It's a great effort for this hot vintage. Drink 2017–2024.",92,Elvio Cogno 2009 Vigna Elena Riserva  (Barolo),,,,
"A very successful Cabernet that continues the winery's string of mountain bottlings. It's dry and classically balanced, with a firm minerality bracing flavors of blackberries, black currants, herbs, spices and smoky oak. The firm tannins are a bit numbing now, so give it 3 or 4 years in the cellar to settle down.",92,Martin Ray 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Mountain),,,,
"93-95 Barrel sample. The ripe fruits go straight to the heart of this powerful, orange peel and citrus wine. There are yellow fruits, balanced with fresh acidity. The ensemble is rich, but balanced.",94,Château Doisy-Védrines 2008 Barrel sample  (Barsac),,,,
"A good (not great) year for this cuvée, brings supple strawberry and cherry flavors, streaked with a strong taste of chicken stock.

Bright and fresh with balanced acidity and a nicely concentrated midpalate.",86,Veramar 2008 Estate Club Cabernet Sauvignon (Virginia),,,,
"This is a full-force wine with a scratchy bouquet and aromas of herbal fruit, vanilla and burnt stems. It's jumpy in the mouth, and not that smooth, with aggressive tannins and baked flavors of raisin, herbs and burnt fruit. On the finish, there's oaky caramel and chocolate along with heat and stewy notes.",87,Casa Primicia 2005 Confradia  (Rioja),,,,
"With 100% Touriga Nacional, this is a finely perfumed, ripe yet elegant wine. The wood aging still shows in the spice and vanilla, although this will certainly diminish as the wine ages further. This small production wine just needs a few more months and will be ready from 2018.",92,Fontes da Cunha 2013 Munda Touriga Nacional (Dão),,,,

"This playful, drink-now blend of 64% Counoise and 36% Cinsault is great for those seeking to try lesser known Rhône varieties. Rose petals, plum blossoms, hibiscus and gamy notes entertain the nose.

"Fermented in open stone lagares, this wine has a typical rounded, generous character, with rich dark fruit and tight acidity. Although smooth from wood aging, it has a taut edge, ultimately feeling ripe and full in the mouth. Drink now.",90,Dona Maria-Júlio Bastos 2013 Red (Alentejano),,,,
"The granite soil of the Brand Grand Cru vineyard has produced a strongly structured wine that also has richness and ripe fruits. Off dry, it has a hint of honey as well as yellow fruits and pears.

"It's hard to ignore the high alcohol listing, but the wine is so well balanced and cohesive that few would even notice. It's aromatic with notes of dried and fresh cranberries and raspberries. The palate is full bodied and rich with concentrated, pure fruit flavors.",91,Two Vintners 2012 StoneTree Vineyard Zinfandel (Wahluke Slope),,,,
"Succulent steak or breaded veal would make good pairing partners to this elegant Brunello. The wine delivers oak spice, red fruit, black pepper and balsam notes of dried ginger and cola.

"Despite its modest alcohol content, this is a medium-bodied dry wine. Like the wines from some Mosel vineyards, the fruit notes hint at red berries or stone fruit in this vintage, backed by strong citrus flavors. This should age well through at least 2025.",91,Frankland Estate 2014 Isolation Ridge Vineyard Riesling (Frankland River),,,,
"This standout blend—the best from this winery to date—is 68% Merlot, 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot.

"Kendric produces very pure, refined Pinot Noirs from this county just over the Golden Gate Bridge.

Gets better as it warms in the glass.",91,Kendric 2008 Pinot Noir (Marin County),,,,
"Firmly structured, this dark wine has smoky tannins and intense acidity combined in a texture that is dusty, almost dry at the core. Over this the ripe red fruits are spread thickly, giving a powerful concentrated wine that will age well. Drink from 2022.",95,Domaine Faiveley 2014  Echézeaux,,,,
"This opens with restrained aromas of vanilla, berry and a floral note. The informal, easy-drinking palate offers tart cherry, raspberry and a hint of baking spice alongside bright acidity. It's not very intense and already extremely accessible so drink soon.",86,Villadoria 2014 Tardòc  (Barbera d'Alba),,,,

"A dark charactered wine, with solid tannins and firm, extracted fruit flavors. The berry fruits are juicy and sweet, with the dusty tannins coming from the Cabernet in the blend. The finish is softer, more black jelly in texture.",93,Château Pichon Longueville 2007  Pauillac,,,,
"The vineyard is in the heart of the Haut-Médoc, midway between Margaux and Saint-Julien. The wine is solid, dark and with plenty of firm tannins. At the same time, it has concentrated black fruits and a fine blend between black-currant acidity and ripe jammy fruitiness. Drink from 2020.",92,Château Beaumont 2014  Haut-Médoc,,,,
"This Cabernet is a mixed bag. It's oaky and also fruity, but a little vegetal, with some green notes alongside sweet raspberry and cherry candy and caramel flavors. A real disappointment, coming after a series of good bottlings, but the vintage was difficult.",86,Knights Bridge 2010 Beckstoffer Dr. Crane Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),,,,

"This red blend relies mostly on Cabernet Sauvignon, adding smaller amounts of Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Soft, spicy and impressively lengthy, it's highlighted in blackberry, currant and toasty oak, concentrated and complex.",92,Ziata 2013 Mia Madre Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Here's a more informal and approachable expression of Barolo with classic Nebbiolo aromas of white cherry and cola set against a clean, polished mouthfeel. Pair this wine with meat-stuffed ravioli, veal, pork or game hen.",89,Simone Scaletta 2007 Chirlet  (Barolo),,,,

"Cava from Rioja may not compute but it's definitely an approved category of sparkling wine. This is minerally and smells a lot like vitamins. The palate is round, moderately foamy and wide.

"This wine features soft apple and pear fruit with light tannins and grapefruit freshness. It is clean, well-made and ready to drink.",84,Finisterra 2010 Branco White (Alentejano),,,,
"Compact, almost gritty aromas of tree bark and herbal berry fruits require time to breathe. After necessary airing, this is elegant and fresh on the palate, but full in body.

"Vaguely floral aromas precede a sweet, cloying palate that tastes candied.",81,Region 1 2013 Moscato (Mendoza),,,,

"Coming from a cool climate and representing the tart, savory style, this bottling shows blackberry, uncrushed peppercorns and black plum on the wound-up nose.

Rita Hills),,,,
"Deeply mineral from nose to finish, this off-dry kabinett balances lush peach, apricot and grapefruit flavors with striking earth tones of wet slate and granite. It's textured on the palate with a long, lingering tangerine-flavored finish.",92,Robert Weil 2011 Kabinett Riesling (Rheingau),,,,

"Available only in magnums, this Chard consists of a single barrel from the estate vineyard, which is in the Petaluma area, a very cool region. The wine is very fine.

Should age well for a Chardonnay, especially in the big bottle.",94,Keller Estate 2005 Precioso Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Pastry notes of caramel, vanilla and mint chocolate are the lead aromas of this Cabernet Franc, but savory touches of wood smoke and thyme surface with air.

"One of the single-vineyard-focused winery's more affordable appellation blends, this is a plush, velvety wine with aromas of black cherry, cola, roasted fennel and a touch of graphite. The palate starts quite earthy, with thyme and rosemary notes, then winds to tart cherry fruit that's lively and long-lasting.",89,Testarossa 2013 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,

"Already beautiful, this comes from an estate that's managed by Louis Jadot in Puligny-Montrachet, always producing fine wines.

"Additions of Sauvignon Musque and Sauvignon Gris add complexity to this rewarding white, full bodied and rounded in anise, creamy vanilla and apricot tones.

"The relatively unknown Pezerolles Vineyard is at the far northern end of Pommard, touching Beaune above Les Epenots. It produces wine that seems softer than many Pommards, with rich fruit, the tannins firm but definitely playing second fiddle. It is the smoky plum fruit with just a dash of acidity that makes this immensely pleasing.",91,Bouchard Père & Fils 2006 Les Pezerolles Premier Cru  (Pommard),,,,
"This reserve-style wine primarily comes from Boushey Vineyard in the Yakima Valley. Aromas of mineral, wood spice, bacon fat, herb and red fruit are followed by sultry, soft flavors that display a lot of elegance.",91,Sequel 2011 Bin 898 Vintage Select Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Dry, earthy and stony-smelling, this multigrape Catalonian blend also shows cherry and sandalwood scents. Fresh, tight and mildly acidic on the palate, this snappy, tasty red delivers peppery, oaky, slightly medicinal red-berry flavors in front of a composed, spicy finish with modest espresso bitterness. Drink through 2020.",91,Mas Blanch I Jové 2010 Saó Abrivat Red (Costers del Segre),,,,
"Walnut and almond aromas share the bouquet with melon and apple scents. This feels fleshy and resiny, with a generic mix of white-fruit flavors and oak. A bulky, woody, creamy finish with tropical fruit flavors is kept afloat by firm acidity.",85,Trapiche 2012 Finca Las Palmas Gran Reserva Chardonnay (Mendoza),,,,
"Thick and lush in red and black cherry, this wine has voluptuous tannins around a medium to full body. Structured and well balanced, it finishes in a tasty cloud of dust.",88,Wellington 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),,,,
"Good growing conditions in 2007 helped shape this bright, berry-driven wine from southern Tuscany. You'll recognize aromas of cherry, blueberry and mineral backed by a firm texture and sour cherry flavors. This is a simple, easy-drinking expression.",84,Poggio Lungo 2007  Morellino di Scansano,,,,
"Between Nantes and Angers, the small appellation of Coteaux d'Ancenis hugs the banks of the Loire.

Drink now.",85,Alliance Loire 2014 Cour de Rohan Rosé (Coteaux d'Ancenis),,,,
"A tightly wrought, crisp texture gives the typical cool character of this appellation. This wine is full of white fruits layered with juicy acidity. Full in the mouth, it is delicious to drink although it will be better from 2017.",90,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2014  Pernand-Vergelesses,,,,
"Simple, soft and sweetly fruity, with jammy flavors of cherries, raspberries, chocolate and black pepper. Seems pricey for what you get.",83,Grizzly Republic 2006 Shiraz (Napa Valley),,,,

"Here's a blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon that opens with aromas of cedar, ripe black-skinned fruit, grilled herbs and a whiff of mocha.

Polished, ripe tannins support the juicy fruit flavors.",90,Rocca delle Macìe 2011 Roccato Red (Toscana),,,,
"This leads with light baking spice and apple pie aromas. The palate is broad, with abundant vanilla flavors that suggest strong oak influence.",87,The Conqueror 2015 Chardonnay (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"Aromas of green-plum jelly and a touch of toast set out a wine that is spicy as well as fresh. Bitter orange marmalade flavors are laced with lime acidity, lying over a firm, tense structure with a mineral edge. It will develop well, but don't drink before 2020.",93,Château Doisy-Daëne 2011  Barsac,,,,
"Made from a selection of grapes from old vines, this wood-aged wine is rich and concentrated. It has warmth from generous black-fruit flavors cut with a solid structure that gives power. Juicy acidity comes through at the end. Drink now.",91,Herdade Grande 2012 Grande Reserva Red (Alentejano),,,,
"Aromas of leather, scorched earth, mature plum and a whiff of mocha lead the way. The forward palate offers dried black cherry, licorice, grilled herb and a hint of tobacco accompanied by polished tannins. It shows the heat of the vintage so drink sooner rather than later.",89,Castelli del Grevepesa 2011 Castello di Bibbione Riserva  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"Rooty aromas of blackberry and baked plum share space on the bouquet with vanilla, smoke and coconut scents. This feels lush, round, firm and tannic, with profound depth. Flavors of blackberry, baking spices, chocolate and pepper finish toasty, with massive black-fruit leftovers. This is a powerful specimen to drink 2017–2030.",94,Resalte 2009 Gran Resalte  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"Made entirely with Nebbiolo grown in the mountain vineyards of northeastern Italy, this opens with enticing aromas of wild rose, bright berry and Alpine herbs.

Drink through 2024.",90,Nino Negri 2009 Vigneto Fracia  (Valtellina Superiore),,,,
"This wine comes from a vineyard that is wholly owned by Chanson. It is juicy, ripe while having a great, straight line of acidity. The red-berry fruits are still developing and coming through the firm, smoky dark tannins. The wine, with its spicy aftertaste, will be ready to drink from 2020.",94,Chanson Père et Fils 2013 Clos des Fèves Premier Cru  (Beaune),,,,
Aromas of cream and corn on the cob are followed by lively full-bodied fruit flavors with plenty of toasty accents. It offers an appealing sense of texture along with a lovely sense of balance.,90,Sparkman 2014 Lumière Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Freshly pressed apples and lemon notes are accented with just a hint of floral notes. It's texture is rich and full in body, adding opulence to the midpalate. Zesty acidity lends an edge towards the finish.",86,Sherwood House Vineyards 2010 Estate Grown Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"A curious bitterness lies at the back of this otherwise fruity wine. At the front, the wine is filled with apple and green-plum flavors layered with acidity.",86,Bertrand-Delespierre NV Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"This is lean and green, so if you like your wines redolent of green tomato, celery leaf and lime this is one to try. It's flavor profile and tart finish would make it pair well with ceviche.",83,Clos Henri 2014 Petit Clos Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"Very rich, opulent and ripe with oak-driven aromas of vanilla, chocolate, licorice and spice, this is a dark Riserva with loads of personality and almost impenetrable density. It imparts a smooth, silky feel thanks to the quality of its tannins and ends with a chewy bite of plump cherry.",92,Caparsa 2004 Riserva Doccio a Matteo  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"The purest scent of fresh, ripe red cherries is the first pleasure to be encountered on this elegant wine. On the slender palate this lovely fruit expression is joined by earthier tones of undergrowth and peat. There is a central seam of freshness that pulls fruit, silky tannin and soft texture together. If there was just one attribute I could name it would be elegance. Lovely and fresh now but Rosenberg ages most gracefully. Drink 2016–2024.",94,Pittnauer 2013 Rosenberg St. Laurent (Burgenland),,,,
"Earthy aromas of juniper and forest floor give depth to the rusty cherry, tart cranberry, dried hibiscus and pepper-dust scents on the nose of this bottling from the historic vineyard. Soft in structure at first, it then delivers a firmer tannic edge in the midpalate, all the while delivering vivacious red fruit and pine-forest flavors. It will age very well.",92,Sanford 2014 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"This expression of Sangiovese shows a pungent, polished, wet river-stone aroma that is backed by black olive, blackberry and cherry. Spicy oak-driven aromas of toasted almond and pipe tobacco give the wine momentum on the close.",85,Villa Vignamaggio 2010 Castello di Spaltenna  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"Fresh, alluring aromas of wild berry, pressed violet, dark baking spice and a whiff of new leather all come together in the glass. The firm full-bodied palate offers ripe black cherry, mature plum, cinnamon, licorice and a hint of tobacco. Chewy tannins and bright acidity provide support and balance. Drink 2019–2027.",93,Castelgiocondo 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Gritty leather and cherry aromas pass quickly across the nose of this wine. It's chunky and meaty, with plum, berry and herbal flavors. A grippy, straightforward finish confirms it's well made but has limits.",86,Tressals 2014 Red (Priorat),,,,
"A simple, big and fruity Malbec, softer than many although with all the right richness. This is a wine for drinking now, with its mature plum flavors and leather aroma. The French number for the department (county) of Cahors is 46.",88,Vignobles 46N118 2008 Noir 46 Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"This is the producer's nonvintage cuvée—a crisp, apple-flavored wine dominated by the softness of Pinot Meunier. It's fruity with an attractive and zesty acidity. A great apéritif-style Champagne.",88,Baron-Fuenté NV Grande Réserve Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"With lots of residual sugar, this white Zin is so sweet, it's almost a dessert wine. The sweetness makes the raspberries and cherries taste like candy.",83,Coyote Creek 2012 White Zinfandel (California),,,,
"Andeluna's top wines tend to be ripe and plump, and so they come across as easy to drink and less demanding. This blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc is devoid of astringency and hard tannins. It's ripe, just a little rugged, and integrated such that the berry flavors are forward and don't need to fight to be appreciated.",91,Andeluna 2004 Pasionado Red (Uco Valley),,,,
"This rich wine smells sweet and tastes jammy, as strawberry and boysenberry flood the palate. Full body and a smoothly dense texture complete the picture.",88,Naggiar 2014 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Sierra Foothills),,,,
"This is the top bottling of Thomas Fogarty's ambitious Bordeaux-aimed brand, and it shows, with regionally distinctive aromas of crushed rocks, blueberry, tar and smoke. The intriguing palate is elegance defined, with sexy tannins and mineral-driven flavors of black dirt, wet slate and squeezed blueberry. It makes for enlightening drinking now, but offers measured components that will last until at least 2030.",94,Lexington 2011 Apex Gist Ranch Estate Red (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"Dark golden-yellow, this opens with inviting notes of toasted caramel. It remains bright in citrus on the palate, getting riper and steamier as it goes, developing deeper, richer flavors of preserved lemon and baked pear. From the winery's estate, this is a small-production wine well worth seeking.",92,Fog Crest 2012 Estate Elevage Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"The 50% of Pinot Meunier in the blend gives this wine a roundness that contrasts with the crisp and very dry character. Together, they produce a wine that is fresh, full in the mouth with a creamy mousse and a smooth, ripe aftertaste. This bottling should be given a few months aging after purchase.",89,J. Dumangin Fils NV L'Extra Brut Premier Cru  (Champagne),,,,
"Round and fruity, this differs from Willamette Valley Pinots, in that it's broad, fruit-driven, perhaps less complex but readily accessible and quite delicious immediately. Cherry lollipop, oranges and light tropical-fruit flavors abound. Drink while it's young and fresh—slightly chilled if you wish.",89,Melrose 2015 Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),,,,
"This is a savory and tasty wine, with smoke, red cherries and bacon fat on the nose. The mouthfeel is dense, with rich flavors of black cherries, licorice and dark chocolate offering layers of complexity, rounded out by the right amount of tannins and acidity.",89,Clavo Cellars 2011 Fedora Malbec (Paso Robles),,,,
"Structured and concentrated, it has a silky richness that is very Volnay, while at the same time giving the bright fruits of the year. The final tastes are smoke and crisp acidity.",92,Bouchard Père & Fils 2008 Ancienne Cuvée Carnot Caillerets Premier Cru  (Volnay),,,,
"While it is still young, the wine is showing great fruit and soft tannins. Juicy black cherries are ripe and full, a sign of the fine vintage. With the acidity and the dry core, the wine should age. Drink from 2018.",88,Domaine Gerard Charvet 2015 La Réserve d'Amélie  (Moulin-à-Vent),,,,
"The aromas are light, with notes of yellow apple and spice. The palate is rounded in feel, showing a lovely sense of texture.",88,Ryan Patrick 2014 Naked Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Tastes sweet and alcoholic, with vegetal flavors that barely break into berries and cocoa.",80,Nine x Nine 2006 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),,,,
"This wine is a blend of about equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with a balance of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. The nose is toast and oak driven, bringing notes of charred currant and dark-roast coffee. Medium bodied on the palate, structured tannins offer support to flavors of racy red and black currant, red plum skin and toasted vanilla.",86,Rappahannock Cellars 2012 Meritage (Virginia),,,,
"This wine is named after a windmill on the Conti family property. It is rich, with a spicy new-wood flavor. While it has plenty of structure, the acidity is subdued.",88,Château Tour des Gendres 2010 Moulin des Dames White (Bergerac Sec),,,,
"This fragrant Barolo has lovely floral and underbrush aromas and a restrained palate showing cherry and spice. It's tightly tannic and very nervous, needing more time to soften up.",91,Paolo Scavino 2009 Bricco Ambrogio  (Barolo),,,,
"Hot pink in color and showing some bricking, light aromas of cherry and spice are followed by broad-feeling fruit flavors that are a hair off dry. It comes off as a bit ponderous but there's enjoyment to be had.",86,Wine o'Clock 2014 Rosé (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Pecorino is an interesting and otherwise unknown native grape of Central Italy that offers syrupy tones of cola, mature apricot and resin. The wine has good density, persistency and lasts long on the finish.",87,Cantina Tollo 2007 Pecorino (Terre di Chieti),,,,
"Great freshness and and almost grassy fruitiness join the yeasty autolytic notes. There is frothy liveliness and irrepressible fruit—red and green apple, a hint of pineapple and zesty lemon. This is one for those who prefer their sparklers full of fruit and life. Midpalate concentration makes this robust enough for food.",89,Graf Hardegg 2010 Brut Sparkling (Österreichischer Sekt),,,,
"One of the biggest, boldest, ripest Chardonnays in California, marked as usual by intense flavors, which the winemaker has boosted with oak. Just explodes in pineapple and apricot jam, tangerine custard and buttered toast, brightened by zesty acidity. The wine will age, gradually losing fruit and picking up roasted nut notes.",92,Talbott 2010 Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Estate Grown Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Produced from vineyards in the mountains away from the coast, this cool wine still gives free rein to the richness of Vermentino. There is an herbal touch, some spice and ripe apricot flavors. Balanced and fruity now, it will be better from 2016.",88,Hecht & Bannier 2014 Vermentino (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"This tangy wine has attractive acidity and a tightly coiled mineral texture. Apple and lemon flavors shoot right through the bright, crisp texture. Drink from 2017.",88,Cave des Vignerons de Buxy 2014  Mâcon-Villages,,,,
"This huge, rich Zinfandel is ripe—nearly overripe—with dry raisin, blackberry and currant flavors. There's a curious bitterness to the finish that must come from the shriveled grape skins, which add to the wine's complexity. The vineyard is on the cooler, hillier western side of Paso Robles. Not a Zin for everyone, it's nevertheless a classic example of its genre.",91,Turley 2010 Pesenti Vineyard Zinfandel (Paso Robles),,,,
"This discloses funk, rubber and sulfur , but otherwise is a good but chunky and beefy Garnacha. Aromas of rubber and scrambled egg veer toward boysenberry and cassis, while the palate is grabby and jammy. Flavors of baked black fruits, prune and licorice finish pasty and oaky, with a note of sweet plastic.",86,Pagos del Moncayo 2012 PdM Moncayo Garnacha (Campo de Borja),,,,
"A light and fruity wine, it is already attractively fresh. The wood aging gives a spicy, smoky character that points up the bright red berry fruits. Drink from 2016.",84,Château Beyzac 2011  Haut-Médoc,,,,
"Rich and rounded, the wine has classic power. Wood flavors show strongly at this stage in its development, but it is full, ripe, full of yellow fruits, pineapple and apple skins. The wine has great weight, but offers a fresh, straight and crisp aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",94,Chanson Père et Fils 2011  Corton-Charlemagne,,,,
"Straight down the line, this wine shows fruit and acidity. The tannins are relatively soft while the fruit is forward. Blackberries, coffee and licorice notes all come together.",94,Château la Gaffelière 2009  Saint-Émilion,,,,
"This wine is clearly shooting for the modern style of Rioja; it's dark as night, soft and meaty. But it also has a lot of gaseous sulfur on the nose and hard tannins. Expect a chewy, broad Rioja that's hedonistic but on the cusp of overripe. Decant before drinking within the next two years.",87,Heredad Ugarte 2004 Martin Cendoya Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"A blend of Grillo, Cataratto and Chardonnay, this opens with aromas of tropical fruit and apricot. The rich palate is loaded with golden apple and yellow peach flavors that are accented by notes of vanilla and lemon drop.",87,Tenuta Rapitalà 2013 Piano Maltese White (Terre Siciliane),,,,

"There's a disagreeable sharpness and harshness to this Merlot. Despite some pleasant cherry, berry and oak flavors and a lush texture, that rough tartness persists through the finish.",84,Bell 2004 Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"After years of taking its Merlot from southerly Lontué, San Pedro is now using Cachapoal fruit for this everyday wine, and the result seems fruitier and wider than in the past, with aromas of charcoal and herbs setting up black-fruit flavors accented by carob. A full and simple wine that has what it takes to please.",86,San Pedro 2006 Castillo de Molina Reserva Merlot (Cachapoal Valley),,,,
"With delicate aromas of orange blossom and lime, this wine takes on a viscosity of texture on the palate, offering plump flavors of peach and guava. Refined and well made, the finish is a combination of vanilla and caramel.",90,Spring Mountain Vineyard 2013 Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Napa Valley),,,,
"You'll love the buoyant freshness and immediate intensity of this lively Brunello. The wine's aromas include blackberries, leather, root beer and wild berries. It's lean and tonic in the mouth, suggesting a pairing with cheese-topped pasta or lasagna.",91,La Togata 2004  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Dark ruby in color, this wine has a bouquet of black cherry, lavender and juniper berry. It offers pleasure from first sip through the fruit filled, smoky finish, with velvety tannins and flavors of cassis, black plum, espresso, chocolate and a hint of green pepper.",93,Jezreel 2014 Adumim Dry Red (Israel),,,,
"The excellent Olsen vineyards provided the fruit for this pure Malbec. It's still quite young, showing clean and tightly-wound flavors. Berry and cherry fruit highlights the palate, with a light hint of chocolate woven through the finish.",88,Market Vineyards 2010 Merval Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
This powerful and rich wine wants to be sweet but is bone dry. Hints of honey accompany opulent ripe peach and spiced pear flavors. The balance of the acidity is crisp and refreshing. Drink from 2017.,92,Domaine Cauhapé 2013 Sève d'Automne  (Jurançon Sec),,,,
"The winery's high-end cuvée, this is a five-barrel blend, three of the barrels new. Dancing in cardamom and dark cherry, the background ripe and toasty, the flavors are exotic and long lingering. There's a tension and intensity to this wine that bests speaks to aging, or a full decant; either way, it'll be delicious.",91,Lynmar 2012 Five Sisters Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Rich and fruity, this has a yellow fruit flavor that's touched by a hint of pepper. A tasty edge of acidity balances this full-bodied, concentrated wine.",93,Bründlmayer 2011 Vincents Spiegel Erste Lage Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),,,,
"Pretty nice for a lean, more traditional Rioja crianza. The palate is clean and tangy, with strawberry, raspberry and citrusy flavors. Freshness is this wine's middle name. It's old-school, so don't look for a lot of color, body or sweetness.",86,Bodegas Franco-Españolas 2003 Rioja Bordón Crianza  (Rioja),,,,
"This is classically proportioned in the warm-climate style. It provides a textbook example of the variety's inky black and purple color, rich, thick tannins and elaborate flavors. These flavors include profoundly ripe summer blackberry and mulberry, smoky, umami-rich bacon and sweet sandalwood. Full-bodied and dry, this is a wine to warm the blood on cold winter nights.",92,Turley 2010 Pesenti Vineyard Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),,,,
"This is a plush and fully fruited wine that's super easy to like, with attractive aromas and flavors of blackberry compote, raspberry sauce and ripe boysenberry that are all hit with seductive notes of sweet spice and vanilla bean. There's ample tannic structure at the core, framing the dense, decadent mouthfeel and lending some lingering grip to the close.",88,Spier 2016 Beyond Ordinary Red (Coastal Region),,,,
"Subtle red fruit aromas show a flash of lemon peel. This medium-bodied Malbec is regular in every way—the flavors are a touch earthy, with spice and plum notes. The finish hums along while offering nothing new.",86,Notro 2012 Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),,,,
"This boasts a bright ruby color, and it shows fine nuances of wild fruit, dried ginger, licorice and dried tobacco. The palate finishes with smooth, silky tannins.",92,Ca' Viola 2006 Sotto Castello  (Barolo),,,,
"Fermented and aged in stainless steel, this single-vineyard wine brings notes of yellow apple and lees accented by tart acidity. While it provides some interest, it doesn't seem like all of the pieces have quite come together.",86,Jacob Williams 2012 Celilo Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Gorge (WA)),,,,
"Chunky, flat and stemmy on the nose, with herbal, generic fruit aromas. The palate is o.k. but sort of scratchy, while the flavors veer toward herbal, roasted cherry and berry. Herbal and sort of sweet and heavy on the finish. Pretty much what you'd expect for a $10 Cab.",83,Bodega Norton 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"From organic grapes in a blend of Grenache, Cinsault, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine is rich and ripe. Generous red fruits are cut with light acidity and broadened by the smooth, creamy texture. The fruit lasts right through to the end.",91,Domaine de Valdition 2014 Vallon des Anges Rosé (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence),,,,
"A wine for those who want something drier and crisper than the typically overoaked white Rhône blend. It's smooth, silky and earthy, with just a touch of orange and sandalwood. A very nice, elegant and versatile wine.",90,Hearst Ranch 2009 Three Sisters Cuvée White (Paso Robles),,,,
"Carignane likes Mendocino. This wine is dusty and soft in plums and smoky blackberry fruit. Having been aged in neutral French oak, the wine is soft and round, offering a taste of tobacco on the finish.",87,Stark 2012 Trimble Vineyard Carignane (Mendocino County),,,,
"This budget Riesling sets a good standard for the style and the price. It's off-dry, low alcohol (11.5%) and solidly varietal. The fruit is full bodied and ripe, with vivid peach and apricot flavors. Additional notes of honey and lemony breakfast tea keep the finish up and running.",87,Columbia Crest 2009 Two Vines Riesling (Washington),,,,
"This wine is crisp, fruity and refreshingly textured. With white fruit flavors and tight acidity, it is on the dry side, with a softer aftertaste that brings in ripe pear flavors. Drink now.",88,Comtes de Dampierre NV Comte Audoin de Dampierre Cuvée des Ambassadeurs Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"This opaque Merlot is charred to the max, with burnt coffee, grilled beef and campfire aromas.

"Lightly smoky and spicy oak nuances top off this deeply fruity and concentrated wine, which has firm tannins and good acidity to support its richness. Almost-sweet plum and black cherry notes form its core, while vanilla and baking spice notes complete the picture.",92,Jackson Estate 2015 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),,,,
Light aromas like canned fruit cocktail and almost sweet flavors like banana and marshmallow characterize this medium-bodied wine.,84,Peltier 2014 Hybrid Pinot Grigio (Lodi),,,,
"A rich nose of peaches, butterscotch and honey leads on this go-to white from Fleur Du Cap. Robust, balanced flavors of like character are buoyed by acidity and freshness. The finish is lingering. Pair with fish and fowl.",86,Fleur Du Cap 2007 Chenin Blanc (Western Cape),,,,
"This shows the softness and red cherry flavors of a nice Merlot, with rich Napa tannins and a hint of green mint. It's a clean, dry wine for drinking now.",87,Marilyn 2010 Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"Still young, this is a wine with fruit and acidity that dominate. At the moment, it is about stalky red berry fruits that need to soften into the smoky background. The aftertaste is perfumed and fresh. Let the wine age until 2017.",88,Saget la Perrière 2014 Marie de Beauregard  (Chinon),,,,
"This is a firmly structured and full-bodied wine with great grip in the texture and lots of oak flavor and tannin. The rich fruit flavors are dominated by the grip now, but that should change with time. It's best to drink after 2018.",89,Lava Cap 2013 Estate Bottled Barbera (El Dorado),,,,
This is a perfumed wine with eucalyptus aromas and new wood flavors. The wood element is held in balance by flavors of ripe berry fruits and delicate acidity. Keep this wine until 2015.,87,Château Saintongey 2011 Les Hauts de Palette Vieilles Vignes  (Bordeaux),,,,
"This wine, from a prime block of a famous vineyard, shows nectarine flesh, lime and lemon peel, salted butter and green herbs on the nose. The palate is still wound a little tight, but reveals green pear, citrus pith, lime juice, cheese rind and a touch of sour grass. Hold until 2016.",91,Foxen 2013 Block UU Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"Mocali's Fossetti estate delivers a fantastically crisp and easy white blend of Chardonnay, Moscato and Trebbiano with the natural creaminess, floral aromatics and freshness you'd expect of those three grapes respectively. It's the perfect fish or pasta salad wine.",87,Mocali 2009 Fossetti White (Toscana),,,,
"This wine sees only 10–15% new oak, which allows the gritty peach and tangerine fruit flavors to shine through, dressed up by hints of toasted hazelnuts. White peaches and a powdered talc texture give the impression of richness without excess weight. Finishes long, with notes of mineral and citrus.",88,Louis Latour 2000  Puligny-Montrachet,,,,
"Dry, spicy red-fruit aromas are solid and standard, while the palate is lean but comfortable, with dry, simple cherry flavors accented by a spot of oak-driven vanilla. Good but as regular as they come. Easy to drink.",86,Familia Schroeder 2007 Saurus Patagonia Merlot (Neuquén),,,,
"A vein of burnt sugar threads curiously from nose to finish in this dry full-bodied Pinot Gris. Sunny tangerine, pineapple and apricot flavors flood the midpalate, brightened by streak of lime acidity. A graceful balance of brawn and restraint, it should drink well through 2021.",88,Sheldrake Point 2015 Estate Bottled Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This is a deep, intense and focused wine sourced from 40-year-old vines. Its 28 g/l of residual sugar is all but buried in bright acids, creating tension and depth. Grapefruit, lime and pineapple flavors burst through, making this highly cellar-worthy wine irresistible already.",93,Timothy Malone 2015 Medici Vineyard Riesling (Chehalem Mountains),,,,
"The Kanonkop Pinotage does a beautiful job of maintaining the grape's unique indigenous character—on the nose you'll find trademark smoke, banana and plum, and on the palate, like flavors, with an added clove and leather touch. There's also an appealing cherry-mocha spin that gives the wine additional draw. Pair with smoky BBQ ribs, steak.",87,Kanonkop 2006 Pinotage (Simonsberg-Stellenbosch),,,,

"Aromatic, with notes of black tea leaves, sandalwood and incense, this smoky Georgian amber wine boasts delicate orange rind and blossom flavors, swathed in bristling, chestnut-skin-like tannins.

"The 2005 vintage was kind to this wine, grown in the warmer, northerly Middle Reach section of the valley. While lacking the depth of the 2002 and 2003, it shows flavorful black currants, cherries and root beer, with a peppery finish. The tannins are rich and fine. Small additions of Zin, Malbec, Petite Sirah and other red varieties add complexity.",89,Longboard 2005 DaKine Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley),,,,
"The nose of this wine isn't very expressive, but reveals plum and prune aromas, with faint hints of graphite. The palate offers mature black fruit and chocolate flavors, but also very evident alcohol sensations. While it lacks complexity and vitality, it has more immediate charm.",87,Begali 2009  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,,,,
"This fruity wine balances citrus and ripe white fruits. There is a steely edge that lends freshness and structure, and suggests the wine could age well. The aftertaste has some tight citrus acidity.",84,Dirler-Cadé 2011 Réserve Pinot Blanc (Alsace),,,,
Apple and vanilla-cookie aromas are mild. The slightly chunky mouthfeel suggests grape skins. Skins-driven flavors of lime and grapefruit finish with an oily texture and a taste of citrus peel.,88,Don Olegario 2016 Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"This candied rosé is a blend of Touriga Nacional and Syrah. Full of soft red berry fruits with only light acidity, it is off-dry to taste. A touch of pepper at the end is less attractive.",83,Falua 2013 Conde de Vimioso Colheita Seleccionada Rosé (Tejo),,,,
"This is a five-grape Bordeaux-style blend that's firm, substantial and tannic. It spent 30 months in 65% new French oak prior to bottling, and is only ever released five years after it's bottled. Focused and expressive, this deftly blends blueberry, black cherry and cassis fruit with barrel flavors of coffee, toffee and caramel. Hints of woodsy, dried herb notes add further intrigue.",92,Corliss Estates 2008 Corliss Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Soft, round and leathery tannins give way to plum, cherry, cranberry and sage in this subtly rendered Cab Franc out of one of the Livermore Valley's most vaulted vineyards, an approachable version of California Cab Franc that's moderate in price and alcohol (13.9%).",88,Fenestra 2007 Ghielmetti Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Livermore Valley),,,,
"This offers ripe dark-skinned berry, chopped herb, baking spice aromas wrapped in balsamic savor. On the palate, chewy tannins weave through wild cherry, black raspberry, cinnamon and star anise flavors. Drink 2018–2024.",92,Casisano Tommasi 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Dry tannins from the old wood give this wine a hard edge at first. Fresh, juicy red fruits offer an enticing character. On the finish, the tannins are tough and will need several years to soften",87,Château du Domaine de l'Eglise 2009  Pomerol,,,,
"The terse nature of Assyrtico finds a friend in oak when properly administered, as this wine exhibits. On the nose, citrus and mineral harmoniously mingle with spice and toast. On the palate, the wine retains its bright lemon and citrus flavors but is given extra body through the subtle oak. A lovely wine with a clean finish.",89,Domaine Sigalas 2013 Fermented in Oak Barrel Assyrtico (Santorini),,,,
"Ripe fruit flavors advance from apple to pear to honey as you sniff and sip this wine. It tastes clean and fruity, with a medium body and a smooth texture that allows the fruitiness to linger on the finish.",87,Cosentino 2013 The Chard Chardonnay (Lodi),,,,
"This is a 100% varietal selection, with most of the fruit coming from Weinbau Vineyard. It brings an assortment of barrel notes—including mocha, cedar and char from 20% new French oak—and varietal flavors of cherry, flowers and herbs. It starts out lighter in style, fleshing out over time with tart acidity providing a lift.",91,Tamarack Cellars 2011 Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope),,,,
"Rich with gooey marshmallow, crème brûlée and cotton candy aromas, this is an unabashed classic California Chardonnay from Austin Hope. Unctuous marzipan and sea salt caramel flavors make for a creamy mouthfeel, and yet firm acidity leaves the midpalate feeling clean, allowing butterscotch tones to linger on the finish.",90,Treana 2015 Chardonnay (Central Coast),,,,
"This is a standout of the vintage from the producer, earthy and stemmy in complex cherry, strawberry, forest and plum. Within the context of fruit and pine, it supports lively acidity and a lushness that shows its full-bodied fervor.",92,Saintsbury 2014 Toyon Farm Pinot Noir (Carneros),,,,
"Rick Longoria is all about restraint in his winemaking, and that shows on the shy aromas of this bottling that allow hints of black plum, wildfire, roasted meat and light rosemary to emerge. Tart plum and cranberry fruit pop on the palate, where a feral, gamy component is laced by forest floor and wild herbs.",92,Longoria 2014 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"The Australian golf legend now makes wine in California. Compared to your usual fruity Chard, this one's lean and minerally and high in acidity. But it's very clean, with tantalizing suggestions of lemon meringue and Key lime pie, and actually has a lot going for it.",87,Greg Norman California Estates 2006 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Confident and self-assured, Torrione is a wine that transmits its essence without veils or tricks. Vibrant berry fruit, blue flower, mineral tones and bright crispness create a balanced ensemble and suggest a pairing with wild boar or rabbit.",92,Fattoria Petrolo 2005 Torrione Sangiovese (Toscana),,,,
"This second wine of Labégorce Margaux is named after the former neighboring estate Labégorce Zédé that was amalgamated after the 2009 vintage. This is a ripe wine, full of the fruit of the vintage as well as having a firm dry tannic structure that will allow it to age. With juicy blackberry fruits still so youthful, it is going to be ready drink from 2019.",89,Château Labégorce Margaux 2012 Zédé de Labégorce  (Margaux),,,,
"Mild citrus and raspberry aromas are appropriate for this light-colored, light-bodied Pinot. A medium-sized palate is balanced and hints at elegance, while true-to-Leyda flavors of pie cherry and red plum are peppery on the finish, which brings hints of vanilla and wood grain.",87,Leyda 2013 Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley),,,,
"A ripe and soft style of rosé with its full strawberry fruits and only light acidity. Fruity and smooth, this bend of Touriga Nacional and Syrah is ready to drink.",84,Casal da Coelheira 2016 Rosé (Tejo),,,,
"This is a soft, tart, light red wine with excessive volatility. The finish borders on vinegary flavors, which overtake the fruit.",82,Edmonds Winery 2007 Slide Ridge Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Straightforward apple and peach aromas announce your basic everyday quaffing Chardonnay: this is low on minerality and acidity, and thus it tastes of banana, melon and vanilla. A flat, melony finish lacks acidic framework.",85,Chilensis 2014 Reserva Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Maule Valley),,,,
"Cola, black cherry and crushed purple flowers show on the nose of this bottling, one of the first reds to emerge from the 2014 vintage. It's light and energetic on the palate, with tangy cranberry juice and a touch of licorice.",88,Apriori 2014 Hicks Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"Pretty floral aromas accent notes of fennel and savory apple on this dry, crisp Riesling. Bright and bold on the palate, this has lemony acidity and an abundance of fresh apple flavor.",87,Swedish Hill 2011 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This highly concentrated, richly ripe red explores notions of plum, black cherry and tobacco. It finishes with a mildness of dried herb.",86,Buena Vista 2014 Merlot (Sonoma Valley),,,,

"Soft and charming, with jammy cherry, blackberry and chocolate-covered mint flavors. The wine flirts with off-dryness, but its crisp acidity provides a welcome balance.",84,Falkner 2004 Rock Creek Vineyard Syrah (Temecula),,,,
"Medium bodied and silky in texture, this is an unusually graceful and elegant Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Baked cherries and raspberries on the nose give way to a mix of red and black fruits on the palate, then finish fine, dry and savory. Drink now–2021.",90,Louis Bernard 2014 Domaine la Crau des Papes Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),,,,
"Cherry-raspberry notes show on the nose of this appellation blend from a Paso producer, along with eucalyptus and cedar. The palate is straightforward, with cranberry, raspberry, pencil lead and a bit of tar.",88,Proulx 2012 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),,,,
"Attractive and enticing, with aromas of dried red fruit and raspberry dust spiced up with notes of pepper, cocoa and toffee. Although grippy and somewhat sandpapery in the mouth, that firm texture lingers through the endless finish. Still young; try in 2012.",89,O'Vineyards 2007 Proprietor's Reserve Red (Cabardes),,,,
"A waxy, sour-leaning Chardonnay that's tart in a teeth-clenching way though it might mellow in time with air.",82,Girasole 2012 Chardonnay (Mendocino),,,,
"While this Stephané Derenoncourt wine has dry tannins, it also has ripe fruit and blackberry flavors. Concentrated and firm for now, from 18 months in barrel, it will develop well to give a rich wine in the future. Drink from 2019.",92,Domaine de l'A 2014  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,,,,
"Overtly sweet and simple, with sugary flavors of raspberries, oranges and vanilla.",81,Clayhouse 2010 Adobe Pink Rosé (Central Coast),,,,
"All the parts are here to make a good Cabernet. Flavors of chocolate, blackberry jam, cassis and smoky oak are framed in rich tannins. But the wine needs a little time to knit together. Should be drinking well by spring 2014. It's a great value for the price, and easy to find with more than 15,000 cases produced.",90,Katherine Goldschmidt 2011 Crazy Creek Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"So sweet in fruit, it's almost like a dessert pastry. Shows blackberry, cherry and cocoa flavors, with pie spices and caramelized oak. Finishes a little sweet, but it's clean and made in a popular style.",87,Rancho Sisquoc 2009 Flood Family Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"This big, thick, oaky Zinfandel is powerful in flavor and not particularly subtle. It overwhelms with truckloads of blackberry and cherry jam, stewed plums, chocolate, mocha, pepper and cedar, and stings the palate with hard, astringent tannins and heat. The suggestion is ageability, but it's a gamble beyond 2012.",87,Bella 2007 Barrel 32 Lily Hill Estate Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"This crisp, focused wine may not be quite as racy as its namesake dog breed, but it is very fresh. There's a touch of green apple, but the majority of the fruit leans more toward white grapeffruit, with a long finish.",88,Longview 2007 Whippet Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills),,,,
"Slightly oxidized at first with aromas of caramel and butterscotch, the wine soon opens to reveal apricot, honey and dried hay. It's an easy, genuine wine to pair with fried onion rings.",83,Fattoria Laila 2010  Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi,,,,
"This soft wine has only the lightest suggestion of texture. It is gently fruity and easy to drink, with strawberry fruits to the fore.",84,Château Torpez 2014 La Bravade Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"Despite its age, this white still offers upfront ripe-fruit aromas of citrus, pear and apple, but is graced with additional complex accents of hazelnut, toasted oak, orange blossom, lanolin and soft, chalky minerality. Pineapple, fig and apple-flesh flavors fill the palate, with a smooth, creamy mouthfeel and ample acidic lift to the long, gently textured finish.",91,Buitenverwachting 2011 Chardonnay (Constantia),,,,
"Bright lemon, lime and sweet grass aromas trend toward passionfruit on this fresh, fruity wine from Southern California. The palate is also quite ripe, with green bell pepper, ripe green apples and herbal punch, laid across tongue-tingling acidity.",88,Falkner 2014 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Temecula),,,,
"This eight-year old wine, based on Touriga Nacional, is ripe, now mature with the tannins fully integrated into the rich black fruit. It is firm with a structure that gives concentration and perfumed acidity. The wine is still dark and dense although ready to drink.",91,Quinta de Lemos 2008 Dona Georgina Red (Dão),,,,
"In its second vintage, this wine is light and spicy, clearly made to be enjoyed with food. A collaborative effort between winemaker Guy Davis and proprietor/grapegrower and chef Guy Fieri, it shines in subtly toasty oak, cinnamon and dark cherry flavors, with a lingering lushness on the finish.",91,Hunt & Ryde 2014 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Pretty, balanced and elegant, this wine offers varietally correct aromas and flavors of citrus, melon and apple, all buoyed by a crisp minerality that offers lift. Also true to the style, there's a round sweetness here that gives the wine an opulent edge. Pair with a chicken salad or seafood.",88,Winery of Good Hope 2007 Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch),,,,
"Balanced and dry, this is fruity with just the right amount of wood-aging flavors. It has red fruits, a shot of spirit that still keeps in balance, and tight, dry acidity at the end.",89,Dow's NV 10-Years-Old Tawny  (Port),,,,
"Impressive in its size and weight, this wine has tart fruit flavors of pomegranate and blueberry, with a dusting of coffee grounds. Tannins are ripe, firm and sleek, and the structure impactful. This needs even more bottle age or some hours of aeration.",91,Tranche 2010 Estate Grown Sangiovese (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Round and soft, this warm wine from the southern end of the Côte de Beaune feels rich and generous. It has caramel and yellow fruit flavors, and its crisp acidity will ensure that it will remain fresh and fruity.",87,Jaffelin 2010 Passetemps Premier Cru  (Santenay),,,,
"This inexpensive wine is relatively low in alcohol and reasonably refreshing, although pear, melon and pineapple flavors leave a slightly sweet impression on the palate. Drink now.",85,Yellow Tail 2015 Pinot Grigio (South Eastern Australia),,,,
"One of the simple pleasures from southern Italy, Corvo has steadily produced value Sicilian reds and whites for many generations. This blend opens with peach, citrus and pear notes, plus zesty freshness.",85,Corvo 2011 Bianco White (Sicilia),,,,
"This Syrah-based rosé, with just 4% Viognier, offers very clean lines of ripe cherry, strawberry, baking spice and brioche on the nose. There is a strong tactile grip to the palate, and then it smooths out very quickly, with a lemon juice acidity cutting through ripe red fruits.",88,Vina Robles 2016 Estate Rosé (Paso Robles),,,,
"This plush Syrah opens with a pretty ruby color and thick, almost syrupy, tones of blueberry and raspberry. The fruit aromas are followed by spice and roasted almonds and the wine is succulent and chewy to the very end.",88,Spadina 2006 Una Viola Signature Syrah (Sicilia),,,,
"This is a blend of Merlot (42%), Cabernet Franc (32%) and Cabernet Sauvignon coming from vines with an average age of 30 years. It has light but complex notes of cherries, plum, herbs, flowers and bittersweet chocolate. It's restrained and understated in style with seamless fruit flavors, mouthwatering acids and edgy tannins that need some time in the cellar to calm down.",93,Andrew Will 2010 Champoux Vineyard Red (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"Dark reddish-orange in color, this medium-bodied rosé offers refreshing acidity against a dramatic backdrop of intensely etched flavors, a mix of dark cherry, strawberry and blood orange that refreshes and rewards.",90,Bruliam 2016 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),,,,

"This pure expression of Nero d'Avola offers broad aromas of red berry, blackberry and currant. The fruit is on the dry side, made complex with aromas that recall wet earth and tobacco. The palate is elegant and layered.",89,COS 2009 Nero di Lupo Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),,,,
"Suavia's base Soave Classico opens with an initial hint of sulphur but then finds purity in the form of peach, honey and herbal aromas. In fact, the wine shows very nice fruit characteristics on the close.",86,Suavia 2010  Soave Classico,,,,
"This savory wine opens with aromas of violet, red rose, wet soil, woodland berries and a whiff of Mediterranean herbs. The fresh, inviting palate doles out juicy dark cherry accented with hints of cracked black pepper, sage and clove. It's straightforward, balanced and enjoyable now but will drink well for through 2017.",91,Luiano 2010 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"This wine is equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Franc, with a smaller percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon also added. Neutral French oak was used to age the blend, which opens with a strong, earthy aroma and a scent of wild blackberry. Soft, it features a twist of licorice on the tangy finish.",87,Judd's Hill 2010 Meritage (Napa Valley),,,,
"On the dry side, showing crisp white currants, grapefruit and a chalky structured texture. A delicious wine, firmly in the refreshing apéritif Champagne camp, floating its fruit with considerable delicacy.",91,Bruno Paillard NV Blanc de Blancs Réserve Privée Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),,,,
This tough wine seems light on fruit. It is hard and shows considerable extraction.,83,Chateau le Grand Verdus 2012  Bordeaux Supérieur,,,,

"A full-bodied wine with a style that incorporates richness in the aromas and restraint in the flavors. It smells sweet and candylike, but tastes dry and oaky. A touch of walnut on the palate adds an austerity that is smoothed over on the finish with a dash of sweet oak.",85,Wattle Creek 2012 Chardonnay (Yorkville Highlands),,,,
"Aromas of red berry, rose, toast and a whiff of oak emerge in the glass. The firm palate offers mature wild cherry, licorice, grilled sage and mineral alongside taut, fine-grained tannins.",90,Travaglini 2009 Riserva  (Gattinara),,,,
"Old-vine straw, tobacco and herb in the nose. The wine is subtle, sensual and complex, with layers of interesting spicy flavor. Nicely balanced and flavorful, with a long, firm finish.",90,Sausal 1997 Century Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma County),,,,
"Freixenet's signature Cava is consistent and pure as usual, with aromas of white fruit and white pepper and an overall freshness on the nose.

"With the wonderfully crisp acidity and bright, laser-pure fruit Edna Valley is known for, this Syrah, Grenache and Viognier blush offers a wealth of tasty raspberry, cherry, citrus fruit and spice flavors. Dry and clean, it shows California rosé near its best.",87,Tolosa 2007 Edna Ranch Rosé (Edna Valley),,,,
"Pure Petit Verdot from Red Mountain's quintessential Bordeaux varietal vineyard—does it get any better? Big, deep and tannic, with lovely purity, this features ultraripe fig and plum fruit with a pleasing salinity. The finish is persistent and shows a streak of iron. Note the alcohol is pushing 16% however it is beautifully integrated.",93,Côtes de Ciel 2012 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Petit Verdot (Red Mountain),,,,
"Cracked pepper and black olive aromas give this wine a savory cast, and they're followed up on the palate by hints of charred meat. It's medium-bodied and supple, with a soft, slightly diffuse finish that suggests drinking not cellaring. Drink now–2025.",88,Maison Nicolas Perrin 2013  Cornas,,,,
"Aromas of banana, apricot, honeysuckle and tropical fruit lead the nose. The round, medium-bodied palate offers creamy white peach, green apple, tangerine and a hint of honeydew melon. Fresh acidity brightens the rich flavors.",89,Zenato 2015 San Benedetto  (Lugana),,,,
"An austere Riesling in the traditional Australian style, the 2012 Isolation Ridge Riesling appears destined to have a long life. Penetrating lime aromas lead into a palate that's high strung and tight, but lined with mouthwatering fruit. An electric vibrancy of citrus and wet stones lingers on the finish. Drink now–2030.",92,Frankland Estate 2012 Isolation Ridge Vineyard Riesling (Frankland River),,,,
"Full bodied and rich, this has flavors of apple and lemon, with a warm and ripe feel that is balanced by a final mineral character. It needs several months to come together.",87,Baron Philippe de Rothschild 2011 Mouton Cadet  (Bordeaux Blanc),,,,
"A new effort from DDO, this drops Domaine Drouhin from the name, and puts the vineyard name front and center. It's young and well-crafted, with strawberry and cherry fruit. The potential is evident for an impressive site once the vines get some age under them.",88,Drouhin Oregon Roserock 2014 Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
"Fragrances recall honeysuckle, jasmine and citrus zest. The juicy palate offers creamy green apple, Bartlett pear and nectarine alongside zesty acidity. A note of white almond signals the close.",91,Pieropan 2013  Soave Classico,,,,
"Only produced from Grand Cru vineyards, this ripe wine offers yellow fruit flavors cut by dry tangy citrus acidity. It's full in the mouth, with a creamy mousse and attractive freshness. The wine, with its hints of toast as well as fruit, is ready to drink.",91,Pehu-Simonet NV Face Nord Brut Grand Cru  (Champagne),,,,
"Even though this Chardonnay has rich, ripe flavors of tropical fruit, peaches, apples and honey, it possesses an austere elegance by virtue of dryness, minerality and acidity. The blocks from which the grapes were grown are part of Stonestreet's holdings in the mountains overlooking Alexander Valley. This is a fine wine, intricate and powerful.  Drink now–2015.",92,Stonestreet 2011 Broken Road Chardonnay (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Charred earth, toast and menthol aromas come together in this evolved wine. The palate is dried out, showing licorice and powdered sage notes alongside worn tannins.",85,Salvano 2007 Riserva  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Candied mandarin peel and apricot join the rose-petal flavors that meet on an unctuous, rich palate. Residual sweetness gives this considerable heft but the overall balance is there, with a soft-focus finish that carries both fruit and spice.",89,Domaine Ehrhart 2014 Herrenweg Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"Blended with small amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, this has pinpoint focus and is packed with ripe berry fruit. The oak aging (45% new) and crisp tannins layer in veins of espresso and dark chocolate. Drink now through 2022.",90,Dusted Valley 2011 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Using grapes from all three estate vineyards, this slightly sweet (2.5% residual sugar) Riesling is textural and complex. Flavors of fruit skin and rind dominate, notably grapefruit and peach pit.",89,Chehalem 2011 Three Vineyard Riesling (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Luscious honeyed tangerine and yellow peach notes are offset by a streak of minerality in this easy, off-dry Riesling. It's delicate in body yet juicy and refreshing. Drink now.",87,Dr. Volkmar 2013 Kabinett Riesling (Rheinhessen),,,,

"So delicious and easy to drink, it's complexities are almost unappreciated. Lush, ripe raspberry, cherry and cola flavors flatter the palate, finished with smoky toast and exotic spices. Extra points for crisp acidity and lovely tannins.",91,Balletto 2009 Burnside Road Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Perfumed, subtle apple notes unfold on the creamy, biscuity palate. This is rounded but fresh, generous but shows tension. A central seam of acidity keeps the dry palate very supple and lets the purity of this wine speak clearly. The mousse is somewhere between creamy and frothy and thus very invigorating.",92,René Muré NV Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),,,,
"This wine's crusty, minerally aromas of black fruit are lightly toasted and earthy. On the palate, it feels tannic and high in acidity, with roasted, earthy flavors of plum and raspberry. Concentrated and grabby on the finish, it has a touch of lemony oak and astringency.",87,Apaltagua 2010 Signature Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),,,,
"Juicy streaks of grapefruit and pineapple in this spry, dry Riesling are cut by laser-focused acidity and rocky edges of slate. It's approachable and fresh yet abundantly elegant. Drink now through 2018.",90,Dr. Loosen 2014 Dr. L Dry Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Fresh red apple and tangy mandarin flavors unite in a fruity and fun combo. The palate is equally fruit-driven and refreshing, with bright but ripe acidity. This is a light-footed summer apéritif and very moreish.",89,La Cave des Vignerons de Pfaffenheim 2014 Pfaff Tradition Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"Aromas of mature berry, menthol, licorice, cooking spice and a balsamic note lead the nose. The firm palate is still tightly wound but already offers wild cherry, white pepper, grilled herb, tobacco and anise. It's balanced and fresh, with ripe but youthfully bracing tannins. Drink after 2019.",94,Germano Ettore 2011 del Comune di Serralunga d'Alba  (Barolo),,,,
"Rich and ripe, with some Chardonnay-like power, it's a lush mix of tropical fruit flavors—guava and banana and more. A lovely vein of caramel runs across the palate, and makes this simply irresistible.",91,Coelho 2013 Renovação Estate Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),,,,
"A baked lemon, honeyed aspect of this wine makes it seem overripe in many ways, a lush, full-bodied characteristic that seems slightly overdone. From one of the farming family's Green Valley ranches, it's intense and creamy.",86,Dutton Estate 2014 Dutton Palms Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Full bodied and bold flavored, this is not overwhelmingly dark in color nor pumped up in ripeness. It does emphasize aromas of anise and dried plums, adding flavors of blackberrry juice and a sense of alcoholic strength. It is moderately tannic, while the texture is mouthfilling and the finish rather warm.",89,Prospect 772 2012 The Truant G-S-M (Sierra Foothills),,,,
"A roasted, stalky smelling nose is a touch offputting at first but improves with airing. This high-elevation Maipo Pinot is watery on the palate, with raspberry, plum and earthy spice notes. A modest finish can generously be described as elegant.",85,William Fèvre 2011 Gran Cuvee Pinot Noir (Maipo Valley),,,,
"If you enjoy a really pungent, intensely grassy Sauvignon, then you'll love this wine, but for many consumers it will be too much.

"Ah, this wine is distinctive and practically haunting in personality, as wild, earthy, sage and mushroom aromas meet meaty, savory, mineral-like flavors on a well-balanced frame of good acidity and appetizing, fine-grained tannins.",92,Terre Rouge 2013 Mourvèdre (Sierra Foothills),,,,
"A firmly structured wine, solid with tannins and with structure. The wine is also full of fruit potential, ripe with red berries. It is dense wine that needs to age. Drink from 2025.",93,Maison Champy 2015 Aux Cras Premier Cru  (Beaune),,,,
"Shows an improvement over the 07, maybe because the vines are a little older. Still dry and crisp in acids and jammy, with raspberry and cherries, but with extra depth and length. Good now, but probably better after 3–4 years in the cellar.",89,Bartz-Allen 2008 Split Rock Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Garden herb and forest floor aromas make a case for this wine to be considered the producer's “Finest Selection” (the “FS” in “OFS”). On the palate, wild strawberry, black cherry and berry are the story, while powerful spice adds intrigue to the velvety texture, roundness and full-bodied concentration.",93,De Loach 2013 OFS Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"A sweet note of vanilla and cinnamon emerges at first and is soon followed by cherry, coffee and leather. The wine is both soft and silky thanks to its cherry and bright fruit nuances. It also offers zesty freshness on the close.",92,Castiglion del Bosco 2005  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"French oak, coconut, underbrush and a balsamic aroma follow through to the full-bodied palate along with licorice, espresso, dried cherry and raw cranberry. Raspy tannins provide the assertive frame work and clench the finish. Give the tannins a few years to relax then drink to capture the remaining fruit.",89,La Mannella 2012 Poggiarelli  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"Aromas of red fruits, tomato, herbs, tobacco and cedar are stylish and not overpowering. This feels fresh and a touch earthy, with flavors of tobacco, cinnamon, cassis and baked berries. The finish is medium in length and intensity, with apparent but not overbearing oak. Drink through 2017.",89,Pascual Toso 2011 Reserve Barrancas Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"Starts out with stalky, corny aromas that are typical of sweet Cavas. It feels candied and almost cloying, but adequate acidity comes to the rescue. Flavors of melon, mango and kiwi are sweet, while the finish suggests corn cakes and tropical fruits.",85,Segura Viudas NV Aria Estate Extra Dry Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"White-fruit aromas suggest peach and melon, but there's also some sourness and green thrown in. Acidic but fresh in the mouth, with citrusy flavors of lime and grapefruit. Acutely citric on the finish, with a hint of asparagus.",86,Chilcas 2008 Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"Vague melon aromas are strange at best and offputting at worst. This blend of 70% Chardonnay and 30% Moscatel is watery and suggestive of cantaloupe juice. Funky, mushy white-fruit flavors are tough to wade through.",80,Bodegas San Valero 2014 Particular White (Cariñena),,,,
"A juicy and smoky nose of black cherries, vanilla, smoked pork and teriyaki is lifted aromatically by pretty violet elements on the nose of this bottling. The palate centers on a blackberry-jam character, with roasted fennel and black-licorice candy adding quality spice.",92,Falcone 2013 Syrah (Paso Robles),,,,
"This four-grape, Bordeaux-style blend offers firm, concentrated plum and cassis fruit, stiff tannins and a touch of iron and graphite. It saw 45% new French oak—pretty impressive for a $25 red.",91,Cadence 2011 Coda Red (Red Mountain),,,,
"This red blend is nicely dry, with abundant of dark plum and pomegranate flavors and a full-bodied, moderately tannic mouthfeel. It's easy to drink but bold enough to pair with hearty proteins.",86,The Naked Grape NV Harvest Red (California),,,,
"Full-bodied wine, rich and rounded. It has its edge of tannins underlying the ripe cherry fruits. There is a jammy character that seems to diminish any acidity, making this a wine for drinking soon.",89,Manuel Olivier 2008  Vosne-Romanée,,,,
"This wine starts off with notes of blackberry, mint and asphalt on the nose, unfurling on the tongue to reveal tar, black olive, meat and blackberry flavors. It's full bodied and intense, even a bit warm on the finish. Impressively concentrated, but slightly bitter as well.",89,Kilikanoon 2008 Oracle Shiraz (Clare Valley),,,,
"A small-production blend of 86% Zinfandel with 14% Petite Sirah, this was aged over a year in a small percentage of new oak. Dry and structured, it's a celebration of chocolate, leather and blackberry, the fruit sizably ripe yet kept in check. Drink now through 2018.",91,Fidelity 2013 Railyard Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Aromas of pressed rose, toast, menthol and a whiff of cellar floor emerge after a few minutes in the glass. The palate shows dried cherry, coffee, vanilla and a hint of mocha alongside bracing tannins that leave an astringent finish.",89,Virna Borgogno 2012 Barolo del Comune di Barolo  (Barolo),,,,
"This biodynamically farmed vineyard is often found as a named designate, and for good reason. It's one of the Willamette Valley's most distinctive and evocative sites, with less of an emphasis on pure fruit flavors, and more attention to details such as herbal tea, earth, stone and dried leaf. The fruit is tart and lightly herbal, like a fresh-picked mountain berry.",93,St. Innocent 2014 Momtazi Vineyard Pinot Noir (McMinnville),,,,
"A tangy grapefruit flavor and refreshing acidity make this a good before-dinner quaff and an apt pairing with seafood. Herbaceous and citrus aromas carry through to the flavors, medium body and good balance.",89,Husch 2013 La Ribera Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino),,,,
"A wine with a very mineral character, some weight, very lively acidity, rounded out with spice and pear. This is for long-term aging, over five years and more.",93,Domaine Huët 2010 Clos du Bourg Sec  (Vouvray),,,,
"This is the first release from this new winery, and was crafted by Jared Etzel using Bonnie Jean and Schindler vineyard fruit. It's a lovely mix of blueberry, raspberry and cherry flavors, lively and bright, with polished acidity and 30% new oak just peeking through. Drink it young with a nice chunk of wild salmon, or age it a few years and bring on the lamb chops. Either way, you're in for a treat.",91,Furioso 2014 L'Altra Linea Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"At 6% residual sugar and just 7% alcohol, you might expect this to be dessert-like. But the delicate spritz and grapefruit-like acidity keeps it in the apéritif range, with Moscato-like orange-candy flavors and a juicy, fruity mouthfeel.",87,Chehalem 2011 Ridgecrest Vineyards Sext Riesling (Ribbon Ridge),,,,
"The variety is unmistakable, with notes of dried herb, dark cherry and espresso. The jammy fruit flavors are rich, with lightly grainy tannins and coffee notes on the finish. It shows a fine sense of balance.",90,Barnard Griffin 2014 Signature Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"From the producer's family estate site planted in 1982 on Eastside Road, this is a nuanced elegant expression of the variety, earthy and pungent in baked bread. Baked plum, strawberry and dried herb are accented by forest floor and a rich hit of maple.",91,Rock Wall 2015 Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"The mint-green bottle color presages the minty flavors of this dry, crisp wine. The fruit feels delicately balanced between underripe and fine, with suggestions of white peach and mango. It shows some real complexity, and the all-important acidity is wonderful.",87,Angeline 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Passiró is a gorgeous dessert wine from Lazio in central Italy that shows enormous beauty and harmony. The wine is thick and creamy and brightens the palate with its bouquet of honey, creamy vanilla, candied fruit and apricot. Pair it with pâté or aged cheese.",95,Falesco 2007 Passirò White (Lazio),,,,
"Peardrop scents accent the yeasty nose of this wine. The palate is full of generous, fruity yellow and green pear, set against a backdrop of zesty-fresh grapefruit peel. Salty savor provides depth to its otherwise light, dry and refreshing body.",90,Kohl 2016 Classic Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel),,,,
"Green pears and ivy leaves, together with zesty lemon, bring a very slender and precise focus to this wine that promises refreshment and ageing mileage. Drink now or keep until 2015–2016.",90,Salomon-Undhof 2013 Franziskus Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),,,,
"Fermented and aged in barriques, this Sauvignon is overwhelmed by wood. It's loaded with sensations of toasted oak, butterscotch and vanilla with a hint of lemon drop. It lacks the fruit richness to support the dominate wood.",86,Dorigo 2011 Ronc di Juri Sauvignon (Colli Orientali del Friuli),,,,
"From vineyards that surround the winery in San Martin, this wine offers stony aromas of black slate and earth but only the tiniest bit of plum fruit. Dark red-cherry fruits show on the palate along with cedar, and it's rather light in body though with grippy tannins.",86,Clos LaChance 2012 Whitestone Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast),,,,
"A sweet, simple Chardonnay, with pineapple and orange jam flavors and oak-like vanilla and caramel influences.",83,DeLorimier 2008 Chardonnay (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Here's a thick and sweet-smelling Orvieto Classico Superiore (a blend of Grechetto, Procanico and a small part of Chardonnay) that sports a deep golden color and opulent aromas of butterscotch, honey, apricot, exotic fruit and toasted nut. The wine is extremely soft and succulent in the mouth with long-lasting flavors of apricot and almond.",90,Barberani 2006 Pomaio Villa Monticelli  (Orvieto Classico Superiore),,,,
"Crisp and fresh aromas of pineapple and melon lead on this pretty semi-sweet Riesling, and are followed by slightly sweet, floral flavors that are kept light with a citric, minerally backbone. Pair with chicken salad, Thai cuisine, even curry.",84,Penguin Bay 2007 Semi-Sweet Riesling (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Made in the familiar style that is K-J Vintner's Reserve, this Chardonnay shows pineapple, lemondrop, mineral and spice flavors balanced with crisp coastal acidity.",87,Kendall-Jackson 2007 Vintner's Reserve Chardonnay (California),,,,
"Soft and light just off dry, this is an attractive and fruity wine. Strawberry flavors give a crispness to the background of the wine, finishing with a light, dancing aftertaste.",85,Le Charmel 2014 Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"This unusually rich wine has it all: ripe, round citrus and peach fruit compounded with oaky notes of vanilla, toast and butter. There's none of that grassy, straw character you find in so many North Coast offerings. With its fine, spicy finish, it's one of the best Sauvignon Blancs of the vintage. Contains 9% Sémillon.",90,Gainey 1998 Limited Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Formerly the Goldschmidt vineyard, Winderlea is under new ownership, and has been replanted. This is a light vintage, but beautifully rendered here, with sweet cherry fruit, bracing acidity and a lively mouthfeel that invites further sipping. The underlying minerality carries a hint of toasted cracker.",91,Winderlea 2007 Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),,,,
"Bramble and dusty mineral notes extend from nose to finish in this dry Riesling, lending a savory tone to freshly pressed apple and dried orange peel flavors. Its voluminous, mouth-filling texture is pleasant, balanced neatly by a strike of lemonade acidity.",86,Suhru 2014 Dry Riesling (New York),,,,
"Powerful, natural, uncomplicated grape aromas and flavors fuel this light-bodied but memorable wine. With each sip its depth, complexity and appeal improve. The density and intensity of the fruit flavors combine with very firm tannins and lively acidity to make it nervy and delicious. Best now through 2019.",91,Couloir 2013 Chileno Valley Vineyard Pinot Noir (Marin County),,,,
"Quite watery, the nose shows just a touch of gunmetal, pear flesh and apple blossom. The palate is a bit flat, with steel and apple elements.",83,EOS 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"This copper-colored wine was made from mostly Rhône-style grapes and has earthy meaty aromas and flavors, a light to medium body and a texture that's rich and smooth. This is not a crisp fruity version, but a more savory complex one that can fill in for a red.",87,Hess 2016 Shirtail Ranches Rosé (California),,,,
"This lightly oaked wine is full of fruit, ripe with red berries and crisp with acidity, just hinting at Douro minerality. That makes for a balanced fruity wine that with its soft tannins is ready to drink.",88,Delaforce 2014 Tinto Red (Douro),,,,
"Worth the effort to find, this wine shows terrific balance in every respect. Subtle oak and spice frame ripe cherry fruit on the nose. Refreshing herb and spice elements add zest to cherry and cola flavors on the palate, where the wine is fleshy without being at all heavy. The ripe tannins on the finish are supple enough to make this approachable now, but it should also evolve gracefully for at least five-to-eight years.",93,Moorooduc 2012 Robinson Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mornington Peninsula),,,,
"This is a ripe, soft and rich cru wine. With its attractive cherries and gentle tannic structure, it is fruity and easy. The acidity that comes through at the end gives the wine a crisp aftertaste. Drink now.",87,Jean-Paul Brun 2015 Pisse Vieille  (Brouilly),,,,
"Dusty orange and nectarine aromas are on target. This is basic and citrusy in feel, with mild orange and stone-fruit flavors that fade quickly. A fresh finish isn't that flavorful but hangs around nicely due to healthy core acidity.",87,Viña Otano 2015 Rosé (Rioja),,,,
"This is a bit Sancerre-ish in its light to medium body, aromas of struck flint and crisp flavors of grapefruit. Riper hints of fig and melon betray its New World origins, but it still finishes tart and racy.",87,Mussel Bay 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"Pure Cabernet sourced principally from the Cold Creek Vineyard, this instantly accessible reserve plays out broadly across the palate, with black cherry, caramel and creamy coffee flavors in abundance. Hints of graphite and chalk carry through the tannins and into the well-defined, balanced finish.",90,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2011 Ethos Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A heavy coating of oak covers red-fruit aromas of plum and currant. This is firm and drawing in feel, with red plum, currant and oaky flavors. Additional oak and related vanilla flavors are key players on the finish.",88,Consejo de la Alta 2013 Crianza  (Rioja),,,,
"Terrale Oro is a simple, somewhat watered down expression of Nero d'Avola that would pair well with easy pasta dishes or take out pizza. Cherry, blueberry and almond flavors characterize the palate.",83,Calatrasi 2009 Terrale Oro Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),,,,
"This wine has a rustic, unclean quality. At a high alcohol level it also tastes disjointed, all about heat without fruit.",80,Ektimo Vineyards 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Bennett Valley),,,,
"Chalky tannins and subdued fruit and tannin weight make this an inviting, food-friendly wine, a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller amounts of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. Made from estate vineyards, it's rich in black cherry and dark chocolate, concentrated and layered. It ends in a spicy back note of pepper. Cellar through 2022.",93,Flora Springs 2012 Trilogy Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"This is a perfumed, citrus and apricot-flavored wine. It is crisp, with a ripe character that fills the mouth with rich fruitiness. It has a light, mineral structure and a long, fruity aftertaste. Drink now.",88,Clos Poggiale 2015 Vermentino (Corse),,,,
"A pretty, perfumed Pinot Noir, with gorgeous streaks of kir and vibrant blackberry and cherry. It's subtle and structured, with a pronounced layer of earthy forest floor on the finish. With sprinklings of spice, it dazzles from beginning to end.",96,Williams Selyem 2011 Weir Vineyard Pinot Noir (Yorkville Highlands),,,,
"This wine holds the tension between sweetness and fresh apple acidity well. Crisp, light and fruity, it's a great apéritif wine, ready to drink.",87,Mailly Grand Cru NV Délice Demi-Sec  (Champagne),,,,
"Aromas of bell pepper and canned peas are offset by lime and grapefruit notes. This feels citrusy but diluted, while pyrazine-driven flavors of bell pepper and lettuce finish fresh but watery.",86,Santa Rita 2014 Medalla Real Gran Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),,,,
"Though not known as a particularly cool region, the hills southwest of San Jose turn out solid Pinot Noirs for this winery. Aromas recall olives, forest floor and cloves, and flavors are quite smooth, with buttered cherries, peppery spice, cola and vibrant acidity that cuts a clean, quick finish.",88,Sarah's Vineyard 2011 Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Clara Valley),,,,
"Root beer, tar, asphalt, prune and dark jammy fruit make a lasting impression on the nose. This Ripasso sports a soft, velvety texture that would pair well with lasagna or ravioli stuffed with meat.",88,Cantine Benedetti 2007 Corte Antica  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso),,,,
"With a beautiful honeysuckle nose, this dessert offering of 100% Moscato di Canelli is simply divine. Bright acidity balances against bold waves of honeycomb and gingerbread, alongside pear compote. It should be mandatory to serve it over ice cream.",92,Benessere 2014 Estate St. Helena Vineyard Moscato (St. Helena),,,,
"This concentrated wine is also well balanced. Deep red color comes with bright aromas that combine red and black cherries with cranberries. Flavors repeat the cherry-berry mix and ride on a surprisingly light, agile texture. Tasty now, it should gain complexity through 2020.",91,City Winery Chicago 2011 Alder Springs Vineyard Reserve Syrah (Mendocino),,,,
"This coastal, cool-climate estate wine is fresh and fruity, with plush tannins that feel velvety on the tongue. Cranberry, pomegranate and orange flavors provide complexity, complemented by black tea and forest floor notes.",93,Joseph Phelps 2014 Pastorale Vineyard Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Grassy on the nose, and for a brut nature this is decidedly flat in aromas, with ultradry flavors of lime and tangerine along with powdery vanilla. Super light on the finish, which dissipates in no time. Almost tart and lacking in the long run.",84,Miquel Pons NV Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"With apricot, orange, peach, lemon and lime flavors, this is one of the richer Sauvignon Blancs out there. But it's totally dry, with brisk acidity and a clean, elegant finish.",88,Laird 2013 Big Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"The vineyard is one of the better Chardonnay sources in Alexander Valley, and in this fine vintage it lends ripe pineapple, pear, Key lime pie and Mandarin orange flavors to the wine. Lots of toasty new oak adds buttered toast and vanilla, but the wood influence is in balance. Classic Burgundian-style California Chardonnay, rich and opulent.",92,Matrix 2007 Stuhlmuller Vineyard Chardonnay (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Dry, acidic and earthy, lacking the richness you want in a fine Chardonnay. Could almost be a Pinot Grigio, with its crisp citrus and mineral flavors.",85,Justin 2009 Chardonnay (Paso Robles),,,,
"Not much Rutherford character here, in the way of structural complexity. What you get is a soft, gentle wine, with rich, ripe raspberry jam, cinnamon and toast flavors that are easy to like, especially with a juicy burger.",84,There 2010 Merlot (Rutherford),,,,
"Slender and compact, this has a light ruby color, with lively aromas of wild berry and bitter almond. The acidity shows a tight, nervous quality.",86,Domodimonti 2010 Monte Fiore Sangiovese (Marche),,,,
"From the vineyard owned by winemaker Bill Brosseau's family, this bottling shows black raspberry, strawberry, wet slate and rose petal scents on the nose. The palate is loaded with earthy black plum and other dark fruits, lifted by a star anise spiciness.",91,Testarossa 2015 Brosseau Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chalone),,,,
"A blend of four vineyards, this is an extremely impressive Merlot. It dazzles with rich, ripe black currant, cherry liqueur, raspberry, milk chocolate, smoky oak and spice flavors that are complex and go on and on through the finish. Beyond that is the texture, so refined and elegant, combining power and subtle elegance. Just a gorgeous, sensual Merlot. Drink now–2010.",95,Duckhorn 2004 Estate Grown Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"So rich and powerful in fruit. Blackberry and cherry jam, mocha, cola, tobacco, black pepper, anise, licorice, beef jerky, it's all there, on steroids.",89,Williams Selyem 2008 Feeney Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Summer where art thou? This zippy, simple but ultrarefreshing and light-bodied Grüner, with green pear crispness, is just the thing for hot days. Drink soon.",88,Hugl-Wimmer 2015 Wimmer Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),,,,
"Fragrant and firmly structured, this offers enticing scents of ripe berry, baking spice, tobacco, leather and a balsamic note. The solid palate doles out sour cherry, crushed raspberry, strawberry, cinnamon, clove and anise. A tannic backbone and bright acidity lend structure and balance. It boasts a surprisingly age-worthy structure given the heat of the vintage. Drink 2019–2031.",94,Umberto Fracassi 2011 Mantoetto  (Barolo),,,,
"Aromas of raspberry and strawberry are grassy, and the wine feels hard, lean and grinding. The flavor profile mirrors the nose, and the wine finishes with jammy but green raspberry notes.",83,Quinta de Aves 2014 Otus Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),,,,
"The color of this full-bodied wine is deep red and aromas are dense with dark fruit like black plum and blueberry, accented with earthy nuances. The mouthfeel is rich and almost thick, as firm but fine-textured tannins coat the tongue and concentrated flavors of dark chocolate and blueberry soak through. This should improve through at least 2020.",91,Baiocchi Wines 2011 Nicholas' Vineyard Syrah (Fair Play),,,,
"With fresh, pure fruit flavors, great balance and very full body, this wine will be great at the table. It has a dry but velvety feel, moderate tannins and good acidity, all of which lift up the great cherry and boysenberry nuances and give an overall impression of freshness.",93,Renwood 2013 Story Vineyard Zinfandel (Amador County),,,,
"Calera's basic Central Coast Pinot is a good, drily crisp wine, showing some real elegance. A little heavy, it shows cherry, red currant, herb, tobacco, teriaki beef and sandalwood flavors. Drink now. More than 12,000 cases were produced.",87,Calera 2009 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),,,,
"This basic, fairly priced offering is bright in acidity with crisp, clean cherry and cola flavors.",85,Steelhead Vineyards 2014 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),,,,
"A dense, beautifully structured wine. It shows intense, ripe fruit with balanced acidity. It's the fine tannins that give it such class, surrounding the fruit, promising long aging. This is a classic for Léoville-Barton.",96,Château Léoville Barton 2008  Saint-Julien,,,,
"Generally considered the best of the best single vineyard Pinots from Sineann, this new Resonance is—to quote the late, great Robert Palmer—simply irresistible. Fresh fruit flavors of strawberry, raspberry, sweet cherry and more roll into a lingering aftermath with nuances of cinnamon, cola, chocolate, nougat, coconut and caramel. None of this is overwhelming; the fruit rules. But the finesse and length, which sneaks up on you, are impressive.",94,Sineann 2009 Resonance Vineyard Pinot Noir,,,,
"This is a clean and vibrant rosé, with upfront notes of lavender, menthol and bay that frame red cherry and berry tones. The palate is fleshy and fruit-forward, with bold flavors of peach and strawberry that transition seamlessly into the citrus-zest finish.",89,Hecht & Bannier 2015 Rosé (Languedoc),,,,
"This is one of a trio of single-vineyards bottlings from this producer. It comes from the village of Fuissé and is situated in a small valley. Elegant and perfumed, the touch of wood aging enhances the white-fruit flavor. The aftertaste is juicy while also ripe. Drink from 2017.",93,Château de Fuissé 2014 Les Combettes  (Pouilly-Fuissé),,,,
"This creative blend of 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot, 15% Tannat, 13% Petit Verdot, 8% Syrah and 1% Petite Sirah offers roasted red-bell pepper, black gravel, black plums, chocolate cake and caramelized beef on the umami-driven nose. The palate is tighter, with elderberries, cranberries and decent tannic grip, proving tasty but not quite as exciting as the nose suggests.",90,Bonny Doon 2013 A Proper Claret (California),,,,
"This very herbaceous wine shows almond, toast and a rich texture. The wine has a creamy feel, ripe in the mouth while retaining grapefruit-driven freshness at the end.",88,Château d'Argadens 2011  Bordeaux Blanc,,,,
"Syrah (37%), Grenache (24%) and Mourvèdre (19%) take the lead on this blend, with the balance Cinsault, Counoise, Cabernet and Viognier. Perfumed aromas of flowers, blue fruit and herbs lead to sweet, plentiful blue and black-fruit flavors that coat the palate from end to end. The finish lingers.",90,Buried Cane 2013 Heartwood Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Firmly tannic, this is still a young wine. It has a dry structure with a black currant-skin stalkiness. Acidity and structure are still developing, so wait until 2016.",85,Château de Piote 2010  Bordeaux,,,,
"This light, pleasant wine shows ripe strawberry, white pepper and dried herb notes. It was aged for 22 months in 10% new French oak.",87,Twill 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Gherardino offers tight fruit nuances of forest berry, white cherry and cranberry, wrapped within generous tones of almond, wet earth and blue flower. It's an easy-drinking Sangiovese, with bright acids on the finish.",88,Villa Vignamaggio 2010 Gherardino  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"Dusty, smoky earth tones fade to reveal a rich, fruity palate of sweet white peaches and tangerine. Despite its light-footed nature, there's a lusciousness in mouthfeel, cut with spine-tingling acidity on the midpalate. Enjoy from 2018 to allow its honeyed mineral notes to develop.",92,Fritz Haag 2013 Brauneberger Juffer Sonnenuhr Auslese Goldkapsel Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Smells full but reduced, with a foxy, candied leaning and aromas of vitamins and minerals. Feels big, bulky, grabby and thick, with baked blackberry and plum flavors. Full on the finish, with some heat.",86,Loriñon 2006 Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"This wine all comes Chandler Reach Vineyards. The aromas seem to lack clarity while the cranberry, prune and cherry flavors want for midpalate concentration.",85,Keira 2014 Merlot (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Tastes a bit on the sweet, sugary side, but with the crisp acidity, it's balanced and elegant. The cherry, raspberry, lemongrass, vanilla, peppery spice and smoky wood flavors will work well against Thai or Vietnamese fare.",86,Tablas Creek 2007 Rosé (Paso Robles),,,,
"An intriguing wine, this boasts herbal-, tobacco- and truffle-laced aromatics backed by a modicum of cassis fruit and a wonderfully soft, creamy, supple texture. The flavors also veer dangerously close to vegetal, so if you insist on no green notes in your Cab, search somewhere else.",87,Jenke 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa),,,,
"In only its second vintage in the U.S., this nutty, mineral-rich, immensely fruity wine from Antinori's coastal estate is a great example of the heights that Vermentino can achieve. This version is full of lime, stone, citrus and marzipan, and is focused from beginning to end",91,Antinori 2001 Guado al Tasso Vermentino (Bolgheri),,,,
"For a fruity sparkling wine, there's nothing wrong with this. Aromas of ripe apple and lychee precede a palate with weight. Residual sugar causes lychee, lime and apple flavors to come across as sweet, while the finish is steady and avoids being cloying.",86,Vicente Gandia NV Sandara Sparkling (Spain),,,,
"Soft and sweetly gentle, this everyday wine has likeable flavors of black cherries, raspberries, chocolate, dates and black pepper. Blend is Syrah, Grenache, Mourvèdre, Petite Sirah.",84,Two Angels 2006 Divinity Red (High Valley),,,,
"Blockbuster intensity is delivered here in part thanks to the dense soils and concentrated style associated with the Brunate cru, and in part due to the warmth and power of the 2007 vintage. Lingering tones of vanilla, sweet spice, red cherry and soft chocolate fuel a long, luscious finish.",94,Ceretto 2007 Bricco Rocche Brunate  (Barolo),,,,
"Varietally correct Syrah from Washington can be difficult to find in this price range but this wine brings it with notes of blueberry, mesquite and vanilla along with a soft, subdued, citrusy feel. Finishes a touch ripe.",86,Washington Hills 2011 Syrah (Washington),,,,
"As intense and strapping as a Hall of Fame cornerback, this Cabernet is ripe in dark cherry, vanilla and milk chocolate, the tannins mouthfillingly sweet. Built to last, it should stand up to even the fiercest of meats, from rib eye to ribs.",90,TwentyFour by Charles Woodson 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Calistoga),,,,
"This warm ripe blend of Pinot Noir and Gamay has some firm tannins as well as juicy red fruits. It is concentrated and structured while also having a generous, fruity character. Drink this wine now.",88,Florian Roblin 2015 Champ Gibault Pinot Noir-Gamay (Coteaux du Giennois),,,,
"Zesty and simple, this has fruity aromas of bright red berry and a floral note. The lean diluted palate offers suggestions of unripened sour cherry and a hint of orange zest. Sharp, bracing acidity dominates.",84,Ca' Nova 2014 Bocciolo Nebbiolo (Colline Novaresi),,,,
"A mineral, aromatic wine, taut, herbal in character, the fruit crisp, with concentration and apple skin characters. A delicious wine, with great depth of flavor.",91,Manfred Tement 2009 Grassnitzberg Sauvignon Blanc (Südsteiermark),,,,
"This is a plump Vino Nobile that delivers red currant and cola on the nose followed by meaty tones of smoked bacon and leather. In the mouth, the wine feels crisp and lean with moderate intensity.",87,Vecchia Cantina di Montepulciano 2009 Leone d'Oro Figli d'Italia  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),,,,
"David and Anna deLaski planted this obscure grape on their home vineyard to honor her Austrian roots—the results are fascinating. A dark earthy graphite-driven minerality contrasts with the brighter sweeter strawberry and cherry fruit on the nose, and then the bone-dry sip pops with a candied raspberry flavor, enhanced by fennel and white pepper.",91,Solminer 2015 deLanda Vineyard Blaufränkisch (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"This salmon-pink-colored wine is refreshingly fruity, with attractively crisp acid offsetting the bright red fruit and apple flavors. Drier than in past vintages, it still has a ripe, soft finish.",87,G. H. Mumm NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne),,,,
"This is done in a wide-open, instantly drinkable style that makes it an excellent, everyday quaffer. Young Oregon Pinots often need more time, but not this one. Strawberry, coffee and cola flavors combine into a broad and flavorful midpalate, fresh and inviting.",88,Hundred Suns 2015 Old Eight Cut Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Dry and softly tannic, this Cab is ready to drink now. It offers blackberry, black and red currant, licorice and sage flavors, with a touch of smoky new oak.",85,Side Job 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),,,,
"This vintage of Marsiliana (the top wine from the Maremma property of Prince Corsini) shows rich tones of espresso, chocolate, dark fruit, leather and spice. The wine is soft and well extracted, with a slightly tough, chewy finish.",90,Marsiliana 2005 Red (Toscana),,,,
"The cooler northern part of Burgundy is not far from southern Champagne, so it's unsurprising that this is the source of much sparkling Burgundy. This pale colored rosé is soft and fruity, with a hint of red cherry and plenty of fine, crisp acidity. Drink now.",89,Simonnet-Febvre NV Brut Rosé  (Crémant de Bourgogne),,,,
"Lots of oak results in aromas of bacon, charred beef, cinnamon and heavy berry fruit. The wine is big and clangy, but not harsh. The flavors of berries mixed with greens and vanilla are nervy, while in the end the wine shows a solid mouthfeel and decent structure.",85,Viña Albali 2001 Reserva Tempranillo (Valdepeñas),,,,
"Great structure, with crisp, supportive acids and a fine overlay of oak that seasons but doesn't overwhelm. The flavors are quite lean. The winemaker calls them mineral-like, but it's more like grapefruits and lemons. The main problem with this well-made wine is, in fact, this lack of flavor.",84,Stuhlmuller Vineyards 2000 Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Aromas of toasted nut, citrus and oak lead the nose. The linear, rather lean palate shows yellow apple skin, bitter almond and lime zest. A mineral note signals the finish.",87,La Tunella 2013 Col Livius Friulano (Friuli Colli Orientali),,,,
"This is a tight wine, firm with tannins and with a bitter edge. Jammy cherry fruits lie behind this structure, along with acidity. The wine will soften and be ready to drink from 2018.",85,L. Tramier & Fils 2016 Collection  (Beaujolais-Villages),,,,
"This is for real Pinotage lovers, so bashful drinkers, beware. The nose bursts with ripe red fruit and spice—Pinotage hallmarks—and on the palate, lively, spicy and smoky flavors of berry and savory spice abound. It's a wine full of personality and is best enjoyed with a dish of grilled spicy ribs or ethnic food that can tame its wildness.",86,Fairview 2005 Pinotage (Paarl),,,,
"It's hard to believe it's possible to buy this quality rosé for so little money. Mouthwatering scents of raspberry, stone fruit and crushed stone emerge from the glass, followed by rich, ripe fruit flavors balanced by just-enough citrusy acidity. It's full-bodied and plush, yet vibrant and long on the finish.",93,Domaine des Carteresses 2016  Tavel,,,,
"More mineral than fruity, this dry Riesling has an angularity and elegance that's distinct. Candlewax and smoke notes seep through concentrated flavors of tart tangerine and lime. It's approachable and refreshing yet quite refined. Drink now through 2020.",90,Schlossgut Diel 2014 Riesling (Nahe),,,,
"In possibly the world's heaviest bottle comes this heavy Ancient Vine Zinfandel, greasy in bacon fat flavor, plus-sized in every way with a taste of sweet cigar smoke from beginning to end.",80,Moss Roxx 2010 Ancient Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),,,,
"This creamy, candied Viognier comes across hot and high in alcohol, with banana and vanilla aromas that are not very encouraging. Flavors of Animal Cracker cookies, vanilla and canned fruits end in a sweet, soft, cloying finish.",82,Viña Casas Patronales 2010 Maucho Reserva Viognier (Maule Valley),,,,
"This rich, oaky Chardonnay has aromas and flavors of buttered toast, buttered popcorn, vanilla and pineapple jam. It's very rich and creamy, and appeals for sheer deliciouness.",87,Perception 2008 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Rich blackberry and black-currant flavors give this wine its ripe character. They are already well balanced by the spicy tannins and dry core. The wine will develop well and should be ready from 2019. This is the last vintage under the Fournier-Casteja family. In December, Birot was sold to Miaolin Chen's New Century Tourism Group based in Hangzhou, China.",90,Château de Birot 2014  Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux,,,,
"Punset is a very interesting organic and biodynamic winery that tends to release its vintages much later than the others. This 2004 Riserva Barbaresco is amazingly intense and complex with deep layers of cola, white licorice, balsam notes, forest berry and dried mint. Drink from 2015–2020.",95,Punset 2004 Riserva  (Barbaresco),,,,
"A full, ripe vanilla- and strawberry-flavored wine that hits the spot for the summer, with an emphasis on dryness, but with a soft, fruity, food-friendly aftertaste.",84,Falua 2007 Conde de Vimioso Vinho Rosé Red (Ribatejano),,,,
"Not sure which vineyard sourced the grapes, but this is a flavorful, ready-to-drink bottle of wine. There is substantial evidence of aging in expensive new oak barrels, with a lot of coconut flavor over toast, chocolate and cherry. Tannins are soft and the fruit is round and luscious; except for a slight fall-off in the finish this could be from any one of a number of well-known Walla Walla wineries.",89,Kramer 2007 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),,,,
"This medium-weight wine shows a crispness of style and provenance. Caramelized oak is softened and made fruity by the taste of apple skin and pear. Stony mineral is given additional freshness by layers of lemon peel and orange zest, finishing focused and clean.",93,Flowers 2014 Camp Meeting Ridge Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"This wine's dried pear, hay and hayflower scents create an immediate impression of richness. The palate underlines all of these generous flavors with a unique, streamlined freshness that illuminates. This is what happens when good Grüner Veltliner benefits from a little bottle age: Its herbal, lifted allure comes to the fore. Savor this.",93,Sohm & Kracher 2012 Single Vineyard Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),,,,
"Extremely fragrant and floral, this classic method sparkler delivers a full bouquet of jasmine, honeysuckle and chamomile. But the nose is not just floral: You'll get yellow fruit, peach, honey and a bit of apple pulp as well. The wine closes with a note of bitter almond.",85,Carpenè Malvolti 2004 Brut Millesimato Sparkling (Veneto),,,,
"Chunky and a bit hard-edged, this Shiraz combines plum and vanilla notes with hints of cocoa and black olive. There's some richenss here, it just needs a few years to emerge. Try 2012-2017.",87,Nugan Family Estates 2007 McLaren Parish Vineyard Shiraz (McLaren Vale),,,,
This wine—made using fruit from 60-year-old Marsanne vines—is full bodied but crisp and reined in at the same time. Hints of toast accent citrus and melon notes that turn more lemony and lean on the finish. Could improve with 3–5 years of cellaring.,90,Paul Jaboulet Aîné 2009 Domaine de Roure Marsanne (Crozes-Hermitage),,,,
"Aromas of pear, Spanish broom, flint and Mediterranean herb emerge in the glass. The juicy, medium-bodied palate offers ripe apple, peach and lime alongside fresh acidity and a mineral vein. A hazelnut note marks the close.",90,Feudi di San Gregorio 2015  Fiano di Avellino,,,,
"Rich, ripe streaks of black cherry preserve are balanced by savory nuances of dried herb, toast and bramble in this luscious Pinot Noir. Aptly “lusty” in style, it's deeply concentrated with an unabashed fruit-forwardness, but crisp cranberry acidity and a penetrating earthiness gives it marked composure.",90,Inspire Moore 2013 Lust Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This opens with aromas of toasted oak, yellow apple skin and a confectionery note. The aromas carry over to the firm palate along with butterscotch and a mineral note but it doesn't have quite enough fruit richness to stand up to the dominant oak sensations.",87,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano 2014 Sanct Valentin Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),,,,
"This pleasing blend of Pinot Noir from estate-grown fruit is light and undeniably pretty. Rhubarb and raspberry flavors are backed with vivid acids. It's a wine from a challenging vintage, and the native yeast ferment seems to have contributed to its length and detail.",88,Patton Valley 2011 The Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This wine's concentrated dark fruit shows in the color—a vibrant dark garnet—and in the aromas of blueberry, vanilla and dried spices. The 16% alcohol is well concealed, manifesting only as wonderfully full, creamy density on the palate, magnifying the intense cola, earth and spice complexity. A pronounced peppery, black licorice note adds extra length to the finely textured finish. Drink now–2020.",95,Kaesler 2006 Old Vine Shiraz (Barossa Valley),,,,
"With 11.1% residual sugar, this is a sweet wine, but it's also a little simple. That brown sugar and honey sweetness is delicious, by definition, but the underlying flavors are a little disappointing.",85,Navarro 2006 Late Harvest Gewürztraminer (Anderson Valley),,,,
"Appealing complexities appear right from the first sniff, with a mix of rhubarb, tomato leaf, berry, cherry and plum. There is a suggestion of tanned leather, and the brambly fruit flavors carry a lemon-rind edge into a tightly framed, lightly toasty finish.",92,Domaine Serene 2013 Two Barns Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),,,,
"This is a very sweet, unctuous dessert wine, with the flavor and texture of honey. Made from Viognier, it has decadent apricot, peach, tangerine and crème brûlée notes that combine in a dense, delicious mélange.",93,Novy 2006 Oley Dessert Wine Viognier (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This easy-to-drink, medium-bodied red blends 31% Merlot, 28% Shiraz, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 16% Cabernet Franc, then adds lashings of toasty, vanilla-scented oak. The result is a supple wine redolent of plums, vanilla and baking spices that finishes soft and creamy-smooth. Ready to drink now.",88,Syan 2005 Tradition Red (Pyrenees),,,,
"True to this negociant's style, this Chardonnay offers lots of bang for the buck. It delivers true varietal character, offering flavors of pineapples, pears and oak, wrapped into a creamy texture that finishes dry and spicy.",87,Cameron Hughes 2007 Lot 108 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),,,,
"A lightweight Sauvignon Blanc that fits the standard Marlborough profile, with slightly grassy notes layered over grapefruit and pineapple flavors. Drink now.",85,Saint Clair 2007 Vicar's Choice Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"Bright and easy, this has direct aromas and flavors of red cherry and raspberry. It's light in weight, with low tannins and a short but clean finish. Drink now.",84,Wamakersvallei 2010 Bain's Way Shiraz (Wellington),,,,
"Intense and crisp, this wine concentrates great acidity and tight citrus flavors. It's zesty, bright and fresh, with a refreshing, lightly salty character. Ready to drink.",89,Les Rocailles 2016 Apremont Vieilles Vignes Jacquère (Savoie),,,,
"Dry and fashionable, this has a dusty, minerally character and high acidity that's reminiscent of a good Chablis. The cool, long vintage resulted in subtle peach, pear, pineapple and spice flavors.",90,Langtry 2006 Genevieve Vineyard Chardonnay (Guenoc Valley),,,,
"This aged Riesling is medium gold colored, with pleasant aromas of lemon peel and petrol. It is round and generous on the palate, with flavors of lemon custard and green olive tapenade. The finish is long, with lingering flavors of lemon pith.",86,Budimir 2008 Margus Margi Riesling (Župa),,,,
"The wine, unusually 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, is ripe and juicy with some smoky tannins in support. It has a finely perfumed character although touches of extraction give it a bitter edge. That should blow by, leaving an attractive fruity wine.",87,Château la Freynelle 2014  Bordeaux,,,,
"Dusty and peppery aromas alert you to the fact that this will be a lean, tight ride. The palate delivers on the promise, showing tart cherry and raspberry flavors in front of a wave of vanilla on the choppy, acidic finish. Decent fruit and clean, but lean and clipped.",83,Torre Oria 2005 Superior Tempranillo (Utiel-Requena),,,,
"Brassy in color and woody in aroma, this Chardonnay is a pleasant enough drink, offering ample weight and modest pear and citrus flavors. Drink it through 2017.",84,Angove 2014 Family Crest Chardonnay (McLaren Vale),,,,
"This opens with aromas of white spring flowers, orchard fruit and a whiff of herbs. The vibrant palate doles out green apple, citrus zest and pear alongside tangy acidity and a refined, creamy mousse.",89,Masottina 2014 Rive di Ogliano Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
"Immature now, with sweet, jammy berry fruit, currants and hard tannins, and the oak overlay hasn't been integrated yet. But there's a lot going on in this spicy, bold Zin. Give it 3–4 years.",90,Elyse 2007 Morisoli Vineyard Zinfandel (Napa Valley),,,,
"Closed at this stage, the wine has acidity, minerality and the potential of ripe pear and apricot fruit flavors. The wood is showing strongly but will integrate, while the texture promises good aging.",91,Louis Latour 2009 Les Truffières  (Puligny-Montrachet),,,,
"Dominated by the local star grape Mourvèdre, the wine is ripe, spicy and packed with fresh red-currant and strawberry fruit. It has spice, crisp acidity as well as a full rich aftertaste. Drink now.",87,Château d'Azur 2015 Bastide d'Azur Rosé (Var),,,,
"The addition of 15% Petite Sirah takes this bottling to a compelling place, showing barely ripe blackberries, animal fat, smoke, black pepper and a wild clove element on the nose. It's rich and layered on the palate, where chalky tannins support black cherry, grilled beef and mint flavors. This has the bones to last awhile.",91,Dracaena 2013 Cabernet Franc (Paso Robles),,,,
"Super-delicious, a mouthful of Chardonnay perfection. Really notable for the pure concentration of its flavors, such as fresh ripe white peach, mango, and spicy fig. Elaborately oaked, but not too much to support the huge fruit. The rich and creamy texture is a delight.",92,Clos La Chance 2001 Vanumanutagi Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"Hello alcohol and black cherry liqueur. A nicely made and compelling Syrah this is, although the alcohol is intense. The wine has mighty tannins and is very fruity, with an added note of black licorice. The peppery finish will make you want more.",88,Chatom Vineyards 2008 Syrah (Calaveras County),,,,
"Chardonnay from a hot valley in a hot vintage equals something like this. Orange peel and oak aromas, a pulpy palate and warm flavors of orange and grapefruit.",83,Siegel 2012 Crucero Reserva Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"Toasted oak integrates nicely with fresh fruit aromas. The flavors are more hidden, with subtle strawberry, black tea tannins and just enough acidity making for an even, well-priced wine.",88,Tolosa 2012 Estate Tolsosa Vineyard Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),,,,
"True to its name, this Moscato delivers musky aromas of soapy flower, honey, acacia flower and stone fruit. It shows sweet, smooth creaminess as well.",84,Risata 2011  Moscato d'Asti,,,,
"Flavor-wise, this is a huge wine, bursting with raspberries, cherries and persimmons. The texture is pure silk and satin, as light and airy as Pinot gets, yet with a ghostly weight. Drink now with your most Pinot-friendly foods.",89,Roadhouse Winery 2011 Orange Label Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Bright and easy drinking, this has delicate aromas of yellow wild flower and a whiff of pear. It's fresh and simple, offering yellow apple and a hint of citrus zest alongside crisp acidity.",86,Corte Moschina 2016 Roncathe  (Soave),,,,
"A pink sparkling wine that opens with vibrant tones of cranberry, raspberry and red rose. The feminine, floral side is indeed intense although the wine shows much more simplicity in the mouth.",84,Bortolotti NV Lagrein Brut Rosato Sparkling (Veneto),,,,
"Thick and chocolatey, this brawny wine is full bodied and richly concentrated. It is a mighty force of blackberry, blueberry and toasted oak.",88,Charles Krug 2013 Estate Grown Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"Aged nine months in 20% new French oak, this enjoyable offering brings notes of cedar, cranberry and cola. True to the vintage, the flavors are richer in style while still retaining acidity with firm, tightly coiled tannins and a mesquite filled finish. Drinking young right now, hide this one away in the cellar for a while.",88,Savage Grace 2012 Underwood Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Columbia Gorge (WA)),,,,
"Using grapes sourced from four high-quality vineyards, this shows deeply layered raspberry, cherry, cola and mushroom flavors, with no trace of the unripeness that marred some other coastal wines from this cool vintage. Drink it over the next six years before the fruit fades.",92,Benovia 2010 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
A wine that is strangely hollow with structure and juicy fruit around a hole in the center. Spice and red berry flavors are contrasted with dry tannins that may not soften.,83,Quinta do Arrobe 2012 Oculto Red (Tejo),,,,
"From the region of La Londe close to the sea, this wine is warm and ripe, with rich strawberry flavors that are almost jammy. A touch of pepper and spice calms down the freshness. Probably this wine will be better as an apéritif.",85,Château les Bormettes 2015 Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"This wine is somewhat weedy and herbal, with extracted black fruit displaying prominently on the palate. Oaky and tannic, it overwhelms somewhat, needing time in the glass to settle down.",85,Trecini 2015 Zinfandel (Rockpile),,,,
It's well-suited for supplying a big party where there are lots of different tastes to please. A soft texture and almost sweet butter and apple flavors make this a light confection.,85,Twin Arches 2012 Chardonnay (California),,,,
"A stand-out wine among Keuka Lake Vineyard's many excellent Rieslings, the Falling Man is brisk with pineapple and grapefruit flavors accented by lime zest and a distinct crushed-stone minerality. While dry in style, it's supple on the palate with a lingering mineral slick.",90,Keuka Lake Vineyards 2011 Estate Grown and Bottled Falling Man Vineyard Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This structured white displays enticing aromas of beeswax, Spanish broom, acacia and chamomile. The round, structured palate offers mature apricot, juicy nectarine peel, yellow peach and Bartlett pear, with firm acidity. Savory herb and energizing mineral sensations signal the close.",92,Cà Lojera 2012 Riserva del Lupo  (Lugana),,,,
"This has subdued aromas of French oak as well as whiffs of orchard fruit and pressed acacia flower. On the palate, oak-driven spice, toast and bitter almond take center stage while notes of citrus zest and a hint of lemon drop peak through.",86,Il Palagione 2015 Ori Riserva  (Vernaccia di San Gimignano),,,,
"Both Freixenet and its sister property Segura Viudas put out myriad Cavas in this price and quality range. This one shows cherry candy on the nose and some seltzer. The palate is balanced between sweet red fruit and citrus, while the finish is dry despite some earlier sweetness. Bouncy and nice for a Pinot Noir Cava.",87,Segura Viudas NV Aria Brut Pinot Noir (Cava),,,,
"Extracted and jammy in black cherries and black raspberries, with hints of cocoa, this wine is fully dry and balanced. It tasty through the smooth finish.",87,Amador Foothill Winery 2001 Ferrero Vineyard Zinfandel (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),,,,
"Just-ripe green pears and scented spring flowers make this a charming proposition. Underneath, a firm and concentrated body unfolds into a refreshing and long finish.",92,Weixelbaum 2012 Wahre Werte Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),,,,
Rich flavors of orange and tropical fruit are marked with brisk acidity and a touch of Champagne-like sourdough yeast. The finish is sugary and simple.,84,Rail2Rail 2010 Sur Lie Chardonnay (Monterey),,,,
"Creamy and oaky, with butterscotch and pear notes, but heavy and a bit unripe, with vegetal notes.",82,Ca' Momi 2007 Chardonnay (Sonoma County),,,,
"Bramble and green tobacco notes are part of the bouquet, as is rubbery dark fruit. The palate is smooth in feel but a little herbal and leafy, with a mix of berry fruit and mild green notes.",84,Viña Bisquertt 2006 Casa La Joya Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"Here's a “wow” wine you won't easily forget. Messorio is all Merlot, and happily delivers the softness, richness and overall opulence that we love in this noble grape variety. What elevates this particular expression and vintage is the true elegance and sophistication evident here. This is a huge wine, but it's not exaggerated and the finish is as long and smooth as they come.",99,Le Macchiole 2007 Messorio Merlot (Toscana),,,,
"Good but common as Chilean Cabs go. It's a jumbled mass of bulky fruit, raw power, sweet oak and spice. The mouthfeel is tannic, grabby and big, while the flavors of black cherry and raspberry are nice but generic. Finishes with spice and a hint of hickory. 20,000 cases produced.",86,Montes 2007 Classic Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"This is the inaugural vintage of what is intended to be the flagship wine in the Milbrandt portfolio. It has rather light fruit flavors of mixed red berries and currants, a little spice and some toasty accents from barrel aging. Decanting may help to flesh it out.",89,Milbrandt 2006 Sentinel Red Red (Wahluke Slope),,,,
"This textured, perfumed wine has citrus and apple fruits that are dominated by strong perfumes as well as fresh acidity. It needs until late 2014 to age.",85,Terra Silvestre 2013 Arinto (Tejo),,,,
"Like most Monteviejo Malbecs, this is full and extracted, with an opaque purple tint. Ripe aromas of blackberry, prune and spice cake are generous. The palate is surprisingly alive in acidity and grabby in feel. Dark toasty black-fruit flavors are plenty oaky, while coffee, mocha and chocolate flavors share space on the tannic finish. Drink through 2020.",90,Monteviejo 2012 Petite Fleur Malbec (Uco Valley),,,,
"Reduced on the nose, with blueberry, boysenberry and syrupy aromas that reflect the 55% Malbec in this Malbec-CS-Syrah blend. The palate is rich but flat, with dark flavors of black fruits, blueberrry and black licorice. Chunky and a little off the grid, but still good for a bulky wine.",87,Tamaya 2009 Reserva  Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah Red (Limarí Valley),,,,
"This is a soft style of Champagne, just hinting at the minerality often found in Chardonnays from the Côte des Blancs. It is ripe, with red apple and pear flavors, shot through with lime acidity. The aftertaste adds a more textured character.",88,Marcel Moineaux NV Brut Tradition Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Chardonnay (Champagne),,,,
"The aromas are bright and sweet, with notes of freshly cut cantaloupe, pear and candied red apple. The flavors are tangy, sweet and full, with an herbal streak that runs throughout.",87,Coyote Canyon 2016 Albariño (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"A solid value from Meridian. Satisfies for its wealth of blackberry, currant, cherry, chocolate, vanilla and spice flavors that are wrapped into rich, sturdy tannins. Finishes with a fine, crisp scour.",85,Meridian 2005 Merlot (California),,,,
"There's a touch of unripeness in this wine that shows up as a taste of green peppercorn, although it's very subtle, and the blackberry and black cherry fruit quickly washes it away. Other than that, the wine is dry and rich in tannins. Drink now.",86,Terre Rouge 2007 Monarch Mine Vineyard Syrah (Sierra Foothills),,,,
"A ripe, fruity wine with a light structure of tannins and acidity, it has some density while remaining fruity and juicy. The red cherry fruit blends into the closing acidity.",86,Domaine Chasselay 2010 Les Grands Eparcieux  (Beaujolais),,,,
"This dry estate wine is voluptuous and richly floral, with well-developed stone fruit and melon flavors. Medium-bodied, it's weighty enough to be enjoyed on its own or at the table with a wide array of foods.",88,Keller 2014 La Cruz Vineyard Pinot Gris (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"A smoky, charred nose includes notes of baking spice, chocolate and black-fruit scents. A tight, solid palate of firm tannins and oak tastes charred, spicy and ripe. On the finish, oak is out front but this has the body and depth to handle it. Drink 2018–2023.",90,Protos 2012 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"A tremendous Cabernet, authoritative and exciting. Shows a great structure of acidity and tannins, with a cedar and sweet tobacco earthiness. Yet it's also explosive in blackberries, black cherries, red and black currants and anise liqueur. A real accomplishment, and a great compliment to the high-altitude Stagecoach Vineyard, which straddles the Atlas Peak and Napa Valley appellation lines. Drink now–2016.",95,Sequoia Grove 2006 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"A balanced aromatic show of campfire smoke, purple fruit and violet-driven florals emerges on the nose of this affordable wine from Don Sebastiani & Sons. It's a little watery on the palate, but then shows a nice array of blackberry fruit, black pepper, graphite earthiness and a vanilla finish.",85,Gunsight Rock 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"Ripe, jammy fruit, tart acidity and oak are pretty much what you get here. It's pretty simple and perhaps should be better than what it is.",84,Burt Street Cellars 2011 Syrah (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"This low-production Pinot doesn't leave much to the imagination. It's all about fruit. Cherries, raspberries, currants, cola, root beer and pepper flood the mouth, housed in a crisply dry, savory mouthfeel. Could develop bottle complexities over the next six years.",90,Hug 2007 Boulder Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),,,,
"While still young and fruity, this has the potential to be a complex, long-lived wine. It boasts stone fruit and white flower aromas, a tight structure and a hint of sweetness. Drink from 2018.",93,Domaine Albert Mann 2011 Furstentum Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"The wine opens with a dark, saturated color that is tinged by hints of brown and garnet. The nose offers super-ripe aromas of dried plums, prunes, figs, tar, old leather, black licorice and dark spice. It's an evolved and intense wine that should be consumed within the next year or so.",85,Querciavalle 2005 Millennium Losi Riserva  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"With wood-based aromas, this is currently a closed, taut wine. It has green fruits and minerality; it's nervy and under tension. The acidity is crisp while very light in character. This is for aging.",93,Domaine Jean-Paul et Benoît Droin 2010 Montée de Tonnerre Premier Cru  (Chablis),,,,
"Not your standard blackberry-and-oak bomb: there's zing and snap, and even a whiff of mint to the nose. Deep and full-flavored, with chocolate, coffee and some earthiness. It has the length and supple tannins to qualify it as a winner. Quite pure and focused.",91,Farella-Park 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Ripe raspberry and strawberry notes are followed by mild tones of vanilla spice, rum cake and tobacco. This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese has a clean, smooth mouthfeel.",87,Motta 2010 Pievi  (Bolgheri),,,,
"This unusual five-grape blend includes Chardonnay, Sémillon, Sauvignon Blanc, Viognier and Muscat. It maintains a sense of focus, with the grassy, herbal character of Sauv Blanc and Sémillon commanding most of the attention. It's stiff, woody (rather than oaky) and herbal. Try it with fresh goat cheese.",87,Tinhorn Creek 2014 Oldfield Series 2Bench White (Okanagan Valley),,,,
"Given the difficulties of this cool vintage, this is an excellent wine with dark berry, herb, spice and vanilla aromas. It's firm on the palate like most 2008s, with flavors of blackberry, chocolate and oak spice leading to an earthy tasting finish. Drink now–2016.",90,Viñas del Cenit 2008 Cenit Old Vines Tempranillo (Tierra del Viños de Zamora),,,,
"This small appellation is an enclave in the middle of Côtes de Provence. Its style is very similar and this wine, named after the owner, is a structured blend of Syrah and Grenache. The wine from organic grapes has a pepper and spice edge over the crisp acidity of the red fruits. Drink now.",89,Château la Calisse 2016 Patricia Ortelli Rosé (Coteaux Varois en Provence),,,,
"This rich, fruity Cabernet comes from one of the higher mountain regions in Dry Creek Valley. It's enormously concentrated in blackberry, black currant and oak flavors, with the briary, peppery note so often found in Dry Creek reds. Fairly tannic, it leaves a trail of astringency after you swallow. Good, if a little rustic. Give it three or four years to come around.",90,Gustafson Family 2007 Watchtower Vineyard Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"This is a dry wine, although still retaining those enticing honey flavors that are typical of Loire Chenin Blanc. Apple and ripe pear flavors are laced with intense acidity. Its delicate white-flower perfumes are ethereal. Drink now.",91,Clos du Gaimont 2016  Vouvray,,,,
"One of the Chronic brothers' most beloved bottlings, this blend of 46% Syrah, 27% Grenache, 22% Petite Sirah, 3% Mourvèdre and 2% Tannat shows vibrant and fresh aromas of boysenberries, cola and lavender on the nose. It's easy to enjoy once sipped, with red currant, red plum and cranberry flavors gaining depth from oregano and marjoram herbs.",88,Chronic Cellars 2014 Sofa King Bueno Red (Paso Robles),,,,
Subtle aromas of dark fruit and leather give this wine a measured and timid first approach. The intensity builds with each swirl of the glass and the wine shows that typical Sangiovese Grosso tightness and acidity on the close.,89,La Collina dei Lecci 2007 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"Soothing menthol and green floral notes lend vibe to crisp sour-cherry flavors in this bold, penetrating Bordeaux-style blend. It's rich and brawny on the palate with juicy, primary cherry and plum flavors, yet streaked with delicate touches of oak and earth.",90,Anthony Nappa 2010 Dieci Red (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"This is extremely fruity, with an exotic bouquet of blueberry, cardamom, nutmeg and earth aromas. It feels smooth, collected and fairly rich, with savory, lightly baked flavors of black fruit. The finish remains savory, where graham cracker sweetness and roasted qualities dominate.",90,Clos Mont-Blanc 2009 Xipella Red (Catalunya),,,,
"This is a layered and complex estate-driven wine. Its firm, sizable tannin foundation promises longevity and enviable structure, while allowing for a plush, lush exuberance of cherry clafoutis, cardamom and salted caramel. Enjoy best 2022 through 2029.",94,Reuling Vineyard 2014 Reuling Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"You want soft, cult-style, wildly delicious Napa Cabernet? Here it is. The personal vision of Jeremy Nickel, of the Far Niente and Nickel & Nickel dynasty, this is rich and delicious in blackberry compote, black currant, chocolate, anise and sweet oak flavors. Blended with a few drops of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec, this bottling now establishes itself at the forefront of Napa's most important Cabernets.",96,The Vineyard House 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Beautifully ripe notes of yellow pear, even floral overtones, dance above the glass. The palate unfolds in the same friendly, floral, light-footed fashion. Lightness, freshness and flavor are all reminiscent of a flower meadow in spring. A lovely, delicate wine with well-hidden depth.",90,Artner 2015 Klassik Grüner Veltliner (Carnuntum),,,,
"Aragonês (Tinta Roriz or Tempranillo) is given intense power in the Alentejo. It has sold fruits, black cherry and spice flavors, with a big shoulder of tannins and vivid acidity. A wine for aging—3 to 4 years.",90,Herdade da Malhadinha Nova 2007 Aragonês da Peceguina Aragonês (Alentejano),,,,
"With ripe fruits and solid tannins, this is going to be a rich wine. It has plenty of acidity to balance this richness. At the same time, the tannins are going to allow it to age well. Drink from 2023.",92,Domaine Rossignol-Février Père et Fils 2015 Carelle sous la Chapelle Premier Cru  (Volnay),,,,
"Made from traditional Portuguese varieties, this is one of the best California Port-style wines out there, which is no surprise coming as it does from sweet wine specialist Quady. It's tremendously rich and sweet in chocolate truffle and blackberry-infused flavors, with near-perfect acidity and tannins for balance. A great success at a good price for a full, not a half, bottle.",94,Quady NV Batch 88 Starboard Red (California),,,,
"A slightly green edge adheres to the zesty yellow grapefruit notes on the nose, the palate is light-bodied but fizzes with freshness and crunchy acidity. Drink soon.",89,Tegernseerhof 2014 Ried Steinertal Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),,,,
"This wine is 90% Syrah and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. Aromas of plum, smoke, orange peel and dried fruit are followed by a sweet full-bodied palate. It packs a big wallop but could use a bit more acid to balance out the abundance of fruit.",87,Underground Wine Project 2014 Idle Hands Red (Red Mountain),,,,
"An aroma like charcoal and fennel leads to concentrated smoke and black-pepper flavors and a taut, tannic texture before more generous nuances like black cherry and savory lentils kick in. It's a fascinating wine that develops more layers and complexity as it breathes. Best after 2019.",92,Cedarville 2013 Estate Bottled Syrah (El Dorado),,,,
"This wine, which hails from the Napa side of the sprawling Carneros appellation, is somewhat heavy and full-bodied for a Pinot Noir. Yet it's dry in style and the tannins are light and silky. It might improve with a year or two in the bottle.",88,Artesa 2011 Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros),,,,
"The palate on this Tempranillo has smacking acids that create crisp flavors of raspberry and red plum, and there's a pinch of oaky vanilla for counterbalance. Overall this is juicy, fresh and simple.",86,Evohé 2011 Viñas Viejas Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra Ribera del Gállego-Cinco Villas),,,,
"This is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Malbec from both the Sonoma Valley and Alexander Valley appellations, that works in its big, broad and tannic approach to ripeness and bold flavor. Plum, cranberry and currant provide fruit as black olive plays on the back of the palate.",87,Arrowood 2013 Proprietary Red (Sonoma County),,,,
"From the rocky Stagecoach Vineyard atop Atlas Peak, this Cabernet is hearty in tannins and built to age through 2020, the dense black berry and cherry fruit flavors needing time to mature.

"La Fornace offers the kind of Brunello that will make you wish you bought a second bottle. It opens with a bright and cheerful bouquet shaped by various shadings of black fruit and exotic spice. In the mouth, it is still tight and firm so give it a few more years of bottle aging.",92,La Fornace 2006  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
A light but flavorful wine with citrus and green-apple aromas and flavors. A mild chalkiness shows on the palate and oak adds some smoke and spice to the picture. Finishes with an herb note.,84,Barkan 1998 Reserve Chardonnay (Galil),,,,
"This structured wine benefits from the rich fruitiness of the vintage. Based in Morgon, the producer has vines on steep slopes, resulting in structured wines with firm tannins as well as generous fruits. Drink from 2018.",88,Domaine de Leyre-Loup 2015  Morgon,,,,
"This is a fresh Pinot Noir with plenty of crisp red fruits and soft tannins. It's all about fruitiness, with a character that demands to be drunk now.",85,Vignerons de Buxy 2011 Clos Jus Premier Cru  (Givry),,,,
"An onion skin pink is an attractive start to this fresh, red fruited wine. It is crisp, but not bone dry, having a soft texture. There is a fine balance of acidity of fruit, giving a light-bodied wine good as an apéritif.",87,Nicolas Feuillatte NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne),,,,
"A bright and lifted three-grape blend with red berry, bright plum and mild oak aromas. The feel is firm but round, with raspberry, plum, pepper and other dry spice flavors.

"Martin Mittelbach rolls out this intense, concentrated wine, which packs spice, ripe pineapple and apricots and a final floral character that fills the mouth. A wine to age for at least four years. Screwcap.",93,Tegernseerhof 2008 Höhereck Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),,,,
"For the second year running, this bottling is a superb Zinfandel. It's as rich and ripe as they get, bursting with fresh raspberries, cherries and mocha, and that briary, brambly quality of wild forest nettles. Yet it's thoroughly dry, with thick, refined tannins. Beautiful now for its effusive fruit, the wine should slowly slide over the next six years.",92,JR Wine 2008 George's Vineyard Zinfandel (Napa Valley),,,,
"Half Merlot and half Cabernet Sauvignon. The Merlot saves the day, rescuing the underripe Cab with rich flavors of cherries and red plums. Oak adds the usual notes of sweet buttered toast and spice. Drink now.",88,Coghlan 2009 Spessartite on Quartz Fusion Red (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Here's a fragrant and fresh expression of Grillo that shows sharp, green tones of Granny Smith apple, kiwi, cut grass and lemon soda. The wine is clean and zesty, and will make your mouth pucker.",87,Feudo Disisa 2010 Grillo (Sicilia),,,,

"Made from fifty-year old Sangiovese and Ciliegiolo vines, this wine has aromas of violet, cherry and earth with whiffs of tobacco leaf and smoke.

"This spent about a year in 30% new oak, and some portion was American. Those aggressive scents and flavors still dominate, with the typical vanilla and pickle-barrel highlights. More bottle age is in order for maximum enjoyment. At the moment the fruit is primary and the barrel notes not entirely integrated. Drink after 2020.",89,Eola Hills 2014 Barrel Select Reserve Pinot Noir (Oregon),,,,
"Dark, oaky and fiery on the nose, but soft and globular in the mouth, with raisin and prune flavors. The finish is heavy and dark, but severely raisiny. This is a bit overripe.",81,Battle Axe 2010 Malbec (Argentina),,,,
"This big, ripe wine is dominated by Alicante Bouschet. Between the tannins and the dense black fruit, the wine is concentrated and generous. Perfumed, full of fruit and a good line of acidity, this rich wine is ready to drink.",92,Espaço Rural 2013 Poento Reserva Red (Alentejano),,,,
"With fairly muted fruit flavors and a hint of green pepper, this lighter-bodied and easy-drinking wine will pair well with most meat or chicken entrées. Flash-pasteurized and mevushal, this is a blend of 50% Cab, 30% Merlot and 20% Shiraz.",84,Recanati 2006 Yasmin Red Kosher Red (Galilee),,,,
"This raspberry-flavored wine is soft and ripe. While it is fruity, it also has a nutty character that gives it a rich taste. It's dry and in a style that will make it better with food than by itself.",85,Wines & Winemakers 2015 Casa Ermelinda Freitas Monte de Baía Rosé (Península de Setúbal),,,,
"Established in the early 70s by Ed O'Keefe Jr., this Michigan winery remains in the family to this day and maintains the founding father's focus on producing wines from 100% vinifera grapes in a region where hybrids might be the easier option. Perseverance pays off in this delightfully balanced dry Riesling that seamlessly blends juicy peach, pineapple rind and a vein of talc-dusted citrus. Texturally round and soft, with a peach-fuzz feel, this is a veritable steal for the price.",90,Chateau Grand Traverse 2013 Dry Riesling (Old Mission Peninsula),,,,
"This wine's aromas are surprisingly reserved for the variety, with faint peach, lime and mandarin orange notes. It's just off dry on the palate, with zippy fruit flavors. It delivers enjoyment despite its muted aromatic expression.",87,Nine Hats 2016 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Hearty and thick aromas of raspberry, mulberry and sugar plums meet with a touch of bay leaf on the nose of this bottling from a famous vineyard. Woody and dark red fruits show on the sip, with juniper and sour cherry flavors most prominent.",91,Testarossa 2015 Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Lemon shave ice and hints of white peach make for crisp, clean, and pinpoint precision on the nose, which trends toward ripe with a butter element in the background. The palate shows citrus energy, from salty lemons to lime zest, with a touch of browned butter and cream throughout the sip.",89,Rendarrio Vineyards 2013 Baja-Ha Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Toast, espresso, coffee bean and dark berry aromas emerge on this firmly structured red. It's still very much on its oak, showing unripe sour cherry backed up by oak-driven spice including vanilla and coconut alongside grippy tannins.",88,Ellena 2011 Ascheri  (Barolo),,,,
"Just like this wine has lost its initial red color, so too has its flavor changed. Now maturing fast, it conveys flavors of leather and acidity along with a dry edge that may be a sign of age. It's delicious, but drink the wine now.",87,Château des Annereaux 2008  Lalande de Pomerol,,,,
"Here's a rich, soft, gently approachable red wine for big beef stews and barbecue. Full-bodied and dry, it's power-packed in blackberries, currants, carob, violets and raisins, with a coat of sweet smoky oak. Drink now through 2010.",89,Zina Hyde Cunningham 2004 Cépage Red (Lake County),,,,
"Expensive, yes, but defines the soft, luxurious modern style of extreme deliciousness. Made with a drop of Petit Verdot that seems to add depth, the wine is fantastically rich in blackberry, blueberry and cherry jam, chocolate and sweet oak. The tannins are a wonder, and there's just enough acidity to give a balanced tang. Will it age? Yes, but for how long is the question. Beautiful now and through 2019.",94,M by Michael Mondavi 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"One of the best dessert wines from central Italy, this is marked by muffa nobile, or  “noble rot.” It's opulent and dense, with golden apricot, honey and a delicate veil of muskiness.",94,Barberani 2008 Calcaia  (Orvieto Classico Superiore),,,,

"There aren't many white wines coming out of Langhorne Creek, but this Verdelho is a good one, offering crisp, citrusy notes of pear and pineapple, medium body and a clean, refreshing finish. Drink now.",87,Bleasdale 2009 Potts' Catch Verdelho (Langhorne Creek),,,,
"This finely made wine has weight and firm tannins, along with intense acidity. Faiveley owns 12 acres of this premier cru which produces structured wines with fruit tannins and smoky fruit. At the end, the wood aging gives a burnt edge that needs to soften. Drink from 2017.",92,Domaine Faiveley 2011 Les Cazetiers Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),,,,
"Early on, this smells young and a lot like latex mixed with candied plum and red-berry fruits; give it time and it settles on jammy red-fruit aromas as well as a wide-bodied palate. Plum, cherry and raspberry flavors all vie for attention, while the finish is fresh, fruity and lively. Drink through 2017.",90,Clos Figueras 2012 Serras del Priorat Red (Priorat),,,,
"This wine includes all five traditional red-Bordeaux varieties, Merlot the most dominant, resulting in tart Bing cherry and cassis flavors. It doesn't hold back on tannin or power, showing grippy persistence on the finish.",90,AuburnJames 2012 Phaeton Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"There's lemon curd and apple in this straightforward, light Chardonnay. Cradled in oak and vanilla, it is mid-weight in both texture and body, and a good value for the price.",84,Sebastiani 2012 Chardonnay (Sonoma County),,,,
"Ros'Aura is one of the most delightful rosatos to come from southern Italy. It's a concentrated bright pink color, with fresh aromas of wild berry and pink grapefruit.",89,Feudi di San Gregorio 2011 Ros'Aura Aglianico (Irpinia),,,,
"Lean and angular right now, showing hints of mint and chocolate—the oak sticks out a bit over the tart cherry flavors.",87,Sebastiani 1996 Cherryblock Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"Characteristic lime-leaf and lemon notes marry with blossoms and grass. The palate, however, is less focused, starting bright, tapering to flatness in the middle, and finishing on the richer side.",87,Astrolabe 2016 Province Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"Some young-tasting, tart raspberry fruit is front and center here, with the character of hard candy. It hits the palate quickly and stays there, without showing much else. More bottle age may help to unwind this a bit.",86,City Winery Chicago 2012 Hyland Vineyard Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Shows the brilliantly clean, racy acidity of Monterey that provides backbone and firmness to the citrus, peach, wildflower and mineral flavors. With a hint of diesel, it's a lovely California Riesling at a great price.",88,Castle Rock 2008 Riesling (Monterey County),,,,
"Vanilla, pencil eraser and red-berry aromas set up a fresh, juicy, healthy feeling palate. Flavors of oak, vanilla, berry fruits and plum finish with additional vanilla flavors and woodspice. As a whole, this is bright, zesty and oaky, even for a wine that's more than five years old.",88,Casa Primicia 2008 Gr  (Rioja),,,,
"Lots of rich, layered black cherry and currant fruit in this dry Cabernet, which was blended with some Cab Franc and Petite Verdot. There are also interesting notes of mushrooms beginning to emerge as the wine picks up bottle age. The finish, though, is simple despite some firm tannins, and it's hard to see the wine going anywhere, so drink up.",87,Star Lane Vineyard 2009 Star Lane Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),,,,
"Weight and a mealy character combine with bath soap aromas on the nose. This is pulpy in feel, with flavors of generic citrus and lychee. The finish is fresh at first and then turns hollow.",83,Fat Gaucho 2012 Torrontés (Mendoza),,,,
"This Amarone has ripe blackberry aromas, with hints of raisin and spice. The palate shows black cherry, black pepper and prune notes. It has tight tannins and fresh acidity, but needs time to unwind and develop; drink after 2016.",90,Farina 2010  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,,,,
"Opens with an appealing bouquet of dark cherry and chocolate, cedar and leather accents. In the mouth simple berry flavors sporting wood and leather accents take over. Finishes with tart cherry notes and moderate length.",84,Vasari 1998  Chianti Colli Aretini,,,,
"This shows pristine qualities, with white flower, citrus, peach and honey notes. The density it imparts on the palate is also impressive and creamy.",88,Baglio del Cristo di Campobello 2011 Lalùci Grillo (Sicilia),,,,
"Made by Adelaida's winemaker Jeremy Weintraub, this bottling shows asphalt, concentrated violets and lilacs, black peppercorns and dried blueberry on the nose. Similar elements arise on the dynamically dark palate, along with black tobacco, boysenberry, leather and beef-char flavors. The structure is strong but not in the way.",93,Site 2012 Bien Nacido Vineyard Syrah (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"Always a dense and concentrated wine, this new vintage also reveal rich fruit, blackberry and plum. Combined with dark tannins and layers of spice from wood aging, it's a structured wine that finishes with fresh, fruity acidity. Drink from 2018.",92,Clos Troteligotte 2014 K-Or Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"Aged in steel, this is a bright, fruit-driven wine that has red fruits and soft tannins. It has a crisp touch of acidity at the end. Ready to drink now.",85,Sanguinhal 2015 Cerejeiras Tinto Red (Lisboa),,,,
"An outstanding Cabernet that shows its pedigreed origin in every respect. The aroma is profound with black currants, flavors deep and concentrated, and tannins as smooth and complex as Napa can produce. So beautiful now, it's hard to resist drinking it, but this lovely wine should improve for a decade, slowly developing in the bottle.",95,B Cellars 2009 Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),,,,
"This single-block, one-barrel reserve is the best of the 2010 reserve Pinots from Coeur de Terre. It's medium ripe, with pretty accents of rose petals and milk chocolate, around raspberry fruit. Showing well already, it's a wine to drink young.",88,Coeur de Terre 2010 Abby's Block Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
Candied red-fruit aromas are friendly but not that concentrated or dark. This medium-bodied Monastrell shows mild red-fruit flavors of cherry and plum. Candied plum and cherry flavors finish it off.,88,Telmo Rodríguez 2013 Al-muvedre Tinto Monastrell (Alicante),,,,
"The wine is fermented in steel tanks and aged for a few months in neutral oak barrels. The result is dry, tart and complex, with gooseberry, green grass and white pepper flavors, enriched with hints of golden mangoes and vanilla.",89,Dutton Estate 2012 Dutton Ranch Kylie's Cuvée Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Classic and restrained, with herbal components and a firm tannic backbone, this is a finely made wine at a respectable price that's easy to enjoy and share. Savory currant, leather and oak define it best.",88,Robert Mondavi 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Bone dry, minerally and brisk in mouthwatering acidity, this has subtle yet rich flavors of tropical fruit, citrus, green apple and honey. It shows real elegance and complexity; drink now–2016.",94,Joseph Phelps 2010 Freestone Vineyards Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"This shows ample mushroomy complexity without showing any evidence of tiring. Hints of shiitakes add richness and depth to the black cherry flavors, while a dried-mushroom dustiness adds length and interest to the finish. Drink now–2020.",91,Brancott 2012 T Letter Series Pinot Noir (Marlborough),,,,
"A whiff of pine needle runs through this wine, accenting its tight and trim red berry fruit. It's a mix of three clones that were aged in one quarter new French oak, which brings notes of vanilla and toast to its smooth finish.",90,Fullerton 2015 Croft Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Richly tannic but ripe, with red-fruit notes of rhubarb and raspberry up front. Then the palate turns dark and savory, adding hints of espresso, olive and asphalt. Try it in 2017, by which time it should've settled down and become more integrated.",89,Fox Creek 2014 Shiraz (McLaren Vale),,,,
"Bold and fruity, this is a black-currant-flavored wine with soft tannins. In this vintage, the crisp acidity has also kicked in to give the wine its lift and to balance the ripe flavors. The wine is for the medium term. Drink from 2021.",92,Château Batailley 2014  Pauillac,,,,
"Jumpy foxy berry aromas get this Garnacha going. Raw hard tannins smack down with ferocity, while this tastes of candied plum, salt, chocolate and something oddly artificial. Dry scratchy tannins make for a rough finish.",83,Marqués de Montañana 2015 Selección Especial Garnacha (Calatayud),,,,
"Dan Lee's annual stainless-steel release is quite dynamic on the nose, with lime blossom, red apple, soda and freshly cut kiwi notes. The flavors are light, bright and intriguing, trending toward the green-fruit side of the spectrum, with apple and pear cider, pomelo rind and a touch of quinine.",88,Morgan 2014 Metallico Un-Oaked Chardonnay (Monterey),,,,
"Meyer-lemon curd, melted butter and salted peach show on the nose of this bottling from the Hahn family team. Sour lemon, tangerine skins and sharp green-apple flavors show on the sip, as does a savory salty element.",89,Lucienne 2014 Lone Oak Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Reddish-orange in color, this is a high-toned, citrus-laden wine that retains fresh flavors of grapefruit and mandarin orange. It stays crisp and dry on the palate, with just a tiny suggestion of its time in neutral oak. Pomegranate and a tang of sour cherry finish things off.",87,Gustafson Family 2014 Heritage Tree Vineyard Estate Rosé of Syrah (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
A structured and concentrated wine that is packed with tannins. It does have some black fruit under this dry structure although the wine misses out on richness. It will be ready to drink from 2017.,88,Domaine de Leyre-Loup 2013 Réserve Louis Leyre-Loup Le Regard de l'Ange  (Morgon),,,,
"Sourced from the Martinelli family's Charles Vineyard out on the coast, this is a gorgeously rich and balanced white wine, whole-cluster fermented and given just less than a quarter of new French oak. Pretty, floral aromas of orange blossom pique the nose before a compelling combination of salty pretzel, ginger and lemon custard layer over a mountain of structured acidity.",94,Benovia 2013 Chardonnay (Fort Ross-Seaview),,,,
"Gritty and earthy up front, with generic plum scents, this feels hard, tannic and in need of more body. Roasted, oaky flavors of hickory and saucy plum finish dry, woody and hollow.",85,Viña el Aromo 2012 Private Reserve Merlot (Maule Valley),,,,
"Lots of sweet, smoky, vanilla-accented oak in this Cab, but the blackberry and cherry fruit is enormous, easily capable of handing the wood influence. It's a flashy Cabernet, ripe and smooth and softly delicious. Seems best now and for the next few years.",92,Jada Vineyard & Winery 2010 WCS Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"This wine is an oak bomb, from the wood smoke and charcoal aromas to the heavily roasted toasted flavors and woody tannins that make for a drying finish.",84,Predator 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),,,,
"Dark gold, almost chartreuse, this blend of Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc has cider-like aromas at first and a slight effervescence. Balanced, it's interesting, a heady taste of apple and pear and almond that finishes clear and tight. It's a fine choice for fall and wintertime desserts but also as an apéritif.",91,Miraflores 2010 Botricelli Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (California),,,,
"A wisp of a wine that's dark-salmon in color, this is made entirely from Grenache grapes grown near the town of Davis. It's dry, light and fun, offering a strawberry and watermelon fruitiness, with a trace of spice on the end.",87,Rock Wall 2011 Uncle Roget's Grenache Rosé (Yolo County),,,,
"This is the winery's reserve, a lot and barrel selection. Nicely layered, it rolls through strawberry, raspberry, light chocolate and sandalwood, tosses in a hint of cola, and smooths out through a medium-long finish. Nothing is heavy-handed, though in this excellent vintage a bit more concentration would be welcome.",89,Dobbes Family Estate 2012 Patricia's Cuvée Pinot Noir (Oregon),,,,
"Aromas of coconut, tilled soil and ripe plum lead the nose. The dense, round palate offers toasted oak, chocolate, ripe blackberry and oak-driven spice. Drink soon.",87,La Vis 2012 Rover Teroldego (Vigneti delle Dolomiti),,,,
"This opens with leathery aromas of earthy plum and red-berry fruits. It's medium in body and intensity, with racy, tomatoey acidity. Baked flavors are a bit stalky and echo the nose, while this gran reserva finishes ripe and easy. Drink through 2021.",91,CVNE 2009 Cune Gran Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"The Sullivan designate mixes Pommard, Wädenswil and Dijon 777 clones, which were aged 10 months in 30% new French oak. It's similar to the winery's Dardis bottling in terms of the balance between fruit and herbs, though here there is a bit of a hole in the midpalate. Otherwise, it's a friendly mix of black cherry, cola and chocolate: forward and open.",89,Fairsing 2014 Sullivan Pinot Noir,,,,
"Dark in color and slightly bashful at first, this blend of Syrah, Sangiovese and Merlot shows strength in its solid structure, with bright aromas of red cherry, blackberry, leather and cured meat. It would pair perfectly with stewed game meat, like wild boar.",88,I Giusti e Zanza 2009 Nemorino Red (Toscana),,,,
"This bright and nicely layered Chianti Classico opens with characteristic Sangiovese aromas of forest fruit and blue flower followed by leather and tobacco. Since the wine spends many months in oak, the finish is soft and spicy.",88,Cantalici L'Antica Fornace di Ridolfo 2007 Cantalici  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"While the aromas of this rich wine suggest a barnyard character, on the palate it is ripe and still young. Yellow fruits dominate with light acidity and a generous structure. At the end, the wine is full, opulent and needing to age. Drink from 2017.",87,Ramos-Pinto 2013 Duas Quintas Reserva White (Douro),,,,

"Dark pink-orange in color, this pungent 100% varietal wine was given no time in oak, allowing its crisp orange peel, grapefruit and cherry flavors to shine. Moderate acidity underlies the simple finish.",88,Pedroncelli 2016 Dry Rosé of Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"This is made in a lighter, breezier style, but there's nothing light about the flavors, which suggest raspberries, grilled Canadian bacon, softened cola and smoky sandalwood. Gentle and easy, with a silky feel, this shows lots of class and elegance. Ready to drink.",91,Clos La Chance 2009 Erwin Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"Opens with minerally, almost metallic aromas, along with rubber and berry mixed in. Feels fresh and ready, with plum, berry and chocolaty flavors. Finishes with a smooth feel, but maybe it could use a bit more cut and tannic structure. A wine that falls squarely in the middle zone.",85,Tierra Prometida 2008 Clasico Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Lime and apple blossoms, gray slate, wet chalk, a touch of struck match and an ever-so-slight lemon-butter element converge on a wondrous nose in this Rajat Parr-Sashi Moorman winner. Once sipped, the tight citrus hits first, but then come approachable white flowers, golden pears and a touch of ghee and vanilla on the back end.",95,Sandhi 2013 Mt. Carmel Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"This seems a bit oaky on the nose, where scents of baking spices and cedar dominate, but those elements are balanced out on the palate, where blackberries, plums and black currants comes to the fore. This is a full-bodied, ripe-textured wine worth a look. Drink now–2025.",90,Fox Creek 2014 Three Blocks Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale),,,,
"Light cherry colored, this wine displays aromas of herbs, cherry and melon. It drinks off dry (6.6g/L residual sugar) but lacks the acid to support the sugar.",84,Waterbrook 2014 Sangiovese Rosé (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Fresh and vibrantly floral on the nose and palate, this lovely white from the musqué clone imparts full-bodied, voluptuous layers of pineapple and grapefruit rind, lingering long on the finish.",92,Chalk Hill 2015 Musque Sauvignon Blanc (Chalk Hill),,,,
"This is a lovely Brunello with black cherry, plum, smoke, bacon, leather and a drying touch of crushed mineral on the nose. It is rich and concentrated, with a slightly sweet-smelling bouquet. The mouthfeel is compact, tight and polished—but there is excellent length too.",94,Castello Romitorio 2007  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Warm, ripe and rounded, this is a soft and attractive wine. It has touches of wood as well as some firm tannins that are embedded in the soft texture. It's a wine that will develop quickly and well. Drink from 2016.",88,Domaine Roger Belland 2011  Santenay,,,,
"With 24% Cabernet Franc, this is a perfumed wine packed with juicy fruit and a fine smoky character. It offers black currant flavors and youthful spiciness. Drink from 2019.",87,Château Haut la Pointe 2014  Côtes de Bourg,,,,
"Hugely ripe Merlot is at the core of this rich wine. It is opulent, rounded and packed with dark plum-juice flavors. It verges on too much, too rich and too generous. What redeems it is the Bordeaux structure and final dry aftertaste.",87,Château Peyfaures 2010 Dame de Coeur  (Bordeaux Supérieur),,,,
Aromas of tobacco and spice are light and reserved. The palate offers tangy cherry flavors that persist on the finish.,87,William Grassie 2013 Libération Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Far better known as a Pinot Noir producer, Roessler has released this dry Riesling from 25-year-old vines, and it's a terrifically interesting, distinctive California white wine. At 4 years of age, it's bone dry, showing crisp, vibrant Anderson Valley acidity, and is showing the oily, diesel, peach, honeysuckle and hazelnut flavors of a maturing, Alsatian-style Riesling. Should continue to develop bottle complexity for another decade.",90,Roessler 2004 Wiley Vineyard Riesling (Anderson Valley),,,,
"A blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon, this rosé carries notes of unripe strawberry, basil and cracked pepper.",82,The Boneyard 2014 An Unrefined Rosé Wine Rosé (Shenandoah Valley),,,,
"This textured, ripe wine shows the potential of Chardonnay in the Beaujolais region. The 2.5 acres of vines average seven years in age, so still have a lot of time to mature. Still, the wine has a tight, mineral character balanced by yellow and white fruits as well as refreshing final acidity. Drink now.",90,Domaine Lathuilière-Gravallon 2014 Roche Noire  (Beaujolais Blanc),,,,
"A really good wine for the price, this offers a dark color and varietal aromas of black cherry, black olive and faint dried herbs. Next it layers handsome oak on the rich and fruity flavors. The texture is quite dense without being heavy; while somewhat tannic the mouthfeel is not drying.",88,Dark Horse 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),,,,
"Richly wood-aged, this is a serious white wine. With spice and light toast allied to the ripe tropical and yellow fruits, it needs aging. Juicy acidity cuts through the full body, giving a lift of citrus to the rounded, opulent fruitiness. Drink from 2016.",92,Quinta da Alorna 2012 Marquesa de Alorna Reserva Branco White (Tejo),,,,

"This wine is rich, full and densely concentrated. With wood aging not far away, it is still toasty, offering weighty ripe fruit that shows great potential. This impressive wine is produced by the joint venture between the Symington Family and Bordeaux consultant Bruno Prats. Drink from 2020.",93,Prats & Symington LDA 2014 Chryseia Red (Douro),,,,
"This wine, aged in stainless steel barrels, offers muted berry fruit, somewhat masked by aromas of rubber tire and plastic. The finish is short and slightly bitter.",84,Oak Knoll 2012 Dion Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Opaque black to the eye, this is a massive, high-alcohol, syrupy Garnacha that is more like Port than dry wine. Aromas of prune and raisin dominate, while the palate is thick as molasses, with gummy, raisiny flavors that finish with heady notes of coffee and chocolate syrup. At 16% ABV, and with outlandish weight and stickiness, this isn't what you'd call a food-friendly table wine.",85,Atalaya 2011 Alaya Garnacha (Almansa),,,,
"A blend of Grenache, Carignan and Mourvèdre, this is a driven by its bright black cherry flavors, although there are enough spicy, savory notes to add complexity. It's medium-bodied, with crisp acids and firm tannins, making it a candidate to match with rare beef or lamb.",86,Jules 2006 Red (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"After 21 months in 50% new French oak and a few years in bottle, this Shiraz (it contains traces of Mataro, Viognier and Marsanne) is dominated on the nose by graham crackers and vanilla. The fruit surges forward on the palate, bringing plummy, meaty flavors to the fore. This is fuller bodied than most Yarra Valley Shirazes, with a plush mouthfeel and a long, warm, spicy finish.",93,Yarra Yering 2010 Dry Red Wine No. 2 Shiraz (Yarra Valley),,,,
"Made entirely with Trebbiano and vinified in oak, this opens with aromas of mature orchard fruit, citrus, chopped herb and a whiff of toast. The linear, rather lean palate offers toasted almond, coffee, oak and green pear.",87,Pieve de' Pitti 2013 Tribiana Trebbiano (Toscana),,,,
"Strawberry and herbal aromas are decent but a bit green. This has a jammy feel, with basic berry flavors that finish minty but fresh. Overall, this is a middle-of-the-road Malbec.",85,Familia Cecchin 2012 Made with Organic Grapes Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Spine tingling grapefruit acidity adds edge to this otherwise plump, juicy semi-dry Riesling. Sunny yellow plum and tangerine flavors are sunny but fresh, wrapping up briskly on the finish. Drink now through 2019.",88,Karl Kaspar 2015 Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Roasted black fruits, animal notes and a strong whiff of black olive make for a wild and wooly bouquet. The palate on this Carignan is direct and firm, with exotic berry flavors, herbal hints and well-applied oak. Blueberry notes and bold acidity push the finish. Drink through 2017.",89,Meli 2011 Carignan (Maule Valley),,,,
"Pale in color with an orange rim, this transparent, very varietal wine offers aromas of strawberry, herb, cherry, sassafras and cola. The flavors are light and elegant but linger.",86,Cloudveil 2013 Pinot Noir (Oregon),,,,
"This wine is a blend of Sangiovese (65%) and Barbera. Cranberry, raspberry and baking spice aromas are followed by generous tart fruit flavors with an electric jolt of acid. The acid is quite bracing to have on its own. Pair it with pasta with a red sauce.",90,Almquist 2010 Garagiste Rosso Red (Washington),,,,
"A stunning Syrah, with a bit of Petite Sirah that seems to provide darkness, tannins and structure. Marked with black pepper aromas, it's extraordinarily rich in blackberry, blueberry and mocha flavors, with a mushroomy earthiness and sweet smoky oak influences. Full-bodied and dense now, it wants at least 3–5 years to come around.",93,Rusack 2007 Ballard Canyon Estate Syrah (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Generous in brambly wild raspberry fruit and leather, this lush bottling has peppery spice to spare. Aromatically it's as fine as perfume, floral and pretty; in texture, it's soft, but with just the right tension and electricity. Savory and spicy, it will bring out similar characteristics at the table.",94,Terre Rouge 2011 Monarch Mine Vineyard Syrah (Sierra Foothills),,,,
"Forward, fruity aromas of black cherry, raspberry and cassis set up a high-acid palate that's energetic. Lightly herbal, rooty flavors of black cherry and blackberry linger on a juicy, clean finish.",88,Tilia 2014 Bonarda (Mendoza),,,,
"A single-vineyard Sangiovese from Piccini's top estate, Poggio Teo offers up aromas of black tea and anise balanced by flavors of black fruit. It's smooth in the mouth, but not particularly lush, finishing with plenty of juicy acidity.",87,Valiano 1999 Poggio Teo  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"Every vintage Bryan Babcock makes an experimental white wine pressed straight from red grapes, in this case opting for Grenache. The result is a unique nose of lemon cake, pink rose petals and ice cream, followed by a a lively, energetic palate powered by Key lime pie flavors. It's worth tracking down for those seeking something completely different.",90,Babcock 2014 Identity Crisis Grenache (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Deep dark berry aromas come with notes of vanilla, gritty spice and tobacco. Hard tannins require cushion and this has just enough to handle things. Blackberry, cassis, barrel spice and molasses flavors finish with savory oak notes, chocolate and lingering blackberry fruit. Drink through 2030.",93,Lleiroso 2011 Reserva Edición Especial Sergio Hernández  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"Full of jammy Merlot fruits, this is a smooth ripe wine. Dried fruits and tannins give the wine its varietal character. They are freshened by the acidity and black-currant fruitiness. The aftertaste allows the firm tannins to shine. Drink from 2017.",88,Maison Givas 2014 Vin No. 09  (Lalande de Pomerol),,,,
"Aromatically this wine offers a lot of pleasant things, from anise and violet to pretty dark cherry and blackberry fruit. The tannins are pronounced and leathery, the mouthfeel quite concentrated, making it a hearty wine that could take a little more time in bottle to come around. The 2009 is more accessible.",87,Yorba 2008 Shake Ridge Vineyards Tempranillo (Amador County),,,,
"This is concentrated, but it's all structure at this stage. It has rich black fruits that lie under the dense tannins, with a potentially rich powerhouse of flavor. It needs at least six years of aging.",93,Domaine Heresztyn 2010  Clos Saint-Denis,,,,
"On first sniff, the scent of sulfur shrouds this wine, but it fades with air to reveal tinges of grapefruit, white pepper, honeysuckle and a legume-like quality. The flavors seem restrained from the start, but they gain intensity with time. Zesty acidity gives the palate cut.",85,Rosemont 2011 Traminette (Virginia),,,,
"This wine starts out brawny and tannic before finding itself in a more vibrant light of cherry, cinnamon and dried herb. Aromatically, it's a field of violets on a spring day, backed by a complex structure that makes for a food-friendly companion that's fresh from start to finish.",90,Bailiwick 2013 Alegria Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Stemmy earth and dark, savory pine give in to sautéed mushroom and cinnamon in this lean, soft and delicious estate-grown wine. A tension of acidity buoys a backdrop of wild strawberry and cranberry on the palate, ending with just the right amount of weight and length, succulent to the end.",93,Joseph Phelps 2013 Freestone Vineyards Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Very dense in the mouth and full-bodied, with a dry, soft feeling. Lots of toasty oak, too. Feels somewhat inert, but the delicious cherries, toast and spices make it a pleasant sipper.",87,Dierberg 2007 Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"This wine has jazzy, jammy aromas and ripe blackberry and strawberry flavors, wrapping them in a warm layer of fine-grained tannins and a nice dash of sweet baking spices from aging in oak.",91,Renwood 2013 Riker Vineyard Zinfandel (Amador County),,,,
"Ripe aromas of roasted coffee and black fruit filter onto a plump, layered and approachable palate. Baked berry and licorice flavors finish with a final dose of char and pepper. Drink this meaty wine through 2017.",89,Casado Morales 2006 Gran Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"Earthy aromas of truffle, forest floor, used leather and a funky whiff of barnyard carry over to the firm palate along with ripe black cherry, clove and a hint of game. It's on the rustic side but full of personality.",88,Viberti 2013 Buon Padre  (Barolo),,,,
"Simple but solid apple and nectarine aromas are straight forward. This feels round and easy, without much acid-based cut. Flavors of melon, mango and nectarine finish short, with a note of apple.",86,Esperanza 2014 Estate Grown & Bottled Verdejo-Viura (Rueda),,,,
"This edition of Nicolis' Valpolicella blend shows simplicity, but cleanliness and balance as well. It's a straightforward expression with lingering tones of cherry and cola on the close.",85,Nicolis 2008  Valpolicella Classico Superiore,,,,
"Fig, nectarine and grapefruit notes mark this as a ripe style, without much of the herbal pungency found in Sauvignon Blancs from Marlborough. It's medium bodied, with a silky mouthfeel and a long, harmonious finish. Drink now.",91,Urlar 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Gladstone),,,,
"Fragrant wild flower, yellow stone fruit, citrus and chopped herb aromas lead the nose on this vibrant blend of 90% Carricante and 10% Riesling. The racy palate doles out fresh apricot, crisp green apple and energizing mineral framed in tangy acidity. A note of aromatic herb accents the succulent finish.",92,Planeta 2015 Eruzione 1614 Carricante (Sicilia),,,,
"This bone-dry, acidic wine does not dazzle, but has elusive flavors of apricots, oranges, tobacco, honey, white pepper and sandalwood. The blend is Viognier, Grenache Blanc, Marsanne and Roussanne. Drink it now, but not too cold.",88,Tablas Creek 2012 Côtes de Tablas Blanc White (Paso Robles),,,,
"A deep color and an aroma of extreme freshness are the first things to notice, then intense flavors of tart cherry and rhubarb kick in on the palate. This wine is light to medium bodied, and the texture is lively, with lip-smacking acidity and tannin. Best after 2017.",94,Waits-Mast 2012 Mariah Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino Ridge),,,,
Mature plum and a whiff of cake spice lead the nose on this straightforward wine. The ripe easygoing palate doles out black cherry extract and a hint of cinnamon accompanied by dusty tannins.,86,Talamonti 2015 Modà  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),,,,
"A blend of 58% Cabernet Sauvignon and 42% Merlot, this boasts bright aromas of rich red cherry, currant, tobacco and char. Medium weight and well-balanced, with structured tannins and ample acidity. Spicy, black pepper and toasted oak flavors fuel the finish.",90,Jardin 2009 Cobblers Hill Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Stellenbosch),,,,
"Criterion is a so-called global brand, offering Italian Pinot Grigio, Rioja and Chianti Classico among other benchmarks. This Coonawarra Cabernet is surprisingly good given that background. It offers cherry, cassis and tobacco notes, medium body and silky tannins. Drink it over the next 5–8 years.",90,Criterion 2013 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra),,,,
"The family farms 125 acres in the Russian River Valley, where the Sauvignon Blanc is planted in gravelly soils. The resulting wine is stately in bristling acidity, ripe melon, peach and a sneaky streak of jalapeño that gives intrigue. Juicy and ripe, it offers a moderate level of richness that's pleasing on the palate.",90,Trione 2013 River Road Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Power is the name of the game with this Petite Sirah and Zinfandel blend. It just detonates in the mouth, with red chili pepper-inspired flavors of cherries, orange marmalade, and red plums, finishing with a dash of tabasco. The acidity may be a little too much for some people, but it makes the wine lively and cutting.",88,Newsome-Harlow 2006 El Portal Red (Calaveras County),,,,
"A darker shade of blood orange in the glass, this bottling of Cabernet Sauvignon shows cranberry and orange on the nose. It's quite flat on the sip, with sour orange, strawberry and plum notes, and that makes it seem more like an afterthought than a focused rosé, which is such a competitive category now.",84,Asuncion Ridge 2016 Rosé (San Luis Obispo County),,,,
"With some attractive tannins and strawberry fruits, this wine has kept its light character. It is developing well into an attractively fruity wine that will be ready from the end of 2016. This is part of a larger estate, Château Haut Rocher, across the line from Castillon in Saint-Émilion. It has been in the family since the 17th century. Jérôme et Béatrice de Monteil took over both properties for the family in 2010.",85,Château Bréhat 2013  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,,,,
"Dry Creek produced this wine and then held it back all of this time to let it properly mellow. It's beautiful—softly lush, dry and complex in jammy blackberry and cherry fruit, with a spicy, briary character that makes it savory.",91,Dry Creek Vineyard 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Dry, fresh aromas of red fruits come across crisp and racy. The palate follows the nose's lead with medium weight and traditional snappy acidity. Flavors of plum, berry and cassis are clean, while the finish shows some richness via molasses and oaky notes.",88,Marqués de Riscal 2008 Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"This wine is complex and deep in flavors, traditional in style and simply gorgeous to sip and savor. It's dry in style, good and tannic in texture, lightly spiced with cedar and cinnamon and grounded in concentrated raspberry and dark cherry flavors.",90,Martin Lane Winery 2011 Estate Primitivo (Sierra Foothills),,,,
"The aroma is a bit buttery and nutty, and the flavors are similar, with good depth and generosity. Although the mouthfeel is crisp enough, it strives more for richness than refreshment. Consider this wine serious enough for indulgent plates of seafood, pasta and chicken.",87,Chatom Vineyards 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Calaveras County),,,,
"Principally sourced from the winery's oldest block of Cabernet Sauvignon, this offers a solid core of dense black cherry and cassis fruit. There's a streak of cola and sassafras, and the wine seems to lighten up as it sails into the finish. The blend includes 10% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot.",90,Kiona 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),,,,
"Aromas of minerally pencil lead and smoky plum and berry are positive albeit oaky. This is tight and grabby in feel, with firm tannins. Plum and berry flavors offer more than enough oaky support, while the finish is dominated by wood-spice notes and bulky tannins. Drink through 2021.",90,Solar de Castro 2013 Vendimia Seleccionada  (Rioja),,,,
"The palest of pinks announces the lightness of touch that makes this wine so attractive. Sure, it has ripe strawberry flavors, but they are delicate, laced with acidity, good freshness. A real apéritif wine.",90,Deutz 2003 Rosé Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"While Testarossa specializes in single-vineyard wines, this basic appellation blend is solid. It's crisp in acidity and amply oaked, with powerful pineapple and peach jam, buttered toast and sweet vanilla flavors. This wine calls for dramatic Chardonnay fare, such as lobster and crab.",91,Testarossa 2011 Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"A thin but crisp finish characterizes this luminous Prosecco, which also offers measured aromas of stone fruit, honey and jasmine. Pair this wine with simple finger foods on a hot summer afternoon.",84,Zonin NV Prosecco (Italy),,,,
"Nature in the name of this wine signifies it was made with organically grown grapes. It is stylish, fresh in red berry fruits and attractive acidity. There is a tangy character that gives the wine a taut, nervy structure. With further aging, the wine will fill out more. Drink from 2018.",89,Dão Sul 2012 Paço dos Cunhas de Santar Nature Red (Dão),,,,
87—89 Barrel sample. Full of the vibrant Merlot which is a hallmark of 2006. The wine adds to the fruit solid tannins and a dense structure.,88,Château Teyssier 2006 Barrel sample  (Saint-Émilion),,,,
"Containing all red Bordeaux varieties except Malbec, this wine has a sweet vanilla-caramel character that devolves into baked prunes.",80,Vindemia 2006 Commonwealth Red (South Coast),,,,
"The scents and flavors are dominated by chocolate, right from the start. The mouthfeel is tight, and herbal notes come up ahead of the light red fruit. Whole cluster fermentation was employed, perhaps accounting for the woody accents in the tannins.",87,Z'IVO 2014 Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
"Saline aromas, celery notes and mild citrus scents make up the nose on this slightly round SB. Herbal green-fruit flavors finish with controlled pyrazinic bitterness.",86,François Lurton 2016 Araucano Reserva Made With Organic Grapes Sauvignon Blanc (Lolol Valley),,,,
"A ripe, jammy, caramel style, with super-sweet fruit and spice followed by toast and fig jam. The wine is big, bold, opulent, finishing with bright berry flavors.",88,Quinta da Gaivosa 2004 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),,,,
An overtly fragrant nose of both moss and ripe yellow pear makes for an intriguing opening. The palate has the same seductive pull of ripeness—and the accompanying warmth. But there is tone and freshness that lifts everything up and ends up as a picture of complete charm.,90,Hutter 2013 Loibner Kreutles Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),,,,
"Light in color, this is a wine with flavors that seem to have been stripped away. It is crisp and only lightly fruity, with some bitter acidity at the end.",83,Château Goudichaud 2014 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),,,,
"Soft and rounded with ripe apple and pear flavors, this wine expresses the richness of the vintage. Hints of toast and cookie are changing the fruit character, making this a wine that's ready to drink while still fresh, yet starting to show good aging as well.",90,Nicolas Feuillatte 2002 Palmes d'Or Vintage Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"89-91 Barrel sample. Surprisingly lightweight wine, its freshness the dominant character. It shows bright black fruits and some toast, the tannins a sweet element.",90,Château Tour de Pez 2009 Barrel sample  (Saint-Estèphe),,,,
A light yeasty quality and a note of mustard stick out on an otherwise generic white-fruit nose. This is fairly full in body and well balanced—flavors of melon and stone fruits fall off on the finish and taste slightly oxidized. Drink now.,88,Bodegas Campante 2015 Viña Reboreda Godello (Ribeiro),,,,
"Plenty of acid underscores rich flavors of pineapple, Meyer lemon and lemon curd. The wine dives deeply into the palate and lingers, with crisp highlights of citrus rind and a long, smooth finish.",90,Walnut City WineWorks 2012 Reserve Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Plum and raspberry fruit, intriguing spice notes reminiscent of allspice and cardamom, and ample weight and suppleness make this bargain-priced offering a winner. Drink now.",87,Gosford 2015 Reserve Shiraz (South Eastern Australia),,,,
"Herbal blackberry, raspberry and leather aromas are solid and inviting on the nose. The palate is juicy and lithe, with a springy, bouncy mouthfeel and lightly herbal, earthy flavors of cassis and raspberry. Drink through 2019.",91,Undurraga 2012 T.H. Terroir Hunter Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),,,,
"A big, modern, lusty style with dark aromas of cola, chocolate, licorice and immense berry fruit. The palate hits with a wall of tannins, but there's also full-flavored blasts of blackberry, fudge, espresso and licorice. Finishes in form: it's blackened and toasty.",90,Bodegas La Horra 2009 Corimbo  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"Dry, wooly aromas of apple and peach pit are steady. Pithy nectarine and apple flavors veer towards citrus on a mild, focused finish.",89,Otazu 2015 Chardonnay (Navarra),,,,
"This is a bold fruity wine that just allows its tannins to build a supporting structure. The black fruits are right up front, full of acidity and with a delicious potential. Drink from 2019.",88,Château le Grand Verdus 2015  Bordeaux Supérieur,,,,
"This medium sweet wine has attractive yellow fruit and mango flavors. It's soft, with a touch of honey and crisper lemon juice accents. Drink now.",87,Lionel Osmin & Cie 2016 Villa Chambre d'Amour Gros Manseng-Sauvignon Blanc White (Vin de France),,,,
"This has flavors of fresh citrus and intense, fragrant flowers. The finish has notes of lime and white peach, with a soft, lush feeling and creamy bubbles.",87,Le Manzane 2010 Millesimato 20.10 Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
"This wine's red and yellow apple and melon aromas lead to broad, fleshy fruit flavors. It's direct and delivers a lot of appeal.",88,Nine Hats 2016 The Benches Vineyard Pinot Gris (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"With all the freshness of the vintage, this fruity wine shows good balance between tangy acidity and crisp apple and green-plum fruits. Subtle touches of wood give a spicy, nutmeg flavor to complement the bright fruitiness. Drink from 2018. The vineyard is next door to the Grand Cru Montrachet vines.",92,Au Pied du Mont Chauve 2013 Les Chenevottes Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet),,,,
"Defines the Pride Cabernet style of big, rich, ripely extracted fruit, significant oak and dense mountain tannins. Harder to describe is just how dramatic the wine feels in the mouth. Offers black currant, cassis liqueur and dark chocolate flavors subtlely tinged with herbs and tannins. May not have the stuffing for the very long haul, but great over the next six years.",92,Pride Mountain 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa-Sonoma),,,,
"Although the wood aging shows strongly at the moment, there is enough weight of ripe black currant fruits to integrate as the wine matures. Then, it will be a firm-though-fruity wine, solid and chunky.",86,Château Roc Meynard 2011  Bordeaux Supérieur,,,,
"With a depth of ripe cherry flavor, Sean Thackrey's Wentzel Clone 777, shows concentration and weight, with a riper, fleshier and bolder character than its clonal companions grown in the same vineyard block.",90,Sean Thackrey 2010 Cassiopeia Wentzel Vineyard Clone 777 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),,,,
"Gentle lemon-peel freshness spells summer wine with the first whiff. The slender palate also continues on a friendly, superclean and superfresh lemon theme with just a very slight hint of fizz. Refreshment personified.",89,Dürnberg 2015 Falkensteiner Lagen Riesling (Niederösterreich),,,,
"The popularity of rosé has lead to higher prices in Tavel, but this estate, one of the region's largest, has kept those increases in check. Thankfully, the wine quality seems as good as ever, with this 2013 offering deep cherry-berry notes, hints of white chocolate and a long, citrusy-clean finish. Drink this full-bodied rosé now and into fall and winter 2015.",90,Château d'Aqueria 2013  Tavel,,,,
"Earthy spicy aromas of tea and leather frame herbal berry and cherry notes. This has a fresh jumpy palate and snappy flavors of spiced pie cherry, plum and oak-based vanilla. A bit of saltiness rises up on a juicy, racy finish.",87,Cono Sur 2015 Reserva Especial Pinot Noir (San Antonio),,,,
"Avesso is the hallmark white grape from the south of the Vinho Verde region. This wine is deliciously crisp, with a touch of oak to add spice. It is full of ripe apples, with an aftertaste that brims with acidity.",88,Casa de Vilacetinho 2016 Avesso Superior Avesso (Vinho Verde),,,,
"Lively, spicy and warm, this full-bodied wine wraps firm tannins around flavors like mulled berries and preserved cherries, though it's also surprisingly fresh and vibrant. After baking spices, mellow fruit comes through on the palate, while the firm texture really keeps it going on the finish.",92,Boeger 2014 Pinot Grande Pinot Noir (El Dorado),,,,
"Melony and green on the nose, with an asparagus note. The palate sports enough acidity to keep it afloat, but the flavors shift quickly from lime and melon to peas and asparagus.",83,Viña Casas Patronales 2010 Reserva Privada Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),,,,
"Named after a green oak (Eouve in the local Provencal language), this wine is brightly aromatic, with a caramel flavor and tight acidity. The 15% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend has given the wine some structure, which needs to soften a little. Drink from late 2017.",88,Ravoire et Fils 2016 Domaine Bel Eouve Rosé (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence),,,,
"This starts off with scents of ripe black cherries and dried herbs, then turns more chocolaty in flavor on the palate. It's full bodied without being particularly textured, and shows some coarse tannins on the finish. Drink now–2015.",87,Louis Bernard 2011 Les Carbonnières  (Gigondas),,,,
"Expressive, honeyed white currant, banana purée and peach aromas give this blend of Viognier and Roussanne depth. The palate is smooth, lush and weighty, and it ends with some warmth and flower tones.",87,The Infinite Monkey Theorem NV The Blind Watchmaker White (Colorado),,,,
"From the tiny Faro denomination overlooking the Strait of Messina, this cult red opens with earthy aromas of tilled soil, leather, dried berry, smoke, savory herb and a hint of game. Displaying compelling earthy elegance, the palate offers black cherry, raspberry, tobacco, truffle, tobacco, soil, graphite and licorice. It's still young but impeccably balanced, with firm but fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. Hold for even more complexity. Drink 2018–2025.",94,Palari 2010  Faro,,,,
"Decadently rich in caramel and vanilla on the nose, this vineyard-designate evolves into more delicate floral elements, with a depth of spicy oak and baked apple and pear. Throughout the medium body and medium acidity is a freshness of lemon and lime, with a slight twist of tangerine.",92,Dutton-Goldfield 2013 Dutton Ranch Walker Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Green Valley),,,,
"There's a strong green-peppercorn tinge to the nose of this bottling, along with hints of ancho chile and cedar. The palate shows oregano, thyme and dill, proving quite Old World in style, with only the slightest presence of blackberry fruit.",87,Rancho Sisquoc 2015 Flood Family Vineyard Merlot (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"A young and fruity wine, full of ripe black currant fruit. Its tannins are soft, a good balance with the fresh, juicy fruit. Drink or age a year.",86,J. Portugal Ramos 2010 Marquês de Borba Red (Alentejo),,,,

"Big and lush, this one's got gobs of chocolate, plum, spice, black cherry, spice, coffee, herb, toast, and vanilla, all framed in creamy smooth tannins that give a supple quality to the blend. Long, lush and smooth at the end.",90,Rosenblum 2001 Samsel Vineyard/Maggie's Reserve Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"Lavignone is a simple but classy Barbera with solid aromas of forest berry, cassis and fresh tobacco leaf. The wine would pair with fried zucchini flowers stuffed with melted mozzarella cheese.",87,Pico Maccario 2010 Lavignone  (Barbera d'Asti),,,,
"Alexander Valley has a rep for soft, forward Cabs of great deliciousness but, perhaps, a lack of complexity. That description fits this dark, young wine, except for one thing: It’s complex. You’ll find all the spicy-curranty depths of flavor you want, and plenty of oak, and it will even age, because the tannins, while soft, are intricate.",91,Geyser Peak 1997 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),,,,
"From a property owned by Château Mongravey in Margaux, this firmly structured wine is solid with dark tannins and blackberry fruits. It has the stalky texture typical of the vintage, although this will soften to leave a firm while ripe wine. Drink from 2018.",88,Château de Braude 2013  Haut-Médoc,,,,
"A beautiful Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, albeit a very young one that would be a shame to drink too early. The score indicates its current drinkability, but that could heighten over the next 6–8 years. Shows a very firm tannic structure, with luscious black currant flavors that grow richer as the wine warms up in the glass.",91,Black Ridge 2006 San Andreas Red Red (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"This Sangiovese-dominant blend opens with red cherry and dried tobacco leaf aromas. A hint of clove accents the palate, which is full of red plum fruit and smooth but rather fleeting tannins that give it an easygoing framework. Drink soon.",87,Artimino 2015  Barco Reale di Carmignano,,,,
"Fresh, crisp, citrus and floral flavors make a light, easy Grüner Veltliner, a great summer drink of light white fruits and green berries. Screwcap.",86,Schloss Halbturn 2006 Koenigsegg Velt. 1 Grüner Veltliner (Burgenland),,,,
"Harsh and rustic, with jellied berry and red pepper flavors. Feels soft, simple and sweet. The blend is Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah.",83,Eagle Castle 2007 Trinity Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"Fleshy in pineapple and papaya, with a pinch of Sémillon blended within, this wine displays itself in a fuller-bodied style, quite ripe and robust, with strong, lingering flavors of dried apricot and vanilla.",85,Merriam 2015 Danielle Vineyard Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This is an attractive, relatively light Sauternes. It has a fine botrytis character that's already well integrated with the orange peel and honey flavors. Not for aging; ready to drink.",87,Château Gravas 2010  Sauternes,,,,
"Sumptuous notes of sugar cookie and honeydew perfume this lavish, full-bodied bottling. It's dry on the palate with piercing white-grapefruit acidity, but balanced by a rich, almost creamy, mouthfeel. The finish lingers luxuriously with a murmur of lime-zest astringency.",92,Fritz Haag 2013 Trocken Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"This soft, juicy Cab Franc is fine for drinking now with a nice steak. It's almost sweet in cherry, tobacco and green herb flavors, with a pretty touch of oak and gentle tannins.",87,Lang & Reed 2009 Cabernet Franc (North Coast),,,,
"The nose does not want to give any more away than a yeasty, savory glint. On the palate, this evolves into a peppery, herbal core with real texture and depth. Fruit, apart from citrus, remains hidden for now, still held in that primary, yeasty center that already sends out sprays of spice. Delicious and intriguing now, probably even more interesting in the coming two to three years.",93,Fischer 2014 Reserve Frauenweingärten Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),,,,
"Black-fruit aromas come with notes of fresh-cut grass, rose petal and berry jam. The mouthfeel is creamy and sticky, with modest acidity. Ripe, rich flavors of berry fruits, cocoa and caramel finish jammy. Drink this tasty, saturated, soft-bodied Malbec through 2018.",89,Antigal 2014 Uno Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Slightly feral, with baked fruit notes alongside hints of coffee grounds. Disappointing; lacks freshness.",81,Castell 2008 Casteller Reitsteig Trocken Spätburgunder (Franken),,,,
"Still dominated by its new wood aromas, this is a fine, structured wine that is only just setting out. It has fine weight, rich blackberry fruits and dark tannins. The spicy wood still needs to integrate, so drink from 2017.",90,Château Bel-Air Ortet 2010  Saint-Estèphe,,,,
"A fruity style of Douro wine, perhaps missing the tannins but with generous black fruits and ripe berry flavors. Acidity and a streak of minerality combine to give the final tight texture. Drink now.",87,Borges 2012 Quinta da Soalheira Red (Douro),,,,
"Dense, cedary, rubbery aromas of blackberry and turned earth set up a lush, clean, chewy palate full of ripe flavors of blueberry, prune, raisin and fig. Throw in a chocolaty aftertaste and a borderline syrupy finish and this full-bodied, grabby Tannat is impressive. Drink through 2018.",90,Familia Deicas 2008 Massimo Deicas Tannat (Juanico),,,,
Blaufränkisch's characteristic briar and blackberry tones shine brightly in this rather substantial rosé. Demure whispers of cherry blossom and fresh herb on the nose meld into smoky black fruit and bramble tones on the palate. It's refreshingly crisp but finishes with persistence.,90,Inspire Moore 2015 Grace Dry Blaufränkisch Rosé (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This clonal combo from a meticulously tended family vineyard shows iron, cranberry, strawberry blossoms, sagebrush and a wound-up minerality on the nose. Sanguine flavors power the tip of the palate alongside cranberry and pomegranate fruit. A suave spiciness of dried mint and menthol emerges in the midpalate.",89,Boekenoogen 2013 3 Clone Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Sweet, forward aromas of mocha, blackberry, cotton candy and vanilla signal a rich wine. The palate is round and chunky, with a spot of elegance but more size and force. Flavors of chunky blackberry are slightly salty and salinic at the edges, while overall it's thick, fruity and black in nature. Drink now through 2012.",89,Ruca Malen 2007 Kinien Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"This is a light and fruity style of Grüner, with a crisp green-fruit flavor. It is immediately accessible, with a spice note and bright acidity on the finish. Screwcap.",88,Weixelbaum 2011 Stephanus Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),,,,
"Dark tones of smoke and slate persist from nose to finish in this dry, intensely mineral Riesling. Its silky, supple palate suggests a ripeness of fruit off set by puckery lemon-lime acidity.",91,Pflüger 2014 Buntsandstein Trocken Riesling (Pfalz),,,,
"A sizable percentage of Cabernet Franc (19%) makes it into this wine, as does 1% Viognier. Inky and plummy, it's a full-bodied, brawny mix of ripe plum, blackberry, leather and black pepper, well structured and built to age. Drink now through 2020.",91,Sequoia Grove 2012 Syrah (Napa Valley),,,,
"Girardet farms its vineyards organically, does not irrigate, and ferments this wine in stainless steel. The result is a solidly made Pinot Gris, offering lush scents and tastes of ripe pear. Good texture and balance keep it from feeling one dimensional; puts the fruit front and center.",88,Girardet 2006 Pinot Gris (Umpqua Valley),,,,
"A pronounced scent of lilacs marks the nose of this wine, making it distinctive, to say the least. It’s more traditional in its flavors, with some herbal and strawberry nuances. Finishes a bit short and ever-so-slightly sweet, but a decent quaff.",85,Freixenet NV Brut De Noirs  (Penedès),,,,
"Crushed orange peels, plump lemon blossoms, spun sugar, clarified butter and a slight almond oil touch combine for a lush, layered nose on this bottling from the Carmel Valley producer. The palate presents an expert balance between salt, butter and almond warmth aand tingling, lime-led acidity. Will please both lovers of classic Cali chard and acid-heads.",92,Bernardus 2014 Chardonnay (Monterey County),,,,
"Snappy, dry red-fruit and citrus aromas are a good opening. The palate is fresh and bouncy, with punchy pomegranate and grapefruit flavors. A zesty finish with mild citrus and nectarine flavors is par for the course.",87,Enanzo 2013 Garnacha Rosado (Navarra),,,,
"Made with Cortese grapes, this white from Piedmont has a delicate fragrance of white and yellow flowers accented with whiffs of stone fruit. The palate offers crisp apple and pear along with hints of citrus and peach.",86,Broglia 2012 Il Doge  (Cortese di Gavi),,,,
"A very rich Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon, but quite tannic. You want to give it some time in the cellar. Dry and full-bodied, it shows ripe, deep flavors of blackberry jam, black currants, dark chocolate and anise, with smoky overtones from oak. Feels dramatic and impressive. Give it until 2012 to come around.",93,Korbin Kameron 2006 Cuvée Kristin Red (Sonoma Mountain),,,,
"The nose begins with a smoked Meyer lemon element, but evolves into fleshier tropicality, with ripe kiwi, white flowers and vanilla. The palate begins with vanilla, but then shows ripe stone fruits that trend toward bubble gum, with enough acidity and tannic grip to keep it serious.",89,Still Waters 2013 Estate Viognier (Paso Robles),,,,
"Each year Rich gets his grapes from different sources: This time it’s Corral Creek, and the wine’s tight as a drum, emphasizing cranberry and pie cherries. It isn’t sour, but it is tart. The gorgeous nose and precise, powerful red-berry fruit make it pleasurable. Puckering acids say it should be served with food.",88,Andrew Rich 1998 Les Vigneaux Corral Creek Vyd Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Camelot is a bold blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot that shows great balance and elegant composure. It's not overdone or jammy, despite the hot climate that shaped it. Instead, it shows focus and precision in its blackberry, cherry, oak spice and cinnamon notes.",90,Firriato 2008 Camelot Red (Sicilia),,,,
"Fresh, despite the dense tannin, this is a ripe, juicy wine, full of black currant flavors and vibrant acidity. Wood treatment shows more cassis just at the end to round the wine out.",89,Cálem 2006 Curva Reserva Red (Douro),,,,
"Has an old-fashioned, rustic quality, an acidic, bone-dry wine with sour cherry and dark unsweetened chocolate flavors that finish with some bitterness. Brings to mind those old-style Chiantis.",84,Lolonis 2005 Winegrower Selection Golden Vineyard Petite Sirah (Redwood Valley),,,,
"A relatively light color and aromas like cherry jam give this medium-bodied wine an easy appeal. It has fruit flavors that dig deeper than the aromas, and moderate tannins for a good, gripping mouthfeel.",88,Skinner 2014 El Dorado Grenache (El Dorado),,,,
"This wine is ripe in strawberry-raspberry notes. It's lush and velvety, with a richness that will appeal to those who like a hint of decadence in their Pinot. Round and soft, with a bite of earthiness throughout, it brightens with a trace of minerality on the finish.",91,Marimar Estate 2012 Don Miguel Vineyard Earthquake Block Estate Grown & Estate Bottled Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Subtlety on the nose hides the hazelnutty softness of this pliable, pleasing and gentle wine that has a balm-like structure which almost comes across as soothing. With echoing nuttiness and an apricot core, this does not fit any particular mold, but is intriguing, authentic and totally convincing.",93,Wohlmuth 2012 Edelschuh Sauvignon Blanc (Südsteiermark),,,,
"Soft tannins support a lighter style of leather, strawberry and herb in this structured, aromatic wine, speckled in cherry cola.",89,Amici 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This wine is maturing well, giving a firm, structure and some stalkiness. It's dry and will remain that way, showing some mineral texture as well as black currant flavors. The wine will be at its best in 2015.",87,Château de la Grenière 2008  Lussac Saint-Émilion,,,,
"Bold flavors and plenty of creamy texture make this full-bodied wine seem big and mouth-filling. It offers nice lemon and butter aromas, ripe pear and spicy nutmeg flavors along with a smoky overtone that lasts from the aroma to the finish.",88,Lava Cap 2014 Reserve Estate Bottled Chardonnay (El Dorado),,,,
"This opens with aromas of blackberry, ground pepper and a whiff of graphite. The juicy savory, palate offers ripe black cherry, clove and licorice alongside fresh acidity and chewy tannins. Drink through 2021.",90,Abbazia di Novacella 2013 Riserva Lagrein (Alto Adige),,,,
"Initially this smells rugged and choppy, but calmer aromas of spice, red plum and cherry emerge with time. A fruity, approachable palate and straightforward cherry and plum flavors finish fairly long, with a touch of controlled bitterness.",88,Estefania 2013 Tilenus Mencía (Bierzo),,,,
"Pleasant and melony on the nose, without the sharp, piercing aromas that sometimes push Chilean SB over the edge. New from the north of Chile, Elki is medium-bodied and generous, but not too angular. It's a whole wine with common citrus flavors as opposed to something demanding and sharp.Drink right away.",88,Elki 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Elqui Valley),,,,

"As in the past, Leonetti's 2010 Sangiovese was co-fermented with Syrah (11%), and sourced from Seven Hills, Pepper Bridge and Mill Creek Upland vineyards. It's flat-out delicious from the first scents of barrels and fruits, right on through a lush palate rich in flavors of berries, rum-soaked cherries and exotic spices. A long finish, with a smoky/earthy cast, is supported with tart acids.",93,Leonetti Cellar 2010 Sangiovese (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Small in production and clearly defined from Carneros, this Blanc de Noirs blends 92% Pinot Noir with 8% Chardonnay to great effect. Pretty in peach color, the intense flavors are a combination of fresh-cut herb and strawberry kirsch.",90,Gloria Ferrer NV Blanc de Noirs Sparkling (Carneros),,,,

"A blend of Syrah (40%), Merlot (30%), Malbec (16) and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is dark in color, with aromas of plum, chocolate, orange peel and peppery spices. Flavors are soft and full, bringing appeal at a seldom-seen in this appellation.",88,Foundry Vineyards 2012 Foundry Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"High alcohol, to the tune of 15.5% by volume, is the defining element of this Zin. It gives heat and the sweet, glyceriney finish of a minor Port. The flavors are also too ripe for comfort, with raisins, prunes and brown sugar.",84,Dunning Vineyards 2011 Private Reserve Zinfandel (Paso Robles),,,,
"Still showing its tannins, this wine is developing well. It is relatively light in texture, the sweet berry fruits balanced with a layer of acidity.",89,Château Grand Corbin Manuel 2004  Saint-Émilion,,,,
"On the light side, this is an attractive wine, but missing the intensity of some other wines from Saint-Julien. It's balanced, fresh and elegant.",89,Château Talbot 2008  Saint-Julien,,,,
"There's a boisterous amount of freshly pressed boysenberry juice, crushed graphite and sweet rose on the very accessible, somewhat soda-poppy nose of this blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Petit Verdot, 20% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc. The medium-bodied palate is plummy with a hint of fennel.",91,Grassini 2014 Articondo Red (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),,,,
"Bright and concentrated raspberry fruit is the hallmark of this Washington Zinfandel, with the acidity it needs to support almost 16% alcohol. High-toned and juicy, the fruit shines, though the finish turns chalky.",87,Animale 2009 Zinfandel (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Hints of cedar and spice accent ripe red-fruit and flower notes on this distinctly Old World-style Pinot Noir. A fresh green-herb flavor, brisk acidity and penetrating tannins drive through the long finish.",88,Bloomer Creek 2008 Unfined and Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),,,,
"86-88 Sweet, soft fruit, ripe and attractive, with some spice and fresh tannins. The wine is open, already developing.",87,Château Balestard la Tonnelle 2010 Barrel sample  (Saint-Émilion),,,,
"This young wine offers aromas of underbrush and mushroom, along with evident oak and toasted notes. The palate is still rather closed but reveals oak, plum, espresso and coffee flavors. It's tightly knit, with astringent wood tannins that linger through the close.",87,Barone Ricasoli 2011 Brolio  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"Give this wine a brief decant, to let some off notes breathe away. The flavors are fine and dry, suggesting sour cherry candy and Dr. Pepper that are brightened with vital acids.",86,Jenner 2010 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Light in color, light in aromas, light in flavor... that pretty much describes this decent but rudimentary Chardonnay. Airy pear aromas lead to a monotone, fresh palate with generic flavors of peach, melon and citrus. A pithy bitterness rises up on the modest finish.",83,Château Los Boldos 2012 Cuvée Tradition Chardonnay (Rapel Valley),,,,
"Dry spice is fighting with rich, smooth Chardonnay to give a wine that is unbalanced at the moment. It is full, fragrant, still young so the dried almond edge should melt into the more honeyed character. Drink from 2017.",90,Umathum 2011 Beerenauslese White (Burgenland),,,,
"Small amounts of Malbec and Merlot bring some additional complexity to this Cabernet, but it's still a pretty straightforward wine. Soft and dry, it has generous flavors of blackberry and new oak. Drink now.",86,Hess Collection 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),,,,

Wisps of violet on the palate and soft, furry tannins lend it an elegant feel.",87,Grafen Neipperg 2009 Neipperger Schlossberg Spätburgunder (Württemberg),,,,
"A brilliant Chardonnay showing how well this region can ripen fruit while retaining brisk acidity. Oak barrels add an exotic touch of clove to the underlying pineapple fruit flavors. Feels rich and creamy, and aging on the lees provides a complex touch of sourdough. Drink now.",93,Foley 2008 T Anchor Ranch Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"A big, juicy Pinot Noir, rich and opulent, with flavors ranging from cherry pie and bacon through Dr. Pepper cola to the most succulent, meaty heirloom tomato you ever had. Exotically spicy and complex, and the overall result is delicious. Fine now and for the next 4–6 years.",92,Ken Brown 2008 Cargasacchi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Pecan and brown sugar aromas float around a sharp core of citrus that's reflected on the palate via tangy, dry orange and apricot flavors. The mouthfeel smacks down hard with acidity; overall it combines heat, acid, nuttiness and tang.",86,González Byass NV Viña AB Amontillado Seco Palomino (Jerez),,,,
"Oak and alcohol aromas dominate this wine made from 100% Montepulciano. The palate delivers café au lait and espresso, blueberry, chocolate and mint alongside the warmth of alcohol. It's starting to fade, so drink soon.",85,Piantate Lunghe 2009 Riserva Rossini  (Conero),,,,
"Aromas of tropical fruit and white peach carry over to the creamy palate along with ripe Granny Smith apple, candied lemon rind and a ginger note. Fresh acidity lifts the rather rich finish.",89,Malvirà 2015  Roero,,,,

"From vines with an average age of 25 years, this concentrated wine is fruity and stylishly textured. With lively acidity balanced by tense minerality, it shows intense citrus and concentration. It will benefit from some aging, so drink from 2018.",91,Domaine Matthias et Emile Roblin 2014 Enclos de Maimbray  (Sancerre),,,,
"An unusual blend of flavors fills this full-bodied wine. It has fruit cocktail aromas and obvious butter and butterscotch flavors as if it's trying to be a Chardonnay. The texture is rich and soft, and the butter keeps flowing on the finish.",84,Steelhead Vineyards 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (North Coast),,,,
"Good price for a Cab of this elegance and complexity. It's a dry, full-bodied wine, with proper varietal flavors of black currants and cedar. A great substitute for a more expensive Cab in this economy.",87,Spellbound 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),,,,
"Made from 65% Sangiovese and 35% Cabernet Sauvignon—organically farmed—this polished red opens with aromas of black-skinned fruit, violet and Mediterranean herb.

"This wine has power along with great fruit and a rich structure. Yellow fruits are laced with a more finessed texture that adds minerality. It is a dense wine, full of fruit, with a measured touch of wood. Age this until 2021.",95,Albert Bichot 2014  Corton-Charlemagne,,,,
"This is the finest Cheval Blanc for many years. It is, quite simply, magnificent. The wine shows the greatness of Cabernet Franc in the vintage, with 57% of the variety in the blend. It is beautifully structured and perfumed, with velvety tannins, balanced acidity and swathes of black-currant and black-cherry fruits. It's well on course to becoming a legendary wine.",100,Château Cheval Blanc 2010  Saint-Émilion,,,,
"This was the first vineyard bought by the Bouchard family, purchased in 1791. More than 220 years later, this 2011 has a delicate touch of wood nestled in the heart of creamy fruit flavors.

"Developed by winemaker Loic Bulliat, this wine comes from an estate owned by his family. It's structured, firm with tannins and juicy acidity.

Drink after 2018.",94,Andrea Oberto 2007 Vigneto Brunate  (Barolo),,,,

"Dry tannins dominate this rough-edged wine. There are plenty of bitter cherry and cocoa flavors, while the acidity gives an attractive freshness. Those tannins need a year to settle down.",87,Château de Minière 2008 Cabernet Franc (Bourgueil),,,,
"Aromas of toasted oak, green leaves, vanilla and spice waft from this medium-bodied North Carolina Bordeaux-style blend. The palate is ripe and plush with plenty of sweet dark cherry fruit, but there's a tinge of green in the backdrop. Tobacco, smoke and supple tannins on the finish add an edge to this otherwise soft sipper.",84,RayLen 2006 Eagle's Select Red Wine Red (North Carolina),,,,
"The nose is rather closed but eventually reveals red berry, rose, cake spice and a whiff of leather. It's young but balanced, with bracing tannins and bright acidity that support the tart sour cherry, white pepper and sage flavors. It closes on a mocha note. Drink 2018–2027.",90,Castello di Verduno 2012 Rabajà  (Barbaresco),,,,

"Ripe black fruit aromas aren't overly complex or nuanced but they are generous. Feels tight, gritty and healthy, with firm tannins in front of black cherry and blackberry flavors. Mellows on the finish, where plum and prune flavors take over. Not a hard, fierce Priorat; drink now through 2014.",90,Fuentes 2008 Coraje Red (Priorat),,,,
"The vintage was cool, lending this wine strong acidity that cuts through the mouth like a squirt of lime juice. Dry and austere, it offers oak-influenced sour-cherry candy and cola flavors. This should develop bottle complexity over the next 3–6 years.",92,Lynmar 2010 Freestone Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"A big but not-too-tannic Petit Verdot, this is juicy and structured with red fruit and a light layer of spice. Tending toward black licorice and dark chocolate, it could use a splash of something to brighten it up. But it's otherwise a bottle worth trying if you're curious to try a varietal Petit Verdot.",86,Concannon 2009 Reserve Petit Verdot (Livermore Valley),,,,
"A sunny touch of peach adds a very fruity edge to the strawberry nose of this vivid, pale-pink sparkler.

The finish is dry and clean-cut.",88,Cave de Cleebourg NV Clérostein Pinot Noir Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),,,,

"This is a big, rich, ripe Zinfandel that tastes hotter and headier than its official alcohol reading of 14.6% abv. It's sweet with black cherry jam and raisins, with a chocolatey finish. Not for everyone, but a good example of the ripe Paso Robles style.",86,Proulx 2010 Swiss Colina Zinfandel (Paso Robles),,,,
"Aromatically, this wine does not want to give too much away yet. However, the citrus focus of its linear palate and the refreshment that it holds are already evident.

Complex and delicious, it finishes with a thickness of toast and black tea.",93,Talisman 2014 Sadie's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Hot, stalky aromas of red chili flake and weedy raspberry lead to a lean, tomatoey palate with flavors of tomato, dried berry, vanilla and especially dill weed.

Drink through 2023.",92,Albino Rocca 2013 Ronchi  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Schisty minerality infiltrates blackberry, cassis and raisin aromas. In the mouth, this is fully saturated and jammy. Flavors of blueberry and raisin suggest borderline overripeness, while the finish is jammy and pinched.",87,Scala Dei 2007 Cartoixa Red (Priorat),,,,

"Light golden in color, this is exotic in ginger and lemongrass, with a midpalate of fresh-cut pear and wet stone. Gearing up to the finish, expect deeper tones of caramel and tropical oak.",88,Bucher 2013 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Vanilla, wood shavings, charcoal and floral berry aromas come with a hint of minty green. The palate has a healthy but common grabbiness to it, with flavors of black cherry, cassis and herbs. Almost cloying on the finish, with candied notes and vanilla. A strange wine that doesn't fully come together.",85,Caliterra 2008 Tributo Single Vineyard Malbec (Colchagua Valley),,,,

"Made entirely with Merlot, this opens with subdued aromas of ripe plum and vanilla. The aromas carry through to the robust palate, together with tobacco and clove. Round tannins provide soft support. Drink through 2019.",89,Cafaggio 2011 Basilica del Pruneto Merlot (Toscana),,,,
"Beyond the hard edge of tannins, this is an extracted wine, with dark chocolate and wood flavors. The hints of fruit bring out a more gentle black currant ripeness, although they are far from developing well.",88,Château Rauzan-Gassies 2012  Margaux,,,,
"Fresh-squeezed apple juice, grapefruit spritzer and nearly sweet cherry aromas sit atop minerality on the nose of this blend of 46% Viognier, 19% Verdelho, 19% Vermentino and 16% Sauvignon Blanc. There's a lot of tart acidity, with a lingering apple flavor.",91,Vina Robles 2013 White4 White (Paso Robles),,,,
"This blend of 42% Petit Verdot, 36% Sangiovese and 22% Merlot shows strawberry, light caramel and expressive baking-spice aromas on the nose. A powerful burst of acidity starts the palate, which combines red currant and purple-flower flavors into a very interesting and lively wine.",91,Rancho Sisquoc 2015 Tre Vini Flood Family Vineyards Red (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Charred lamb, lilac and freshly paved streets make for a very savory entry to this excellent bottling—a partnership between longtime Santa Barbara County viticulturist Jeff Newton of Coastal Vineyard Care Associates and Villa Creek winemaker Cris Cherry. Tangy elderberry, black peppercorns, rosemary and lavender show on the sip, where gritty sticky tannins make for a memorably tarry expression from a new vineyard.",94,Villa Creek 2014 Rancho Boa Vista Vineyard Syrah (Ballard Canyon),,,,
"At first this wine seems quite astringent, closed and tight. It shows dark streaks of cassis and dried leaf, and it only reluctantly opens up to expand the black fruit flavor with a wash of Bourbon barrel.",89,Januik 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This is a richer, rounder version of rosé, with tropical mango and pineapple notes as well as lush peach aspects. Moderate acidity keeps it grounded and refreshing.",87,Balletto 2016 Estate Grown Rosé of Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Aromas of clamshell, tree bark and berry fruits are scattereshot. This has a noticeably sticky, syrupy feel along with candied, sweet flavors of black plum and baking spices. A chunky, sticky, sweet-tasting finish lacks cut and finesse.",83,Beach Kite 2013 Pinot Noir (Central Valley),,,,
"Leathery red berry aromas move to dark fruit after sitting in the glass. This Malbec is jammy in feel, but overall it's fresh. Earthy flavors of spiced plum, baked berry and salt finish toasty, woody and briny.",88,Santa Carolina 2011 Reserva de Familia Malbec (Rapel Valley),,,,
"Here's a unique blend of two of Campania's little known grapes, Casavecchia and Pallagrello Nero. It opens with a pretty fragrance of blue flower, ripe berries and spice. The soft, round palate offers red berry and fleshy blackberry accented by cinnamon-toast notes. Drink soon.",88,Terre del Principe 2012 Castello delle Femmine Red (Terre del Volturno),,,,
"A fine blend with 60% Tannat that has been softened and filled out by Cabernets Franc and Sauvignon. It still does have a firm tannic core although this is surrounded by ripe black fruits and acidity. It has all its bright fruit and so could age further, although it is now ready to drink.",90,Domaine du Moulié 2011 Red (Madiran),,,,
"The challenges of the 2010 vintage were ample, but Longboard has succeeded with this elegant Syrah. With fruit-forward blackberry, cherry, licorice and pepper flavors, it has a smoked meat note that recommends pairing it with barbecue, game birds, or a wild mushroom risotto, especially if you can slice a little truffle onto it.",90,Longboard 2010 Syrah (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Fresh, light, and deliciously refreshing, this summertime Grüner Veltliner is full of light, playful acidity and green currant fruits. It's crisp, easy to drink. Glass stopper.",86,Summerer 2007 Grüne Lady Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),,,,
"100% varietal, this wine displays an intriguing profile of savory herbs, nori, barrel spices and graphite with dark fruit lurking beneath the surface and a citrus twist. There's minimal excess alcoholic fat. It's all flavor, with lively acids, a supple, polished feel and good depth and intensity—especially impressive considering the youth of this site (2005 plantings).",92,Andrew Will 2011 May's Discovery Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"The light and soft bouquet offers faint glimmers of fresh-cut grass and tart green berries. More of the same unfolds in the mouth, with lime citrus and green gooseberry leading through to the crisp finish.",86,Vrede en Lust 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Elgin),,,,
"Soft and juicy, this is a bright cherry-flavored wine. It has a fine line of acidity to bring out the refreshing fruitiness and crisp aftertaste.",85,Collin-Bourisset 2015 Beaujo Chéri  (Beaujolais),,,,
"This bottling from young winemaker Michael Miroballi shows lime blossom, chalk, fresh rain on concrete and nectarine flesh on the nose. The palate is exuberant with flavors but they're not ripe, instead showing lime peels and juice, a cement-like grip and a buzzing sensation that overtakes the mouth like a Sichuan peppercorn.",92,Miroballi Wines 2013 Grenache Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Smoked meat, olives and mushroom lend a distinctly rustic flair to this late-release Merlot. Blackberry and cherry flavors are pristine and concentrated, but accented by hints of barnyard and astringent tannins that linger on the finish. Drink now through 2017.",87,Osprey's Dominion 2010 Reserve Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"Crisp and grassy, this is a classic herbaceous Sancerre. It is tight, bright and full of citrus fruits. Grapefruit dominates, cut through with acidity and the freshest aftertaste. Drink now.",86,Domaine de Bellecours 2013  Sancerre,,,,
"Soft and fruity, this tastes like cherry candy, with a slight suggestion of burnt toast. It's smooth and pleasant, a good everyday pizza red.",86,Cloudlift Cellars 2010 Panorama Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Damask rose and honeysuckle add their sumptuous perfume to the scent of ripe peaches. Balanced and bright, the palate conveys full-fruited notes of juicy yellow plums. This wine is all about fruit and blossom, spun in a web of rounded, warm freshness.",90,Cave de Cleebourg 2014 Prestige Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"Produced from the best parcels of the estate, this wine is structured, firm and concentrated. It is rich, hinting at dark chocolate flavors at this young stage along with dense tannins. As it matures, this will transform into a ripe and concentrated wine that is dark with black plum and juicy acidity. Drink from 2017.",90,Casal da Coelheira 2012 Mythos Red (Tejo),,,,
"This is a crisp, floral wine with apple and pear aromas that are unabashedly forward. It has lively acidity and a texture that's crisp, fresh and intensely minerally. Just a touch of creamy vanilla helps to fill the wine out. Drink now and until 2020.",88,Château Philippe-le-Hardi 2011 Clos Philippe-le-Hardi  (Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Beaune),,,,
"Winemaker: Gottfried Mocke. If you like herbal, minty Pinots, then this wine is definitely for you. Intense aromas of eucalyptus, rooibos tea, pomegranate, fennel bulb and currant leaf are at the forefront of the bouquet and carry through to the lifted, mentholated palate. The medium-weight palate offers fine yet structured tannins and a long, herbal finish. Drink now–2020.",89,Gottfried Mocke Wine Projects 2015 Cape Winemakers Guild Pinot Noir (Coastal Region),,,,
"This is a stalky, black currant and spice flavored wine. It has relatively soft tannins while showing a meaty, juicy character. The wine is for medium-term aging, so drink from 2016.",85,Château d'Escurac 2011  Médoc,,,,
"Smooth and ripe, this wine comes from vines planted in what was once a royal hunting ground. It is a full-bodied blend of Douro grapes with a more local southern variety, giving both structure and warmth. An impressively concentrated wine, it needs to age. Drink from 2019.",91,Quinta de Vale Veados 2014 Reserva Red (Tejo),,,,
"You won't find many wines like this on the market today. The blend is Tai grapes with 30% Sauvignon. The bouquet is broad and intense with complex aromas of peach, apricot, cinnamon, passion fruit, toasted almond and butterscotch. In the mouth, the texture is long, creamy and soft.",90,De Stefani 2010 Olmèra White (Veneto),,,,
"A blend of grapes including traditional Corvina and Rondinella undergoes air-drying for extra-rich concentration and intensity. That, with careful oak aging, has shaped a richly textured, dense wine that would pair with game meat or bean soup with smoked bacon. It shows raw, slightly chewy tannins on the close.",88,Allegrini 2007 Palazzo della Torre Red (Veronese),,,,
"Clean apple fruit with some yellow plum as well, this carries a whisper of citrus. It's a sleek elegant wine, that won't overpower you, nor obscure the flavors of more delicate foods such as prawns or whitefish.",90,Trisaetum 2015 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Struck flint and smoke lend shade to exuberant pineapple, mango and citrus flavors in this sprightly, honey-kissed Auslese. It's an approachable but elegant wine invigorated by whiffs of fresh green herbs and a touch of bitter pollen on the finish. A fantastic bargain find.",89,Leonard Kreusch 2013 Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Auslese Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Part of an impressive flight of Crozes, this wine stood out for its balance. It's fruit driven and succulent, yet firm and savory at the same time, marrying notes of mocha, blueberry and black olive. Drink now–2020.",90,Vidal-Fleury 2013  Crozes-Hermitage,,,,
"Key-lime rinds, pink grapefruit, crisp pluot, just-ripe pineapple, nectarine and a steely gunmetal aroma show on the nose of this bottling. There's an intriguing touch of sweet onion to the sip. The laser-sharp precision would pair well with shellfish, but a slightly buttered warmth makes the bottling quite versatile.",92,La Honda Winery 2015 Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"Focused and fresh, this wine starts with aromas of snappy lemon and slate, followed by sea salt, tropical fruit and citrus on the palate. The acid-fruit interplay offers an expressive but lively choice for pairing with salads, ethnic cuisine and fruit dishes.",90,Domaine Sigalas 2013 Assyrtico (Santorini),,,,
"A soft shade of yellow pink, this wine shows red apple, nectarine and a shred of lime rind on the nose. The palate offers slightly sour lime and underripe raspberry flavors as well as a unique and intriguing touch of fresh herbs.",87,Chloe 2015 Rosé (Monterey County),,,,
"This is the inaugural release of a tiny new project from winemaker James MacPhail and his wife, Kerry Forbes-MacPhail. Inspired by wines that “dance on the tongue,” it's a worthy debut, showcasing earthy, stemmy roses, herb, tar and tea, layered across a soft, juicy palate of baked orange marmalade and cardamom.",92,Tongue Dancer 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"The high acidity on this wine gives it a sharp and steely personality, especially on first impression. Those sharp edges will soften with time but the wine already shows slightly aged aromas of candied berries, tar, tobacco and leather. Pair it with creamy pasta dishes.",88,Cantine Leonardo 2008 Da Vinci  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"Earthy, spicy aromas of juniper, bell pepper and oak cover up slightly underripe berry scents. This has an acceptable level of tannic scratch and peppery, herbal berry fruit flavors. Like the rest of this Cab, the finish is lightly herbal, green-leaning and hard.",86,Ruca Malen 2011 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"To call it entry level does not do justice to the quality here—this would be reserve level at many wineries. A generous mix of blueberry and black cherry fruit rolls seamlessly through the fruit-driven core, annotated with barrel notes of cola, coffee and cream.",91,J. Christopher 2012 Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Opulent and rich, this is a fine expression of the dense mineral side of the Achleiten Vineyard. It has weight, and is packed with ripe peach and peppered pineapple flavors. It is obviously capable of aging for at least three years. Screwcap.",91,Domäne Wachau 2011 Achleiten  Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),,,,
"Tannins dominate here, the fruit offering some bright support. The wine is certainly firm, although it misses some concentration. But it is well balanced, berry fruits showing well against a drier core. The aftertaste offers freshness and acidity. Drink over the next year.",89,Louis Tête 2007 Les Charmeuses  (Morgon),,,,
"Berlucchi '61 Rosé is a fun and lively sparkler with berry, tropical fruit and toasted bread aromas. The palate delivers strawberry, pineapple and pastry notes and a dry walnut finish.",87,Berlucchi NV '61 Rosé Sparkling (Franciacorta),,,,
"This Pinot shows lots of style and classy elegance. Just past three years of age, it's still delicious in raspberries and cherries, but it's beginning to soften and show earthier, more complex notes of mushrooms and herbs. With a silky texture and fine acidity, it should continue its bottle path for another six years, at least.",92,Stewart 2010 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Fresh and fragrant, this offers aromas of rose and violet with a whiff of woodland berry. The elegant palate delivers bright red cherry, crushed strawberry, clove and peppercorn alongside polished tannins and fresh acidity. Drink through 2020.",90,Lornano 2010 Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"Fresh floral and peach-like aromas emerge from the nose of this pristine expression of Pinot Grigio from sunny Sicily. You'll get aromas of chopped herb, lemon and yellow rose. The mouthfeel is zesty and bright. Highly recommended at this low price.",86,MandraRossa 2008 Pinot Grigio (Sicilia),,,,
"Lots to admire in this wine, but it's not without its challenges. Likeable is the restrained alcohol and pleasant, silky texture that prevents heaviness. Flavorwise, there's a green, bell pepper streak to the riper cherries and black raspberries.",86,Qupé 2006 Purisima Mountain Grenache (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
Aromas of green apple and Bartlett pear lead the nose on this attractive blend of 90% Chardonnay and 10% Sauvignon. The creamy palate offers juicy white peach and tangerine brightened by fresh acidity.,88,Librandi 2013 Critone White (Val di Neto),,,,
"A controversial wine that will have its fans. Dryness and acidity make it a little sour, and a medicinal taste invades the citrus and tropical fruits.",84,Dragonette 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),,,,
"This is a little wayward and funky on the nose, with a lightly pickled aroma. It's a forward Cava with a yeasty, creamy feel. Its acidity and proper bubbles set up flavors of pastry, powdered sugar and sweet apple. The finish is quick, ending with a white-pepper flavor.",87,Agustí Torelló Mata 2009 Aliguer Brut Vintage Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"This wine's pinkish-coppery hue suggests a bit of skin contact, as does the silky texture on the palate. Hints of gingery spice accent flavors of poached pear, finishing on a dry, dusty note.",88,Fowles Wine 2015 Are You Game? Pinot Grigio (Victoria),,,,
"Black as coal, with a heavy, smoky, meaty nose, this is one of a growing number of excellent biodynamic Syrahs from Oregon. It marries tangy acids to chewy red and blue fruits, with streaks of coffee liqueur and caramel latté. Half was whole-cluster fermented, and it all spent time in 50% new French oak.",92,Cowhorn 2013 Reserve Syrah (Applegate Valley),,,,
"This twin county blend is a sophisticated Sauvignon Blanc. It shows the gooseberry tartness that Capture is known for, but not too much, with richer notes of citrus fruits and white flowers dominating. One quibble is that the wine is a little too sweet.",87,Captûre 2010 Tradition Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County-Sonoma County),,,,
"This opens with vanilla and sweet, powdery aromas. In the mouth, it's bubbly and foamy, with a mix of pickled citrus and dry apple flavors. The finish is crisp and dry like a soda cracker.",83,Tarantas 2011 Brut Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"Ripe, concentrated and bullish from the start, this has a roasted berry aroma that leads to a saturated, tannic palate. The flavors on this full-bodied Cabernet run from toasted and crusty to blackberry-like and minerally. Toastiness and a sense of darkness remain on the finish.",89,Misiones de Rengo 2010 Gran Reserva Cuvée Cabernet Sauvignon (Rapel Valley),,,,
"Cool, alluring aromas of ripe blackberry and fine oak are complete and highly attractive. A deep palate offers excellent balance, while flavors of cassis, blackberry, oak and delicate spices finish with power, elegance, length and an overriding sense of high quality. Drink through 2028.",94,Elias Mora 2010 Reserva  (Toro),,,,
"Light and vibrantly high in integrated acidity, this wine is complex and savory, but white pepper is a constant. Along the nuanced layers are an earthy patch of wild strawberry and cardamom that persists elegantly on the palate.",91,Joseph Phelps 2014 Freestone Vineyards Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"This is your quintessential simple quaff among brut cavas. It's clean, lime-tinged and soda-like on the nose, with a correct, no-issues palate that pushes zesty apple along with sweet papaya, mango and banana flavors. It's slightly sweet and tropical, but still it holds onto its crisp qualities and dryness. No complaints for the money.",87,Freixenet NV Cordon Negro Brut Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"Punchy plum and raspberry aromas are light and fresh, as is the palate, which introduces jumpy acidity to the equation. Like the nose, this tastes of basic red fruits, cherry and plum in particular, while the finish is persistently fruity. This is 54% Tempranillo and 46% Garnacha.",86,Albet I Noya 2014 Petit Albet Red (Catalunya),,,,
"The Marconnets vineyard on the slopes above Savigny-lès-Beaune produces some of the most perfumed wines in the appellation. This is typical, a wonderful medley of juicy, fruity aromas. It is still young, although temptingly attractive now. Drink ideally from 2018.",93,Roche de Bellene 2012 Les Marconnets Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),,,,
"This is a structured wine, showing the firm tannins of a 2010 Beaujolais. Under the dry surface, the rich, juicy fruit is there, balanced with acidity, red fruit and a dense texture. Age for at least another year.",90,Domaine Chasselay 2010 La Chapelle des Bois  (Fleurie),,,,
"Aromatics of raisin and earthy tobacco breathe complexities as this airs out. A balanced but ripe and mouthfilling palate holds deep flavors of blackberry and cassis. Loamy berry, fig and chocolate flavors provide pleasure on the finish. Drink through 2018.",90,Bueyes 2012 Malbec (Uco Valley),,,,
"Made from Sangiovese, this refreshing rosé has floral aromas of iris and white violet. The palate offers strawberry, crushed cherry and pink grapefruit flavors. Thanks to its crisp nature, this would work wonderfully with pizza.",87,Casalvento Radda 2012 Rosé Sangiovese (Toscana),,,,
"A blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Alicante and 5% Ciliegiolo, this wine has earthy aromas that recall wet soil, leather and pressed blue flower petals. The juicy palate delivers fleshy black cherry and raspberry. Notes of black pepper, espresso and Mediterranean herbs add interest.",88,Erik Banti 2010 Ciabatta  (Morellino di Scansano),,,,
"Aromas of black plum and green pepper set the scene for flavors of black cherry, blueberry and white chocolate. Tannins are a touch chalky, but fruit brightness takes the power seat and shines through on the zippy finish.",89,Vitkin 2012 Israeli Journey Red (Judean Hills),,,,
"A wine made entirely from Pinot Meunier is unusual. This perfumed wine with its soft acidity and open fruitiness suggests there should be more. It's an easy, apple and ripe pear flavored wine with acidity that gives everything an attractive lift.",89,H. Blin NV Blanc de Noirs Brut Pinot Meunier (Champagne),,,,
"Ripples of fleshy, almost overripe, black cherry and berry are mouth-filling and plush in this voluptuous Syrah. It's amply oaked, wafting of toasted coconut, vanilla and spice. Soft, sunny acidity and feathery tannins cushion a moderately long finish.",87,Sannino 2013 Bella Vita Vineyard Syrah (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"Bread crust and golden apple aromas lead the way and follow through to the lively palate along with citrus zest and toasted hazelnut. Bright acidity and brisk, persistent bubbles offset the rich flavors.",88,Monzio Compagnoni 2010 Satèn Brut Chardonnay (Franciacorta),,,,
"Ripe and soft, this is a smooth, dense wine. Yes, it has plenty of tannins, but they're smothered by the concentrated black fruit that gives it its generous, rich character. It's likely to age well, so drink from 2020.",91,Château Moulin de Guiet 2015  Côtes de Bourg,,,,
"This wine drinks qualitatively above and behind its low price, delivering light, clear color and tangy wisps of cranberry and citrus-tinged minerality. With a depth of character that builds on the midpalate, it finishes lean and crisp, a wonderfully elegant expression of the variety.",91,Broken Clouds 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Herbal, tomatoey red-berry aromas lead to a fleshy, fresh palate with barely any structure. Plum, currant and herbal flavors finish solid, with basic flavors of oak and spice.",86,Bodega Norton 2014 Barrel Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"Young Touriga Nacional vines produced this crisp, refreshing wine. With red currant flavor and a light touch of caramel, it's both fruity and full in the mouth. Drink now.",86,Colinas do Douro 2015 Superior Rosé (Douro),,,,
Pellehaut likes blends and this wine has seven varieties. The result brings out more of the cool herbal character of Colombard and Sauvignon Blanc and less of the riper flavors of Chardonnay. That makes for a surprisingly attractive spice and asparagus flavored wine that has lines of acidity and tightly crisp citrus fruit flavors. Drink now.,85,Domaine de Pellehaut 2015 Harmonie de Gascogne White (Côtes de Gascogne),,,,
"This blend of Pinot Bianco, Friulano, Sauvignon and Ribolla Gialla has oak, butterscotch and pressed acacia flower aromas. They carry over to the tangy, linear palate, along with pineapple and citrus zest flavors. A toasted almond note leaves a lingering, rather bitter finish.",89,Russiz Superiore 2013 Col Disore White (Collio),,,,
"This wine is closed and still very young. For the moment, acidity dominates, although plenty of ripe apples and peaches are waiting to come out. Drink from 2017.",88,Domaine Sangouard-Guyot 2014 En Brûle  (Saint-Véran),,,,
"This fresh and crisp raspberry-flavored wine is refreshing. It is all fruit with just a touch of tangy lemon zest to give extra freshness. The largest single plot of vines in Beaujolais and Burgundy, 244 acres in Bruilly cru, the estate has been in the same family since 1667 and is a historical monument.",86,Château de la Chaize 2014 Gamay (Beaujolais Rosé),,,,
"Lots of upfront lemon, lime, orange and tropical fruit flavors in this wine, which is balanced with crisp acidity and finishes dry. A tang of minerality helps to make it clean and vibrant. Great food wine, especially with Asian fare.",87,Concannon 2010 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey County),,,,
"Nicely aromatic, this offers scents and follow-up flavors of cherry cola, with a dusting of sweet hay. It's authoritative without being over-amped—the classic iron fist in the velvet glove. Notes of earth and iron add interest to the finish.",90,River's Edge 2013 Elkton Cuvée Pinot Noir (Elkton Oregon),,,,
"An attractive rosé, made from 100% Castelão, the local grape of Setúbal peninsula. It is crisp with citrus and ripe with raspberry giving a fine balance and refreshing character. Drink now.",85,Wines & Winemakers 2015 Pegos Claros Rosé (Palmela),,,,
"This blend of 43% Grenache, 20% Cinsault, 20% Syrah and 17% Petite Sirah offers boisterous berry, cherry and plum-juice aromas on the nose. Black-cherry juice flavors dominate the ripe palate. This would make a great wine for backyard barbecues with burgers and ribs.",86,Robert Hall 2014 Cuvée de Robles Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"High-toned, raw aromas of cherry and currant are backed by toasty oak and mint. Lively and lifted as well as choppy in feel, this tastes mostly of char, plum and peppery spice. Things blacken up on a hot, firm, toasty finish.",85,Sottano 2011 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"The perfumes of Touriga Nacional dominate this soft, smooth wine. A layer of tannins gives structure, and the ripeness of the fruit creates a delicious, full-bodied wine.",89,Magnum Vinhos 2015 Ribeiro Santo Red (Dão),,,,
"A delightful wine, softly round and mellow, with flavors of apricots, peaches, limes, honey and minerals that are accented with just-in-time acidity.",87,Keller Estate 2011 La Cruz Vineyard Pinot Gris (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"The nose is a little subdued but the palate comes in with fresh, tart and aromatic apple notes. The palate is slender and dry, and driven by refreshing lively apple notes of both Granny Smith and Red Delicious.",89,La Cave des Vignerons de Pfaffenheim 2016 Tradition Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"Opens in a soft, dusty, melony way, with cider-like flavors, melon and dryness as opposed to chiseled zest. Satisfying but on the bland side, with cider on the finish. Good for casual consumption but unexciting.",85,François Lurton 2009 Hacienda Araucano Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),,,,
"Accents of vanilla, spice and coconut waft boldly from nose to finish on this lavishly oaked Cabernet Franc. There's plenty of concentrated red-cherry-preserve flavor on the palate too though, tinged by savory touches of herb and bramble. It's rich and full bodied with firm tannins bracing the finish. Drink now through 2023.",89,Lamoreaux Landing 2013 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This opens with aromas suggesting moist underbrush, tilled soil and a hint of dried herb. The bright, lithe palate offers black cherry and white pepper while silky tannins and vibrant acidity provide the easygoing framework. It finishes on a grilled herb note.",87,La Mannella 2014  Rosso di Montalcino,,,,
"Superb at every checkpoint, this is a world-class wine. Cherry, cassis and earth aromas are spicy and mellow, not bullish or loud. This feels creamy but with enough textural grit to keep things lively, while flavors of vanilla, tobacco and plum are nicely integrated. A mild, medium-long finish epitomizes elegance. Drink now through 2025.",95,Marqués de Murrieta 2005 Castillo Ygay Gran Reserva Especial  (Rioja),,,,
"This wine is dark and extracted, with bitter chocolate flavors as well as hints of black-currant fruit. It does have weight and structure that could develop, but will need time, so wait until 2020.",87,Château Saint-Pierre 2013  Saint-Julien,,,,
"The wine is soft, and full of fruit with attractive spicy black currant flavors. Dominated by the rounded Tinta Roriz, it is an easy wine to drink young.",86,Rui Roboredo Madeira 2015 Castello d'Alba Colheita Red (Douro),,,,
"Herbes de Provence, lavender soap and baked cherry scents meld with a background of desiccated black fruit. Medium to full in body, this bears brawny tannins and assertive acids, making it a great wine to pair with hearty dishes like sausage-studded Catalonian bean stew.",87,Three Fox 2010 La Dolce Vita Piemontese Nebbiolo (Virginia),,,,
"This is an organically farmed blend of Sangiovese (80%) and Syrah (20%) with elegant mineral tones at the back of red berry, smoke and campfire. Elegance and harmony stand out here and the flavors are smoky and ashy.",90,Montebelli 2005 Acantòs Sangiovese (Toscana),,,,
"This 50-50 blend of Inzolia and Catarratto opens with aromas of white flower and honey, followed by a fat, thick palate.",84,Feudi del Pisciotto 2011 Baglio del Sole White (Sicilia),,,,
It's not clear what separates this from some of the other estate-grown cuvées. The thin strawberry fruit accompanies rather stemmy tannins and a green vegetal streak.,85,Montinore 2013 Cataclysm Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"The Savagnin grape is rarely found outside the Jura. Here it gives an unusual wine, like a dry Sherry, yeasty and with intense acidity to go with the dry, tangy texture. Drink now.",87,Domaine de Savagny 2011 Savagnin (Côtes du Jura),,,,
"Sourced from estate vineyards, this is aged in a mix of new and neutral French oak. Baking spices, gingerbread, cassis, earth, umami, soy and balsamic elements combine in a complex, distinctive and powerful wine with another decade of development ahead. Decant if drinking soon, or cellar until 2025.",92,Beresan 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),,,,
"Ripe aromas of passionfruit, kiwi and nectarine rise alongside greener elements of celery stalk, wet thyme and Granny Smith apple on this promising early look at the vintage. The tongue tingles throughout the sip, with flavors of crisp apple, yellow melon and crushed chalk. Buttercream appears on the finish.",93,Alma Rosa 2013 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"This Picolit is light in color and lean in form but it does do a very good job of presenting elegant aromas and nuances. You'll recognize sweet honey, almond, orange zest and subdued herbal tones. It's young and fresh in spirit.",90,Marco Cecchini 2005 Picolit (Colli Orientali del Friuli),,,,
"Yeasty aromas include briny notes of citrus and stone fruits, while on the palate, this is tangy and tight. Flavors of briny citrus, pickle and kimchee are zesty on a finish. This is not clean like polished crystal; funk and brine are key players on this Cava.",88,Segura Viudas NV Gran Cuvée Reserva Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"This has initial aromas of raisin and underbrush, followed by hints of toasted oak and espresso. The palate shows evident alcohol sensations, with black cherry, fig and coffee flavors relegated to the background.",86,Bolla 2011 Le Poiane  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso),,,,
"A touch overripe and indulgent, this Chard needs a little more vibrancy to enliven its heavy character. Mushy peaches, banana and mealy cantaloupe emanate from the bouquet while flavors of buttered popcorn and oaky spice dominate the palate. Try with a heavy cream-based dish to downplay the wine's own richness.",86,Thelema 2008 Chardonnay (Stellenbosch),,,,
"This medium-bodied Chard has some butterscotch notes on the nose, but thankfully lacks similarly overpowering flavors on the palate. Some citrus flavors accent the wine's peachy core; finishes a little watery.",85,Yering Station 2000 Chardonnay (Yarra Valley),,,,
"This is a blend of 85% Pinot Noir and 15% Lemberger—and yet the Lemberger is the dominant grape. The color is dark, the aromas and flavors are chunky and less nuanced than pure Pinot Noir, and the tannins are ripe but lack the silky character of Pinot. It's a solid, robust red that would make a nice match for burgers and the like.",88,Weingut Burg Ravensburg 2007 Noir Dry Pinot Noir (Baden),,,,
"Whiffs of spice and slate lend complexity to plump, sunny peach and yellow plum flavors in this off-dry Riesling. It's fruity, approachable and easy, yet elegantly balanced.",90,Dr. Hermann 2014 Ürziger Würzgarten Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"This opens with rustic aromas of barnyard, wet animal fur, game and overripe black fruit. The overripe quality carries over the palate along with notes of bacon, rubber and fleshy blackberry. It finishes on an unpleasantly bitter note.",83,Mocavero 2010 Puteus Riserva Red (Salice Salentino),,,,
"Winemaker Bruno Corneaux keeps a tight grip on alcohol levels, without sacrificing ripeness, flavor or balance. This aromatically compelling wine jumps up with scents of sea breeze, toasted nuts and buttered popcorn. Flavors follow, with apples, vanilla and toast coming to a full-bodied lingering finish. There's ample length and tension to age gracefully for another decade.",92,Domaine Divio 2015 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),,,,
"A thick, sweet and meaty dessert wine made from older vines, this offers a richness of Dr Pepper, baked plum and dried cherry.",88,David Clinton 2012 Forté Unti Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Vigneto La Villa opens with ripe, pulpy fruit and fresh aromas of plum, blackberry, crushed mineral and exotic spice. The wine takes on a ruby color and there is slight browning on the edges. The mouthfeel shows great balance between the fresh acidity and drying tannins. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers.",91,Seghesio 2006 Vigneto La Villa  (Barolo),,,,
"Wreaths of smoke surround pretty raspberry aromatics. The red and plummy purple-fruit flavors continue, along with some tannic muscle and grip. This is a mix of 667 and Pommard clones—still young and a bit tight.",92,Domaine Serene 2014 Côte Sud Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),,,,
"This blend is proprietors Claire and Gonzague Lurton's foray into California fruit: the two of them together owner several estates in Bordeaux. Their estate vineyard site, still in replanting mode, sits atop a compelling knoll atop Chalk Hill. Leathery and smoky, this wine is classically styled in currant and pencil lead, with a dry, restrained body that lingers on the palate.",92,Acaibo 2013 Red (Sonoma County),,,,
"Great price for a Chardonnay that tastes like it costs a lot more. Although it's unoaked, it's very rich in passionfruit, pineapple, peach and vanilla cream flavors, with a honeyed finish. Easy to find, with 5,000 cases produced.",88,Healdsburg Ranches 2009 Unoaked Chardonnay (Sonoma County),,,,
"A wine from one of the group of premier crus that are in the east of Chablis, this is stylish, crisp and comes with a fine line of minerals running through it. It has yellow fruits, vanilla and a hint of honey. That contrasts with the mineral acidity that gives the wine its elegant aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",92,Domaine Gueguen 2015 Vosgros Premier Cru  (Chablis),,,,
"Subtle aromas of yellow peach, golden apple and honeydew melon lead off. However the palate is rather lean, with citrus and mineral notes alongside bracing acidity but not much fruit richness.",86,Sandro de Bruno 2010 Monte San Piero  (Soave Superiore),,,,
"A new wine from Chile's Veramonte, this starts with huge cola and blackberry aromas. which are backed by grippy tannins and mild astringency. It tastes bulky, bearing grippy tannins and mild astringency, with leather and blackberry notes. Coffee and spice flavors control the finish on this ripe Malbec.",88,Primus 2010 Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Inviting floral notes open the aromatics of this wine. These evolve into a thick palate of melon and citrus, the finish light and high in acidity. Straightforward and balanced, it's a quaffer.",86,Wattle Creek 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),,,,
"There is a slight pepper character in this wine with its ripe fruits and fresh acidity. The result is a balanced wine that is not just about fruitiness but also full of character and with some complexity. The wine can be drunk now, although it will be better from the end of 2016.",90,Quinta de Soalheiro 2015 Alvarinho (Vinho Verde),,,,
"Combine prune, leather and spice notes with firm tannins and the result is a slightly rustic, old-school expression of Vacqueyras. It's concentrated and characterful, with up to a decade of aging potential.",88,Les Vins de Vienne 2009 La Sillote Red (Vacqueyras),,,,
"Tightly wound and sculpted fruit anchors an appealing Chardonnay with ample influence from barrel aging. In this excellent, fruit-forward vintage, plenty of weight characterizes the core apple flavors, which are wrapped in a lush coating of toast, butter pecan and nougat.",90,Carabella 2012 Dijon 76 Estate Chardonnay (Chehalem Mountains),,,,
"Light berry aromas and a hint of spice open up this generic but solidly made Malbec-Merlot blend. Strawberry and raspberry are the lead flavors, with pepper on the finish. Not very evolved or complex, but good enough.",84,Benvenuto de la Serna 2005 Blend Malbec-Merlot (Uco Valley),,,,
"Densely textured, this has firm and dark tannins. Powerful notes of rich berry and stone fruit give weight to this concentrated wine. This needs time to age.",88,Château Turcaud 2010  Bordeaux,,,,
"This is pungent stuff—redolent of sweaty socks and nettles—but it's also concentrated and intense, balancing out those strident aromas with round, ample flavors of melon and green tomato. It's leafy, fresh and assertive on the finish. Drink now.",89,Catalina Sounds 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"Pizzolato brings us an easygoing Pinot Grigio with a thin, watery mouthfeel and measured aromas of citrus, white mineral and passion fruit. This informal style of wine works well at outdoor lunches and barbecues.",84,Pizzolato 2008 Pinot Grigio (Piave),,,,
"As Italy's first Prosecco with sleeve packaging, this offers a cheerful and carefree expression, with sweet tones of peach and melon on the finish.",86,Anna Spinato NV 4or Extra Dry  (Prosecco),,,,
"Wines like this are why Americans can't get enough Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. Passion fruit and nectarine are joined by spicy hints of jalapeño, creating a fine balance of round, tropical fruit with peppery piquancy that leaves the mouth watering.",89,Allan Scott 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"This is big and juicy, with extra weight imparted by the wood aging. Its flavors of spice and red fruit are laced with acidity. Full bodied and forward, this is quite drinkable.",87,José Maria da Fonseca 2009 Periquita Reserva Red (Setubal),,,,
"This seductive Brunello portrays aromas of black fruit, vanilla, brown sugar, plums and prunes wrapped within a thin veil of smoke. It's a wine that reaches a comfortable level of intensity and balance and that offers mouth-puckering flavors of sour cherry on the finish.",91,Tenuta Crocedimezzo 2004  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Fresh and linear, this offers spring wild flower and white stone fruit aromas while the luminous palate offers Bosc pear, citrus and a hint of white almond. It has a bright, slightly tangy finish.",88,Gianni Tessari 2016 Monte Tenda  (Soave Classico),,,,
"This wine's aromas of baked apple, honey, cinnamon and brown sugar are immediately attractive, and in the mouth it doesn't disappoint. It's broad and mouthfilling but avoids heaviness, finishing long, with hints of orange rind.",91,Willi Haag 2006 Brauneberger Juffer Spätlese Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer),,,,
"Opens with a warm, baked nose of raisin, roasted plum and tobacco. The palate is scouring and crisp due to sharp acids, and thus the flavors follow suit in that they're lean and tart and focus on pie cherry and red plum. Lean, zesty and lively Rioja to drink now.",86,Bodegas Muriel 2005 Vendimia Seleccionada Crianza  (Rioja),,,,
"This handsome, full-bodied wine has aromas of dark cherry and toasted oak, flavors like ripe plums and vanilla and a velvety mouthfeel due to good acidity and fine-grained tannins.",89,Oak Farm 2013 Barbera (Lodi),,,,
"Roasted berry, black pepper and mild leafy aromas are true to the region. The palate is full but not heavy or clumsy; flavors of earthy berry fruits show a touch of raisin, while the finish is loamy and smooth. Drink this approachable wine now through 2018.",91,Bodegas Bilbainas 2006 Viña Pomal Gran Riserva  (Rioja),,,,
"A first-release from this site, this is a balanced, lightly textured wine, pretty in rose and lavender, with an intriguing shock of white pepper. Baked cherry and plum find companionship in savory clove and cinnamon on the delicate palate.",93,Small Vines 2014 TBH Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"This is fresh and lively, with aromas of apple juice, pine nuts, lime peel and chalk. Cut grass, lemon juice and white rock minerality show on the palate.",87,Tangent 2013 Paragon Vineyard Albariño (Edna Valley),,,,
"An attractively balanced wine, this is ripe but fresh. The raspberry and orange fruits are vivid and well etched into the structure of the wine.",87,Les Maîtres Vignerons de la Presqu'île de Saint-Tropez 2011 Cave de Saint-Roch les Vignes Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"This is on the pungent side, boasting aromas of boxwood and white grapefruit. Try it with a ceviche or herb-steamed mussels to lessen the impact, or embrace the potent, leaf-inflected flavors on their own. Either way, savor the silky texture and crisp, vibrant finish.",90,Forrest 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"This rich, smoke- and wood-flavored wine shows great potential. It also has plenty of black fruits that give it a ripe full character. The spice from wood aging is still right up front and needs time to settle down to become a dense, balanced wine with fruit and structure all in place. Drink from 2019.",92,Casa Agricola Alexandre Relvas 2015 Herdade de São Miguel Alicante Bouschet (Alentejano),,,,
"Brown sugar and chocolate make for a hedonistic experience in this brawny, powerful wine. It's well-composed in smoky char, juicy blackberry and a full-bodied finish of black pepper.",87,Puccioni 2012 Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"A full, yeasty wine, this has gentle acidity, with a touch of smokiness as well as a note of apple It feels full, without the necessary crispness.",85,Bründlmayer NV Extra Brut Sparkling (Österreichischer Sekt),,,,
"Candied apricot dominates on the nose and palate of this vineyard-designated wine that is fleshy and reflective of its five months in new French oak. Creamy and round, it finishes ripe and rich.",86,Provenance Vineyards 2014 Wildwood Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford),,,,
"Chatons, which means “kittens,” indicates this is a younger style of wine from Château du Cèdre. The dark, perfumed, mint and black berry flavored fruits give richness and precociousness. The wine is going to develop over the short term so drink from 2016.",87,Château du Cèdre 2011 Chatons du Cèdre Malbec-Merlot (Cahors),,,,
"Bonterra is offering up some serious yumminess here, from organic grapes grown in Lake County. The sweet wine opens with a sweet floral nose and a lot of minerality graduating into a concentrated thickness of golden honey-graham flavors.",90,Bonterra 2010 Bartolucci Vineyard Muscat (Lake County),,,,
"Blossomy and perfumed, this exuberant Viognier offers loads of juicy cantaloupe and tangerine flavors. It's uncharacteristically light in body, lacking the variety's typical heft and unctuousness, but its crisp refreshing style makes it quite quaffable.",89,Bedell 2015 Viognier (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"The entry wine of Château Lagrezette lives up to its name in the color. With its soft tannins, touch of smokiness and blackberry-juice fruit flavors, it's a fine showpiece for the more open side of Malbec.",86,Château Lagrézette 2011 Purple Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"The winery actually released this wine after the 2007, no doubt to give it the extra bottle age needed. Nonetheless, it's still quite tannic, bringing to mind an older style of Howell Mountain Cabernet. It's refreshing to have an ageable alternative to the soft, sweet modern style. Rich in mountain blackberries and sweet currants, this wine should develop over the next decade.",94,Camiana 2006 Blue Hall Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),,,,
"This wine has the plucky character typical of Greece, but with a polished spin. The nose is allspice, cherry and cocoa, and on the palate, dried fruits, coffee, mesquite smoke and chocolate. The wine finishes spicy and clean. Good, if not a bit aggressive. Pair with meat or hearty fare.",85,Estate Constantin Gofas 2008 Agiorgitiko (Nemea),,,,
"A strongly wood-aged wine, firm, spicy and with a burnt edge. Chocolate and black plum-skin fruit combine in this strongly tannic wine. There is, though, a smooth element from the ripe Merlot in the blend, giving potential richness in 2–3 years.",88,Château de Parenchère 2011 Cuvée Raphaël  (Bordeaux Supérieur),,,,
"This is a structured, still young and extracted wine, with dark tannins and spice from the wood aging. In the background, the red-berry fruits are developing and filling out to give a balance to the wine. Drink from 2017.",87,Les Vignobles Gueissard 2013 Les Papilles Red (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"There is an earthy touch to the almost overripe peach notes on the nose. The palate adds both sweetness and a subtle welcome hint of phenolic bitterness to the peachy fruit. Bright lemon freshness cuts through the medium-sweet palate to provide a fresh, almost lip-smacking finish. This wine is full of ripe expressive fruit flavors, giving equal billing to lemon and peach.",92,Jean-Marc Bernhard 2015 Mambourg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"Barrel fermented in new French oak, then pulled out and put into neutral oak. So the acids are softened, the wine gains some flesh, and there are nuances of toast and butter without overwhelming the fruit.",88,Guardian 2007 Angel Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This biodynamic Rhône blend is equal parts of Marsanne, Roussanne and Viognier, co-fermented with native yeast. It's a splendid example of the non-interventionist style, rich, and textural. The yeasty flavors are refreshing—pear and apple and cucumber fruit holding down the center—clean and solid. The wine gains power and brings in some toasty barrel flavors as it rolls into the finish.",90,Cowhorn 2009 Spiral 36 White (Applegate Valley),,,,
"Either this producer is one of the most honest when it comes to listing alcohol levels or this is as close to Port as it gets, a Primitivo that's got some cherry brightness to it, but gets bogged down by its own bigness.",85,Rosa d'Oro 2009 Estate Primitivo (Clear Lake),,,,
"There are two kinds of great California Pinots: delicate and massive. This is massive. It's dark, tannic and powerful in fruit, but is so rich, so complex and interesting, you just can't keep from drinking it. Explodes with black cherry, currant, cola, mocha and smoky spice flavors. Now through 2012.",93,Morgan 2006 Double L Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"A light, softly spiced nose of pineapple, apricot and honey starts this elegant wine off right. On the palate, fresh, clean, friendly flavors are unfolding but instantly likeable. A food-friendly sip that will pair with fish, poultry and ethnic cuisine.",87,Allée Bleue 2007 Chenin Blanc (Western Cape),,,,
"A unique blend of Tempranillo (54%), Malbec (33%) and Mourvèdre, this wine leads with aromas of vanilla, coconut and woodspice followed by blue and black fruit. The dark-fruit flavors are restrained in feel with barrel notes on the finish. It brings enjoyment but the wood seems very primary.",88,Stottle 2012 Hombre Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This Cabernet-Agiorgitiko blend has a big personality, starting with aromas of chocolate-covered cherry, rich black fruit and pepper. Red and black fruit, spice and a touch of flowers on the palate are buoyed by a fresh acidity and chalkiness on the palate. A touch spicy and fiery, but a fun wine with character.",85,Domaine Costa Lazaridi 2007 Oenotria Land Cabernet Sauvignon Agiorgitiko Red (Attica),,,,
"This wine carries fairly broad fruit flavors of mixed red fruits, along with leaf and earth. Tannins are well managed; the finish light and fruity.",84,Wooldridge Creek 1998 Cabernet Sauvignon (Applegate Valley),,,,
"Lighter in color, this blend of Conner Lee, Red Mountain Vineyard and Elephant Mountain fruit has aromas of freshly brewed coffee, dark chocolate, toasty barrel spices and red fruit, with the barrel notes taking the lead. It's silky-soft in feel, with generous raspberry flavors that show a pleasing sense of balance, all backed by a light squeeze of tannins.",90,J. Bookwalter 2012 Foreshadow Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Made mainly with Syrah, this wine's flavors are potent in blackberries, cherries, black pepper and smoky, salty meats. The tannins are big, but negotiable. Feels rustic and hot, and at its best now.",87,Hearthstone 2008 Lodestone G-S-M (Paso Robles),,,,
"Salinic upon opening, with thick, candied blackberry aromas along with orange peel. The wine is sincerely syrupy and rich for a value-priced Malbec, but it struggles with balance and comes across heavy, roasted and loaded down with candied berry and milk chocolate flavors.",84,Alta Vista 2009 Classic Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Made from equal proportions of Tempranillo and Garnacha from the winery's estate vineyard, this young wine is barrel forward with notes of char, toast and mocha. The fruit flavors are light and juicy with cranberry and barrel spices extending through the finish.",87,Jaxon 2011 Tradición Red (Rogue Valley),,,,
"Dense and heavy, and maybe a touch dull on the nose in terms of fruit aromas. But once it hits the palate the wine shines with intense black fruit, sugar beet and chocolate flavors. The finish is toasty and warm, with saturation and texture. Almost over the edge as far as ripeness, but not quite. Drink now through 2012.",91,García Figuero 2005 Vendimia Seleccionada  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"For a Cahors, this is a surprisingly light and gently fruity wine. It is dry, with some tannic character, but it is much more about youthful black fruit flavors than it is about structure. It is ready to drink now",84,Clément Bosquet 2014 Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"An incredibly balanced wine where red cherry fruit marries with velvety tannins, medium body and clean-cut acidity and cinnamon hints in the background. This is an ideal, unobtrusive but delicious food wine that will perform no matter what.",89,Hannes Reeh 2012 Zweigelt (Neusiedlersee),,,,
"Chocolate milk, with a squeeze of cassis liqueur and the sweet vanillins of toasted oak, are the flavors. With the high alcohol, it's almost a dessert wine. Give it credit for a heady opulence.",85,Cerro Prieto 2009 La Teresa Bloc Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"This Domaine, based in the Pouilly-Fumé region across the Loire, also has vines in Sancerre. The wine is rich, with melon and juicy apple flavors. Its acidity and steely texture form a contrast to its deliciously refreshing character. Drink now.",90,Domaine Tinel-Blondelet 2015 Frétoy  (Sancerre),,,,
"Manfred Prüm's 2009 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Kabinett is a bit bigger than usual, and perhaps a bit drier as well at 9% abv, but it still displays hallmark notes of slate, lime and apple. Fruit, mineral and gingery spice notes linger on the finish.",90,Joh. Jos. Prüm 2009 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"This is the entry-level wine from Vallado, bright and fruity, with an attractive red-berry flavor and a solid, tannic core. As is typical with the 2010 vintage, it has some structure and should be aged for another year.",88,Quinta do Vallado 2010 Vallado Red (Douro),,,,
"This is not a shy wine—it is concentrated and powerful, with ripe tannins and dense black fruits. Coming from vineyards in the Douro Superior, this shows the region's the heat and harsh growing conditions, giving a compact, firm wine with a mineral texture to balance the juicy fruits. It will need several years, so drink from 2017.",91,Companhia das Quintas 2012 Quinta da Fronteira Reserva Red (Douro),,,,
"Aromas of dry underbrush, toast, oak and eucalyptus lead the nose. The palate is already quite evolved, offering dried red cherry, espresso and a hint of anise alongside close-grained tannins that dry out the rather abrupt finish. Drink sooner rather than later.",87,La Collina dei Lecci 2010 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"This blend holds fruit from Olsen and Red Willow vineyards. Aromas start out lightly reduced, followed by notes of stone fruit, spice and mineral. The peach flavors are full bodied, bringing generosity and appeal.",89,Mark Ryan 2015 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This has earthy aromas suggesting underbrush, new leather, menthol and truffle, along with a whiff of medicinal herb. The palate is tightly wound and still rather closed, offering hints of espresso, anise and raw berry framed by drying, close-grained tannins.",88,Nada Fiorenzo 2013 Montaribaldi  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Bright aromas of toast, spice and pear are followed by medium-bodied fruit flavors that persist on the finish.",88,Dunham 2015 Shirley Mays Lewis Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Hailing from the heart of the historic Cannubi vineyard, this polished wine opens with notes of black fruit, violet, leather and baking spices. The palate offers black raspberry, crushed cherry, clove and vanilla alongside brisk acidity and firm tannins. It's already accessible but will improve over the next four to five years and then evolve gracefully for decades. Drink 2018–2038.",94,Borgogno F.lli Serio e Battista 2010 Cannubi  (Barolo),,,,
"This creamy and viscous white from one of the valley's cooler appellations is kept fresh and lively by moderate acidity. Its fruit is of the lush peach and nectarine variety, laced with vanilla.",90,Materra Cunat Family Vineyards 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Oak Knoll District),,,,
"Extremely dry lime and green pepper aromas don't really roll out the welcome mat. Nor are the lean, tangy green flavors fully up to par. However, served chilled in a less than formal setting, say a picnic, it should work well enough. There's ample citrus and zest to save the day.",85,Brancott 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"This shows a lean, silky texture, with a touch of bright alcohol on the finish. Its a finely-textured wine that's redolent of wild berry, cola and white cherry.",89,Tenute Cisa Asinari dei Marchesi di Gresy 2009 Martinenga  (Barbaresco),,,,
"A blend of 70% Syrah, 20% Grenache and 10% Mourvèdre, this wine is quite perfumed, with intense aromas of spiced black cherry, forest berry and licorice. The medium-weight palate is plush and mouthfilling, with velvety tannins lending structure to the ripe black-fruit flavors, alongside a touch of graphite. The enduring finish beams with notes of licorice and black pepper.",90,Château du Prieuré des Mourgues 2012 Grande Réserve Red (Saint-Chinian),,,,
"A pleasantly rich Chardonnay, brimming with white peach, pineapple, lemon tart and buttered toast flavors. Gets better as it breathes in the glass. Drink now.",88,Tayson Pierce 2008 Alder Springs Vineyard Chardonnay (Mendocino),,,,
"This is a finely made, easy to drink wine. It is soft, round, with spice and light tannins, a wine that would travel to parties, barbecues and pasta bakes. The acidity from the blackberry flavor keeps it fresh and fruity.",87,Falua 2012 Tagus Creek Shiraz and Trincadeira Red (Alentejano),,,,
"Prickly foxy aromas are mildly pyrazinic. While this Pedro Ximénez feels plump and mostly healthy, it's short and simple in terms of flavors, with a note of briny citrus prior to a low-intensity finish.",84,Cucao 2014 Reserva Pedro Ximénez (Elqui Valley),,,,
"Sweet fruit dominates this attractive, spicy wine. It has ample acidity, giving a fine, fresh black-currant character and tannins that are already melding into the wine. For medium-term aging of 3–5 years.",88,Château Lamothe-Cissac 2011  Haut-Médoc,,,,
"There's something wonderfully intriguing about Dr. Konstantin Frank's Rkatsiteli, an ancient Georgian grape variety that pays homage to the original Dr. Frank's European roots. Fragrant with fresh apples, sweet figs and a subdued paraffin note, it's a light profile wine, but with a uniquely luscious mouthfeel. Well balanced with a clean minerality and bright, sour tangerine acidity, there's a touch of salinity in the finish that makes it a fabulous companion to seafood.",86,Dr. Konstantin Frank 2008 Rkatsiteli (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This wine is cherry red with soft brown tinges, offering a nose of cherry with notes of summer farmstand. The predominant flavor is of tart cherry, interlaced with hints of red raspberry and bell pepper.",89,Gantenbein 2011 Pinot Noir (Switzerland),,,,
"This opens with funky, earthy notes of blueberry, juniper and animal hide. The palate is chunky and jammy, which is welcome given 2011's cold conditions. Flavors of herbal blackberry, baked plum and spice finish with a note of green and heat as well as with acidic freshness.",88,Echeverria 2011 Reserva Syrah (Maipo Valley-Colchagua Valley),,,,
"A perfumed wine with red fruits, this offers dry tannins and a dense texture. With all these elements in place, the wine will develop slowly and well. Drink from 2021.",93,Tollot Beaut et Fils 2014 Les Grèves Premier Cru  (Beaune),,,,
"From the best parcels at Haute-Serre, this prestige cuvée is big, powerful and certainly full of the ripest fruit. Strong wood aging and chocolate flavors show the firm extraction of this very concentrated wine. It needs considerable time to soften and open up. Drink from 2017.",92,Georges Vigouroux 2010 Château de Haute-Serre Cuvée Géron Dadine de Haute-Serre Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"This wine is marked by dry tannins and is smoky and toasty, with little sign of fruit. While it will soften, it will stay somewhat tough.",84,Domaine de l'Aurage 2015  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,,,,
"Pure Mourvèdre remains a rare bird of a wine, even in grape-happy Washington State. This is a good example, with flavors that carry the leafy, herbal character often found in Carmenère and the bright, mineral-laced fruit of southern French wines. It's not a big wine, and the vines from which the grapes are sourced are still young, but it's well made and will hold your interest.",88,Dowsett Family 2010 Heart of the Hill Vineyard Mourvèdre (Red Mountain),,,,
"The perfumed, otherworldly scent of blood orange works its charm on the nose of this lovely wine. The palate is equally juicy and aromatic: tart and soft, edgy and pliant, plump and lip-smacking, juicy and bracing. The palate is streamlined and fresh, hinting constantly at this world of flavor, if you only give in to it—so moreish, so long.",94,Hirsch 2015 Heiligenstein Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),,,,
"There's a candied tone on this honeyed white blend (predominantly Grüner Veltliner)that extends from nose to palate. It's sunny pineapple and peach flavors are indeed tasty, but can seem a bit confected in style.",85,One Woman 2011 Tribute White (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"The Allen bottling typically needs time to come around. This '06 shows the dusty tannins that close it down a bit in its youth, suggesting a good five years in the cellar. Silky and refined, it should evolve to a fine wine, with its cherry pie, mocha, cola and spice flavors. If you drink now, decant. Beautiful with a fine grilled steak.",93,Williams Selyem 2006 Allen Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This is prickly and grassy smelling, with cherry candy and plum aromas. The palate is tangy and abrasive, with plum, herb, spice and green tobacco flavors. It's tart and a bit green on the finish.",82,Quasar 2011 Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Molina),,,,
"Gooseberry and feline aromas are true to the variety but a bit austere and sharp. The palate is plump like you'd expect from warm-climate SB, while flavors of nectarine, citrus and melon finish full, tangy and a bit heavy.",84,O. Fournier 2013 Urban Uco Sauvignon Blanc (Uco Valley),,,,
"This is an impressive, powerful wine. It speaks of the hard landscape of the Douro Superior, with its structure and dark tannins. At the same time, ripe dark fruits push through the still-young tannins giving the potential for a rich, black fruit dominated wine. Predominantly Touriga Nacional (60 percent), this wine is a new venture created by João Nicolau d'Almeida (who has run Ramos-Pinto for many years) and his family. Drink from 2018.",92,Quinta do Monte Xisto 2013 Red (Douro),,,,
"Candied strawberry fruit and a touch of lemon peel make for a fairly mellow nose on this bottling, named after winemaker Adam Comartin's daughter. There is a sizzle of acidity, a grippy texture and clean lines of sour cherry flavor on the palate, which holds its tension deep into the finish.",88,Comartin 2016 Adelaide's Rosé (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"This is spicy, woody and sharp, with good red fruits. However, there is a strong streak of bitter green vegetal flavors running through the tannins. The bitterness may subside with more cellar time, but at the moment it does kill a lot of the fruit sweetness.",84,Gordon Brothers 2005 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"There is rich fruit behind the severe opening tannins, giving a sumptuous although firmly structured wine. The raspberry and crushed strawberry flavors are developing well, ready to balance with the tannins after another year.",93,Domaine Jacques Prieur 2009 Beaune Grèves  (Beaune),,,,
"Earthy, wet-stone aromas and very tart flavors make for a lean, dry character in this light-bodied wine. The aroma and initial flavor are sharp and smoky and the texture is a bit rough.",83,Manifesto! 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (North Coast),,,,
"Cooked blackberries, baked black plum, grape candy and lilac touches show on the nose of this bottling, which is easy to like and uncomplicated. Violet floral flavors kick off the palate, followed by coffee spice, cedar and dark berry fruit, all framed by moderate tannic tension.",88,Eberle 2014 Vineyard Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"Fresh, enticing fruit aromas and a smooth yet firm texture make this full-bodied wine hard to resist. Toasted oak, ripe berries and cherries gush from the glass, and light tannins add grip to the generous mouthfeel.",92,Baiocchi Wines 2013 Sharon's Vineyard Grenache (Fair Play),,,,
"Potent black-plum and black-cherry aromas come with a ton of grainy, spicy oak. This is both fresh and bright as well as dark, brawny and roasted in character. Flavors of ripe blackberry and cherry share the stage with toasty, charred oak and spice flavors in front of an aggressive but tasty finish.",89,Alto Moncayo 2012 Veraton Garnacha (Campo de Borja),,,,
"Finely rounded wine, smoky wood and spice combining well with ripe yellow fruits. The acidity is rather underplayed, but all the other elements are well in place. The aftertaste shows more ripe fruit character.",89,Collovray et Terrier 2007 Domaine des Deux Roches Vieilles Vignes  (Saint-Véran),,,,
"The wine has weight, and dense tannins at this stage. What does give it a hint of Volnay's generosity is the warm, full fruit that is behind the structure. It's obviously going to need at least three years to soften out into a more rounded wine.",89,Nuiton-Beaunoy 2011  Volnay,,,,
"Ripe berry and prune aromas are accented by licorice and raw oak scents. Clampy tannins and bright acidity create a high-energy palate, while this tastes of peppery black plum and blackberry. Heat and chocolate-mint dominate a bold bright finish. Drink through 2020.",90,Narbona 2013 Roble Tannat (Uruguay),,,,
"Rose petal, perfumed berry pressed powder and sweet cake spice aromas lead the way. The vibrant palate offers crunchy red cherry, raspberry, white pepper, grilled herb and tobacco alongside fresh acidity and assertive tannins. Drink 2019–2029.",93,Sordo 2011 Gabutti  (Barolo),,,,
"The evident presence of toasted oak tilts this ruby-colored Brunello slightly off balance. You'll recognize aromas of espresso, Indian spice, leather, tobacco and vanilla: There's not much in the way of fruit and the wine probably won't age for long. Drink now.",85,Tenuta di Sesta 2003  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"This is a beautifully aromatic wine with toast and yellow fruits mingling easily together. It is ripe while also light to taste, a crisp burst of acidity giving the wine a fine lift. Yellow fruits, citrus and toast play together in this attractive wine that is ready to drink.",90,Olivier Leflaive 2014 Oncle Vincent  (Bourgogne),,,,
"This is a sharp-edged wine with green-tinged fruits—apples and pears not quite ripe. It pushes accents of herb and stem forward, and will probably drink best with food rather than on its own.",87,J. Scott Cellars 2016 Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Cherry, dry spice and leather aromas are detectable on an otherwise lean and dilute nose. Like the bouquet, the palate on this basic Malbec is thin. Flavors of generic berry fruits finish earthy and scratchy.",83,Cascada Peak 2012 Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Asphalt, leather and paint aromas are present on the scratchy bouquet. It feels clacky, with pushy acidity and flavors of tomato, saline, herb plum and raspberry. It's lively, with a bite to the finish.",84,Xavier Flouret 2007 Pavo Real Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"This blend of Malbec and Syrah is dark as night, with rubbery, heavy aromas of reduced blackberry and plum along with a hint of volatility. Chunky, heavy and tannic on the palate, this offers blackberry, oak and acidic coffee flavors in front of an herbal, leathery finish.",85,DiamAndes 2013 Perlita Malbec-Syrah (Uco Valley),,,,
"Structured tannins dominate this blend of Blaufränkisch, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon right now, but dense yet sleeping plummy fruit and oaky spice are waiting in the background for their time to shine. This will relax into something slinky and fruitful if you have the patience to wait a year or two; drink after 2016.",91,Esterházy 2011 Estoras Red (Burgenland),,,,
"Although the 2011 vintage was difficult, Foris did particularly well with this lightly spicy, fruit-laden Pinot Gris. True varietal flavors of pear and apple are perfectly set against vivid acidity.",89,Foris 2011 Pinot Gris (Rogue Valley),,,,
"Toasty, warm, lusty dark-berry aromas are laced with a subtle animal accent. This is a big wine, with a fleshy, tannic, muscular feel. Flavors of blackberry, mocha and chocolate finish in fine form, with moderate tannic grip and all sorts of length. Drink this excellent Toro through 2022.",92,Elias Mora 2012 Crianza  (Toro),,,,
"This sophisticated effort maxxes out the potent cherry fruit with plenty of barrel toast. Much like the winery's reserve, the cherries are matched to roasted walnut flavors, with a hint of chipotle.",92,Vercingetorix VX 2012 Caroline's Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"The winery's flagship Cabernet, this offers elements of cranberry and black cherry that slide onto the palate rather than explode. Fig and plum give it a savory edge, around accents of pencil lead, mocha and clove. Rich and soft on the tongue, the wine offers plenty to enjoy now, but it will also yield intrigue over several years, through 2029.",93,Barnett 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),,,,
"Initial aromas are oaky and a touch raw, but soon they settle on raspberry and plum. This is a chunky, fruit-forward Mencia with dark berry, raspberry, spice, resiny oak and salty flavors. A full, lively finish is muscular but also fresh and bright. It had only eight months in oak; drink now through 2015.",91,Gancedo 2012 Mencía (Bierzo),,,,
"This fruity wine has fresh pineapple, peach and white fruit flavors. It is crisp and dry, with an attractive touch of honey. This would be a great partner with Asian foods.",86,Château de la Roulerie 2014 Le Petit Chenin Chenin Blanc (Anjou),,,,
"Earthy mushroom, cedar and leather provide an elegance of savory invitation in this nicely balanced wine which is a mix of powerful fruit and tannin with nuanced seasonings of white and black pepper and a beautifully intoxicating aroma of violets. Drink now through 2022.",92,Trinchero 2012 Central Park West Vineyard Cabernet Franc (St. Helena),,,,
"The bouquet is floral and lightly jammy, with berry aromas and a savory note or two. Turns a touch soupy and salty in the mouth, where the red fruit flavors thin out quickly. Finishes without much punch, but at least it's solid.",85,Ksana 2008 Bonarda (Mendoza),,,,
"This is a deliciously ripe and fruity wine. Citrus and apricot and peach flavors are given a lift by a nutty, toasty character. It is rich and full, with minerality and acidity shooting through the attractive aftertaste. Drink now.",90,Manuel Carvalho Martins 2014 Golpe Branco White (Douro),,,,
"Few wines are as ripe and fruity as this. It's explosive in raspberry jam and cherry pie flavors, with scads of dusty pie spices, and the smooth tannins make it silky in the mouth. The problem is excessive sweetness. If you like a sugary, glyceriney edge to your red wines, it's for you.",85,Wilson 2007 Ellie's Vineyard Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Broad and ripe, this is textured with some citric character, its acidity cutting through the green plum flavors. The aftertaste is freshly mouth watering.",87,Cave de Lugny 2008 Les Beluses  (Mâcon-Chardonnay),,,,
"This offers aromas of ripe plum, black berry, fig, spice and underbrush. The palate delivers crushed black cherry layered with sweet baking spices and grilled herbs alongside firm tannins. This will be even better in 2015, but then drink it soon.",89,L'Aietta 2012  Rosso di Montalcino,,,,
"Fragrances suggest white and yellow flowers, stone fruit, pear and a whiff of brioche. Displaying its 100% Chardonnay pedigree, the palate delivers Golden Delicious apple, white pear, citrus peel and notes of Mediterranean herb alongside bright acidity and a soft mousse.",89,Villa Crespia NV Novalia Chardonnay (Franciacorta),,,,
"Plum, violet, leather and menthol aromas float from the glass. The soft, smooth palate offers juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, vanilla, espresso and anise alongside round, polished tannins. It's easygoing and made to enjoyed young so drink soon.",89,Querceto di Castellina 2012 L'Aura  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"Mint and tarragon come to the fore aromatically in this vineyard-designate, a soft, approachable mix of juicy plum, red berry and chocolate. Fuller in style and ripe, it'll do well on a table of grilled and roasted fare, finishing with a kick of black pepper.",86,B.R. Cohn 2010 Olive Hill Estate Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"Lots of toasted, smoky, coffee-like aromas and flavors coat the raspberry and tart blackberry core of this medium-bodied wine. It's a bit much in terms of oak, but makes a fun exercise, especially when paired with its sister wine made in American oak.",86,Herzog 2014 Variations French Oak Cabernet Sauvignon (North Coast),,,,
"Crimson is half Merlot, one-third Cab Franc, the rest a mix of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon. There's some volatility in the nose, with bright, spicy strawberry fruit swathed in light chocolate. The midpalate drops out.",85,Merry Cellars 2011 Crimson Red (Washington),,,,
"This is an elegant and stylish wine that's full of lively acidity, red berry fruitiness and soft tannins. The wine is well integrated, with just a touch of gaminess and bright acidity on the finish. It is ready to drink.",92,Chateau de Pibarnon 2008 Red (Bandol),,,,
"A decent value in the upward-spiraling world of Châteauneuf-du-Pape, this 2009 offers pungent scents of tobacco and damp earth, then dark, meaty notes and dried fruit flavors. It's creamy in texture and full bodied, with a softly tannic finish. Drink now–2020.",91,Les Vignes d'Alexandre 2009 Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),,,,
"This spicy, wood-aged wine is full of both tannins and fruit. It is dense and still young, bringing together juicy blackberry and a solid structure. It will be ready to drink from 2018.",88,Messias 2014 Quinta do Cachão Reserva Red (Douro),,,,
"Managing to be both brisk and rounded on the nose, this bottling by veteran Rick Longoria shows ripe nectarine, sea salt, white peach and lime rind aromas. The palate is quite flinty at first, then opens to light Meyer lemon juice, Gravenstin apple flesh, sea salt, white sesame, chive and jasmine flavors. Excellent now, but will drink excellently all the way through 2024.",93,Longoria 2014 Rita's Crown Vineyard Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"There's a thickness of oak and mouth-coating depth to this wine that displays its full-bodied soul. The richness of black cherry and caramelized vanilla was cradled in French barrels for 21 months. Concentrated on the finish, it offers a slightly reduced character at its end.",88,Talisman 2012 Spring Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"A pale salmon-colored rosé, this is largely Cinsault (60%), with the rest a blend of Grenache and Syrah. It's more minerally than most, with canteloupe and pomegranate fruit and a minerally finish reminiscent of smoky quartz.",88,Château du Galoupet 2007 Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"Subtle peach, apricot and yellow melon dance in the bouquet of this medium-bodied wine. The palate is pithy and tart, leaner than the nose suggests, with nice vibrancy and a subtle spicy accent on the close. Enjoy now.",86,Michel Gassier 2014 Les Piliers Viognier (Vin de France),,,,
"This is a block selection from the principal estate vineyard. At first flavors of soda cracker, with a saline edge, fill the palate. Then apple, pear and melon fruit come in, with excellent concentration and refreshing acidity.",92,King Estate 2012 Three Bees Pinot Gris (Oregon),,,,
"This elegant 80-20 Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc blend delivers mature aromas of ripe berry, black cherry and fresh aromas of dried herbs and powdered licorice. The somewhat subdued bouquet leads to a generous mouthfeel that leaves a long-lasting impression.",90,I Luoghi 2008 Campo al Fico  (Bolgheri Superiore),,,,
"Régnié, is the newest of the Beaujolais cru village appellations. The grapes come from vines owned by the chateau, giving a wine that is all about ripe fruit and some firm tannins. It is still developing and will be better from 2017.",88,Château de Pizay 2015  Régnié,,,,
"A blend of Merlot and Syrah, the aromas of smoke, matchstick, high-toned dried herb, spice and purple fruit give way to quite sweet-seeming dark-fruit flavors. Lightly grainy tannins provide support. The sweetness seems distracting.",87,Columbia Winery 2015 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Small percentages of Croatina, Oseleta and Forsellina grapes are added to this traditional Valpolicella blend. It's bright and fruity, with cherry and blueberry notes that are backed by a touch of smooth spice and a polished finish.",88,Trabucchi d'Illasi 2007 Terra di San Colombano  (Valpolicella Superiore),,,,
"The chilly vintage has yielded lean flavors of grapefruits and limes, but sur lie aging lends notes of cream, while oak brings a subtle touch of buttered toast. The result is elegant and complex.",89,Spring Mountain Vineyard 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Spring Mountain District),,,,
"This appealing wine offers aromas of blueberry and huckleberry, and drinks like a vinous piece of blueberry pie. It's a bit one-note but it hits that note hard and well.",88,Burnt Bridge 2012 Coyote Canyon Vineyard Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"This is a classy wine made from familiar Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. The nose of rooty, brandied fruit and floral scents is the definition of light and mild, while the palate holds form via vital acidity. In the mouth, pointed flavors of raspberry end in a juicy, crisp finish. Drink this pleasant Old World wine now.",89,Clos Barenys 2004 Crianza Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Tarragona),,,,
"Whiffs of black cherry and delicate violets make this full-bodied Long Island Cab Franc wonderfully aromatic. The palate as well is rich with red fruit, dark brambly notes and soft supple tannins, but the tomato leaf flavors that linger throughout are a distraction.",85,Palmer 2007 Proprietor's Reserve Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"This elegant Rosso opens with an intense and alluring fragrance of rose, blue flower and crushed red berries. The palate is more evolved than the fresh aromas suggest, delivering ripe black raspberry and crushed red cherry lightly accented with cinnamon-spice. A note of orange zest marks the close.",91,Poggio di Sotto 2011  Rosso di Montalcino,,,,
"The color is midnight black and tannins are big and tough. The fruit is enormous, offering an explosion of blackberries and succulent plums, with hints of bacon, mu shu plum sauce, caramelized oak and freshly crushed black pepper. Stick this in the cellar until at least 2022.",89,Raymond 2010 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),,,,
Heavy oak notes with a slight chemical/turpentine scent crowds the nose on this basic Chardonnay. A resiny quality carries over onto the palate along with citrus and cinnamon spice flavors.,84,Casas del Bosque 2012 Reserva Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"The wine comes from the hilltop town of Estremoz in Alentejo, where the streets are paved with local marble. It is an oak-aged wine with touches of spice as well as attractive juicy black-currant fruits. The wine is soft, developing quickly and likely to be drinkable from 2018.",87,Encostas de Estremoz 2016 DJ Escolha da Enóloga Red (Alentejano),,,,
"Created by music industry businessman Kedar Massenburg (CEO Motown Records), the K'orus range is produced in the Languedoc. This Cabernet Sauvignon gives blackberry fruits, very juicy, lightly sweet to finish, but retaining attractive structure and acidity.",85,Kedar's K'orus NV Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de Pays d'Oc),,,,
"Merlot forms the core of this blend, supported by smaller amounts of Syrah, Zinfandel, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon. A note of black olive opens the wine, which is soft, full-bodied and tart in red plum, the tannins chewy on the finish.",84,Hill Family Estate 2012 The Barrel Blend Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Red berry, leather and aromatic herb aromas slowly appear in the glass along with a subtle whiff of violet. The taut palate is still tightly wound, offering red cherry, cranberry and star anise alongside youthfully assertive fine-grained tannins that leave a firm finish.",92,Fratelli Alessandria 2013 San Lorenzo di Verduno  (Barolo),,,,
"Winemaker: Carl Schultz. Plush, saucy red and black berry fruit takes centerstage on the nose of this plush, ripe Shiraz. Waves of vanilla and sweet spice add depth and decadence, continuing through the palate and medium-length finish. The palate is smooth and surprisingly accessible, with medium tannins lending ample grip and structure. Well balanced and enjoyable now, drink through 2022.",91,Hartenberg 2014 Cape Winemakers Guild CWG Auction Shiraz (Stellenbosch),,,,
"Violet, crushed herb and mint aromas start this Agiorgitiko. On the palate, coca, vanilla, red berry and a savory spin give it depth. Fresh and friendly but substantive, this wine can age.",86,Papaioannou 2006 Old Vines Single Vineyard Agiorgitiko (Nemea),,,,
"A light, bright and lemony white wine that's textured and deliciously quaffable, this vineyard-designate is only available in tiny amounts and well worth the hunt. Orange blossom and juicy peach figure on the nose and palate without the interference of oak or undue sweetness.",91,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2014 Catie's Corner Grenache Blanc (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Musk melons, limes and lemons perfume this crisp, cutting Sauvignon Blanc. The palate is refreshingly citrusy, offering brisk grapefruit flavor accented by swathes of green leaf and herb.

"While there are firm tannins, this wine also has plenty of fresh black currant fruits. Acidity and a crisp texture give it a lift and brightness. Drink this 100% Merlot from 2016 when the tannins have softened.",84,Château Donjon de Bruignac 2013 Premium  (Bordeaux Supérieur),,,,
"SuLei's Tanya Woodley ferments her Sauvignon Blanc in stainless steel, then ages it in a mix of neutral oak and stainless steel barrels. In this new vintage some residual sugar (just under 1%) remains, to soften the otherwise-searing acidity. It works well, crafting a fleshy wine loaded with citrus and honeydew. The finish lingers and has plenty of lift.",89,SuLei 2011 Spring Creek Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Dark smokiness hovers above the fruit, slightly obscuring the view. Firm tannins, however, hold a core of bright, ripe but tart red berries. This is tightly framed and needs time to evolve. A slender but warm body is built on firm structure. Drink as of 2016.",90,Loimer 2012 Langenlois Pinot Noir (Niederösterreich),,,,
"Produced from old vines in the Grand Cru vineyards of Chouilly in the Côte des Blancs, this is a beautifully crisp, ripe wine, showing taut fruit and fine, stylish acidity.

Still young, it will be best from 2019.",94,Roland Champion 2011 Special Club Blanc de Blancs Chouilly Grand Cru Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),,,,
"This bottling from the famously rich wine-making vineyard shows incredible restraint on the nose, starting with the reserved aromas of lavender, white pepper, bergamot, pomegranate and snappy raspberry. The blackberry fruit runs quite deep on the sip, edged by bay leaf, menthol and purple flower touches. Simultaneously elegant and powerful.",93,Bernardus 2015 Pisoni Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"A structured wine that has berry fruits, black currants and a firm, dry core of tannins. It has the weight, texture and richness of the vintage, with a solid future as it rounds out and softens. Drink from 2015.",89,Château Trolliet Lafite 2010 Red (Côtes de Bergerac),,,,
"A young, spicy wine, with white flower aromas. The acidity is as crisp as possible, the sweet currants adding bursts of fruit. This is a potentially serious wine, its elegance and structure promising good aging.",90,Weinrieder 2008 Bockgärten Riesling (Niederösterreich),,,,
"Packed with red fruits and soft tannins, this is fresh, crisp and with bright acidity. The tannins at the back offer a firm aftertaste, along with juicy red currant fruits. Thierry Lurton bought the 14th-century château in 2007.",85,Château Camarsac 2013 Cuvée Prestige  (Bordeaux Supérieur),,,,

"A rich, full-bodied, oaky Chardonnay, with the pleasing texture of cream. It's spicy and very flavorful in pears, mangoes, vanilla custard and buttered toast. Could be a little livelier, though.",88,Stephen Ross 2009 Bien Nacido Vineyards Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"This wine is atypically fine and chiseled for this estate, combining bright, sweet fruity notes of lime and green apples with crushed stone and spring flowers. It's light in body, but impeccably balanced.",91,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler 2010 Bernkasteler Badstube Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),,,,

"From the northern edge of Margaux appellation, Grand Tayac is dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon. It has elegance, light wood flavors and generous black currant fruits. The tannins just give support, bringing out the style of the wine. Drink from 2017.",88,Château Grand Tayac 2011  Margaux,,,,
"Toasted nuts, seared marshmallows, roasted corn and dried apple play on the nose of this richly layered wine. The palate shows plenty of lively sea salt from front to back, along with concentrated citrus character and an apple-syrup ripeness.",89,Bernardus 2013 Soberanes Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Berry, cola and chocolate aromas are pretty. In the mouth, this wine is bright and brash, with rough tannins and high acidity. Flavors of plum and wild berry are a touch salty and then comes a hard-pounding finish. Drink through 2026.",89,Bodegas Palacio 2013 Glorioso Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"A cool vintage shows through in the lighter style of this Merlot. Strawberry is the dominant fruit flavor, although the time in new oak is what dominates currently. The scent and vanilla flavor of American oak, though accounting just 20% of the barrels, comes across quite powerfully. Give this one another year or two.",87,Forgeron 2008 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Made entirely with Pinot Nero, this lively sparkler offers aromas of woodland berry and toasted almond. The crisp palate doles out watermelon, apple and a mineral note alongside fresh acidity and a firm perlage.",89,Moser 2011 Rosé Extra Brut Pinot Nero (Trento),,,,

"This wine has gorgeous, obvious cedar and toasted-bread aromas. Oozing with fruit and oak richness, it tastes like blueberry syrup and cocoa. Very full bodied, it wallops the taste buds, weaves around the mouth and lingers on the finish.",91,Dante Robere 2013 Estate Reserve Syrah (Livermore Valley),,,,
"While the wine appears initially generous, it then reveals a strongly steely, tight and mineral character. Rich fruits give a full and rounded exterior, while the more textured center shows how well this wine will age. Honey and acidity reinforce the poised contrast. Drink from 2017.",92,Olivier Leflaive 2012 Sous le Dos d'Ane Premier Cru  (Meursault-Blagny),,,,
"Latex, rubber and loud plum and berry aromas set up a somewhat astringent palate with rubbery, medicinal berry flavors. A note of saline appears on a firm, drawing finish.",85,Señorío de Sotillo 2012 Joven  (Ribera del Duero),,,,

"There's a touch of effervescence upon opening this twist-top bottling, which makes the aromas of fresh tangerine peel, pear cider, white rocks and Pink Lady apple skins very accessible. It's extremely racy and zippy on the sip, with tons of citrus blossom and ripe stone-fruit flavors, all cut by a slightly sour mineral-laced acidity.",90,Claiborne & Churchill 2016 Dry Gewürztraminer (Central Coast),,,,
Apple notes play with citrus overtones on this superfresh and light wine. This is a summer wine with great refreshment potential: light and lifted with spritzy citrus.,88,Tement 2014 Berghausener Sauvignon Blanc (Südsteiermark),,,,
"From old vines, this a wonderfully perfumed, oak-aged wine. Almond and ethereal juicy acidity complement its richness and fine ripeness, with an intense acidity on the finish. Delicious now, but can age for another 6–8 years.",92,Domaine Vincent Carême 2008 Le Clos  (Vouvray),,,,
"This reserve level wine brings high-toned aromas of herbs, violets, bittersweet cocoa, mint and dark fruits. The palate displays layered, full-bodied cherry and chocolate flavors that show density and depth. It's an impressive display that captures the senses with its seamless feel.",94,Feather 2013 Vintage Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Ripe apricot, orange and nectarine flavors mark this Chardonnay. It's also oaky. The cold 2011 vintage has given the wine an herbal edge, and it won't age. But it is an elegantly dry wine for drinking now.",87,Smith-Madrone 2011 Chardonnay (Spring Mountain District),,,,
"With 12% Sémillon in the blend, this is a lovely, fresh, almost exuberant Sauvignon Blanc.

"Perfumed, ripe local white grapes are the backbone of this soft, full-bodied wine. It's rich, full of yellow fruits and plums.

It's attractive now, but will be better from 2016.",87,Adega Cooperativa de Borba 2013 Montes Claros Reserva Branco White (Alentejo),,,,
"Scratchy, edgy aromas of boysenberry and blackberry are a touch minty and herbal. This feels big, loud and choppy, with plenty of kick and hard tannins. Flavors of ripe dark fruits are toasty and earthy, while the finish is blocky, bullish and a touch hot, with power in reserve.",87,O. Fournier 2011 Urban Ribera  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"This wine is rich and ripe, oozing with black cherry, boysenberry and strawberry jam aromas and flavors. It feels full and rather soft on the palate, as the acidity and tannins appear very mild.",90,Freeman 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Initially, this smells green, with aromas akin to salad. With time, riper berry notes and oak rise up.

"Aged in a mixture of French and American oak, of that, 33% new, the barrel notes of vanilla and spice are at the fore followed by cherry and herbs. It's blended with 19% Merlot where all the fruit is coming from Alder Ridge Vineyard and made in a lighter style—the oak providing a significant amount of the flavor and feel.",87,Cloudlift Cellars 2011 Ascent Cabernet Franc (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"Bright and fruity, this is a wine to be enjoyed now. It's crisp acidity, but concentrated with creamed-apple flavors and broadened by a touch of wood.",86,Henri de Villamont 2010 Prestige  (Bourgogne),,,,
"This wine is a bit reductive out of the gate, opening to reveal aromas of pear, peach, melon, lees and spice. The palate is creamy and textured in feel. If the aromas come together, it could move up a notch.",88,Buty 2015 Conner Lee Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Aromas of spice, lees and ripe pear are followed by creamy feeling tropical fruit flavors, with pineapple in the lead. It doesn't quite all come together but provides plenty of intrigue.",88,Matteo 2014 Chenin Blanc (Red Mountain),,,,
"Mature black-skinned fruit, truffle, underbrush, tobacco and leather aromas lead the nose on this powerful wine. The chewy, full-bodied palate doles out layers of juicy wild cherry, black raspberry, cinnamon, licorice and nutmeg, all framed in ripe, velvety tannins. The succulent fruit richness seamlessly supports the hefty alcohol. Drink 2017–2022.",93,Talenti 2011  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,

"Named for the producer's beloved English Springer Spaniel, this is a barrel selection from one Dijon clone. The wine is broad-shouldered, piney and juicy in black cherry and raspberry.

It's unabashed in its appeal.",91,Covington 2012 Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Pear compote is lightly spiced in nutmeg in this full-bodied, creamy white, buzzy in acidity and a stony minerality that presents as tightly woven texture on the palate. Refreshingly balanced, it offers length and breadth as it nears the finish.",90,Geyser Peak 2015 Water Bend Chardonnay (Sonoma County),,,,
"Erath is now part of the Ste. Michelle Wine Estates portfolio. The white wines, which have long been a strength of the brand, remain fresh and lightly fruity. The flavors of this young Pinot Gris suggest pear skin, grapefruit and lime, and there are bracing acids providing some additional lift. The '07 seems to show a bit more textural density than the previous vintage.",87,Erath 2007 Pinot Gris (Oregon),,,,
"It's hard to find a Pinot at this price that shows real sophistication, but Stephen Vincent tries hard. The wine is racy and silky, with coastal elegance. Its cherry, licorice and cola flavors have a little kiss of oak.",85,Stephen Vincent 2006 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),,,,
"A grand wine, it has great ripeness and richness, majestic in its structure and upright character. It is concentrated, perfumed and opulent. The style of Ducru Beaucaillou is both generous and powerful, and obviously ageworthy.",96,Château Ducru Beaucaillou 2010  Saint-Julien,,,,
"A shade off dry, this approachably fresh fruity Riesling offers a bounty of juicy peach and tangerine refreshment. Sunny lemon acidity and blossom notes extend through a moderately long finish.",87,Winzer Von Erbach 2014 Weinkeller Erbach Riesling (Rheingau),,,,
"Supple and powerful, this new Nysa brings potent purple fruits to the core, wrapped in notes of orange peel and citrus. Tannins are smooth and ripe, and there is a light touch with the new oak, adding a pleasant streak of caramel to the finish. Drink now through 2020.",90,Torii Mor 2012 Nysa Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),,,,
"Rose, red berry, mint and anise aromas unfold in the glass. The firm palate offers wild cherry, crushed raspberry, clove, anisette and a mocha note framed in bracing tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2020–2031.",90,Oddero 2011  Barolo,,,,
"Leathery and somewhat green, this wine has yet to find its balance, combining 95% Cabernet Sauvignon with 3% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot. It veers between heavy, ripe tension and an underripe underbelly, finishing unsure.",84,Charles Krug 2012 Vintage Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Tight, mineral and closed, packed with dark tannins. The fruit lies behind all this texture, leaving an impression of toughness, the acidity dominant.",88,Henri de Villamont 2008 Clos des Guettes  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),,,,
"This is true Tannat, black colored, powerful and firm. It also has fruit weight, potentially delicious black plums, damsons and dark berries that give aging potential. For now, it has tannins, a dark, brooding character and concentration. Age at least until 2018.",93,Château d'Aydie 2011 Tannat (Madiran),,,,
"This unoaked Chardonnay starts with aromas of citrus and stalky greens. It's plump in the mouth, with soft acids and flavors of pineapple and other tropical fruits. It's just fresh enough, but mostly it's innocuous.",84,Miguel Torres 2012 Santa Digna Reserva Chardonnay (Central Valley),,,,
"Deep, inviting aromas of cherry, strawberry and cranberry mesh with red licorice, violet and nutmeg on this superbly priced wine. It's a fleshy Pinot, named after a falcon that perches in the vineyard's lone pine tree, with pretty, punch-like flavors of violet, rose and more red fruit.",92,J. Lohr 2012 Estates Falcon's Perch Pinot Noir (Monterey County),,,,
"Pronounced mint and menthol in the nose, with good, ripe cherry fruit underneath. It's like a mint chocolate covered cherry in the mouth, distinctive and delicious.",87,Vigil 1998 Tres Condados Zinfandel (California),,,,
"Earthy, dusty, slightly cheesy plum and cassis aromas come with a floral note. This Tannat-led blend feels plummy and healthy, with direct acidity. Blackberry, plum and fig flavors finish smooth and chocolaty, with residual berry fruit. Drink through 2019.",90,Pizzorno 2013 Select Blend Reserva Red (Canelones),,,,
"A light style with crisp red currant flavors, acidity and a touch of minerality.",88,Domaines Duffort 2010 Château la Moutète Grande Réserve Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"This compact and lean Barolo Riserva opens with a light but luminous ruby color with amber highlights. The aromas here are elegant and ethereal with loads of menthol, balsam and root beer-like overtones. In the mouth, this is a particularly polished and silky wine.",89,Gigi Rosso 2004 Arione dell'Ulivo Riserva  (Barolo),,,,
"Aromas of underbrush, tilled soil and ripe black fruit lead the nose. The palate doles out ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, coffee and a confectionary note alongside ripe tannins. A licorice note marks the finish.",88,Loacker 2012 Valdifalco  (Morellino di Scansano),,,,
"More traditional than modern in style, this has aromas of citrus, herb, dry oak and medium-weight fruit. It feels crisp and tightly focused, with a complex palate that offers notes of berries, chocolate and herbs. It finishes long, with a leathery, meaty element that lends gravitas to the wine. Drink now–2016.",91,Viñamada 2006 Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"This is lightly fragrant, with pear and apple notes. There's a touch of tart sweetness on the finish as well a foamy texture and bright acidity. It should pair with Brie- or Gouda-based appetizers.",87,Gemin NV Brut  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
"This red blend has a nose of fresh cherry, red plum and clove. In the mouth, it offers a combination of fruit and spice flavors featuring anise, black plum, Chinese five spice, and black cherry. There is a burst of still-youthful acidity on the finish, but this should be drunk within the next year or two.",89,Stapleton & Springer 2007 Roucí Red (Moravia),,,,
"In homage to a major product of the region, this wine has a cork label. It has considerable power, an old-fashioned, astringent wine that keeps the typical ultradry tannins as a sign of its ability to age. The fruit is definitely in second place here, although there are concentrated black fruits in the background. Age for 3–4 years.",89,Adega Cooperativa de Borba 2003 Reserva Red (Alentejo),,,,
"A rich wine, opulent in character. There is power here, with richness of fruit and texture. It is both serious side and exuberant, with its bursting black berry fruits.",96,Château Mouton Rothschild 2008  Pauillac,,,,
"A silky, compelling wine full of minerality, this comes from a gradually sloping site within the larger estate ranch, where the soils are tightly packed and volcanic, and the air often drenched in fog. Silky on the palate, the red-fruit profile is crunchy and juicy, the body medium in terms of strength and length.",94,Etude 2013 Temblor Vineyard Grace Benoist Ranch Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Carneros),,,,
"You'll find good, ripe and savory flavors of blackberry, currant and spice. A touch of oak and a sweet licorice note give this 100% Cabernet a candied appeal. It can't quite escape its rustic mouthfeel, but it's a nice glass of red wine.",86,Ruby Red 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Fontanabianca is a microboutique, family-run winery that pulls out jaw-dropping gorgeous wines year after year. A hard work ethic and lucky vineyard locations shape this opulent, deeply layered Barbaresco and its steady array of spice, dark fruit, plum, cola, licorice and dark asphalt-like aromas.",93,Fontanabianca 2008 Bordini  (Barbaresco),,,,
"This is a smooth, wood aged wine that comes from the Mouchão estate. It has rich red fruits, finely integrated tannins and a solid structure. It has an open, generous feel to it, given shape and aging potential by the dry core and fruity acidity. Drink from 2015.",90,Mouchão 2010 Dom Rafael Tinto Red (Alentejo),,,,
"If you want to taste ripe Pinot Noir in Champagne, this grand cru blend (with 40% Chardonnay, 60% Pinot Noir) from Soutiran is where to come. The wine has weight, delicious white fruits and kiwi, and a textured mouthfeel. It is concentrated, certainly in a food wine style.",90,Soutiran NV Brut Grand Cru  (Champagne),,,,
"This blend of 60% Sangiovese and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon is aged in oak for 40 months, which contributes dark, woody spice to the nose, enhancing the fresh-pressed elderberry and crushed lava-rock aromas. The sip is soft at first before the tannins tighten around the dark flavors, and the acidity is powerfully fresh. Give it a tad more time for all components to marry. Drink 2019–2028.",91,Bella Luna 2013 Estate Riserva Sangiovese Cabernet (Templeton Gap District),,,,
"The crown jewel of the winery's ice-style wines, it's gorgeously aromatic with notes of tropical mango and pineapple adorned with honey and blossoms. Dripping with nectar and yellow peach preserves, it's lusciously sweet, yet impeccably balanced with acidity and an elegant mineral tone that lingers on the finish.",91,Standing Stone 2012 Ice Riesling (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Touches of Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Merlot contribute to this wine's overall complexity. The cuvée formerly known as “Cask,” it now emphasizes the historic estate property. Red currant and cedar notes and firm tannins strike first, as bright, underlying acidity provides balance. Tobacco leaf and chocolate flavors mark the long finish.",92,Inglenook 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),,,,
"Ideal Spanish rosé in every way, from color to aromas to flavors to the price tag. The nose is inviting, with delicate, crisp fruit aromas. The feel is just right, propelled by bright acids. Tastes of raspberry and watermelon, while the finish is long and lightly spicy. What a quaffing rosado should be.",89,Marqués de Cáceres 2010 Rosé (Rioja),,,,
"This is a polished Chardonnay, fruity in Meyer lemon and lime yet mellow and honeyed on the palate, buoyed by tight acidity and just enough spice. There's a balance of depth and breadth to this wine, and a lengthy finish. Some fruit comes from 40-year-old vines planted to Heritage Selections of the Robert Young clone.",90,Gundlach Bundschu 2012 Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"This wine is still closed, lean and firm with its fruitiness masked by a strong mineral structure. It needs plenty of time to develop, so drink from 2018.",87,Château de Cruzeau 2013  Pessac-Léognan,,,,
"The vineyard of the Giennois is close to the city of Orléans, making it the most northerly Loire vineyard. This wine with its cool, fresh character has a light tannic character and brings out red fruits as its biggest attraction. It has a fresh, crisp, juicy aftertaste. Drink now.",86,Emile Balland 2014 Les Beaux Jours Red (Coteaux du Giennois),,,,
"The texture is silky on this bright, clean Pinot Noir. With strong, ripe raspberry and cherry jam, date, brown sugar and oak flavors, it's also tasty, and ready to drink now.",86,Rock View 2012 Reserve Pinot Noir (Monterey County),,,,
"These 100-plus-year-old vines were transplanted to another site, but continue to yield outstanding wines. Intriguing aromas of fruit compote and roasted meat lead into a palate of blueberry and spice. It's medium to full in body, with supple tannins that finish on a faintly dusty note. Ready to drink now, but should hold at least through 2020.",93,Langmeil 2010 Orphan Bank Shiraz (Barossa),,,,
"Smoothly seductive, this wine showcases an amazing site with great skill, coaxing high-toned squeezes of mandarin orange, honeysuckle and anise from a foundation of balance and acidity. Luxurious, the oak plays a supporting role, never distracting from a core of freshness and finesse.",94,Gary Farrell 2014 Rochioli Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Pressed rose, violet, dark-skinned berry, a balsamic note and a whiff of oak-driven spice lift out of the glass. The juicy spicy palate offers a wonderful purity of raspberry and cherry flavors offset by licorice, chopped mint and pipe tobacco. Taut fine-grained tannins provide a firm, polished framework. Drink 2018–2027.",93,Mauro Veglio 2012 Gattera  (Barolo),,,,
"This restaurant-style Pinot Noir is rich in fruit, crisp in acidity and dry in the finish, with a silky body that makes it lovely to pair with Pinot-friendly food, such as grilled salmon or tuna. It has sweet, spicy flavors of raspberries and strawberries.",87,Baker & Brain 2010 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),,,,
"Grapefruit zest and Conference pear peels are embedded in some creamy autolysis that comes across with a notion of baby powder. The palate is straight-laced, fresh and wonderfully light-bodied and dry without denying the pleasure of deeper notions of fruit. The fizz is persistent and soft.",90,Steininger 2013 Brut Sparkling (Österreichischer Sekt),,,,
"Produced from a mix of clones and vineyard sources, this is a chewy, substantial wine, with dark fruit flavors of plum and black cherry. Light suggestions of coffee, gravel and iron also factor in. It's a rugged, earthy, tannic wine that will be best decanted.",89,Roco 2015 Gravel Road Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Bandarossa is a flagship sparkler and among the best Prosecco Superiori because of its steady and smooth delivery on the palate. There are delicate floral and stone fruit nuances, followed by crisp tones of citrus and grapefruit.",88,Bortolomiol 2012 Bandarossa Millesimato Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene Superiore),,,,
"A very basic Cabernet Sauvignon, very low in alcohol, with a harshness on the finish.",81,Harlow Ridge 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),,,,
"This is a perfumed wine, with intense flavors of spring blossom, grapefruit and white peach. It has a tight line of acidity that cuts through to the finish. Screwcap.",89,Markus Huber 2011 Terrassen Riesling (Traisental),,,,
"Medicinality, animal notes and rubbery scents interfere with this magenta-colored Monastrell's berry aromas. Scratchy and somewhat abrasive on the palate, with high acidity, this tastes of herbal plum and medicinal raspberry, with a gripping finish.",84,Casa Castillo 2014 Monastrell (Jumilla),,,,
"Despite the famed vineyard on the label, this seems a bit gauzy, chalky and stripped. There are light suggestions of berry and cherry, and hints of the nice details of earth and mineral that old vines can often bring. The finish is dilute and slightly metallic.",86,Et Fille 2012 Maresh Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),,,,
"Buttery peach crumble and vanilla bean flavors are balanced by floral aromas and a rounded, likable character in this bold, full-bodied white.",90,Kunde 2015 CS Ridge Vineyard Estate Grown Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"Full bodied and heavily extracted, this is a dark, plummy wine with almost chewy tannins on the finish. Yet the aromas remain fresh and floral, nicely accented by coffee and spice. Drink now–2017",90,Château de Ségriès 2009 Cuvée Reservée Red (Lirac),,,,
"Owner Michel Dietrich takes the vegan route with no animal derivatives in fining the wine. The wine is taut and tight, with a steely texture that needs to soften. All its fruit is there, muted by the herbal edge and nervy texture. Drink from late 2017.",87,Château Haut-Rian 2016  Bordeaux Blanc,,,,
"Slightly earthy and herbal, as Somontano reds are prone to be, with a gritty mouthfeel and sweet black fruit flavors that come with proper herbal accents. Tastes roasted and toasty, with pepper and heat on the lusty finish. Balanced and good; drink now through 2013.",88,Viñas del Vero 2005 Gran Vos Reserva Red (Somontano),,,,
"From 30-year-old vines, this is beautifully built and already showing the complexity that predicts a long life ahead. The old-vine grapes create a skeleton of mineral and acid upon which just-ripe fruit flavors of mulberry, plum and blueberry are placed. Drink now with pleasure, or put a few bottles away to enjoy through 2027 or longer.",93,Lavinea 2014 Elton Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
"An attractive, rich and creamy Chardonnay, this balances acidity with  tropical fruit and wood flavors. Made using fruit from a parcel in the Haute-Serre Vineyard, this is a wine that has an edge of minerality as well as ripe, textured fruit.",89,Georges Vigouroux 2010 Haute-Serre Albesco Chardonnay (Lot),,,,
"Dark, smoky and oaky, this ripe wine tastes very much of the 40% Primitivo featured in the blend. It has nice structure, with Syrah, Zinfandel and Petite Sirah also in the mix. It's ready to drink, especially with pasta with an herb sauce.",87,Di Arie 2009 Interlude Red (Sierra Foothills),,,,
"Bread, vanilla cookie and pear scents drive the bouquet on this nature Cava. A citrusy, medium-bodied palate shows flavors of cider, brined apple and mixed citrus fruits, while the finish is salty, with notes of orange and grapefruit.",87,Bohigas NV Gran Reserva Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"Made from the oldest vines on the estate, this ripe and fruity wine is ready to drink. Its tannins are already integrated, leaving a smooth-textured wine that is accompanied by spice and red plum fruit flavors.",89,Domaine Roumagnac 2012 O Grand R Red (Fronton),,,,
"Light aromas of clove, spice and herb are followed by plump plum and herb flavors that bring freshness, with grainy tannins providing support. It brings a lot of easy-drinking appeal.",88,Three Rivers 2013 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Here's a young, bracing Barbaresco that opens with scents of perfumed berry, rose, iris and a whiff of vanilla. The youthfully austere palate delivers ripe black cherry, raspberry, sage and a note of white pepper while bracing tannins give it structure. Drink 2018–2024.",90,Boffa 2012 Pajè  (Barbaresco),,,,
"The 200-acre Shea vineyard provides fruit to many of Oregon's best winemakers. Here is the estate's own brand, offering up a fragrant, appealing blend from various blocks. Floral highlights, dusty spices, a whiff of cocoa and a streak of nut butter all come into focus around pretty purple fruits. The finish is silky, long and lovely.",91,Shea 2013 Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Exemplary in all areas, from the smoke, mushroom and berry nose to the exotic undertones of island spice and fine oak supporting vibrant raspberry fruit. It's one of those wines that's a pure pleasure to drink, and it's ready out of the gate. For very good Burgundy that clicks on all cylinders, this is it.",92,Laleure-Piot 1998 Premier Cru Les Vergelesses  (Pernand-Vergelesses),,,,
"From a vineyard originally planted in 1922 to what is thought to be 100% Zinfandel, this wine brims with notes of yeasty baked bread, leather and high-toned raspberry and boysenberry. Layered and supported by oak, the medium-bodied weight supports a long finish.",90,Benessere 2012 Collins Holystone Vineyard Zinfandel (St. Helena),,,,
"Chipped slate and wet-clay minerality give depth to the baked strawberry, black plum and rose-petal aromas on the nose of this single-vineyard study by Brian Loring. Similar earthiness descends on the palate, with a slow-simmering acidity allowing the juicy black fruit to steadily emerge.",92,Loring Wine Company 2014 Clos Pepe Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Dark fruits and graceful highlights of black tea, citrus oil, tobacco and mocha make this an endlessly fascinating wine with impressive complexity. Give it extended breathing time and it rewards you with layer after layer of silky fruit, leaf and spice. This is a 20-year wine, but may be enjoyed immediately with ample airing.",94,Penner-Ash 2012 Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir,,,,
"This iconic bottling, a blend of 80% Sangiovese and 20% Canaiolo, features aromas of ripe black fruit, violet, grilled herb, toast and espresso. The palate delivers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, vanilla and mocha alongside firm but refined tannins. It closes on a licorice note. Drink 2015–2023.",92,Lungarotti 2008 Vigna Monticchio Red (Torgiano Rosso Riserva),,,,
"From a higher elevation—and hence cooler—region of Australia, this is a light to medium-bodied Cabernet that avoids excessive leanness, offering up a mélange of plump cassis, leather and tobacco. It's not the most powerful Cab, but offers elegance and length at an affordable price.",88,Cuttaway Hill Estate 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Southern Highlands),,,,
"A blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this has bright cherry fruit, with light touches of spice and toasted almond. The simple, but velvety mouthfeel will work with curry chicken or spicy beef.",87,Maculan 2010 Brentino Red (Veneto),,,,
"A Bordeaux-style blend, this begins with concentrated strawberry and cherry flavors, rich and liquorous. A majority of the oak was Hungarian, and a strong vanilla streak runs through the middle and on into the finish. For some palates the fruit and the oak will seem a bit mismatched, but for others this will be right on the mark.",87,Upland Estates 2008 Teunis Red Red (Snipes Mountain),,,,
"Named after the outcropping of gravel on which the vines are planted, this second wine of Fourcas-Dupré is Merlot-based. With its smoky tannins and strong flavors of wood, it needs to fill out with the blackberry fruits that lie in the background. That won't take long and the wine will be ready to drink from late 2016.",87,Château Fourcas Dupré 2012 Cuvée Hautes Terres  (Listrac-Médoc),,,,
"The Barrel Selection certainly has no qualms about hiding its true colors. The nose offers ripe stone fruit supported by hints of butter and cream, while the mouth presents a prickly acidity and clean citrus flavors that prevent the wine from landing with a thud. A solid selection that will pair well with most poultry dishes.",86,La Forge Estate 2007 Barrel Selection Chardonnay (Vin de Pays d'Oc),,,,
"Fleshy, ripe red and black cherry fruit streams from the glass. This smooth, easy red shows all the ripeness of the 2015 vintage and just enough freshness to balance it. The finish is juicy and full-fruited.",88,Rosenhof 2015 Reserve Zweigelt (Burgenland),,,,
"This is a soft, open wine showing a few tannins and some of the perfumed character of the grape. The palate is rounded and shows attractive red fruits.",86,Quinta da Alorna 2014 Touriga Nacional (Tejo),,,,
"Bright raspberry and leather aromas set up a tight palate ringing with acidity. That creates a narrow flavor profile with drawn cherry and currant flavors. A minty, lightly herbal finish carries notes of leather and oak-based bacon, which frankly seems a bit forced given the simplicity of the wine.",85,Calcu 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"This Sémillon-Sauvignon Blanc blend hits the nose with near-petrol scents, and then slides into a slightly sour-orange zone. On the palate, that citrusy intrigue continues into a lime zest finish. It's a vibrant, refreshing sipper, though it leans on tingling acidity more than overall balance.",87,Happy Canyon Vineyard 2012 White (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),,,,
"With its rich chocolate and spice flavors, this rolls around the mouth like velvet, its fruit so well-integrated with the wood and the vanilla that it is seamless. A delicious wine that deserves 3–4 years aging.",91,Château l'Enclos 2005  Pomerol,,,,
"Made with 70% Sangiovese and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with subtle aromas of black cherry jam and vanilla. The dense palate shows black currant, oak and mocha alongside firm rather drying tannins. It's a bit shy on freshness, so enjoy over the next few years.",88,Castello di Bossi 2012 Corbaia Red (Toscana),,,,
"This limited production wine comes in a fancy bottle with wax seal. It is a rich blend of Touriga Nacional along with Merlot, which smooths out the structure and gives the wine its intensity and dense texture. It is a ripe smoky wine, packed with juicy black fruits and flavors of the wood aging. Drink now.",93,Adega Mãe 2012 Terroir Red (Lisboa),,,,
"This seems slightly fresher than the basic Muscadelle, offering more balanced flavors, including a touch of orange zest. It's sweet and long, with notes of brown sugar and citrus lingering on the long, more-ish finish.",91,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards NV Muscat (Rutherglen),,,,
"Burgundy-raised vintner Christian Roguenant gets to show his stuff in this line of Firepeak wines. Wet cement, honeysuckle, crisp Asian pear and the slightest hints of tropicality show on the nose, while the palate offers yellow grapefruit, lemon skins, squeezed lime and lime-blossom flavors, wrapped around nervy tension.",93,Baileyana 2014 Firepeak Chardonnay (Edna Valley),,,,
"Savory notes of nuts and grains stand out against a backdrop of fresh white grapefruit, apple and lemon in this semidry Riesling. Crisp lime acidity lends refreshment to the finish. Drink now.",86,Anthony Road 2014 Semi Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),,,,
A lime-centric wine that also has notes of white peach. It's medium sweet with the sugar getting out in front of the acid.,84,Summit Estates 2012 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
There are pretty grassy or floral aromatics that come on the heels of passion fruit and exotic fruit. The wine has fresh fruit flavors and an attractive creaminess on the palate.,85,Di Lenardo 2007 Vigneto Vigne dai Vieris Pinot Grigio (Venezia Giulia),,,,
"A solid effort, with attractive, balanced black currant fruits and ripe acidity. The wine layers fruit and integrated tannins. It feels chunky and dense, finishing dry.",90,Château Ferrière 2009  Margaux,,,,
"A basic red Rhône blend, with a dash of Viognier for acidic brightness. Shows simple, thin flavors of raspberries and cherries, with a dash of sweet oak.",83,Minassian-Young 2007 GMSV Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"This Pinot Grigio is a bit more fragrant and floral in essence with aromas of stone fruit and peach blossom. It has a fresh, almost piquant edge but it also has that characteristic watery mouthfeel you'll likely encounter with this variety.",85,Ronco Blanchis 2006 Pinot Grigio (Collio),,,,
"This flagship effort showcases the winery's oldest block of Cabernet, planted in 1975—the first vineyard on Red Mountain. The subtle, slightly grainy and grassy nuances of old-vine grapes are here, with red-fruit flavors that are soft and delicate, yet substantial. There's a light dusting of cinnamon, a whiff of smoke and an over-riding elegance. Such old vine, 100% Red Mountain Cabernet from a great vintage doesn't come along very often.",93,Kiona 2012 Old Block Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),,,,
"A ripe blend of fresh apple and lemon fruits give this wine is crisp, dry character. It is packed with acidity, orange and lemon zest and has a lively aftertaste. Drink now.",87,Quinta da Raza 2015 Escolha White (Vinho Verde),,,,
"Ruben “The Grape Whisperer” Solorzano may need a new cellar-oriented nickname if he keeps turning out such excellent bottlings. This offers lots of white and black pepper on the nose alongside thyme, rosemary, black plum, licorice, black olive, roast beef and Mediterannean spice. The palate packs thyme, peppercorn, dried sage, black and green olive, espresso and green coffee beans atop underripe blackberry and strong elderberry flavors.",94,Hecho por Ruben 2012 Harrison Clarke Vineyard Syrah (Ballard Canyon),,,,
"A chalky, mineral aroma leads to lively green apple and dried herb flavors. This wine is light-bodied and subdued but has enjoyable, savory flavors to complement its moderate fruitiness and an easy elegance that separates it from the pack.",89,Berryessa Gap 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Yolo County),,,,
"Corvina, along with smaller percentages of Rondinella and Molinara, is the base for this meaty expression of Ripasso. Aromas here include raw cherry, blackberry tart, dark vanilla bean and barbecue spice.",87,Tinazzi 2007 Monterè Cà de' Rocchi  (Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso),,,,
"The exquisitely restrained nose has just a touch of honeysuckle perfume—just a hint of that spicy headiness. These aromas also color the fine, ripe and juicy peach fruit on the palate that vies with fine citrus zestiness for attention. Slight residual sweetness caresses the fruit on the palate but this is very subtly done. The finish is off dry, but utterly balanced. This is a very beautiful, elegant and fresh Gewurztraminer. Drink now through 2030.",93,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2014 Rosenberg Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"This wine shows more character and finesse than most other Italian whites in this price range. Subtle aromas of apples, peach and mineral carry over to the bright, savory palate along with citrus notes and crisp acidity. It has nice length and leaves the mouth feeling clean and fresh.",89,Pieropan 2012  Soave Classico,,,,
"Cannubi is regarded as perhaps the finest vineyard cru in Barolo, delivering clean and elegant wines with power and determination on the finish. This expression stays true to the vineyard, with added touches of soft fruit and spice to the mix.",92,E. Pira e Figli (Chiara Boschis) 2008 Cannubi  (Barolo),,,,
"The winery doesn't reveal on the label what grape varieties are in this blend, but they're Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. It's a fine, delicious wine, with blackberry, dark chocolate and bacon flavors, wrapped into exceedingly fine tannins. It's well-balanced, too, with moderate alcohol and a nice lick of acids. Impressive and classy from this Lake County winery.",94,Obsidian Ridge 2009 Half Mile Red (Red Hills Lake County),,,,
"This wine keeps true to the varietal character of German Riesling, with an aroma of petrol—that British term that describes Riesiing's oddly attractive and mild diesel smell—plus peach and green apple. It tastes crisp, dry, medium-bodied and well balanced.",88,Joleté 2012 Riesling (Anderson Valley),,,,
"Zesty lime and fresh green herbs abound in this leaner, steelier expression of dry Riesling. Tart tangerine and orange flavors are concentrated but crisp, edged in cool, stony minerals. Drink now through 2021.",90,Villa Huesgen 2016 1735 Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"An opening of smoky tomato sauce, tea and earthy berry fruit turns leathery and more earthy with each passing minute. This has a lean body and sharp acidity, which creates a tangy flavor profile that includes tomato and plum. A light, zesty and earthy finish is par for the course.",84,Pisano 2011 Río de los Pájaros Reserve Pinot Noir (Progreso),,,,
"Earthy underbrush, leather, scorched earth, dark spice and toasted hazelnut aromas lead the way. The firm palate shows dried cherry, licorice and tobacco flavors alongside assertive, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2019–2026.",90,Germano Ettore 2011 Lazzarito Riserva  (Barolo),,,,
Terra di Siena is an easygoing Tuscan red that begs for a pairing with cheesy pasta or risotto. The fat element in those foods would be balanced by the wine's fresh acidity and easy berry flavors.,84,Tenuta di Trecciano 2010 Terra di Siena  (Chianti Colli Senesi),,,,
"If you like a traditionally styled Rioja then this will be highly appealing. Aromas of dill, tobacco and dried fruits are enticing, while the palate veers toward subtle fruits, more tobacco and finely intertwined acidity. This is a wonderful wine from an excellent vintage, thus there's absolutely no reason why it shouldn't age gracefully for another decade.",91,Montecillo 2001 Gran Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"This opens with aromas that recall mature plum, resin and nail polish. The palate offers fleshy blackberry, nutmeg, anise and vanilla alongside fine-grained tannins. A subtle warmth of alcohol marks the close.",88,Colle Spinello 2010 Tre Quarti Riserva  (Morellino di Scansano),,,,
"A whiff of yeasty baked bread opens the bouquet of this 100% varietal wine that's plenty juicy and drinkable right now. Plum surrounds integrated tannins and a powerful midpalate, suggesting an ability to age. The finish is all about mocha. Cellar through 2022.",92,Amici 2012 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),,,,
"Savory, baked cassis and blackberry aromas show form and solidity, while the palate is deep and a little soft, with lush, slightly roasted berry and black currant aromas. Chocolaty on the finish yet not too heavy or forced. Not all that Syrah-like but it still smells and tastes good.",86,Trivento 2008 Reserve Syrah (Mendoza),,,,
"Another good example of how Lake County grows excellent big reds. Delicious, rich, almost chocolaty, this nevertheless dry wine is packed with flavor. It's concentrated, very smooth despite massive tannins and just a pleasure to taste. Tempting now, but best after 2020.",92,Shannon Ridge 2014 High Elevation Collection Sustainably Farmed Vineyards Petite Sirah (Lake County),,,,
"It's obvious that Pernand-Vergelesses can produce great Chardonnay since part of the Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru is in the village. This is a cool wine, crisp with textured acidity and age-worthy acidity and toast. The wine is taut, spicy and moves strongly in the citrus direction. Lime and tangerine flavors are strong along with a complex mineral structure. Drink from 2019.",91,Olivier Leflaive 2014  Pernand-Vergelesses,,,,
Crisp pears and apples abound in this light-bodied dry Riesling. It's delicate in concentration but pleasantly lemony. The wine finishes briskly but freshly.,86,Atwater 2014 Dry Middle Block One Riesling (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This wine is principally Cabernet Franc along with dollops of Malbec and Petit Verdot. A pretty pale salmon color, it offers very primary aromas of strawberry, green pepper and spice. The palate drinks dry with lovely fruit flavors and acid that brings tension and keeps the interest high.",88,Seven Hills 2015 Dry Rosé (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Slightly sweet and powdery smelling, with simple creaminess to the orange-influenced nose. The palate is solid and plump, with basic citrus flavors that shouldn't steer you wrong. Nice feel and a good but regular finish seal the deal.",85,Viña Requingua 2008 Puerto Viejo Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley),,,,
"This wine is all Chardonnay. Aromas of citrus peel, spice and baked bread are direct and appealing. The flavors are dry and crisp with well-balanced acidity.",90,Castillo De Feliciana 2013 Brillánte Brut Méthode Traditionnelle Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Plum and berry aromas show a touch of varietal green. In the mouth, this wine is a bit jammy as well as dense. Woody, herbal blackberry flavors are satisfying. It stays firm and balanced across a ripe finish that includes a touch of resiny oak.",90,Santa Rita 2013 Medalla Real Gran Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"The 18 months' barrel aging has given a strong toasty wood taste that smothers the black plum fruits. Six months could see better integration, but the juiciness is missing in the bone-dry tannins.",87,Mas del Périé 2007 La Roque Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"A grabby wine with earthy/mulchy aromas, licorice and prune aromas. The palate has a balsamic character to the black cherry and dark plum flavors, and the finish is more of the same. Solid enough but it doesn't vary much or improve along the way.",85,Valle Perdido 2006 Malbec (Neuquén),,,,
"This Southern Hemisphere adventure from an Austrian winemaking family can turn out some interesting wines. In this case, it's a medium-bodied wine that's firm yet silky in feel, marrying cassis and tobacco leaf with subtle, balanced oak.",91,Salomon Estate 2013 Finniss River Braeside Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Fleurieu Peninsula),,,,
"This is an extremely floral Negroamaro that boasts intense aromas of Chinese jasmine, incense, dried violets and lavender. The wine has good freshness and lingering floral, almost soapy, flavors. Acute floral notes like these won't appeal to everyone, but the wine's low price will.",85,La Pisara 2007 Negroamaro (Salento),,,,
"Villa Monticelli Passito represents one of the best dessert wines to come from Umbria, central Italy. Made from air-dried grapes, the wine sports a amber-copper color and opens with syrupy aromas of white raisins, candied fruit, honey and loads of apricot.",92,Barberani 2006 Moscato Passito Villa Monticelli Moscato (Umbria),,,,
"Simple and bright, filled with crisp berry nuances, this easygoing effort offers tones of blackberry, cherry and spicy tobacco.",86,Valle Reale 2006  Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,,,,
"Lots of fruit power flows through this full-bodied wine, making it focused and delicious. A firm coating of tannin kicks in to add weight to the texture and help the flavors linger on the finish. Plum, smoke and black pepper are among the complex flavors. It's made from vines planted in 1910 at a nearly 2,000-foot elevation.",90,Sobon Estate 2013 Zinfandel (Fiddletown),,,,
"Waxy white fruit aromas of peach and apple are a touch baked, with vanilla peeking through. The palate is smooth and offers good mouthfeel, while the flavors of lemon, apple and hay are good and finish buttery and creamy. Made by Finca Allende; 70% Viura and 30% Malvasia.",88,Finca Nueva 2009 Fermentado en Barrica Blanco White (Rioja),,,,
"A sweet-smelling wine with notes of overripe pear, pineapple and jasmine. It also drinks quite sweet (26g/L residual sugar) but doesn't have the acid or flavor concentration to match.",84,Paradise Peak 2012 Riesling (Washington),,,,
"AThe nose is appealing in its raisiny fruit, earth, meat and mocha. Things get all together punchier on the palate with vice-like tannins that overwhelm all else.",87,Thorn Clarke 2015 Shotfire Shiraz (Barossa),,,,
"Made from Sierra Foothills Zinfandel, this smells of grapes dried in the sun. This is delicately balanced, with just the right level of thickness and sweetness. Enjoy with plummy desserts or dark chocolate.",88,Easton 2009 Late-Harvest Obscura Zinfandel (Fiddletown),,,,
"This light and fruity wine has fresh acidity as well as lemon and ripe pear fruits. It is soft, smooth, and with a creamy texture, is very ready to drink.",85,Casa Agricola Alexandre Relvas 2015 Ciconia Branco White (Alentejano),,,,
"This linear wine opens with aromas that suggest tomato vine, white spring flower and yellow grapefruit that carry over to the crisp palate along with a hint of zesty lemon peel. Racy acidity adds even more verve.",88,Nals Margreid 2014 Sauvignon (Alto Adige),,,,
"Aromas of mixed black fruits, spice and earth are deep, thorough and integrated. This blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Carmenère, 20% Malbec and 10% Cabernet Franc is tight and taught, with austerity and tannic grip. Flavors of toast, coffee and plum finish peppery, dry, tight and herbal, with a chocolaty note added in for good measure; drink through 2022.",91,Casa Donoso 2012 D Red (Maule Valley),,,,
Red fruits and banana aromas lead to a wine that has a lightly tannic touch over bright cherry fruits. Intense acidity and a herbaceous character come from grapes that are barely ripe. Drink now.,84,Château de Chatelard 2014 Cuvée les Chalandières  (Beaujolais),,,,
"Groseilles is French for red currant, and there is a definite red-fruit character here, with a hint of smokiness and sweet tannins over layers of wood. The wine is still young and relatively soft, but offers aging over the next three to four years.",91,Henri de Villamont 2007 Les Groseilles Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),,,,
"If it weren't for a pretty well-balanced mouthfeel, this would be pushing daisies. It smells like green beans and a used ashtray, with murky green fruit and milk chocolate flavors backing that up. As we said, mouthfeel is good; aromas and flavors not so much.",81,Cubo 2006 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),,,,
"Despite having a wealth of cherry and sweet, smoky oak flavors, unripe notes of green peppercorn and tomato mark this Pinot Noir. The structure is fine and the acidity is great, but the veggie taste distracts.",85,Costa de Oro 2010 Estate Gold Coast Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"A very nice wine, with good, ripe black-currant fruit; dry and balancedwith aromas and flavors of sweet, smoky oak. The flash is on the surface and it's a little sharp, so it's not an ager. But it's a tasty wine.",87,Beringer 1998 Cabernet Sauvignon (Knights Valley),,,,
"This is a lovely, rich wine with mature red berry tones followed by sharp mineral definition and bright aromas of fresh Indian spice. The wine is dense and decadent and could stand up to beef tenderloin with balsamic reduction.",94,Podere Sapaio 2007 Sapaio  (Bolgheri Superiore),,,,
"From a hilltop location near the ocean-influenced town of Freestone, this wine is silky in plum and dark cherry, a hint of mushroomed earth doing its best to come out. Robust on the palate, juicy berry fruit satisfies, finishing thick and rich.",88,Landmark 2012 Rayhill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"This potent Petit Verdot will test your tolerance for tannins and raw power. After a bouquet of gritty berry aromas, tobacco, moss and graphite, you come to punishing tannins and huge flavors of blackberry and dark chocolate. Nothing really subsides on the finish, which is peppery and hard as rocks. This can age another 5–10 years, or drink now with something like steak or braised short ribs.",91,Marques de Griñon 2007 Single Vineyard Estate Bottled Petit Verdot (Dominio de Valdepusa),,,,
"A touch of flinty funk hovers on the nose. The palate at first unfurls in a grapefruity zesty texture on which riper notions of pear and peach, quince and smoke are displayed. The merest touch of residual sweetness lends a baroque sheen to this tableau, always countered by spicy zesty freshness while being so seductive. The dry whistle-clean finish still tingles with that aromatic fruit of the concentrated midpalate. A great expression of the great 2015 vintage: rich but streamlined, seductive but contained and therefore all the more intriguing. Drink now through 2035.",94,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Clos Häuserer Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"A blend of several vineyard sites, including Riddle and Pratt, this is a knockout, a testament to fine winemaking in its soft, velvety texture and buoyant acidity and structure. Orange and strawberry provide a tangy ripeness complemented in earth and clove. This is one worth stocking up on.",93,Sojourn 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This wine is a blend of 70% Mourvèdre, 25% Grenache and 5% Syrah. It opens with achingly pure red currant, cranberry, black pepper, blue fruit, orange peel and dried herb aromas that completely captivate the senses. The palate shows a hypnotic sense of purity along with a sense of elegance that is dazzling. Smoked meat flavors linger on the long finish.",94,B. Leighton 2013 Gratitude Red (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Earthy with subtle Asian spice and forest floor scents, this wine is medium in build and generous in tannin, still untangling its limbs in the glass.",89,Hawley 2014 Oehlman Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"From the area of La Morra in the Langhe, this elegant Barolo delivers a tight, traditional style with sharp aromas of blueberry, spice, teriyaki sauce and root beer. There's very nice depth and density here with a bright, menthol-driven finish.",91,Francone 2007  Barolo,,,,
"This is a field blend from the steep Quinta da Foz vineyard at the mouth of the Pinhão River. Aged from two years in new wood, this impressive, structured wine is just setting out on its aging process. Big tannins and big fruit are all there, packed into dense tannins and a mineral texture. It will age well, don't drink before 2019.",95,Quinta da Foz 2012 Grande Reserva Red (Douro),,,,
"From one of the few producers to have estate-grown Syrah in the appellation, this wine comes from vines planted in Goldridge soils. It offers robust notions of tangy red fruit, leathery pepper and wild game, a worthy representative of the variety that could stand more time in bottle. Drink now through 2020.",91,Dehlinger 2013 Goldridge Syrah (Russian River Valley),,,,
"New oak dominates this brisk, young Chardonnay. It's elaborate in tropical fruit, Asian pears and green apples, with fine, tart acidity making the mouth water, as well as a buttery creaminess from lees and 100% malolactic fermentation. Drink now.",90,Patz & Hall 2011 Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Despite the age, this still drinks quite young and tight, with firm tannins and a gripping structure framed against a fleshy black-fruit center. Rich and dense notes of blackberry, boysenberry and plum are laced with hints of cigar spice, licorice and toasted vanilla, and a sweet-wood sensation stays through the long finish. Big in almost every regard, this should continue to age well through 2016.",91,Domaine Calvet-Thunevin 2008 Les Trois Marie Red (Côtes du Roussillon Villages),,,,
"Rich and fine, this is extraordinarily decadent. Flavors of pineapple, mango, crème brûlée, buttered toast, honey and spicy oak are wrapped in a note of vanilla cream, and brightened with crisp acidity. A bit heavy and seemingly sweet, this is showing its best now.",90,Rochioli 2010 River Block Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This firm's top Crozes-Hermitage cuvée is the Domaine Raymond Roure, which sees plenty of new wood in its upbringing, to judge from its somewhat coarse vanilla and cedar notes. There is plenty of blackberry fruit lurking beneath, so hopefully this will come together in time. Try after 2010.",89,Paul Jaboulet Aîné 2005 Domaine Raymond Roure  (Crozes-Hermitage),,,,
"Fresh and versatile, this Cabernet-Merlot blend offers a balanced interplay of spice, pepper and red fruit notes. The cherry, raspberry, leather and cedar flavors will pair well with tomato-based dishes, grilled meats and stews.",87,Estate Biblia Chora 2008 Red (Pangeon),,,,
"It's very clean and fresh in aroma, cool and clear in flavor and soft in texture. Vaguely pearlike aromas lead to more vivid and interesting canteloupe flavors on the finish.",84,Bota Box 2013 Pinot Grigio (California),,,,
"Herbal notes of bark and soft spice mingle with red cherry and plum fruit aromas and flavors. This is bright and accessible now thanks to approachable tannins and a clean, easygoing finish.",85,Laroche 2011 L'Avenir Pinotage (Western Cape),,,,
"A blend of 80% Sangiovese and 20% Malvasia and Merlot, it has aromas of underbrush and tobacco leaf alongside notes of espresso and spice. The linear palate offers black cherry accented by notes of nutmeg and black pepper, with firm but rather fleeting tannins.",87,Fattoria di Petroio 2010 Lenzi  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"This lovely vineyard-designate opens in cherry-berry cobbler, becoming luxurious and weighty on the palate while remaining juicy and expansive, too. Dusty tannins provide a structure and backbone before Tahitian vanilla marks the long finish. This wine is entirely enjoyable now but should thrive in the cellar through 2025.",92,Kokomo 2012 Ruth's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"This rich selection has a touch of bottle age that creates a toasty character. It features ripe apricot and peach notes, with warm and taut acidity. Ready to drink.",87,Henri Goutorbe NV Cuvée Prestige Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"This is the epitome of a composed, approachable Rioja reserva; it's earthy and dry up front, with aromas of fine herbs, brandied cherry and plum. A solid palate houses oaky flavors of vanilla and butter in addition to plum and currant, while the finish is dry, elegant and oaky enough to give off a popcorn-like character. Drink through 2022.",90,Bodegas Bilbainas 2010 Viña Pomal Reserva  (Rioja),,,,

"The second wine of this Saint-Emilion Premier Grand Cru Classé estate comes from selected parcels. Rich and with the smoothness of oak aging and ripe grapes, it is a generous wine that is developing well. Drink from 2020.",93,Château la Gaffelière 2014 Dame Gaffelière  (Saint-Émilion),,,,
"Aromatic and richly fruity, this has surprising weight that gives the palate a round and smooth quality. The acidity is there, although it is covered by the superrich fruit.",85,Domaine de Moulin-Pouzy 2011 White (Bergerac Sec),,,,
"A charming package, with raspberries and fresh plums as an opening act followed by leather and mushrooms on the palate and just a hint of tannin. The finish falls a bit short but offers up an intriguing watermelon note. Drink up.",87,Marchesi di Barolo 2007 Madonna di Como  (Dolcetto d'Alba),,,,
"Sturdy in texture and a bit earthy in flavor, this medium-bodied wine has aromas like raspberries, core flavors like red cherries and a sense of good maturity for drinking now.",86,Josh Cellars 2014 Pinot Noir (California),,,,
"Much in the style of the outstanding 2008, this elegant, Burgundian-like Pinot Noir is a finessed wine, with lovely details of rose petal and penetrating raspberry fruit. There's a pleasing transparency, keeping it light without losing focus or depth, and the finely rendered tannins put the perfect period at the end of the sentence.",91,Lachini 2009 Lachini Family Estate Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),,,,
"This is a fresh and fruity wine with lively acidity and spice from wood aging. Dominated by Sauvignon Blanc, it is herbal and still young, needing time to develop. Drink this crisp wine from late 2017.",87,Château Haut Selve 2015  Graves,,,,
"Ripe aromas of cassis, prune and brandied black cherry indicate the concentration on this Cabernet. A palate that doesn't hold back is jammy but a bit heavy.

Drink through 2022.",90,Mendel 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"A sweet sparkling wine that is fresh and clean, this comes from the south of France. The light, crisp character with some acidity leaves a fresh aftertaste. This is a new release from Barton & Gustier.",84,Barton & Guestier NV NectaRosé Sparkling (Vin Mousseux),,,,
"Sprightly lime and peach aromas mix with seared orange rind and hints of white flowers on the nose of this bottling. The riper aromas tighten up on the sip, where tart green apples cut the suave nectarine-flesh flavors as white peach slowly emerges.",88,San Simeon 2014 Estate Reserve Viognier (Paso Robles),,,,
"Made with 80% Sangiovese and 20% Merlot, Canaiolo, Mammolo, Colorino and Cabernet Sauvignon, this has aromas of espresso, scorched earth and ripe berry.

"For a Lalande de Pomerol this wine has a high proportion (30%) of Cabernet Franc, giving a structure that shapes the ripe Merlot. It's juicy with black plums and has a core of dry tannins. Drink from 2018.",90,Château Tournefeuille 2013  Lalande de Pomerol,,,,
"A great value choice from Sicily, this bright Nero d'Avola is perfumed and floral, with red rose, violet and wild berry aromas. The mouthfeel is delicate, polished and fresh.",87,Tasca d'Almerita 2009 Regaleali Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),,,,
"This is a lean Dominus, showing the difficulties of the vintage. It's dry and tannic, with black currant, cherry and cassis flavors that are wrapped in strong, hard tannins. It's a good wine, but lacks the r ich complexity you expect from this property.",88,Dominus 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"A rich, full Petite Sirah with a taste of cola and spice followed by ripe raspberry and blackberry. A very yummy version of the variety from one of Livemore's most promising vineyards.",88,Fenestra 2007 Ghielmetti Vineyard Petite Sirah (Livermore Valley),,,,
"The standard Sauvignon Blanc aromas of lime and mineral define the nose of this wine. It tastes juicy to an extreme, with fruit flavors of nectarine and apple that don't rise to a high level. It's tangy, candied and bright on the finish.",84,François Lurton 2012 Hacienda Araucano Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Lolol Valley),,,,
"Ripe white peach and sharp lime peel qualities interplay on the nose of this bottling from the iconic vineyard, which is now under the quality-focused ownership of the Foley family. That lime zest comes through on the palate too, cutting through the creamy midpalate and adding a pinpoint edge to the finish.",89,Chalone 2014 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Chalone),,,,
"Solabal captures the essence of Rioja reserva with this fairly oaked, fruity wine. The palate is tight and demanding, with proper acid-to-tannin balance. Flavors of wild raspberry and plum are lively, while the finish shows some creaminess, tobacco and warmth. Drink now and over the next two years.",91,Solabal 2004 Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"A lovely purity of lemon oil and zest pervades both nose and palate of this straight-laced wine. There is purity and freshness, precision and tons of zesty tangy lemon. This finds its counterpoint in a lovely texture of stone and chalk. Later, ripe apple notes make an aromatic experience and stay on the dry palate all the way through the long lemony finish. Drink now through 2030.",94,François Baur 2015 Brand Grand Cru Clos de la Treille Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"Deep and sweet, but there's also an unusual and appetizing edge offered via cola nut and root beer. Any tartness to the blackberry fruit is offset by vanillin oak. Pleasurable, full-bodied and on the money. It's stylish good stuff with a correct amount of woody character.",91,August Briggs 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Brezza's finely nuanced Cannubi expression of Nebbiolo delivers sweet spice tones of cinnamon, clove and nutmeg followed by delicate tones of root beer, drying mineral, soy sauce and forest fruit.

Together they weave a lean, simple gathering of red berry and dried herb, that finishes in toasted oak.",86,Viszlay Vineyards 2012 Five Vines Red (Russian River Valley),,,,
"90–92. Barrel sample. This is a solid and dense wine with hints of bitter chocolate along with super-ripe blackberry fruits. The wine has concentration, richness and a fine ageing potential.",91,Château Maucaillou 2012 Barrel Sample  (Moulis-en-Médoc),,,,

"Pure varietal, this spent 18 months in French oak. Dried cherries, plums and tobacco combine, at first quite tight and compact, but eventually opening into a full-bodied and flavorful red. A touch of maple syrup from the barrel aging sweetens the tannins and enlivens the finish.",91,Tinhorn Creek 2013 Oldfield Series Cabernet Franc (Okanagan Valley),,,,
"Dusty, bready apple aromas are direct and not too yeasty. This feels tight and refined, with citric acidity. Lightly briny apple and citrus flavors finish steady and fresh, but also smooth. For brut nature, this gets things right.",90,Maria Casanovas NV GLAÇ Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"Pungent with strong aromas of stem and herb, the fruit suggests green banana and other minimally-ripe flavors. The wine is a bit disjointed, with stiff tannins and a green edge to the finish.",85,Anne Amie 2010 Winemaker's Selection Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"The nose on this isn't very expressive but eventually reveals notes of red berry, baking spice and a whiff of grilled herb. The palate is raw and tannic, offering unripe sour cherry, young sage and ground pepper but it lacks fruit richness. Bracing tannins dry out the mouth.",86,Rivella Silvia 2012  Barbaresco,,,,
"Spicy and strong, this vineyard-designate has a definite point of view. Pure, fresh cranberry and apple flavors drive down into the finish, buttressed with crisp, clean acidity. Drink now through 2020.",90,King Estate 2013 Pfeiffer Vineyards Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
This Chard competes well with others that are considerably more expensive.

Notes of oak and lees lend complexity to this delicious wine.,91,Cambria 2011 Bench Break Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"This is an inaugural release from this site, an ocean-viewing, high-elevation perch overlooking the Pacific Ocean that loves the variety.

A length of cardamom provides a memorable spiciness to the finish.",93,Sojourn 2015 Walala Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,

"About a second after you sip this wine, the sugary fruit hits, like the blast of a gummy bears. The wine is front-loaded with raspberries, watermelons, persimmons and strawberries, and the acidity is pretty good, but it's simply too sweet and fruity.",84,Balverne 2010 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"At 7.5 g/L of residual sugar, this is more off-dry than dry, but the acidity is high enough to provide a sense of crispness. In this plump, medium-bodied Riesling, peach and citrus strike a fine balance, ending with a dollop of lime sherbet. Drink now–2018.",89,Villa Maria 2010 Cellar Selection Dry Riesling (Marlborough),,,,
"Gossamer-light in texture, this delicate Gewürztraminer seems to whisper tones of apricot, blossom and peach on the nose and palate. A shade off dry, it's an elegant, mineral-toned wine. Drink now to enjoy its ephemeral beauty.",89,Bellangelo 2013 1866 Reserve Gewürztraminer (Seneca Lake),,,,

"This lightly sparkling, terroir-driven wine is loaded with soul and finesse. It's ethereal and bone dry, with delicately alluring aromas and flavors of white spring flower, ripe apple, Bartlett pear, citrus and Alpine herb.

The sediment at the bottom of the bottle adds even more flavor to the last glass.",93,Ca' dei Zago 2016 Col Fondo Glera,,,,
"An exciting wine, dry and silky with balanced restraint Overall, the power is evident in the controlled explosion of cherries, currants and cola, wrapped in firm, smooth tannins. A great success, and worthy of extended cellaring. Begin to drink this beauty after 2018.",94,Foxen 2011 Fe Ciega Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Named for a barrel that once rolled off a cliff, this forward fruity wine blends numerous sources to craft an easy-drinking, no-frills style.

That's not to say it lacks concentration, but its strength is the pretty fruit.",88,Brooks 2015 Runaway Red Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,

Firm, refined tannins provide the backbone.",91,Ceste 2011 Palliano Riserva  (Roero),,,,

"Meeker has tinkered with Bordeaux blends for years, and this is their best so far. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, it's rich and soft, with blackberry, currant and chocolate flavors and interesting notes of sage and sweet dill. Now through 2011.",90,Meeker 2005 Four Kings Red (Alexander Valley),,,,
"The Lollipop Hill designation seems rounder and fuller on the palate than the producer's Special Reserve Tocai. It's not deeply concentrated, but offers shades of ripe yellow apple, plum and lemon flavors. Soft tangerine acidity brightens the midpalate. Drink now through 2019.",87,Millbrook 2016 Lollipop Hill Estate Bottled Tocai Friulano (Hudson River Region),,,,
"This is a great 2005 Pinot Noir, the best ever from Talley. The wine somehow combines huge ripe fruit with delicacy. It floods the mouth with profound currant, cherry pie, licorice, cola, raspberry, cocoa and vanilla smoke flavors, yet feels light and silky, and is thoroughly dry. That's the magic of Pinot Noir. You can enjoy this small production wine now, and it should develop additional complexities for 10 years.",97,Talley 2005 Rosemary's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),,,,
"From the start, this is a heavily roasted and fully oaked wine. The nose is charred and cooked, with black-fruit aromas lurking below the surface. The mouth is drying and shows black-fruit flavors along with burnt meat, licorice, lemon peel and herbs.",85,Aguirre 2010 Reina Ana Cabernet Sauvignon (Maule Valley),,,,
"This is a basic Malbec, dark in color, dry and tannic. It has blackberry, currant and leather flavors that lack some intensity.",84,Swirl 2010 Lockwood Oaks Vineyard Malbec (San Antonio Valley),,,,
"Phillips Hill's Two Terroirs is very subtly marked “AV + MR,” signaling that the fruit was sourced from both the cool Anderson Valley and even cooler Mendocino Ridge. It's lightly earthy and resplendent in bright, just-ripe cherry tones. Gorgeously crisp, with undeniable structure, this is ready to drink, but it would also shine in a few years time.",92,Phillips Hill 2010 Two Terroirs Pinot Noir (Mendocino),,,,
"A nice tarry funk along with dried mint and menthol cigarette scents characterize the nose of this blend of 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Syrah and 4% Petite Verdot. The creosote sense carries to the palate, meeting with black cherry, dried bouquet garni and quite grippy tannins.",88,Callaway 2010 Profonde Winemaker's Reserve Red (Temecula Valley),,,,
"The winemaker really squeezed out the cherries and boysenberries in this Merlot, making it super fruity. It's not especially complex, but it will appeal to fans of jammy wines.",84,Frei Brothers 2011 Reserve Merlot (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Harmonium is a gorgeous, opulent wine with a generous bouquet that is packed tight with blackberry, cherry liqueur, dark mocha, toasted vanilla bean and bright touches of black licorice. It's a very pleasurable and elaborate interpretation of Sicily's number one indigenous grape.",91,Firriato 2009 Harmonium Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),,,,
"This single-vineyard Dolcetto is concentrated, juicy and impressive. The raspberry and black cherry flavors are rounded out by developed notes of leather and earth while finely polished tannins and good palate length make for a sophisticated mouthfeel. The finish is strikingly long and textured, with excellent depth of flavor. At five years old, this wine is fully mature and drinking well now.",92,Romana Carlo 2003 Brich dij Nòr  (Dolcetto di Dogliani),,,,
"This is a soft, fruity style of rosé, perfectly suited as an apéritif. It has attractive red currant and raspberry fruit, a light touch of tannin and balanced acidity, finishing elegant and crisp.",87,Liebart-Régnier NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne),,,,
"Despite coiming in at only 12.5% abv, this is fairly weighty. Restrained aromas of crushed stone set the stage, then bold peach and melon flavors take over, finishing with a bit of celery leaf. Drink now.",91,Forrest 2015 The Doctors' Grüner Veltliner (Marlborough),,,,
"Juicy black cherry, tobacco, leather, underbrush, licorice, menthol, mint and balsamic notes all come together on this powerfully structured wine. The succulent, ripe fruit is supported by a solid tannic backbone. It's already delicious but it's still compact and brooding so give it time to unwind. Drink after 2020–2040.",95,Poderi Aldo Conterno 2010 Bussia Cicala  (Barolo),,,,
"This blend of 64% Marsanne and 36% Roussanne is one-dimensional, and it tastes a bit sour.",81,Highland Hills Winery 2011 White Rhone Blend Marsanne-Roussanne (Ramona Valley),,,,
"Soft and ripe wine, with gentle tannins and fresh acidity. There is an edge of bitterness that comes between the fruit and the structure.",88,Louis Latour 2008 Vignes Franches Premier Cru  (Beaune),,,,
"Light, airy and leesy on the nose, this is more complex than most everyday Albariños. Additional aromas of vanilla wafer, acacia, honeydew and minerals lead to a clean-flowing palate. Minerally peach and nectarine flavors show a touch of almond-skin bitterness on the finish.",91,Lusco 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"This is a ripe and tangy wine from the Bellanger family. Its green, citrus and apricot fruits are all singing together in an attractive, balanced way. It has richness that gives a full-bodied wine without detracting from the fresher, white currant and spice side. Drink now.",90,Château Roquefort 2015  Bordeaux Blanc,,,,
"This appellation blend is very light in color and also quite restrained aromatically, with the slightest hints of lime, lemongrass and vanilla on the nose. The sip is quite tense, powered by lime acidity and a chalky mouthfeel. A richer white-peach element arises toward the finish.",89,Sanford 2015 Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Cranberry, cardamom, earthy mushroom, loam and a bit of smoke power the nose of this wine from one of the appellation's pioneers. The flavors are more subtle, with Bing cherry and raspberry fruit accented by notes of clove, plum skin and turned earth.",91,Hahn 2012 SLH Gabrielle Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"This is so fruity with its blend of Grolleau and Cabernet Franc. It is off dry, full of strawberry flavors and laced with acidity. It is a fine summer rosé.",84,Chereau Carré 2015 Domaine des Nouelles  (Rosé d'Anjou),,,,
"The value bottling from this producer, this wine bursts with pretty scents and raspberry fruit flavors. It carries a nice hint of citrus tang, and still lighter notes of mocha and caramel. Modest in proportion, but generous in flavor, it's ready for immediate enjoyment.",90,Purple Hands 2013 Oregon Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"The vineyard has been source to several wineries including Conn Creek, who had a successful 2002, but this '04 is a let-down. Despite some decent black currant and oak flavors the wine feels tannicly sharp and astringent, without charming softness, and does not seem capable of improving in the cellar.",84,Conn Creek 2004 Hozhoni Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),,,,
"Very high alcohol gives this wine a hot, jalapeño pepper burn. Based on Zinfandel, the blend also includes Syrah and Petite Sirah. It's a rugged, rustic wine that would shine with a richly-sauced barbecue for balance.",86,Wilson 2010 Wilson Family Red (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
One must strain to smell the ripe plum at first in this wine that is otherwise more tannic than juicy or flavorful. Buoyed by American oak and a dash or two of Syrah and Petite Sirah it's rightly priced.,84,Zynthesis 2009 Old Vine Zinfandel Zinfandel (Lodi),,,,
"This is big and dark on the nose, but also kind of generic. It feels round, flush and tannic, with blackberry, chocolate and a mild bitterness to the palate. The wine finishes big and chewy, but there's a persistent, controlled bitterness to the flavor profile.",87,Maquis 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"This vineyard is widely regarded for its quality worthy of grand cru status, and this wine, from vines owned by Louis Jadot, is a fine example. It is both structured and richly fruity—dense with ripe red fruit flavors cut with acidity. A dry core of tannins will allow this impressive wine to age. Drink from 2024.",94,Louis Jadot 2014 Clos Saint-Jacques Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),,,,
"The freshness and concentration of the fruit flavors in this full-bodied wine is exceptional. It smells like Concord juice and tastes dark and grapy, forming a simple but appealing personality that's hard to resist.",87,Infidel 2014 Zinfandel (Lodi),,,,
"On the nose, this Chardonnay smells mostly of oak, with apple and melon notes in the background. Salty oaky flavors mask the wine's fruit, which falls into the stone-fruit category. A barrel-dominated finish with nectarine notes is resiny and salty.",87,Concha y Toro 2015 Marques de Casa Concha Chardonnay (Limarí Valley),,,,
"Dried, or appassiti grapes, are added to this Nebbiolo-based wine to enhance intensity and flavor. The result is a medium-structured ruby wine with floral notes backed by forest berry, dried currant and bitter almonds. The wine finishes with smoky tannins.",86,Salis 1637 2003 Corte della Meridiana Riserva  (Valtellina Superiore),,,,
"Aromas of white peach, flint and hint of banana carry over to the round, ripe palate along with green apple and a note of juicy tangerine. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors and leads to a bright, clean finish.",90,Jermann 2015 Pinot Grigio (Friuli Venezia Giulia),,,,
"Flavors are followed by intense crisp citrus fruit. This is a lively style, very fresh with a delicious tang of orange zest, light caramel and vibrant acidity.",90,Domaine de la Chapelle 2008 Madame Noly  (Saint-Véran),,,,
"The upside of the recession is that wines this good are being sold for lower prices, which is great news for consumers. This Cabernet, basically a négociant's blend, is really delicious. It's rich, dry, tannic and lush in blackberry and cherry tart, chocolate and smoky cedar flavors.",91,Wine Spots 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Tawny in color and wafting of potpourri and fallen leaves, this raspberry-inflected wine is already starting to show its maturity. Briskly concentrated and light on its feet, it makes an elegant sip to enjoy now before it loses its delicate, perfumed charms.",87,Serenity 2012 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),,,,
"While shades of slate and saffron lend complexity and nuance, this semisweet wine is more a showcase of sumptuous yellow peach and pear flavors. Its high-toned acidity and delicate, lacy mouthfeel make it irresistibly gulpable.",92,Weingut Albert Gessinger 2014 Zeltinger Sonnenuhr Josefsberg Old Vines Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Beautiful and likeable for its dryness, crisp minerality, and the sleek, clean mouthfeel. The fruit suggests oak-inspired pears, oranges and citrons. This elegant quaff gets better as it warms in the glass. Drink now.",92,Dutton-Goldfield 2008 Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Notions of tart redcurrant play on the nose while a delicious edge of white pepper draws you in. The same pepper entices on the palate, framing fresh, tart berry and lemon purity on the slender but memorable palate. A firm structure makes this spicy, energetic and invigorating little number irresistible. The fine mousse has verve and elegance. It finishes pure and long.",93,Exton Park Vineyard NV Rosé Sparkling (England),,,,
"The 2008 Brookman Syrah is a rich, plush, luxurious wine. Aromas of cedar, vanilla and black cherry set the stage, while the palate features intense dark fruit layered with hints of olive and coffee. It's full bodied and creamy in texture, showing just a touch of warmth on the supple finish. Drink now–2020.",92,Clarendon Hills 2008 Brookman Syrah (Clarendon),,,,
"Aiming to highlight one Cab clone grown in the dusty soils of the appellation, this well-crafted wine remains tight in grippy tannins for the meantime. Just enough compelling notes of cedar, grenadine, red cherry and truffle hit the palate to suggest further aging. Drink from 2017–2027.",93,Beaulieu Vineyard 2012 Clone 4 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),,,,
"Light pink in color, this is a pretty wine made from 100% Grolleau. It is soft, medium sweet with integrated acidity that comes from the fresh raspberries. It is ready to drink.",84,Bougrier 2015  Rosé d'Anjou,,,,
"About as rich and flamboyant as California Chardonnay gets, a wine that blows you away with sheer pyrotechnic wizardry. Massive in grilled pineapples, mangoes, Key lime pie, vanilla honey, crème caramel and dusty spices, accented with perfect acidity.",95,Au Bon Climat 2007 Santa Barbara Historic Vineyards Collection Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Alluring, attractive aromas of tree bark, licorice, fig and blackberry feed into a layered, concentrated palate with plum, blackberry and peppery flavors. Toasty oak, mild herbal notes and a lot of dark spice drive the finish on this cellar-worthy Cabernet. Drink through 2023.",92,Finca El Origen 2012 Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Uco Valley),,,,
"This darkly colored blush may be technically dry, like the label says, but it tastes as sweet as raspberry Kool-Aid. If you like that fruity style, it's for you.",84,Pedroncelli 2011 Dry Rosé of Zinfandel Rosé (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"This full-bodied, muscular Shiraz is built for the ages. Baking spices and plummy fruit form a concentrated, nearly impenetrable wall on the nose, while the palate is nearly dense enough to stand a fork in. Despite all that, it's not overly heavy or fudge-like, instead offering tremendous poise, purity and length. Drink 2020–2030, and likely then some.",96,Kay Brothers 2012 Amery Vineyard Block 6 Shiraz (McLaren Vale),,,,
"Spicy, dense and thick, this wine settles into bright, lifted acidity and tart flavors of rhubarb and cranberry. The underbelly remains earthy in clove and black tea.",88,August Briggs 2014 Dijon Clones Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),,,,
"A darker, denser red that offers chocolate, black fruit and spice on the nose and palate. A spin of nutty spice and dried fruit punctuates the cherry and raisin fruit. Slightly Port-like and heavier, this wine will soften with time in the bottle.",87,Palivou 2004 Ammos Terra Leone Single Vineyard Selection Agiorgitiko (Nemea),,,,
"Herbal, brambly aromas mix with dark berry, mocha and vanilla aromas, while the palate is creamy and soft, with herbal, almost vegetal flavors and not much defined fruit or clarity. Finishes as herbal as it starts, with coffee and green tobacco flavors.",84,Errazuriz 2009 Estate Carmenère (Central Valley),,,,
"Red berry, baking spice, mint, leather and rose petal aromas emerge on this beautiful, balanced Barolo. It shows remarkable freshness for the vintage, offering juicy wild cherry, raspberry, licorice and a balsamic note alongside polished tannins and bright acidity.",92,Luigi Oddero & Figli 2011  Barolo,,,,
"This Brunello opens with a bright ruby color and delivers aromas of cherry cola, Spanish cedar, cigar box, wild berries and spice. It's a streamlined wine that puts more emphasis on elegance than brawn or power. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers.",88,Le Potazzine 2005 Gorelli  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"Creamy and spicy, this blend of Grenache Blanc and Roussanne has rich, slightly sweet flavors of pineapple cream, white peach jam, honey, vanilla and a wealth of dusty Asian spices. It's an opulent wine that needs equally strong fare, like crab cakes.",86,Adelaida 2006 The Glenrose Vineyard Version White (Paso Robles),,,,
"This wine smells like an ice cream sundae, with scents of mint-chocolate chip and cookie dough, plus touches of strawberry and cherry sauce. Light to medium bodied, it has a malleable midpalate, but the tannins gain astringency on the finish. As the wine sits in the glass, the fruit seems to fall away, and the palate becomes more brittle feeling.",83,Miracle Valley 2010 Cabernet Franc (Virginia),,,,
"This is a dry wine meant for the dinner table. It has blackberry and raspberry aromas, concentrated fruit flavors, firm tannins and a taut finish. It will be best to drink after 2018.",88,City Winery Chicago 2014 West Loop Red (North Coast),,,,
"Hickory and other wood-based aromas and flavors dominate this Amarone-style blend. Amid all the smokiness there's cola and vanilla aromas and thick, heavy, meaty flavors of baked black fruits offset by toast, spice and chocolate. A sweet-tasting, jammy feeling finish closes the show.",88,Bodega Renacer 2011 Enamore Red (Mendoza),,,,
"The 2011 vintage was a challenging one, and a reserve wine with alcohol this low is a bit of a stretch. Light, clean raspberry fruit is on display, with sharp acidity and no noticeable new oak influence.",87,Vista Hills 2011 Skyraider Reserve Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),,,,
"Damilano is one of Barolo's historic wineries and Cannubi its most historic vineyard cru. All that history combines here to shape a traditional, yet New World wine with plush roundness and intense notes of spice, leather, pipe tobacco, polished red wood and black currant. It's luscious, velvety and tight in the mouth and will improve with age. Drink with venison or game.",92,Damilano 2004 Cannubi  (Barolo),,,,
"David Sterza makes one of the best Ripassos ever and the low price of this delicious wine makes it all the more irresistible. Huge concentration and inky richness is offset by sweet cherry, black licorice, cola and dried flowers. The wine is long, smooth and firmly structured.",90,David Sterza 2009  Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso,,,,
"Dense, deep and angular, this young Cabernet is a lot of wine, loaded with bright berry flavors mixing raspberry, strawberry and boysenberry. With great concentration and palate presence, this youthful wine shows grip and texture, as light pepper and spice flavors filter in, and the tannins add definition and power to the finish, which slowly opens into a light dusting of chocolate.",91,Robert Karl 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"Scents of honey, pear and cinnamon waft from the glass; the flavors are of baked pears and apples, but never turn too soft or blowsy. Warming on the finish, with lots of dried spices and toast.",89,Tenuta Sant'Antonio 1998 Capitello Chardonnay (Friuli),,,,
"91–93. Barrel sample. There is a fine depth of flavor here, with solid tannins as well as ripe fruit. This second wine of Château Pichon Longueville is packed with the vintage's hallmark of perfumed black-currant fruit.",92,Château Pichon Longueville 2012 Les Tourelles de Longueville Barrel Sample  (Pauillac),,,,
"A pale gold color leads into a wine that is mature and rich. The fruits have mellowed into almond and spice, with attractive acidity, while the ripe texture remains. The balance is just right in a wine that is generous and full in the mouth. Drink now.",92,Jean Laurent 2005 Blanc de Noirs Millésimé Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne),,,,

"Attractive mid-gold color. Fairly muted nose of very ripe stone fruit. Medium-bodied with moderate concentration of juicy citrus and sweet stone fruit flavors.

"Marmalade, raisin and a hint of tropical fruit are balanced by the dry botrytis of this rich wine, which is based on the same grape varieties as Sauternes. It is elegant and ageworthy, but is also ready to drink now.",90,Château K 2009 White (Saussignac),,,,
"Fruity and herbal all at once with aromas of kirsch and black cherry competing with notes of wet forest floor and wild game. Lightweight and drinkable with a clean, fruit-driven finish.",84,Appollis 2009 Shiraz-Cinsaut-Mourvèdre Red (Wellington),,,,
"The Westside Paso winery's name is Finnish for “the hill,” and that aspect delivers baked plums and strawberries, a touch of maple, dried roses and brown sugar on the nose of this 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah blend. It's full bodied, with crushed asphalt at the tip of the sip, then settles into elderberry and cedar notes.",91,kukkula 2012 Pas de Deux Grenache-Syrah (Paso Robles),,,,
"Mostly from Pepper Bridge and Seven Hills vineyards, this wine has aromas of cherry, green herbs, pepper and flowers, with the Petit Verdot (15%) showing through. It's brawny in feel, with coffee and cherry flavors, chewy tannins and mouthwatering acids.",88,Three Rivers 2012 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"A terrific Sauvignon Blanc, this is Mayacamas's best in years. Bone dry and rich in mouthwatering acidity, it shows subtle layers of lemons, limes, oranges and spices, with a bitter grassiness that gives it a perfect bite.",91,Mayacamas 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Mount Veeder),,,,
"This is a classically light rosé, fragrant in strawberry and raspberry. Traces of pomegranate on the back palate offers darker, riper fruit in the glass, getting prettier as it goes along. Deliciously dry and dancing in acidity, it has plenty of citrus on the finish. The wine is substantial enough for springtime and summertime meals, but will drink equally well on its own.",92,Lynmar 2013 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"A hit of sulfur slowly blows off to reveal aromas of hot stone and maple syrup, with undertones of dark stone fruit and dill. The medium-bodied palate offers soft acids that lend a slightly flat feel, with mild tannins adding some support.",83,Brys 2010 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Old Mission Peninsula),,,,
"A light and tart wine, with a bouquet of berry, tea and a touch of barnyard. On the palate, there's more cherry, tea and oak. The fundamental Pinot characteristics are here, but it turns drying and a bit sour on the finish.",82,Undurraga 2000 Pinot Noir (Maipo Valley),,,,

"This cuvée is comprised of 43% Syrah, 40% Merlot and 17% Petite Sirah. It exudes black tar and leather, but it's more savory than fruity. Tannic still, showing off the Petite, its finish is long and lingering. This is a good pasta wine.",87,Stuessy Cellars 2010 Principium Cuvee Red (Suisun Valley),,,,
"A nice Cab that shows the structure and purity of good terroir. It could use more concentration and intensity, but is totally dry and has savory black currant, mocha and cedar flavors. Drink now.",86,Louis M. Martini 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),,,,
"This is a worthy followup to Storm's fine 2008 bottling. Although it's not quite as rich, it does provide a pleasing Pinot Noir experience. The wine is very dry, tart in acidity and clean, with rich cherry, pomegranate and mushroom notes.",88,Storm 2009 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"Made from Tempranillo and Syrah grapes from Stagecoach Vineyard, this inaugural release is unctuous yet light. Six months of aging in mostly French oak has added complexity and a touch of weight. Its orange and peach flavors are juicy and substantial.",90,Krupp Brothers 2016 The Damsel Rosé (Napa Valley),,,,
"Too much of a good thing is how to characterize this Merlot. It's exceptionally ripe with cherries, red currants and mocha. It's also strong in oak. The result is a soft, syrupy confection.",84,Westerly 2010 Merlot (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),,,,
"This is a red that shows some richness— ripe cherry flavor, as well as good layer of tannins. There is a juicy character to the wine that is balanced by the smoky flavors from wood aging. Drink now and until 2018.",87,Rieflé 2011 Bonheur Convivial Pinot Noir (Alsace),,,,
"This is a ripe, fruity wine, its herbaceous citrus character well blended with full melon and green apple flavors. Already attractive wine, it's full of crisp acidity and lively fruitiness.",85,Chateau le Grand Verdus 2013  Bordeaux Blanc,,,,
"A rich wine with crisp apple and grapefruit flavors as well as a touch of sweetness, Lanson's non-vintage Brut always has fine acidity with just a hint of toast indicating some bottle age. It's bottled ready to drink.",90,Lanson NV Black Label Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"The vineyards of this ancient castle in the Aube region have produced a a crisp and balanced rosé. It is tangy, with a dosage that balances the ripe fruit and tight acidity. A touch of minerality gives it a good edge. Drink now.",88,Château de Bligny NV Grande Réserve Brut Rosé  (Champagne),,,,
"This is an elegant, intricate wine that's fresh and lively while layered with attractive green apple, white pepper and thyme flavors. Light bodied, it makes a great apéritif or pairing with fish and fowl.",90,Terra d'Oro 2015 Chenin Blanc-Viognier White (Clarksburg),,,,
"Creamed pear- and apple-skin flavors give a wine that has warm acidity, with touches of vanilla and almond. This is warm, rounded and full bodied, with a tang of citrusy acidity that hints at its aging potential.",87,Domaine Michel Fonne 2010 Tradition Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"Fresh and informal, this opens with tangerine aromas, followed by notes of passion fruit, citrus and white flower. It's easy and fresh, with tonic bubbling on the close.",87,Orion Wine NV Rosa Bianca Brut Sparkling (Veneto),,,,
"A ripe Pinot Noir that's marked by toasty oak and big blackberry and black cherry fruit, this wine hails from the mighty Weir Vineyard. It may simply need more time in the cellar to find its balance. Cellar until 2017–2019.",87,Talisman 2010 Weir Vineyard Pinot Noir (Yorkville Highlands),,,,
"Rose petal, mocha and a deeply concentrated red fruit palate make this a bold, beautifully constructed Pinot. Full bodied but nuanced with layers of dried herbs and florals, it finishes long with a soft layer of feathery tannins.",89,Millbrook 2010 25th Anniversary Pinot Noir (Hudson River Region),,,,
"Behind those characteristic aromas of black stone, resin and tar, this hearty Taurasi delivers a touch of raw fruit or black cherry. Some muddled spice notes appear and the wine delivers more used leather and dried tobacco on the close.",88,La Casa Dell'Orco 2005  Taurasi,,,,
"The old saying, you get what you pay for, is perfectly illustrated by this simple Pinot Noir. It's not bad, though, and at this price, will perform the useful function of introducing budding Pinotphiles to the variety.",84,Lucky Star 2009 Pinot Noir (California),,,,
"Ramione is a 50-50 blend of Merlot and Nero d'Avola that delivers a unique and very attractive mineral quality. Under that drying layer of white stone and talc powder, you'll find bursting red cherry and rich blueberry. The various elements of this velvety wine work very well together.",87,Baglio di Pianetto 2004 Ramione Red (Sicilia),,,,
"A bit rough and scoury in texture, but otherwise this dry sparkling wine has rich, complex flavors of citrus fruits, strawberries, brioche and vanilla. Shows fine Mendocino acidity that makes it finish brisk and clean.",85,Terra Sávia 2006 Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (Mendocino),,,,

"An intense, impactful Malbec strong in tannin and power, teeth-staining and suggestive of a leathery saddle. Amidst the wine's manliness there is also ripe dark cherry, tobacco and plenty of soft vanilla. This is a big meat wine.",88,Shannon Ridge 2010 Betsy Vineyard Malbec (High Valley),,,,
"Planted in 1993, this four-acre, cool-climate vineyard had a relatively late harvest in 2005, which can, in the Pacific Northwest, result in more European, vertically structured wines. This is wrapped up tight, and is far away from the sweet, succulent fruit of California Pinot Noir, but its pleasures are many and varied. Clear and bright, its berry-cherry fruit is shaded with leaf and earth. The tannins are firm but quite polished, and the flavors meld together seamlessly.",91,Elk Cove 2005 Roosevelt Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Reductive aromas distract from the fruit and barrel notes in this wine. The palate brings medium-bodied, mouth-puckering cranberry and cherry flavors. Vanilla notes linger on the finish.",85,Kestrel 2013 Falcon Series Estate Sangiovese (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Based in the village of Cramant, Voirin-Jumel has access to Grand Cru Chardonnay vineyards. This crisp and tight wine is packed with acidity, fresh citrus and a taut, steely texture. It is still young and fruity, and could do with some bottle age.",89,Voirin-Jumel NV Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),,,,
"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Franc (56%), Merlot (38%) and Cabernet Sauvignon. Earth, bittersweet chocolate, green herb and floral aromas lead to palate-coating, pillowy fruit flavors that display a beautiful sense of balance along with a lengthy finish.",91,Sleight of Hand 2013 The Archimage Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"The name means “five chosen” and references the barrels selected for this reserve-level wine. Dense, complex and refined, it remains quite compact with nicely layered ripe berry fruit. The tannins carry a suggestion of orange pekoe tea, and the length is impressive. Drink 2020 through 2028.",93,Lenné Estate 2014 Cinq Élus Pinot Noir,,,,
"This is a complex wine that shows sweet berry fruits, ripe tannins and new wood flavors. It is dense and chewy while also being full of rich fruits. This is a wine for aging, although its smooth character suggests it will age relatively quickly.",89,Château la Jorine 2009  Lussac Saint-Émilion,,,,
"This is a fine example of what Barossa Shiraz is capable of at a realistic price. It's full bodied and richly textured, plush without being too soft.

"Dijon clones notwithstanding, this wine is buttery and oaky, emphasizing the flavors of barrel fermentation (in 40% new French oak). Apart from that, it shows moderate acids and a little heat in the finish.",87,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2006 Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Coming from the Chumash tribe-owned Camp 4 Vineyard, this blend of 40% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 25% Mourvèdre offers concentrated violets, blackberry, leather, cedar and interesting tomato leaf on the nose. The palate is not as dense as the nose suggests, but packs in tandoori spice, pipe smoke and vanilla, making it a wine that could handle a cigar.",89,Standing Sun 2012 G-S-M (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Ripe lime aromas and a full richly fruity palate give a rounded character to this wine. Apricot juice and tangerine brighten up the palate, fitting well with the wood and fruit structure. Keep for another few months for the whole wine to fill out even more.",90,Muxagat 2008 Branco White (Douro),,,,
"A Cab from near Yosemite, grown at 3,000-foot elevation with big texture and tannins that could develop into something interesting.",86,Casto Oaks 2008 Gardner Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sierra Foothills),,,,
"Wild berry, cherry and mint notes are what you'll find on this wine's open, likable bouquet. The feel is clean and crisp, with snappy wild-berry and plum flavors that crackle with finishing acidity and controlled tannins.",87,Bodegas Valdemar 2011  Rioja,,,,
"Tart, fresh and a bit chunky and rustic, this blend of 60% Syrah, 20% Grenache and 20% Cinsaut features bold lime notes, scouring acidity and hints of crushed stone. Drink now.",86,Château de Pourcieux 2009 Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"Full-bodied and ripe, this is a rich, generous wine that shows complexity as well as subtle fruitiness. A blend of Viosinho and Verdelho, it's full of tropical fruit flavors, with ample weight and concentration. Spicy accents, a dense texture and a fine, long-lasting finish are all part of this stylish wine.",90,Wines & Winemakers 2012 Andreza Branco White (Douro),,,,
"Tangerine and citrus aromas give the bouquet an orangey element, and there's a pinch of oak and tarragon in there as well. The palate has a mild, buttery texture and creamy flavors of peach and apple. Honeyed and creamy on the simple finish.",85,Trapiche 2010 Oak Cask Chardonnay (Mendoza),,,,
"A fresh-faced rosé, with a rose-grey color, this has red fruit acidity and an attractive, creamy character to go with the crisp finish.",87,Domaine Sainte-Marie 2011 VieVité Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"Fruity aromas of nectarine and red plum lead to a citrusy palate with flavors of pink grapefruit and red apple. A chalky, grippy finish is basic in its citrusy, pith-driven character. Drink this refresher as soon as possible.",85,Marqués de Cáceres 2012 Rosé (Rioja),,,,
"Fresh green apple and grapefruit aromas are bolstered on the palate of this dry, elegantly balanced Riesling. It's light bodied yet delightfully creamy. A kiss of tangerine zest marks its moderately long finish.",91,Maximin Grünhäuser 2015 Trocken Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon has massive waves of blackberry, black currant and chocolate flavors that take over the palate, plus a sweet note of toast from the oak. It's very tannic, which gives the mouthfeel an astringent hardness, so try giving it 6–8 years in a cellar, and it may even show well in 12–15 years.",91,Corley 2009 Yewell Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),,,,
"Smoky, oaky aromas and vibrant spicy fruit flavors make this wine stand out from the pack of simple, ripe wines. It is very full bodied, high in alcohol, moderately tannic and definitely oaky.",87,LangeTwins 2013 Zinfandel (Lodi),,,,
"Any baseball fan will peg the nose as being that of ballpark franks with yellow mustard. That strange meaty, pickled, spicy character carries onto the palate, where there's also some mineral character. The finish is clipped and short, which is probably a benefit after all the funky aromatics and flavors that come before.",82,Pierpaolo Pecorari 2000 Isonzio Sauvignon Blanc (Friuli Venezia Giulia),,,,
"This is the ideal anti-Chardonnay white wine. There's no oak at all to interfere with the lemon, lime and mineral flavors, and the acidity is brisk and mouthwatering. A dry, crisply brilliant wine to drink now with everything from sushi to tuna tartare.",88,Collection 35 2012 Rancho Arroyo Perdido Grüner Veltliner (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Earthy with streaks of mint and sage, this is a light-bodied, soft and perfumed wine, brightly highlighted in red cherry and pomegranate. It finishes crisp and juicy.",88,Jigar 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Red dusty berry cobbler marks the entry to this estate wine co-fermented with 2% Petite Sirah. Milk chocolate, nutmeg and clove play supporting roles in this otherwise bright, food-friendly wine with measured oak impact.",88,Grgich Hills 2011 Estate Grown Zinfandel (Napa Valley),,,,
"Subtle hints of vanilla, lavender and spice lend depth to pristine peach and pear flavors in this judiciously balanced Chardonnay. It's fleshy and plump in mouthfeel but zesty lime notes keep the finish vibrant. Drink now through 2020.",88,Glenora 2014 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This hits 15.5% alcohol—amazingly high for a Columbia wine. The tart red fruit is offset with sweet grain and dried herbs, almost like an old vine Zin from northern California. Somehow the herbs overmatch the berry flavors, which seem a bit on the light side, despite the high alcohol. Young vines?",84,Columbia Winery 2005 Zinfandel (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"If you didn't know what this wine was, you might guess it was a Rhône-style blend. It's flowery and creamy, with peach custard, honeysuckle and papaya flavors. As it turns out, it's a blend of Chardonnay, Viognier, Chenin Blanc and Sauvignon Blanc, and quite a good one. Not especially complex, but very tasty to drink now.",88,Screenplay Wines 2010 White (Carneros),,,,
"Roaring Meg is Mt. Difficulty's entry-level Pinot, offering authoritative if somewhat chunky flavors. Plum and cola notes predominate, filling the mouth and showing plenty of persistence.",87,Mt. Difficulty 2007 Roaring Meg Pinot Noir (Central Otago),,,,
"Enticing floral aromas of elderflower, acacia and a whiff of stone fruit lead the nose. The radiant palate offers juicy tangerine, white peach and a touch of nutmeg alongside zesty acidity.",87,Kettmeir 2014 Müller-Thurgau (Alto Adige),,,,
"This vineyard is best known for its Merlot but this Cabernet keeps pace. It brings a mixture of fruit and barrel aromas of vanilla, blackberry, coffee, licorice and herbs. Flavors are sweet and rich, with coffee lingering on the finish.",91,Watermill 2012 Anna Marie Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),,,,
"A full, fruity and textured wine, this is ripe with quince and apple flavors that are freshened by the citrus acidity. The ripe and fruity character, with a light toastiness, allow the wine to be drunk now.",88,Château d'Alix 2013  Pessac-Léognan,,,,
"Drying mineral tones are backed by pear, Golden Delicious apple and a touch of citrus. The wine has a thick, syrupy consistency and nice complexity with lingering notes of pineapple fruit in the mouth.",86,Borgo di Colloredo 2005  Falanghina del Molise,,,,
"This isn't as big and burly as some Tavels, but it packs a lot of flavor into its medium-bodied frame. Crushed-stone sensations lead the way, followed up by ample fruit, which ranges from peach and melon to red plum. Drink through the end of 2017.",90,Prieuré de Montézargues 2015  Tavel,,,,
"A rich mix of red, blue and black fruit opens into a sappy, spicy midpalate. The lush fruits are highlighted by a wash of milk chocolate. At first tightly wound, the wine seems to show more oak flavors with air, hinting at licorice and Bourbon barrel.",93,Pepper Bridge 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Underbrush and dark-skinned fruit aromas lift out of the glass along with a hint of nut. The soft fruity palate offers black cherry, spice and a hint coffee. Round tannins and bright acidity provide the easy-drinking framework.",87,Fosso Corno 2014 Mayro  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),,,,
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, The Wanted is sourced from the Stillwater Creek and Stonetree vineyards. This textural, Cab-on-Cab creation is loaded with fig, plum, cherry and cassis fruit, highlights of cedar and tobacco, and supple, rich, ripe tannins. The wine is showing beautifully, but can only get even better with more age.",94,Guardian 2011 The Wanted Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This top-end Cabernet from the dynamic Moletto estate delivers impressive intensity and extremely attractive notes of black fruit, toasted spice and black stone. The nose is slightly sweet smelling and the mouthfeel is modern, penetrating, plush and velvety.",92,Moletto 2001 Selecti Cabernet Sauvignon (Veneto Orientale),,,,
"Ripe and creamy, this has baked apple and generous pear flavors. The wine is all fruit, only lightly textured, crisp and clean. It's ready to drink.",86,Marquis de Goulaine 2013 Château de Goulaine Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),,,,
"The producer travels to Stagecoach Vineyard on Atlas Peak to source 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 38% Syrah and 7% Malbec, making for a softly layered wine with plenty of structure. Crisp red currant and plum dance around savory specks of cedar and toasty oak.",89,Patland 2012 Proprietary Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Barolo Parafada is a very ripe expression of Nebbiolo with thick aromas of chocolate, raspberry, blueberry jam and cola that suggest hot growing conditions. The wine does have balance and structure though, especially in the mouth where firm tannins leave a lasting impression.",89,Palladino 2005 Parafada  (Barolo),,,,
"Showing definite maturity, this remains a solid, chunky wine. It has richness as well as a light structure of acidity and raspberries. It is very ready to drink now.",87,Loron et Fils 2005 Réserve Caveau Vieilles Vignes  (Moulin-à-Vent),,,,
"Depth and complexity typify this mountain Cabernet. There's plenty of concentrated blackberry and black currant fruit, but also intriguing notes of olives, dark chocolate and minerals. A little soft, but fine for drinking now and through 2015.",89,Hess Collection 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),,,,
"The aromas are light, with notes of yellow apple and spice. The palate is rounded in feel, showing a lovely sense of texture.",88,Ryan Patrick 2014 Naked Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This wine's raspberry jam, cocoa, fig and barrel spice aromas really pop. Its red fruit flavors are rich and ripe, providing hedonistic appeal.",91,Walla Walla Vintners 2014 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Ripe strawberries and crisp acidity blend together in this refreshing, crisp and fruity wine. Produced from Cabernet Franc, the wine is lightly perfumed and with a final shot of bright acidity. Drink now.",88,Domaine Dozon 2016 Rosé (Chinon),,,,
"Black-fruit aromas are spicy, with a note of cinnamon sticking out. This blend of Monastrell and Petit Verdot displays high acidity and related scratchiness on the palate. Tartness blends with plum and berry flavors, while this runs quick and tight on the finish.",89,Casa de la Ermita 2012 Idílico Monastrell-Petit Verdot (Jumilla),,,,
"Strained and oily on the nose, this lacks freshness and fruitiness. Briny flavors are extreme and sweaty, while the finish tastes a lot like sauerkraut.",80,William Cole 2014 Albamar Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"From vines grown below the Roche de Solutré cliff, this is a tight wine with a mineral texture and steely acidity. The structure will soften to give a wine that is full and concentrated, with plenty of acidity as well as citrus flavors. Wait until 2017.",87,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2014  Saint-Véran,,,,
"Crusty berry aromas are toasty and tarry. This feels flush and solid, with good body and structure. On the palate, this tastes fresh and lightly herbal, with spiced berry as the core flavor. A minty, lightly toasted and spicy finish provides a nice ending",87,Veramonte 2011 El Caballero Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"This is slightly bigger and bolder than the 2009 Art Series Cabernet, but remains a relatively streamlined and silky rendering of the variety. Potent cedar and vanilla notes frame dark fruit aromas and flavors, while the finish lingers, echoing with wood overtones. Drink now–2025.",90,Leeuwin Estate 2010 Art Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River),,,,
"Cherry pie and cinnamon dominate the aromas. Sweet oaky influences like baking spices and brown sugar come out in the flavors, as a lush texture soothes the palate. This tastes mild in terms of acidity and tannins so it comes off as soft and almost sweet.",88,Masút 2013 Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino),,,,
"Smoky, cedary notes nicely complement the blueberry fruit in this McLaren Vale Shiraz. It's pretty full on the palate, with a slightly syrupy texture that extends the flavors through a mouthwatering finish. Drink now-2012.",87,Gemtree 2006 Uncut Shiraz (McLaren Vale),,,,
"Herbal to the max, with strong bell pepper and pimiento aromas. It feels clacky, with salty, herbal flavors of blackberry and dark plum. Warm almost to the point of being hot on the finish, with burnt notes as well as acidic zip.",83,Jordi Miró 2008 Ennak Criança Red (Terra Alta),,,,
"This is a unique wine from an area of Italy that rarely does blended varieties. The grapes used here are Aglianico, Piedirosso and Sangiovese and the aromas include soy sauce, cola, root beer and barbecue sauce. A little strange and probably not for everyone.",88,I Capitani 2007 Emè Red (Irpinia),,,,
"Chardonnay grapes star in this rich bubbly. It's attractive in pear, orange, papaya and toast flavors, with a fine edge of sourdough yeast. The bubbles are a little scoury, but otherwise this is a good price for a vintage sparkling wine.",89,Gloria Ferrer 2006 Blanc de Blancs Sparkling (Carneros),,,,
"A soft, gently fruity wine, it has warm tannins, layers of smooth vanilla from wood aging and a finish that brings out the acidity of the vintage. Fresh, fruity and ready to drink.",87,Château de Sainte-Gemme 2011  Haut-Médoc,,,,
"A vibrantly aromatic wine with notes of apricot, toast, nutty spices and cream displaying both detail and complexity. The palate is full-bodied yet still shows restraint with fruit and smoky flavors that keep the interest level high through the lingering finish.",92,Cowhorn 2013 Marsanne-Roussanne (Applegate Valley),,,,
"This is bone dry, with plenty of acidity and tough tannins. It's not offering much relief, despite an evident core of blackberries, currants and cherries. Those tannins really lock the palate down, like a sandpaper straitjacket on the tongue. But you have to consider its origin in Yountville, a cool area noted for ageable wines. It hould begin to resolve its difficulties by 2016.",91,Markham 2008 The Philanthropist Yountville Estate Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"From vines in the eastern section of Saint-Émilion, the Beaumartin family has produced a firmly structured wine that has both fruit and firm tannins. At this stage, the tannins dominate, giving the wine a dry character, but the juicy black-currant fruit is all there. Drink from 2018.",90,Château Peymouton 2013  Saint-Émilion,,,,
"Red cherry and raspberry flavors in this Cabernet Sauvignon show remarkably fresh and pure. It's a juicy, approachably fruity wine but also structured keenly by zesty acidity and fine, firm tannins. Surprisingly well balanced for a big, ripe red.",90,Damiani 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This blend of five Bordeaux grapes has the style and lightly herbal character of a cru Bordeaux. Notes of brambly red fruit and peppery herb combine in a well-balanced wine of medium length, with restrained, lightly earthy tannins.",87,L'Ecole No. 41 2009 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"You can feel and taste the cool weather during this vintage in the citrusy acids, steely minerals and sleek, streamlined flavors of Meyer lemons and nectarines. Barrel fermentation adds needed richness. Good price for a dry, sophisticated Chardonnay.",91,Sonoma-Cutrer 2009 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"This flavorful, lively red wine was made with 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, but it doesn't fall easily into a category. Earthy, herbal aromas turn spicy, smoky and rich with raspberry and blackberry flavors as you sip. The other four Bordeaux red grape varieties complete the blend.",85,CK Mondavi 2012 Scarlet Five Wildcreek Canyon Red (California),,,,
"Black pepper, mineral and berry aromas are integrated and impressive in this Cab. Integrated flavors offer dimension and poise, and substantial structure means it can age. Pair with roast beef or a creamy, aged cheese. An effort to be applauded.",86,Mount Pleasant Winery 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Augusta),,,,
"This big blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot and Sangiovese presents a potent purple-flower aroma on the nose as well as boysenberry, tar, dried oregano, pepper and leather. The bone-dry palate is wrapped in a chalky silky texture, with nettle, oregano and blackberry flavors.",89,La Honda Winery 2015 Exponent Red (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"Dry, dustily tannic and somewhat closed down, this Cabernet clearly wants some time in the cellar. It has rich, juicy blackberry and cherry flavors, but the tannins and acidity close in fast, locking them down and making the wine astringent and tart. Give it a few years, or decant if you're opening it now.",90,Frank Family 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Wiemer's standard dry Riesling is an impeccable value for a wine that offers such density of fruit and minerality. While dry in style, it's a luscious, deeply fruity wine studded with tangerine and stone-fruit flavors glazed in honey and nectar. It's unctuous and ripe, but finishes with a cool, steel-edged persistence.",93,Hermann J. Wiemer 2015 Dry Riesling (Seneca Lake),,,,
"This is a succulent, full-bodied Riserva with loads of aromatic intensity in the form of black cherry, ripe blueberry, leather, resin, tobacco and black spice. It's a pretty, vibrant wine both in terms of color and flavor and has solid, ripe tones of black fruit and mature berry.",89,Tenuta di Arceno 2005 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"rich, fruity wood-aged wine, this offers ripe white fruits and plenty of smoky toast flavors. Acidity and minerality give the wine its distinctive tangy texture. These elements result in a ripe wine that will age further. Drink from 2020.",92,Château de Santenay 2015 Abbaye de Morgeot Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet),,,,
"Fresh, fruity and charming, this rosé offers full-bodied flavors of strawberry and spice that are balanced and complex. A step above the typical flirty rosé, the wine gives style and substance and will handle heartier dishes—think Moroccan tagine or grilled, spiced fish.",88,Rietvallei Estate Wine 2007 Juanita Rosé Cabernet Sauvignon (Robertson),,,,
"Winemaker Kevin Mitchell has been gradually refining his style, pulling back on alcohol and oak without sacrificing fruit intensity. This is a fruit-driven Cabernet, loaded with black cherries and cassis and supported by restrained, just-right oak levels. It's medium-bodied, softly dusty yet firm, with a surprisingly long finish. Drink now–2025.",91,Kilikanoon 2013 Killerman's Run Cabernet Sauvignon (Clare Valley),,,,
"Uplifting, light and fresh peach aromas mix with ruby-red grapefruit spritzer and tiny flashes of honey on this energetic wine by the San Luis Obispo-based producer. The palate shows fresh nectarine, apple blossoms and lots of white flowers, and would make a perfect compliment to spicy food.",89,Stephen Ross 2014 Jespersen Ranch Albariño (Edna Valley),,,,
"Aromas of dried herb, dark plum coffee and barrel spice lead to exquisitely balanced dark-cherry flavors. Velvety tannins provide the frame.",92,Sightglass 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A blend of Olsen Vineyard in the Yakima Valley and Clifton Hill on the Wahluke Slope, the aromas are generous, with notes of dark plum, smoke and baking spice. The palate is weighty and full, with palate-coating purple-fruit flavors that show pleasing depth, density and length.",91,Love That Red 2015 Dead Heat Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A lengthy, plush and full-bodied expression of the variety, this wine is sourced from the producer's estate, Stanly Ranch, as well as Hyde and Poe vineyards. Salty caramel and toffee are complemented by bright orange and lemon accents. It's well balanced and attractive now.",94,Merryvale 2015 Chardonnay (Carneros),,,,
"Woody, exotic spice aromas blend with blackberry and raspberry notes. This has a sturdy but basic feel and proper flavors of black plum, peppery spice and wood grain. A grabby finish with salty black-plum notes closes this out.",87,Los Andes 2013 Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"A generosity of baked pear is supported by sizable notions of toasted oak and tannin in this burly, rich and concentrated wine.",88,Sonoma-Cutrer 2014 The Cutrer Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
This softly fruity wine has the lightest of tannins and plenty of simple red-berry fruits. There is an earthy edge to the young wine as well as plenty of acidity at the end. Drink now.,86,Château Coutinel 2015 Il est des nôôôtres! Gamay,,,,
"This barrel-fermented blend—split equally between the two varieties—displays notes of marzipan, melon, tropical fruit and biscuit. It's medium-plus bodied, with a lingering finish.",90,Cowhorn 2012 Marsanne-Roussanne (Applegate Valley),,,,
"There is a distinct phenolic edge on this earthy, lemon-dominated and taut Riesling. Fruit—apart from citrus—is subsumed into an earthy, tense and concentrated palate. This needs more time to relax into itself and should blossom with more bottle age. Drink 2017–2020.",92,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2013 Leimental Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"Delicious sweet raisin and mulled wine fruit, full of herbs and nutmeg spice. This is a ripe wine, but too heavy, showing some austerity, but no sign of tiring.",91,Smith Woodhouse 1999 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),,,,
"This well-priced sparkler opens with aromas of toast, yellow apple, nut butter and a hint of honey. On the palate, fine bubbles and crisp acidity balance the pear, citrus zest and roasted walnut flavors.",89,Rotari NV Brut Chardonnay (Trento),,,,
Ripe apricot and peach flavors juxtapose leaner notes of white-melon rind and lime in this vivaciously fresh spätlese. Delicate sweetness is balanced against shards of acid and mineral. The finish is long yet pure.,92,Maximin Grünhäuser 2015 Abtsberg Spätlese Grosse Lage Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Good flavors of citrus, peach, spice and toast in this classic blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier. It's dry, but rough in the mouth, with a scoury finish.",85,Chandon NV Brut Classic Sparkling (California),,,,
"Fresh grass, gooseberry, lime leaf and a touch of melon rind appear on the nose and mouth of this straightforward wine. It's lightweight and easygoing, with brisk acidity and a crisp, refreshing finish. Drink now.",85,Long Neck 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape),,,,
"This wine is still tannic and firm, with a dry core of ripe fruit. The tannins will always be present, typical of this vintage. Drink now, but decant first.",88,Château la Clide 2011  Saint-Émilion,,,,
"This opens with licorice, chopped herb, eucalyptus and dark spice aromas. The assertive palate offers dried black cherry, coffee bean and sagenotes framed by close-grained tannins.",88,Nada Fiorenzo 2013 Manzola  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Aromas of blue flower, ripe berry and allspice jump out of the glass of this full-bodied but elegant red. The fresh, juicy palate offers blueberry, blackberry, graphite and a hint of mocha. Firm, fine-grained tannins offer support and give it a smooth texture.",89,Masseria Altemura 2012 Altemura  (Primitivo di Manduria),,,,
"This blend of Tempranillo, Malbec, Grenache and Mourvèdre offers such generosity of fruit, but manages to finish dry and clean. Tannins are grippy in the mouth, but flavors of dried currant, leather and black cherry jam burst through. What a great wine to decant for a few hours and serve up with rich beef dishes.",93,ONX 2011 Praetorian Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"Savory mint and herbal aromas accent leafy, classic red fruit on the bouquet, while plum, berry, mineral, black olive and herbs work the palate. The wine transitions from one stage to the next without much trouble, and within the folds there are some complexities. A measurable step up from the bargain barrel milieu.",88,CVNE 2004 Cune Crianza  (Rioja),,,,
"Do you like lemon drop cocktails? This is a lemon drop wine —so ripe and round and sweetly lemony it could almost pass for Limoncello. Despite the almost 14% alcohol, there is some sweetness, as you might find in a late harvest wine, albeit concealed by the acidity. Rose petals and talcum powder flavors coalesce into a firm, full, fruity, slightly sweet and also quite fragrant finish.",90,Brandborg 2009 Gewürztraminer (Umpqua Valley),,,,
"Leathery plum and berry aromas are also jammy and floral on this full and round wine. Roasted berry flavors come with a bacon-like note, delivering similar flavors on the finish.",86,Cono Sur 2015 Bicicleta Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),,,,
"Bandarossa delivers prickly fizz and direct aromas of stone fruit, pear and Golden Delicious apple. It has character and grit that builds in intensity thanks to the wine's lively effervescence and sweet fruity tones.",89,Bortolomiol 2007 Bandarossa Millesimato Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene),,,,
"With dark-berry aromas and pointed toughness, this is a solid wine with creamy oak, some stickiness and a lactic element. Flavors of herbal dark fruits and minty oak lead to a dry, minty, hot and spicy finish with more than enough residual oak flavor.",87,Lapostolle 2011 Casa Grand Selection Merlot (Rapel Valley),,,,
"From a cool appellation, a wine that smells bright and clean, like the scent you get when slicing into a fresh peach. There's also a lot of young, toasty oak riding on top of the fruit. Long in the mouth and in the finish, this delicious wine has crisp, supporting acids.",91,Testarossa 2001 Rosella's Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Strongly mineral in texture, this structured wine from vines growing in gneiss (dense, schist-like rock) soil needs some time. It has intense acidity and citrus flavors along with a crisp edge and tight aftertaste. Drink from 2016.",88,Domaine de la Fruitière 2014 Gneiss de Bel Abord Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),,,,
"Forward and full-bodied, this opens with aromas of mature dark fruit, grilled herb, toast, spirits and a balsamic note. On the warm palate, oak and licorice provide the backdrop to black cherry marinated in spirits alongside firm tannins. The heat of alcohol closes the finish.",89,Paolo Manzone 2011 Meriame  (Barolo),,,,
"Aromas of sawdust, toasted oak, espresso and spice lead the nose on this blend of 90% Sangiovese, 10% Canaiolo and Colorino. The palate offers black cherry, mint and eucalyptus notes alongside bracing tannins. Evident oak muffles the juicy, ripe-fruit notes.",89,Castellare di Castellina 2010 Il Poggiale Riserva  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"This offers aromas of wild berry, baking spice, toast and a floral note. On the firm palate, notes of vanilla, clove and powdered sage accent a sour cherry core alongside nervous acidity. Close-grained tannins grip the finish. Drink 2018 through 2026.",90,Vietti 2011 Rocche di Castiglione  (Barolo),,,,
"A problematic wine, especially considering the price. It's dark in color, quite tannic and bone dry, with powerful cherry and cola flavors, liberally accented with smoky oak. Has all the hallmarks of an ageable young Pinot Noir, but there's a stubbornly unripe streak of green peppercorn all the way through. Difficult and risky to predict where this wine is going.",87,La Crema 2008 Nine Barrel Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This was a perplexing wine to evaluate. The aromas feature toasted hazelnuts, lemon curd, pineapple and more than a hint of banana bread. The flavors follow in a similar vein, but are exaggerated, coming across as strongly tropical and confected, then drawing to a crisp finish.",85,Nugan Family Estates 2015 Frasca's Lane Vineyard Chardonnay (King Valley),,,,
"Rancia Riserva opens with ripe plum, red currant and bell pepper aromas. The palate shows flavors of black fruit, chocolate and soy sauce alongside coffee and oak notes. It has nervous energy and intensity, but should develop nicely over the next few years.",88,Felsina 2009 Rancia Riserva  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"A bitter herbal edge frames this young wine that remains tight and unexpressive, even after many hours. Aged in 28% new French oak for 16 months, it may be showing significant bottle shock at this time. The finish is short, hard and slightly bitter.",87,St. Innocent 2015 Justice Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
"Excessively ripe fruit verging on baked, burnt blackberries, hard tannins and residual sweetness.",80,Vina Robles 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"Restrained aromas suggesting acacia flower, nut and honey lead the nose. The subdued palate offers yellow apple skin, hazelnut and mineral alongside fresh acidity.",86,Rocca di Fabbri 2015 Grechetto (Colli Martani),,,,
"Concentrated and ripe, this offers sensations of forest floor, vanilla, sweet oak, espresso, chocolate and black cherry extract. You'll also feel the burn of evident alcohol on the warm midpalate. It's already forward and evolved so drink now.",86,Agostina Pieri 2012  Rosso di Montalcino,,,,
"This is one of the coolest premier crus, meaning that the wine can often age well. In the warm 2015 vintage, the wine shows both beautifully ripe fruit and a tight mineral streak that will keep it on the straight and narrow. It does need to age and the wine will be best from 2018.",92,Domaine Chenevières 2015 Côte de Lechet Premier Cru  (Chablis),,,,
"This Shiraz has a plucky nose of tart cherry, tobacco and pepper. The flavors of clove, tobacco and berry on the palate are fruity but balanced by the spice. Pair with cheeses, lamb.",85,Douglas Green 2007 Vineyard Creations Shiraz (Western Cape),,,,
"Named after the lords of Hattstatt—a word that evolved to Hatschbourg—this wine comes from selected grapes. It's a medium sweet, rich wine with a smooth structure and opulent texture. Lychees and yellow fruits are cut with lime acidity to balance ripeness and freshness. It's a wine to age, drink from 2018.",93,Joseph Cattin 2013 Hatschbourg Grand Cru Trésor des Seigneurs Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"While dainty in style, this refreshing Riesling is chock full of white-grapefruit flavor accented by a flurry of white florals, lime and lanolin. Concentrated but fresh, the palate bristles with striking acidity and minerality.",89,Red Newt Cellars 2011 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Made entirely with Nebbiolo, this offers aromas of pressed rose, sunbaked earth, flint and a hint of anise. The palate is firmly structured, offering ripe red cherry, raspberry and a rusty iron note alongside firm tannins. Give this a few more years to let the tannins unwind.",91,Antichi Vigneti di Cantalupo 2009 Anno Primo  (Ghemme),,,,
"The soft, open character of Menetou-Salon is very apparent in this gentle, fruity wine. With fresh acidity and bright citrus and apricot flavors, it's a wine to savor young. Light perfumes add interest to this wine that is ready to drink.",87,Joseph Mellot 2014 Les Thureaux  (Menetou-Salon),,,,
"This Lodi Cabernet is priced to sell, but it has a sweltering swath of green pepper.",81,Peirano 2010 Heritage Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),,,,
"This textbook Brunello boasts a careful balance of elements. Sweet cherry and vanilla aromas segue to austere notes of exotic spice, cola and waxed leather. This is a tempered but elegant wine that would match savory duck with wild rice.",92,Pinino 2006  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Ripe in tropical fruit, apricot and Meyer lemon flavors, it shows plenty of toasty oak. It's dry and creamy but not particularly complex. Drink up.",86,Bernardus 2012 Sierra Mar Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"An extraordinarily sweet wine, just massive in honey, orange and butterscotch flavors. A brisk streak of acidity provides much-needed balance. Beautiful and decadent, and deliriously good with cheesecake.",92,PasoPort NV Angelica White Port (Paso Robles),,,,
"Toast and ripe spice go well with the warm red-berry fruits in this wine. It is rich, layering new wood and fine tannins along with a firm structure. Drink this wine, with its good potential, from 2019. This is one of seven château in the Médeville family and 2014 was their 188th harvest.",90,Château Fayau 2014 Médeville Collection  (Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux),,,,
"Anise, red berries and warming spice tones lead the aromas and flavors of this wine, giving it a complex but overall fresh and easy character. The sturdy backbone is layered with bright red fruit and mineral notes. Pair with roasted meats and cheeses.",89,Manolesaki 2008 Syrah (Drama),,,,
"Gritty, earthy aromas of hot tarmac and leathery plum give off a burnt character. Easy, smooth and flush across the palate, this blend of 70% Petit Verdot and 30% Malbec tastes peppery, spicy and of roasted black fruits. Toastiness carries over to the finish, which deals burnt, peppery spice notes and mild heat.",89,Bodega Calle 2013 Dharma Reserva Red (Luján de Cuyo),,,,
"Aromas of tomato sauce and fresh green herbs set up true-to-Carmenère flavors of salty, herbal plum and berry. On the finish, typical varietal flavors of olive, herbs and spice are saucy.",87,Tres Palacios 2013 Family Vintage Carmenère (Maipo Valley),,,,
"From vines in the Marne Valley, this soft, creamy and fruity wine is made to be drunk young. It has plenty of red currant fruits and a light touch of tannin all balanced by acidity at the end.",87,Pannier NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne),,,,

"This is sharply herbal, with peppery bitter greens framing tart berry fruit. It's 100% Pommard from 20-year-old vines, but in this chancy vintage the fruit flavors did not get quite fully ripe.",87,Durant 2013 Heron Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),,,,
"While it's not complex this is certainly well composed. It opens with subtle aromas of yellow flower and orchard fruit while the light, easygoing palate offers pear and citrus. Crisp acidity gives it a clean, refreshing finish.",85,Garofoli 2015 Serra del Conte  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico),,,,
"Rather spare despite the cherry-berry, cola and spice flavors. The tannins are ultralight, and the acidity you'd expect from this cool coastal appellation isn't there. That leaves alcohol and fruit and a certain flabbiness.",84,La Crema 2001 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"This Mourvèdre, Grenache and Cinsault blend has ripe, textured red-berry fruits that give weight and richness. A tangy texture, almost mineral, in the background shapes the spicy, peppery aftertaste.",91,Maison Angelvin 2014 Heritage Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"This blend of 50% Mourvèdre and 50% Syrah shows some deep, plummy aromas and flavors and blackberries, spice and cola. It's medium-bodied, with soft tannins and a touch of warmth on the finish. Drink now–2014.",88,Domaine Saint-André de Figuière 2006 Vieilles Vignes Red (Côtes de Provence),,,,

"Soft, gently sweet, and enormously attractive, a rich, opulent Pinot Noir for drinking now. Cabernet specialist Venge brings their touch to this vineyard, located in one of the warmest parts of the valley. It's a flashy wine, forward in raspberries, cherries, red licorice and sweet oak.",91,Venge 2011 Bacigalupi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Shiraz (60%), Cabernet Sauvignon (28%) and Malbec (12%) combine in this medium-bodied silky-textured blend.

It's soft and easy to drink, and made for near-term consumption.",88,Bleasdale 2014 The Broad-side Red (Langhorne Creek),,,,
"Robust and fruity, almost rustic in its sandpapery texture, this Merlot, from inland Mendocino County, has berry, cherry and spice flavors, with a deep streak of earth. Bone dry, it's a well-balanced wine that will go well with a nice steak.",85,Lolonis 2005 Merlot (Redwood Valley),,,,
"This smells a bit charred at first, then turns syrupy and richly oaked. It feels fresh but hard, with spiky acidity that pushes the citrusy, vanilla-accented red-fruit. It finishes crisp and a little tart, with cherry, plum and herb flavors.",87,Ramón Bilbao 2006 Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"This wine is soft and rounded, ready to drink with its rich black-fruit character and fully integrated tannins. It holds a blend from five different parcels on the estate, ripe in berry fruits and fragrant with the wood aging. Acidity gives a lift at the end.",90,Château du Moulin-à-Vent 2011  Moulin-à-Vent,,,,
"Glowingly ripe pear and juicy yellow plum make a great aromatic opening that continues onto the flavorful palate where it is tempered pleasantly by white pepper and lemon zest. Freshness, verve and drive characterize the concentrated palate. The finish is long and clean.",92,Steininger 2013 Kittmannsberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),,,,
"91-93 Rich fruit currants and berries, intensely juicy, packed with dark very ripe fruit. A powerhouse of berries.",92,Château Gazin 2010 Barrel sample  (Pomerol),,,,
"This standout expression of the excellent Sauvignon de la Tour offers brilliant luminosity and pristine aromas of passion fruit, kiwi and Thai basil. The most extraordinary quality here is the purity and intensity of the wine's beautiful bouquet.",90,Villa Russiz 2007 Sauvignon de la Tour Sauvignon (Collio),,,,
"There's an inviting textural richness to this rounded silky Pinot Gris. White grapefruit and yellow-cherry flavors are sunny on the palate, accentuated by subtle hints of spice and nuts. Delicate tangerine acidity lifts the finish.",89,Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards 2014 Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Dark-colored wine, with smoky, bitter chocolate flavors: cocoa plus spice and jammy black plums. It's powerful, densely textured, finishing with good acidity.",91,Château Clinet 2008  Pomerol,,,,
"Try this beautiful wine in order to understand how Amarone evolves and becomes more sophisticated with age. The aromas here are thick and penetrating with tones of dried fruit, cherry preserves, cola and resin. The mouthfeel is deep and concentrated and the finish is impressively long. A true classic.",93,Bertani 2001  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,,,,
"Simple, attractive wine, with confected spice, lychee and rounded, warm flavors. Honey and rosehip add interest, with a hint of final pepper.",86,Jean Albrecht 2010 Gewürztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"Loaded with personality and special distinguishing qualities, this blend of Nocera, Nerello Mascalese and Nerello Cappuccio is a wine for those interested in Italy's indigenous grapes.

"Fruity and immediately accessible, this is a crisp and delicious wine. It is lively with citrus acidity and bright with a tangy texture. The wine finishes with a salty, mineral aftertaste. Drink now.",88,Gadais Père et Fils 2015 Domaine de la Tourmaline Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),,,,
"Ugolforte Brunello opens with perfumed aromas of blue flower, wild berries, white cherry, cinnamon, vanilla and a slight hint of toasted coconut. In fact, those oak-driven aromas could use more time to integrate. The mouthfeel, however, is more evolved at this stage with bright acidity and a spicy aftertaste.",91,Tenuta San Giorgio 2006 Ugolforte  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"This wine sources this rare variety from Saralee's Vineyard in the heart of the appellation. Meaty strawberry meets refreshing acidity and ample structure, taming the big boldness of flavor, all while remaining light and bright in the glass.",90,Y Rousseau 2014 Tannat (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This small producer, based in the Marne Valley, has a strong predilection for Pinot Meunier, which forms 70% of this blend. It gives a soft, ripe character to the wine while allowing plenty of space for crisp apples, lemon and minerality. This bottling is young and should mature for a few more months before drinking in 2017.",87,Liebart-Régnier NV Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"This is a variety Gerovassiliou does very well, with its aromas of pear, peach and lemon and its creamy but crisp flavors of pear, citrus and peach. The wine has weight without losing its delicate touch, and balanced acidity gives it a food-friendly edge. A great summer white wine.",88,Gerovassiliou 2009 Malagousia (Epanomi),,,,
"As light in color and silky in texture as a Pinot Noir, with refined tannins and a fine burst of acidity. The flavors are characterized by the cherries and raspberries associated with Grenache, along with notes of white pepper, cinnamon, bacon and a floral note. The alcohol is a little too high for comfort or ageability.",89,Austin Hope 2011 Hope Family Vineyard Grenache (Paso Robles),,,,
"Dense aromas of cooked blueberries meet with clove, ginger and leather on the nose of this red blend. Leathery flavors also show on the palate along with black currant and more baking-spice touches.",88,Lorenzi Estate 2013 Brutus II Red (Temecula Valley),,,,
"Still quite closed, this is a firm wine with all its tight tannins still in place. It's dry at this stage, although the fruit is going to develop well. Acidity and a hint of perfumed red-berry flavors promise a good future. Drink from 2020.",92,Maison Champy 2014 Premier Cru  (Beaune),,,,
Red-berry fruits and soft tannins give a wine with some juicy acidity and spice. The firm aftertaste shows that it is still needs time. Drink from 2018.,88,Quinta Dona Matilde 2013 Dona Matilde Reserva Red (Douro),,,,
"Funky on the nose in a good way, this wine is aided by 6% Viognier and 1% Roussanne. It shows roasted fennel, elderberry, grilled lamb, pencil lead and savory black pepper on the nose. The palate starts ripe with blackberries and blueberries, then evolves into thyme, oregano and marjoram, with roasted beef on the edges.",92,Westerly 2013 Côte Blonde Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"If you aren't familiar with Ripasso (a hybrid wine that borrows elements from austere Amarone and informal Valpolicella), this selection from Bolla is an excellent introductory wine. It opens with a deep-ruby color and bright aromas of red cherry, cola, spice and leather. It ends with both sweet and spicy nuances.",87,Bolla 2007 Le Poiane  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso),,,,
"This full-bodied Malbec out-performs its price. Ripe blackberry and pencil aromas set up a dense, tight, structured palate with focused, drilling flavors of blackberry and licorice. If you like layered, full-fruit reds with balance and harmony, this is it.",92,Viña Bisquertt 2012 Ecos de Rulo Malbec (Marchigue),,,,
"Gufo means “owl” in Italian and indeed a cartoon of one is pictured on the label. A pure expression of Nebbiolo, this wine offers drying mineral or chalky notes with some cherry in the background over a crisp, clean style. Pair it with thick crust Chicago pizza.",85,Cantine Lanzavecchia 2010 Cren del Gufo Nebbiolo (Langhe),,,,
"Arinto is a grape that has just crossed the Tejo river from the western Lisboa vineyards. In this wine, it seems to have preserved its fresh and crisp character that is bright and packed with lemon and grapefruit flavors. Drink now.",87,Quinta da Alorna 2014 Arinto (Tejo),,,,
"Richly tannic, this concentrated wine has great structure and intense fruitiness and acidity. Generous and full bodied, it retains a dry core that gives shape to the ripe red berry fruits. Hints of wood aging still show, and the wine needs to develop further. Drink from 2017.",91,Herdade dos Machados 2012 Toutalga Red (Alentejano),,,,
"The massive 2009 vintage has produced a rich, full-bodied wine. Wood aging shows in the smoothing of the tannins, which are joined by concentrated blackberry fruits, a smoky, just burnt wood character and a dark character that will need several years to open up.",92,Domaine des Rochelles 2009 Les Millerits Cabernet Sauvignon (Anjou Villages Brissac),,,,
"This vineyard site, like many others in Green Valley, was once planted to Gravenstein apples. That heritage persists in this wine's tartness that highlights an earthiness of sassafras, pomegranate and even citrus, bright elements atop a velvety-smooth texture.",88,Dutton Estate 2014 Jewell Block Vineyard Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Smoked strawberry and concentrated red plum aromas meet hickory smoke, fresh herb and rose petal scents in this great bottling. The zingy palate is fresh, lively and quite complex, from its oregano, thyme and tarragon notes to its core of pomegranate and dark raspberry fruit to its savory, leathery finish.",92,Midnight 2014 Solstice Malbec (Paso Robles),,,,
"Produced only in top years, this rich wine is impressive. It has great fruit, ripe strawberries and red currants bringing juicy fruitiness. There is also a more serious mineral texture that comes with tangy acidity. Age this wine for a few more months and drink from the end of 2017.",92,Château la Vivonne 2016 Les Puechs Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"A big, dark, extracted Malbec with murky lead aromas of Graham cracker and sweet blueberry. The palate is jammy and chunky, with dark, earthy flavors of prune, blackberry and raisin. Finishes a bit pruny, but there's enough acidity to maintain a sense of balance. Drink now.",88,Mi Terruño 2008 Mayacaba Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"One of a range of single-vineyard wines, this is tight and still very young. It has a chalky texture, feeling very mineral and nervy. The fruit hints at lemon and green plum, needing time to fill out. Drink from 2019.",91,Vignerons des Terres Secrètes 2014 Au Mont  (Saint-Véran),,,,
"This unoaked wine is tart and simple, with sweet and sour flavors of oranges and pineapples, like fruit juice with alcohol.",82,Sera Fina 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Sierra Foothills),,,,
"Concentrated and powerfully structured now, this will benefit from some time to integrate and harmonize. Currently, all of the elements are assertively upfront, with strong oaky sensations, dense and ripe black-fruit notes and firm tannins all vying for your attention. Hints of leather, bramble, licorice root and roasted cocoa nib hang in the background, waiting for their moment to shine. Try after 2016, and through 2020.",91,Gérard Bertrand 2011 Château de Villemajou Grand Vin Red (Corbières-Boutenac),,,,
"Fresh aromas of gooseberry and fig are followed by a flinty, fresh combination of flavors in Cederburg's Sauvignon Blanc. Balanced and robust, the wine has a snappy, citrus finish.",86,Cederberg 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Cederberg),,,,
"This wine is a blend of fruit from Quintessence, Red Heaven, Fidelitas Estate and Shaw vineyards. The aromas are wound up tightly at present but with coaxing reveal notes of French oak spices, black cherry and black currant. The flavors show a surprising amount of restraint, with a pleasing cranberry tartness and a lick of tannins.",89,Fidelitas 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),,,,
"This savory selection offers earthy aromas of underbrush, truffle and leather. The zesty palate expresses tart red cherry flavor punctuated by mint, vanilla and espresso accents. It's nicely balanced, with firm but ripe tannins and ample freshness. Artisan Wines, Downey Selection.",90,Buondonno 2010  Chianti Classico,,,,
"The wine is rich, showing toast as well as apricot and peach flavors. It's full-blown, right up front with fruitiness and rounded texture. Drink now.",88,Château Lafargue 2012  Pessac-Léognan,,,,
"This medium-bodied wine smells sugary and floral, but tastes quite dry. Flavors are fruity but spare and the mouthfeel is taut.",86,Donkey & Goat 2013 Blakeman Vineyard Merlot (Anderson Valley),,,,
"Luisa Ponzi does such an excellent job with her top of the line Pinots that it is no surprise that this entry-level bottle really shines. Immaculate fruit, polished tannins, a vivacious, fruit-laden mouthfeel, all combine into a wine that has both suppleness and varietal power. It does not have the density of the pricier siblings, but it makes up for it with food-friendly acidity.",88,Ponzi 2009 Tavola Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Aromas of underbrush, blue flowers, dark berries and a whiff of menthol unfold in the glass. The supple palate offers fleshy wild cherry, black raspberry, licorice, mint and white pepper alongside firm but fine-grained tannins. Drink 2016–2021.",92,Fattoria Torre a Cona 2011 Terre di Cino Sangiovese (Toscana),,,,
"Somewhat aloof now, this has grippy tannins that lock down the palate. Underneath the grip are complex flavors of juicy blackberry, plum sauce and exotic spice, with brooding earthy notes and sweet, smoky oak tones. Very fine, but one for the cellar. Give it at least 6–8 years, and it could easily go for another decade beyond that, gradually becoming more delicate, supple and complex.",94,Williams Selyem 2010 Allen Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Soft suggestions of cigar ash and green pepper complement the fruity notes of small red berries and plum. Forward medium-grain tannins and prominent acidity supply a sturdy backbone to the wine, leading through to the anise-infused finish.",86,Carmel 2007 Appellation Kosher Cabernet Franc (Upper Galilee),,,,
"This smells a bit green and leathery, with a hint of volatility and jammy blueberry for an offset. A grabby, jammy palate is reasonably good in feel, while stewed berry flavors finish herbal, oaky and mildly bitter.",85,Infinitus 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Patagonia),,,,
"Made with 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, this opens with aromas of black-skinned berry, underbrush and cooking spice. The savory palate offers black currant, clove and a whiff of white pepper alongside smooth tannins. Enjoy soon.",88,Condé 2015 Sangiovese (Romagna),,,,
"Ripe and full, it offers great spice, yellow fruits and hints of tropical fruits. It has acidity and is dry, but it's delicious because of its rounded texture and generous body. Drink from 2015.",89,Domaine Gérard Neumeyer 2012 Le Berger Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"This is an interesting and potentially very beautiful wine that probably needs many more years of cellar aging before it is fully formed. At this young stage it shows raw notes of rhubarb, cola and spice backed by dark licorice overtones. It's drying and tight with jackhammer tannins.",89,Grasso Fratelli 2008 Vallegrande  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Perfumed, floral wine, dominated by Moscatel grapes. The white fruits, pear and vivid acidity give the wine a fine, fruity balanced character.",87,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal 2010 JP Azeitão Branco White (Setubal),,,,
"Very ripe and forward in fruit, this Cabernet floods the mouth with cherry fruit flavors, liberally enhanced with the sweet vanilla and toast of oak barrel aging.

"Owned by the same family as Château Talbot in Saint-Julien, this vintage of Sénéjac is now mature, showing signs of leather and a firm structure rather than fruit. It's unlikely to develop further, so drink now.",87,Château Sénéjac 2006  Haut-Médoc,,,,
"Mild white-fruit aromas are nonspecific but clean. This blend of Chenin Blanc and Chardonnay has a simple, citrusy palate feel and briny nectarine flavors. A briny flavor quality remains on the finish.",85,Alfredo Roca 2016 Roca Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay (Mendoza),,,,
"Hot pink in color, this wine offer plentiful aromas of cherry and watermelon. It drinks off dry, with sugary sweet-fruit flavors that provide appeal.",88,Brian Carter Cellars 2015 Abracadabra Rosé (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,

"Riper notes of pink grapefruit and tangerine distinguish this dry Riesling from Georg Albrecht Schneider's other 2014 wines.

Drink now.",88,Weingut Georg Albrecht Schneider 2014 Niersteiner Paterberg Vom Kalk Limestone Kabinett Trocken Riesling (Rheinhessen),,,,
"This is a fruity, ripe blend of Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Castelão. Soft, with a touch of spice from wood, it also has a crisp edge of acidity. Drink this attractive wine now.",87,Pinhal da Torre 2015 Alqueve Tradicional Red (Tejo),,,,
"It's rare to see a varietal bottle of Petit Verdot come out of this appellation, let alone a single vineyard offering but this one clearly deserves it. The aromas of flowers, soil, green herbs and purple fruit are light and brooding and lead to full but in balance black-fruit flavors. A lengthy finish caps it off.",91,College Cellars 2014 Clarke Vineyard Petit Verdot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Chocolate and prune aromas and flavors come across as somewhat generic, then finish on a drying, astringent note.",82,Terra Australis 2007 Shiraz (South Eastern Australia),,,,

"Cabernet Sauvignon (30%) takes the lead on this wine, followed by Merlot (21%), Syrah (17%), Cabernet Franc (14%) and five other varieties.

This is a perfect wine to drink with friends on a lazy summer afternoon.,87,Santa Margherita NV Brut  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
"This offers a classic Nebbiolo nose of rose petal, dark berry, tilled earth and a balsamic note. The lean palate shows sour red berry, grilled herb, clove and a hint of mocha on the finish. Tightly compacted tannins and brisk acidity need time to unwind. Drink after 2019.",89,460 Casina Bric 2011 Bricco delle Viole  (Barolo),,,,
"This wine's cranberry and raspberry fruit is framed by scents of smoky, toasty oak. It's light in body, with a tart, tangy finish. Try it with seafood dishes that can handle a light red, like grilled or broiled salmon.",86,Wither Hills 2011 Pinot Noir (Wairau Valley),,,,

"A pure Cabernet, sleek and young, but already showing it has the stuff to age. Pretty cassis and black cherry fruit is framed in a smooth and compact structure with supporting acidity and judicious application of new (50%) and used French oak. Immediately appealing, but built for cellaring.",91,Glencorrie 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Just touched by honey and with a light spritz, this is a crisp, lemon and lime zest-flavored wine. It has great acidity with a yeasty character.",85,Pierre Boniface 2009 Les Rocailles White (Apremont),,,,
"Lifted floral aromas include a hint of white pepper and green apples. Flavors are fresh and zesty, showing more mineral notes than fruit. This would be a nice match with chicken satay on the patio.",86,Villa Maria 2001 Private Bin Riesling (Marlborough),,,,

Flavors of vanilla, cocoa and roasted meat ensue.",93,Pulchella 2013 Awakening Tannat-Syrah (Adelaida District),,,,
"Lifted aromas of jasmine, apricot and guava entice from the glass. Medium to full bodied on the palate, this Viognier shows no sense of sloth.

"This succulent, almost tender, wine starts off with lovely aromas of honey and bergamot, adding hints of apricot and vanilla in the mouth. It's a soft, lush style, rather sweet, with a long, mouthwatering finish. It may not be as long-lived as some 2007s, but it should remain delectable for another 10 years or so.",93,Schloss Johannisberger 2007 Rosalack Auslese 375 ml Riesling (Rheingau),,,,
"This wine is a blend of Seven Hills, Loess, Mill Creek Upland, Serra Pedace and Leonetti Old Block. Aromatically brooding at present, it shows intricate notes of barrel spice, thyme, coffee, cranberry, black tea and red and black fruit. The palate is tightly wound, with bright acid and lightly chewy tannins that need some time in the cellar to stretch their legs. Best from 2021 to 2030.",93,Leonetti Cellar 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"There's lots of upfront raspberry and cherry sour-candy fruit flavors in this lush, oaky Pinot. It's a bit one-dimensional and scoury, but fine for everyday purposes. Drink up.",85,Lincourt 2010 Lindsay's Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Single-variety expressions of Perricone (a dark red grape found in Sicily) are showing up more frequently and are quickly cementing the grape's quality potential. A dark red color marks this wine's appearance, as do intense aromas of blackberry, plum and spice.",87,Caruso & Minini 2008 Sachia Perricone (Sicilia),,,,
"This is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon from the Cold Creek vineyard. Smooth and fruit forward, it's done in a seamless, accessible, ready-to-drink style that makes it difficult to put down.

"Aromatic and stylish, this Dijon-clone Chardonnay jumps out with sweet spices on the nose and a floral twist to the palate. Pollen, apple and white-peach flavors punch through into a well-balanced, lingering finish. It drinks nicely already but should continue to improve through 2023.",91,Martin Woods 2016 Yamhill Valley Vineyard Chardonnay (McMinnville),,,,
"Brown sugar and buttered toast flavors dominate this wine, but it's not cloying, because it has lots of acidity. The mango, tangerine and peach flavors testify to exceptional ripeness.",85,San Simeon 2012 Chardonnay (Monterey),,,,

Decant or cellar till 2020 before drinking.",92,Domaine Serene 2014 Etoile Vineyard Block 22 Chardonnay (Dundee Hills),,,,
"Simple but meaty, this 100% Merlot has substantial weight in the midpalate. There are plenty of powerful herbal flavors, yet the grapes seem ripe enough, offering prune and cassis and a little pepper from aging in American oak.",86,Hyatt 2005 Merlot (Rattlesnake Hills),,,,
"A smooth and rich wine, this has weight and concentration. At the same time, it has an attractive, light-hearted feel that's poised and elegant. The wine could age for a few years. Screwcap.",89,Pratsch 2010 Rotenpüllen Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),,,,

"This vineyard designate made from 777 clone Pinot Noir was fermented in single-use barrels and aged in neutral wood.

It's drinking beautifully at the moment, so no need to wait.",92,Fullerton 2015 Lichtenwalter Vineyard Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),,,,
"There's lots of smoothness to this Cabernet. It's at its best now, showing delicious layers of black currants, anise and sandalwood, wrapped into firm but supple tannins. Gets an extra point for fanciness.",87,Owl Ridge 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Oaky influences give this wine a candied taste of caramel and lime pie, on top of the grapier flavors of pineapples and pears. It's solidly in the mode of what Americans want in a Chardonnay.",85,10 Knots 2006 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"This is a straightforward Cabernet that's dry, tannic and soft in acidity, making it fine to drink now. It has easy flavors of blackberries, black currants and cola.",85,Clayhouse 2012 Red Cedar Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"From vineyards in the Douro Superior, the high Douro close to Spain, this powerful wine reflects the dry climate with its dense tannins and concentration. A juicy element brings fresh black plums and acidity to the mix. The wine is an impressive work in progress. Drink from 2017.",91,Quinta das Bandeiras 2011 Passagem Reserva Red (Douro),,,,
"The concentrated apple juice aromas on this off-dry Riesling have a dark, caramelized sugar note that carries through on the palate as well. Bracing acidity and a tart, green apple finish would make this wine an excellent accompaniment to skillet browned pork chops or chicken braised with apples.",85,Wagner 2008 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Slightly grassy in character, this wine shows green pepper and tight tannins as well as black berry fruits. To balance this, the fruit is very much to the front, the wood and tannins behind. Drink now.",86,Pfneisl United Vineyards 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon Cabernet Sauvignon (Mittelburgenland),,,,
"Sweet and rich, verging on heavy, this is a rather soft kabinett, filled with ripe fruit flavors of pineapple, honey and melon. There's some slatey minerality hanging around the fringes to add complexity.",86,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler 2006 Bernkasteler alte Badstube am Doctorberg Kabinett Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer),,,,
"The nose of this luminous sparkler focuses on honey, acacia flower and a hint of almond nut. The bubbling is steady and direct, leaving soda-like effervescence in the mouth with little creaminess.",85,Casalnova NV Extra Dry  (Prosecco del Veneto),,,,
"Quite pale in color, this is an aromatically expressive, very varietal wine, with notes of forest floor, sarsaparilla and cherry. The flavors are light—not delivering on the aroma's promise—but still having richness, with nervy acids keeping it energized.",87,Windy Bay 2013 Pinot Noir (Oregon),,,,
"Pear, apricot and honeysuckle scents lead carry over to the soft, round palate along with a hint of pear. A white almond note fills in the finish.",87,Malabaila 2015  Roero,,,,

"Full of blackberry fruits and ripe tannins, this wine is spicy and with a perfumed character. It does have a dry core of structure to it along with rich fruits and the smoothing effect of wood aging. This is still developing and likely to be ready to drink from 2017.",88,Cortes de Cima 2013 Syrah (Alentejano),,,,
"Showing a flavor concentration unusual in California Chardonnay, this mountain wine is massive in baked tropical mango, guava and peach flavors, even a decadent taste of ripe bananas sautéed in butter and spiced with cinnamon, cloves and gingersnap cookie. It's also rich in smoky, caramelized oak, yet there's a firm backbone of minerals that, together with crisp acids, gives the wine structure.",94,Stonestreet 2006 Red Point Chardonnay (Alexander Valley),,,,

"For this new offering from the winery, fruit comes from top vineyards Dineen, StoneTree, Klipsun, Pepper Bridge, Discovery and Kiona. It displays strong aromas of burnt coffee, woodspice and cherry.

"A vibrant, useful rosé sparkling wine, full-bodied and rich. Crisp acidity brightens flamboyant flavors of raspberries, cherries, yeast and vanilla. Drink this dry bubbly now.",88,Domaine Carneros NV Cuvee de la Pompadour Sparkling (Carneros),,,,
"This Gironde-inspired blend of 80% Sauvignon Blanc and 20% Sémillon is solid now, but will be far more interesting in the years to come. Aromas of wet slate and wet wool meet with Pink Lady apples and green, grassy meadows on the nose. The mineral-focused palate shows graphite and steel touches, with angular grass tones that lead into a warmed touch of toast on the finish. Drink 2018–2025.",92,Shared Notes 2015 Les Leçons Des Maîtres White (Russian River Valley),,,,
"It's hard to choose a favorite amidst Thörle's 2015 dry Rieslings yet this bottling is a standout for its expansive, deliciously clingy mouthfeel. It's lusciously fruity, boasting ripe apricot and white peach flavors balanced by taut acidity and a pleasantly bitter edge of tannins.",92,Thörle 2015 Saulheimer Hölle Trocken Riesling (Rheinhessen),,,,
"Gianelli's first attempt with this Italian variety is all that one expects from an Aglianico that is meant to be deep, dark and dense, all chocolate and cherries, tight yet bright. Save it a few years for when you're next having osso bucco.",89,Gianelli 2009 Aglianico (Tuolumne County),,,,
"An earthy, nutty aroma and flavor come through the intense sweetness and full body of this dessert-style wine. It goes for earthy complexity rather than obvious fruit flavors, and tastes high in sugar and alcohol.",87,Terre Rouge 2013 Vin Doux Naturel Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),,,,
"The best of the new Syrah releases from Betz, this massive wine, sourced from the outstanding Boushey Vineyard, packs tart black fruit into a tight frame of licorice-soaked tannins.

There's terrific structure and poise in a wine of substantial power.",93,Betz Family 2009 La Serenne Syrah (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Rounded and soft, this has a touch of vanilla to go with the sweet strawberry fruit and crisp yet open acidity. Well balanced and dry, this would make for a good apéritif. Screwcap.",86,Bieler Père et Fils 2011 Sabine Rosé (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence),,,,

"Alluring scents of wild berry, Alpine herb, pine forest and wild flower lead the nose on this vibrant linear red.

"Underbrush, cured meat, new leather, camphor and a whiff of cellar floor are some of the aromas you'll find on this.

Drink 2020–2028.",90,Attilio Ghisolfi 2010 Ciabot Minat Riserva  (Barolo),,,,
"Demetria's Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah blend has had a good track record over the years, and what do you know, here's another fine offering. While the wine is quite dry, with a good bite of acidity, it has plenty of apparent sweetness, by way of sour raspberry candy, bacon and caramelized oak. Harder to describe is the splendid way it feels in the mouth, so silky, smooth and clean. Drink soon.",91,Demetria 2010 Cuvée Constantine G-S-M (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"This is a gorgeous wine with loads of intensity and personality derived from the native Corvina grape of Valpolicella, Italy. It's amazingly rich and smooth with long-lasting flavors of maraschino cherry, Indian spice and cola.",93,Allegrini 2004 La Poja Corvina (Veronese),,,,

"Light, elegant and lithe on the nose, with a touch of stemminess to the core plum and cherry aromas. Feels just right, with a feminine touch and snap to the mouthfeel.

"This wine has both structure and ripe red-plum fruits. It is dark and dense, solid and with good acidity. A clear line of freshness promises a good future. This needs time, so don't drink before 2020.",91,Louis Latour 2014 Epenots Premier Cru  (Pommard),,,,
"There isn't much in the way of attractive fruit on the musky, sweaty nose. Lemony, spicy flavors are also broken up by the unwelcome taste of chicken soup. As a whole it's fairly dull and chunky, and not very evolved or fancy.",83,Valchiarò 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Colli Orientali del Friuli),,,,
"This is a flamboyant wine made in the oaky style. It's opulent in pineapple, golden mango and pear flavors, with a coating of sweet oak. The richness is brightened by tart acidity.

"Aromas of red cherry and a whiff of baking spice emerge from this bright blend of 70% Sangiovese, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.

"Sweet, tart and simple, like the filling on a black-cherry pie. Not much else going on. Drink now.",84,Martin Ray 2008 Reserve Merlot (Oak Knoll District),,,,
"A little too soft for ageability, but a very delicious wine. Not quite in the league of the wonderful 2007, but offers rich, ripe flavors of blackberries, cherries, cola and cedar, with all kinds of earthy, minerally complexities. Give it a firmer mouthfeel and the score would soar.",90,W.H. Smith 2008 Purple Label Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),,,,
"Blackberry, briar and savory herb notes point to the preponderance of Cabernet Franc in this round, but elegantly balanced Bordeaux-style blend. It's rich and ripe on the palate with a frame of velvety tannins that extend long on the finish.",87,Six Mile Creek 2010 Quintessence Red (New York),,,,
"A tight, compact expression of Grecanico, this exudes aromas of yellow rose, citrus, vanilla and exotic fruit. The pretty floral component would pair with poached salmon or trout.",87,Cambria 2011 Suaviter Grecanico (Sicilia),,,,
"Invigorating acidity and crisp citrus and apple flavors shine in this sparkling Riesling. The mousse is elegant and smooth, brightened by tiny, persistent bubbles that seem to disseminate pops of caramel and honey sweetness.",90,Fitz-Ritter NV Fitz Extra Trocken Sekt Riesling (Pfalz),,,,
"Juicy dark-purple fruits hold the center of this supple, engaging wine that's still young, with chewy tannins. There's tangy bite to the acids and plenty of muscle for aging. Drink 2020 through 2030 and possibly longer.",94,Bethel Heights 2015 Justice Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
"Here's a really pretty Rosso with a bright, fruit-driven bouquet. It opens with notes of raspberry and wild berry, with background tones of cinnamon and crushed clove. The finish is acidic and crisp.",89,Castelli Martinozzi 2010  Rosso di Montalcino,,,,
"You get both apricots and honeyed botrytis aromas that are followed through by a dry core, very full-bodied with richness, the sweetness of the yellow jam fruits, apricots and mangoes gliding over the palate. Delicious, and certainly ageworthy.",94,Château Rieussec 2005  Sauternes,,,,
"Wonderfully ripe and pure red and green apple notes rise from the glass. The palate shines with the same full-flavored fruit, edged by freshness and a slight spritz. The finish is generously zesty and dry but fruity.",90,Leth 2016 Roter Veltliner (Wagram),,,,
"Light peach and apricot aromas meet richer, riper pear and vanilla flavors and a creamy texture for a medium-bodied, palate-pleasing taste.",88,Josh Cellars 2014 Chardonnay (California),,,,
"Soft, ripe fruit, already accessible. This has a generous feel and flavors of berries and red plums. Not a wine for aging, but very attractive.",88,CARM 2008 Vintage  (Port),,,,
"Full-bodied and smooth in texture, this generous-tasting wine has lots of ripe plum flavors and sweet-seeming oak accents.",87,Archgate Cellars 2014 Reserve Bottling Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),,,,

"The former race-car driver's blend of 49.5% Cabernet Sauvignon, 49.5% Sangiovese and 1% Malbec conveys concentrated dark strawberry and red plum on the nose along with darker fruits, licorice and wet loam aromas. Clove and cinnamon show on the palate, with soft red fruits and cedar, all lifted by a bright acidity.",91,Jamie Slone Wines 2013 Super Tuscan Red (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"This structured blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon, Picolit and Moscato Giallo offers aromas of toasted oak, ginger and orchard fiuit. The elegant palate combines Golden Delicious apple, mature apricot, oak-driven spice and candied nectarine zest alongside tangy acidity.",90,Livon 2013 Braide Alte White (Collio),,,,
"Blue flower, baking spice and red-berry aromas lead the nose. The ripe, straightforward palate shows mature dark cherry, clove, anise and a confectionary note framed in firm tannins.",87,Casetta 2011  Barolo,,,,
"Earthy aromas of scorched earth, underbrush and a funky note of barnyard lead the nose. The palate isn't very expressive, offering dried cherry and kitchen spices alongside assertive tannins.",87,Ca' del Baio 2012 Asili  (Barbaresco),,,,
"A dark-colored wine, this is full of tannins as well as ripe blackberry fruits. The acidity and fruitiness give it a very fresh character, while the underlying tannins will let it age. Drink from 2018.",90,Château d'Agassac 2013  Haut-Médoc,,,,
"Lively in aromas and with vivid flavors like grapefruit and apricot, this wine tastes lightly herbal and appetizing. It has light oaky, buttery notes in the aroma and fairly vivid fruit flavors. The texture that gets richer with each sip, revealing a rather full body.",86,Victor Vineyards 2013 Lawson Ranch Chardonnay (Lodi),,,,
"A high amount of toast currently dominates this wine. Texturally, it is minerally, citric and tight, and its grapefruit and toast notes mingle with its intense acids. Because of its structure, this needs to age for at least three years.",91,Olivier Leflaive 2010 En Remilly Premier Cru  (Saint-Aubin),,,,
"Put this into a blind flight of French rosé, and it will seem like one of the crowd. Crafted from 65% Grenache, 29% Syrah and 6% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is bone dry, dusty and detailed, showing a gorgeous onion-skin hue. The elegance and length are exceptional.",92,Southard 2011 Lawrence Vineyard Le Paon Rosé (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A deep red color and concentrated aromas and flavors of dark berries, dark chocolate and pomegranate are offset nicely by a layered texture laced with fine tannins. This well-structured wine will be great with a juicy steak.",89,Girasole 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino),,,,
"Almost crystal-clear in the glass, this bottling shows broad aromas of red apple and peach before the grass, wet hay, squeezed lime and rainy sidewalk aromas stand up. There is a sharp texture and tension to the sip, where the warmth of poached pear is cut by mowed lawn and wet river stones.",91,La Honda Winery 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"Still a very young wine, Londer's Paraboll is leathery and herbal, marked by swirls of bright cranberry and rhubarb flavor. With a full, silky mouthfeel and long finish, it's one of the best of their 2010s to seek out. This should gain complexity with a few years more of age.",91,Londer 2010 Paraboll Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),,,,
"Muted aromatics tease on the nose before chewy texture and full-bodied weight enter the scene. Deceptively light and airy at first, the wine then delves into a hearty taste of marzipan and oak.",85,Frisson Wines 2013 Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
A perfumed and crisp citrus wine that is light and fruity. It is soft and smooth with a light creamy texture and refreshing acidity. Ready to drink.,86,Quinta do Casal Branco 2015 Fernão Pires (Tejo),,,,
"Prune, raisin and gamy black-fruit aromas fold in a note of iodine. This Uco Valley Malbec features tough but manageable tannins in front of a savory tasting palate with roasted plum and berry flavors. A note of salt lends complexity to a rubbery, tannic finish. Drink through 2023.",92,Finca la Celia 2013 Heritage Single Vineyard Malbec (Uco Valley),,,,

"This opens with aromas of blackberry, leather, coffee and scorched earth. On the palate, licorice, clove and a balsamic note add depth to the core of dried black cherry while fine-grained tannins provide the framework. Drink it sooner rather later to capture the fruit richness.",88,Giulio Accornero e Figli 2011 Bricco Battista  (Barbera del Monferrato Superiore),,,,
"This medium-bodied wine is already drinking optimally, with a core of red fruit streaked with cola, earth, graphite and citrus notes. Only four barrels were produced.",89,Spindrift Cellars 2014 Barrel Select Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
Ripe berry and cassis aromas are broadened by open-grain oak. This Cabernet is big and tannic. Toasty chocolaty berry flavors with a full complement of oaky support maintain a chocolaty essence on a finish that confirms how whole and thorough this is. Drink this warm-vintage wine through 2022.,92,Domus Aurea 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),,,,
"Properly dry and crisp, this is a zesty mineral-driven Champagne. It has acidity, citrus and green-fruit flavors. The texture and the direct fruitiness reveal a wine that is still young. Drink this bottling from 2018.",88,Barrat-Masson NV Fleur de Craie Extra Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),,,,

"There is something of the essential crispness and green fruit character of a Vinho Verde. But the wine also has some richness, weight, and a creamy texture. Very aromatic, this is a wine to drink and also age a few months.",90,Wines & Winemakers 2012 Maria Papoila Escolha White (Vinho Verde),,,,

"Forward and fruity, this offers flavors of berry and plum. It feels a little flat on the palate, with some peppery tannins and a quick fade.",86,Bomb 2009 Pinot Noir,,,,
"At first the aromas of hard cheese and blatant oak veil the black fruit quotient in this blend. However, in the mouth the wine is more expressive and ripe, with plum, berry and ample oak-driven vanilla. It doesn't appear to have much depth or complexity, but overall it is smooth and pleasant.",86,Pago de Larrainzar 2005 Red (Navarra),,,,
"Dusty berry and plum aromas set the stage for a big, cheek-grabbing wine with red berry, leather and light herb flavors. Toasty and minty, this finishes with a touch of spice. This is a good blend of 60% Mal­bec and 40% Merlot.",86,Alfredo Roca 2011 Malbec-Merlot (Mendoza),,,,

"Completing and complementing the winery's extensive portfolio of Pinot Gris, this is the only one that spends time in barrel. As a note to its uniqueness, the King Estate name is intentionally printed upside down on the label. Though there are no intrusive oak-dominated flavors, the technique definitely softens and smooths the wine, eliminating some of the aromatic details and much of the tang. It's ready to drink: lightly toasty, with pleasant apple and pear flavors.",89,King Estate 2015 Paradox Barrel Aged Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Dusty aromas of tea and dried spices blend well with black olive and black-fruit notes. This wine has a lean but muscular build. Plum and wild berry flavors come with dry, spicy oak accents.

"The blend of 40% Grenache Blanc, 28% Viognier, 20% Picpoul Blanc, and 12% Roussanne hits the nose with minerality and citrus, wound tightly around tangerine peel. The flavors are almost all lime zest and chalk, making for a brisk pre-dinner drink or perfect shellfish partner.",89,Adelaida 2013 Finder Estate White (Paso Robles),,,,
"Clean and basic, with peach, buttercup and floral aromas. The palate is round, simple, fresh and not too acidic, with melony flavors and a soft, easygoing, monotone finish. Generic but perfectly adequate Torrontés; drink now.",85,Viniterra 2009 Terra Torrontés (Mendoza),,,,
"Syrah from central Tuscany? Sure. The '98 version of Colvecchio, an offering from a hot year, is leaner than might be expected and short on dimension. It has lots of oak up front and an abundance of spicy, tart red fruit in the middle. The oak kicks up on the finish as well. The effort is there and the fruit seems sound, but tartness is the overriding impression it leaves.",86,Castello Banfi 1998 Colvecchio Syrah (Sant'Antimo),,,,
"One of a series of great single-vineyard wines from Geyerhof, this is as impressive as the rest. It has weight, complexity and richness.

For aging over at least five years.",93,Geyerhof 2010 Kirchensteig Erste Lage Reserve Riesling (Kremstal),,,,

"This is an enormously ripe, sumptuous Cabernet Sauvignon. It has all the hallmarks of the modern cult style, from focused blackberry, cassis and spicy chocolate flavors and profoundly ripe, sweet tannins to the balancing acidity and oak elaboration that adds that extra touch of richness. This elegant wine is at its best now and for five years.",92,Ghost Block 2004 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),,,,
"A soft, hot, funky wine. Despite a wealth of berry, chocolate and spice flavors, high alcohol gives it a chile pepper burn.",84,Hendry 2007 Block 28 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),,,,
"This Bordeaux-style blend offers licorice at the forefront, with baking spice, fig, prune, soy sauce and Lipton tea queuing behind. Showing more of the same on the palate, these flavors help to quench the parching tannins that carry this blend to a lingering finish.",87,North Gate 2013 Meritage (Virginia),,,,
"Simple and straightforward, this fruity wine offers lemon/lime fruit and moderate acidity. Fine for everyday consumption, best chilled.",85,Mount Baker 2009 Proprietor's Limited Release Riesling (Yakima Valley),,,,
"From one of a group of chateaus owned by the Guyon family of Rolland de By, this is an intensely fruity wine. It has finely balanced tannins and acidity along with smoky flavors and layers of delicious black currant fruit. Drink from 2019.",90,Château La Clare 2014  Médoc,,,,
"Lively and aromatic, this shows aromas of candied peach, Juicy Fruit gum and white flower. The palate shows pleasant weight, texture and more tart flavors. The addition of 6% Petit Manseng brings acidic lift that lasts through the finish.",86,Rappahannock Cellars 2014 Viognier (Virginia),,,,
"Ripe and soft with rich apple flavor, there's a fullness to this wine. While elegant with a touch of maturity from bottle ageing, the palate is freshened a crispness and levity characteristic of the house style. It has enough weight to accompany food and is ready to drink now.",90,Canard-Duchêne NV Cuvée Léonie Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"A big, ripe, still very young wine with black fruits that are right up front. It's jammy and juicy, with almost as much fruit as tannin. There is some aging potential, with the underlying dryness of the structure, but the wine is mostly about ripe fruitiness. Drink from 2017.",89,Château de Chambert 2011 Grand Vin Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"Heady raisiny aromas smell sweet, savory and a bit like animal fur. This is pinching and hot on the palate, which shouldn't surprise at 15.5% abv. Savory roasted blackberry and baking-spice flavors end with peppery heat and hard tannins. Drink this sizzling varietal Monastrell through 2023.",90,Vinessens 2012 El Telar Monastrell (Alicante),,,,
"Pitch black wine, densely concentrated, powerful, its wood aging giving shape to the huge fruit and tannins. Ripe black fruits add a juicy character, with a jammy richness complemented by exotic spices. The wine needs five years' cellaring.",93,Herdade das Servas 2008 Reserva Red (Alentejano),,,,
"Wild berries, from elderberry to salmonberry to mountain strawberries, are in play in this wine. The underpinning scents suggest earth and wet cement, while in the finish a strong flavor of breakfast tea lingers. This is an interesting addition to the Sineann lineup.",90,Sineann 2014 Russell-Grooters Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
"This full-bodied red features aromas of underbrush, tilled soil, dark berry, new leather and a whiff of game. The concentrated palate offers ripe black cherry, licorice, mocha and a note of pipe tobacco alongside firm, velvety tannins. It's already ripe and accessible but will also age well for the next decade at least. Drink 2016– 2025.",90,SassodiSole 2010  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Light strawberry fruit is heavily cloaked in flavors of butter and toast from eight months in oak. The wood flavors cover but do not entirely mask the bitter herbal notes, and the tannins seem disjointed and not fully integrated.",87,King Estate 2013 Signature Collection Pinot Noir (Oregon),,,,
"With its intense scents and flavors of orange candy, Muscat is often made in a sweet style, but here it shows its dry side, and to good effect. Bright and penetrating scents and flavors hit on the entire spectrum of oranges, with excellent weight, precision and concentration. A touch of candied ginger adds further interest.",91,Township 7 2015 Rock Pocket Vineyard Muscat (Okanagan Valley),,,,
"Landmark's Chardonnays have been getting sweeter and simpler over the years, perhaps in an attempt to appeal to the popular palate. With the 2011 Lorenzo, they have produced a ripe, oaky, buttery Chard, with orange and pineapple jam, vanilla, honey and fresh cream flavors, made for drinking now.",87,Landmark 2010 Lorenzo Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This popular Chardonnay gives you a generous burst of buttered nuts and toast, the flavors many consumers want in their Chardonnays. Not much going on in the fruit department—just clean, tart green apples, with a sharp, acidic edge.",87,Columbia Crest 2009 H3 Chardonnay (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"Wild strawberry and alpine herb aromas mingle in the glass. The bright palate delivers crushed red cherry, cinnamon and green tea alongside firm but polished tannins and fresh acidity.",89,Franz Haas 2012 Pinot Nero (Alto Adige),,,,
"Sourced from a cool site in the Coastal Range, this has a powerful streak of grapefruit both in the fruit and the acidity. It's sharp but interesting, with pine needle highlights and rhubarb/cranberry fruit. It has the structure to age, and would be an interesting wine to follow over the next decade or so.",89,King Estate 2010 Pfeiffer Vineyards Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This self-described, entry-level blend boasts floral aromatics and spicy, peppery fruit flavors of cranberry, strawberry and raspberry. Ribbon Ridge Pinots show great character, especially when from estate-grown, biodynamically-certified grapes like this offering.",92,Brick House 2013 Select Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),,,,
"Hailing from the Danube Plain, this Bulgarian Chardonnay has aromas of citrus blossom and lemon curd that pave the way to zesty flavors of lemon and green apple in the mouth.",89,Domaine Boyar 2015 Quantum Chardonnay (Danube River Plains),,,,
"The alcohol is pretty high, but the wine is decadently rich and forward in pie-filling flavors of cherries, raspberries, currants and chocolate, seasoned with anise, cinnamon and pepper. Firm tannins give much-needed structure to this deliciously dry Cab Franc.",90,Viansa 2005 Samuele Cabernet Franc (Sonoma County),,,,
"With aromas of black cherry and smoke, this inky garnet-colored wine features flavors of raspberry, pomegranate, clove, and coffee bean with a whiff of eucalyptus. Modest tannins offer a backdrop for a medley of fruit, spice and herb flavors that come to a head in a bracing finish with a touch of smoke.",90,Yatir 2012 Mt. Amasa Red (Judean Hills),,,,
"Zesty limes and lemons brighten aromas of fresh pear on this irresistibly nimble-bodied Riesling. Ripe tangerine and peach flavors are semi-sweet on the palate, but zippy with acidity and a delicate fringe of minerals that lend complexity to the finish.",91,St. Urbans-Hof 2012 Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Erste Lage Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"A concentrated wine, relying on its generous black currant juice fruit rather than the more reticent tannins. The wine is dominated by Cabernet juiciness, a burst of fruit in the glass.",89,Château Clerc Milon 2007  Pauillac,,,,
"This widely available white is unfussy and medium bodied, with toasted oak and baked apple flavors, brightened by a squeeze of lemon.",85,Alexander Valley Vineyards 2015 Estate Chardonnay (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Tar and rich black cherries form the nose of this wine sourced from a vineyard planted in 1997. Luscious red fruit begins the palate, supported in the midpalate and finish by black pepper and fennel seed. It makes for a very approachable but complex, spice-driven wine.",91,Sonnet 2012 Tondre's Grapefield Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"This is a creamy, lushly textured white that's medium bodied and ample on the palate, with accents of well-integrated pear, vanilla and fennel flavors.",90,Kelleher 2015 Block 21 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"A focused line of lemon balm meets with gardenia, soft jasmine, light butterscotch and green tea on the nose of this county blend by Colombian-born, French-trained Winemaker Bibiana González Rave. Lemon, light vanilla and a touch of warm pastry show on the palate.",91,Alma de Cattleya 2015 Chardonnay (Sonoma County),,,,
"You can tell by its thin but still very vibrant color that this is a traditional Chianti Classico (90/10 Sangiovese–Canaiolo) that puts emphasis on delicacy and balance, not on thick concentration. It is that quality that makes this wine well-suited to most Italian and Mediterranean dishes.",87,Badia a Coltibuono 2006  Chianti Classico,,,,
"This Prosecco Extra Dry has a subtle, easy approach with measured fruit intensity but recognizable sweetness in the form of silky honey and melon. It offers a good measure of cleaning effervescence and chewy fruit to keep it going.",86,Carmina NV Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Conegliano),,,,
"Truffle, underbrush, dark berry, mocha and grilled sage aromas unfold in the glass. The firm palate delivers smoke, raw berry, baking spice, anise and a sprinkling of aromatic herb while bracing tannins provide the backbone.",91,Bel Colle 2011 Monvigliero  (Barolo),,,,
"A thick wine that doesn't bring the ripeness, sweetness and balance that's necessary. The nose is filled with milk chocolate, mint and cough syrup, while the palate is surprisingly tangy and sharp, with cranberry and wild raspberry flavors.",83,St. Lucas 2005 Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Apple, spice and mild yeast aromas are composed and hint at complexity. This feels complete, with a layer or two of depth. Dry flavors of apple and apricot are clean and direct.",87,Marqués de la Concordia 2013 Federico Paternina Banda Azul Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"Not much of this wine was made, the grapes coming from a vineyard in the heart of the appellation farmed by Phil Coturri. Earthy and light in oak, it struggles to show fruit, remaining more about minerally and compostable aromas.",84,Sergio 2014 Steel Plow Vineyard Grenache (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"This has bright aromas of red currant, cherry and red pepper. The palate isn't very expressive, but it does show some prune and raisin notes, along with a hint of chocolate. It could use a bit more freshness and length, and you'll detect the alcohol. Drink soon.",86,Cantina Valpolicella Negrar 2009 Domini Veneti  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),,,,
"One of the champions of the old Mission grape varietal, this winery continues to make strides in showcasing its potential in modern winemaking, This blend of 75% Mission, 15% Syrah, 5% Grenache, 4% Zinfandel and 1% Cinsault shows classic watermelon and bubblegum aromas on the nose, leading into a well-balanced palate of strawberry fruit, lime tang and a chalky minerality.",90,Proulx 2014 Willow Creek Farm Rose of Mission (Paso Robles),,,,
"Overtly sweet aromas and flavors dominate this upstate New York offering. Wiemer’s wines have impressed us before, but this comes off as heavy-handed, with a dense, perfumey quality. It possesses decent length and texture, but the weighty sweetness makes it a better candidate for mimosas or for entertaining those who shy away from dryness.",84,Hermann J. Wiemer 1997 Cuvée Brut 2000  (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This is a rich wine, labeled sweet but with a firm core of dryness that gives considerable texture. It reveals pure, ripe fruits coming from the biodynamically grown grapes, adding to a depth of flavor. It's ready for some good aging, so wait to drink until 2017.",93,Kuentz-Bas 2012 Pfersigberg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"Appealing aromas of cocoa, vanilla, spice and red fruit are followed by plump ripe fruit and barrel flavors. Chocolate flavors linger on the finish. The oak plays prominently.",88,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2014 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This blend of 43% Grenache, 20% Cinsault, 20% Syrah and 17% Petite Sirah offers boisterous berry, cherry and plum-juice aromas on the nose. Black-cherry juice flavors dominate the ripe palate. This would make a great wine for backyard barbecues with burgers and ribs.",86,Robert Hall 2014 Cuvée de Robles Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"Earthy, leathery aromas are hot and end up smelling like a field in summertime. It feels hard on the palate, with a buttery oak note that sets up flavors of plum and raspberry mixed with green herb.",82,Viña Requingua 2011 Puerto Viejo Reserve Merlot (Curicó Valley),,,,
"Bright aromas of ripe peach, apricot, flower and jasmine lead to off-dry stone fruit flavors in this simple, straightforward quaffer.",86,Browne Family Vineyards 2015 & White (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"There is a definite richness to this wine, the ripe white fruit and melon flavors aided by a judicious amount of vanilla and toast. That makes the wine seductive, but Laroche does not forget its Chablis origins and leaves enough room for a core of grapefruit, steel and tight acidity. Screwcap.",93,Domaine Laroche 2006 Réserve de l'Obédience Les Blanchots Grand Cru  (Chablis),,,,
"Rose, iris, dark berry and baking spice aromas emerge on this taut wine. The dense palate doles out mature black cherry, resin, cinnamon, vanilla and a hint of toast balanced by fine-grained tannins and bright acidity.",91,Mario Marengo 2011 Bricco delle Viole  (Barolo),,,,
"Made from Syrah, Grenache, Mourvèdre and Counoise grapes grown at the producer's 95-acre estate, this is a dry, simple wine with tart yet ripe strawberry and peach notes.",86,Lasseter 2016 Enjoué Estate Grown Rosé (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"One of the ripest of Hartford's new Pinots, this is a full-bodied and very rich wine. It offers extreme flavor in place of subtlety, offering a massive palate wash of blackberries and cherries that veers into Lifesaver candy. The bet is ageability. Hold until after 2011.",91,Hartford 2007 Jennifer's Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This has a powerful, briary character, with a spicy, high-alcohol kick. It erupts in the mouth, with flavors of wild berry, tobacco, cola, anise and white pepper that should pair well with equally spicy fare, preferably fatty meats and cheeses.",87,Pech Merle 2010 Treborce Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"This wine comes from a one-acre parcel on the Corton hill. It is dense and dark both in color and in black-fruit flavors. Concentrated from the 50-year-old vines, it is firm with tannins and solid with rich fruitiness. The wine needs time; drink from 2022.",93,Domaine Arnoux Père et Fils 2014 Le Rognet  (Corton),,,,
"Fragrant and structured, this opens with aromas of wild berry, menthol, leather, tilled soil and aromatic herbs. The palate doles out wild cherry, fleshy black raspberry, cinnamon, white pepper and anise. Bracing tannins and racy acidity give it an ageworthy structure, but don't attempt this until after 2020.",93,Brezza 2011 Sarmassa  (Barolo),,,,
"A ripe, full-bodied and spicy wine, defiantly dry, with a tight acid character. Aromatic fruit finish with intense perfumes, so that the wine is both rich and fresh.",87,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal 2009 JP Azeitão Branco White (Península de Setúbal),,,,
"This is a delicious, perfumed and fruity wine. It is crisp and clean, bright with acidity and ripe in raspberry flavors. This wine is a perfect summer quaffing rosé.",88,Château Valcolombe 2015 Rosé (Coteaux Varois en Provence),,,,
"Intense citrus notes perfume this bright, sunny off-dry Riesling. Yellow peach and pear flavors are rich and ripe on the palate, but balanced by a firm strike of lemon acidity. Finishes moderately long.",89,Prinz Salm 2013 Two Princes Riesling (Rheinhessen),,,,
"There's a wild array of aromas to this appellation blend, including wild mint and huckleberries. It's bright red fruit at first sip, then the wine downshifts into cloves, wet asphalt and anise. A direct but clean and very appealing selection, ready for enjoyment now.",91,Fess Parker 2011 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Now mature, this is a wine with weight and richness. It shows concentration in its juicy, but maturing, fruit flavors. The wine has layers of tannin still, so could age well for a few years more.",88,Château Romanin 2006 Red (Les Baux de Provence),,,,
"Clear and focused, with raspberry and edgy spice aromas to the nose. The palate doesn't bring a whole bunch of meat or heft, but it is clean, racy and food-friendly. Flavors of red berries and pepper are normal and expected, while the finish is dry and lean.",87,Marqués de Cáceres 2007 Crianza  (Rioja),,,,
"A single vineyard expression from this winery's newish vineyard, this shows pressed purple flowers, deep blueberries and a touch of tar on the nose. The flavors are dense, dark and framed by strong tannins, with elderberry, pencil lead and deep lilac syrup gaining intrigue from white sage, white pepper and raw beef tones.",89,San Simeon 2012 St. Eva Hill Vineyard Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),,,,
"Made for aging, this wine is structured and firm. It has a dense texture surrounded by ripe white and yellow fruits. With a touch of spice and a pepper character, it is rich, impressive and full-bodied. Drink from 2017.",93,Domaine de la Pepière 2012 Clisson  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine Clisson),,,,
"A fresh, fruity nose with hints of spice lend an alluring start to this Chardonnay, but on the palate, flavors run a little thin.  That said, an appealing toasted oak spice character adds dimension.",83,Swedish Hill 2006 Reserve Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This is the winery's top Cabernet. The '09 is very ripe, rich and forward, offering powerful blackberry, cherry and currant flavors that are wrapped into soft, gentle tannins. It's quite good, but it needs a couple of years in the bottle. Best around 2015.",92,Rodney Strong 2009 Alexander's Crown Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Jammy berry aromas are touched up in a good way by spicy notes of good oak and chocolate. A solid, ripe palate feels right and balanced. Mellow but thorough berry fruit and oak flavors linger easily on a finish with chocolate and muted oak notes. Drink through 2022.",91,Viña Tarapacá 2015 Gran Reserva Etiqueta Negra Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),,,,
"Warm and rich, the wine from vineyards on the slopes above Cadillac have the structure of the vintage along with the ripe, blackberry fruits. It is already attractive to drink, and will continue to age nicely over the medium term.",90,Château Suau 2010  Côtes de Bordeaux,,,,
"Delicate notes of nettle and lemon play on the restrained nose. The palate adds slight but very refreshing spritz to the already slender and crisp body. This is an easy, delicate summer wine with a clean and refreshing finish.",91,Umathum 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Burgenland),,,,
"This soft wine is still waiting for its intensity to come through. The acidity is there, as is ripe, honeyed fruit. Wait until 2022 to open it.",90,Château la Tour Blanche 2014 Charmilles  (Sauternes),,,,
"This Roero benefits from an added layer of spice, clove and cinnamon that sits tight over floral notes and wild berries (a tiny percent of Barbera is added to the blend). There's a charred, smoky tone in the mouth and the finish is tight but firm.",87,Marsaglia 2007 Brich d'America  (Roero),,,,
"Rounded and rich, this single-vineyard wine is concentrated without losing a touch of its beautiful fruit. It has a fine balance between fruit and acidity as well as a tense line of minerality and tight texture. Drink this impressive wine from 2024.",93,Le Carré 2014  Saint-Émilion,,,,
"A balanced, well-structured wine, and a superb value. Cassis, black plum guts and anise are supported by soft sweet spice and leather fleshing out the nose and mouth, with lingering dusty tannins leaving you begging for more. Ready to drink now; pair with flank steak fajitas.",87,Juno 2008 Cape Maidens Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz-Merlot Red (Western Cape),,,,
"As ripe as Donum's regular 2010 Russian River Pinot is, this reserve is even richer. It's certainly impressive for sheer power, but is too much of a good thing, flooding the mouth with so much soft, ripe, oaky raspberry and cherry flamboyance as to lose subtlety.",89,Donum 2010 Reserve Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Generous notions of ripe pear on the nose acquire an earthier, rounder aspect on the fresh palate. This is generous with fruit, yet fresh and somehow weightless. The finish is long and lasting.",90,Domaine Gérard Neumeyer 2015 la Tulipe Pinot Blanc (Alsace),,,,
"Spice and ripe fruit, with attractive tannins and a soft texture. This wine is open, generous, rich and packed with black currant fruitiness. Give this wine another 2–4 years, but it could well be drinkable sooner.",90,Château Mayne Vieil 2011 Cuvée Aliénor  (Fronsac),,,,
"From a vineyard planted on the edge of Freestone by James MacPhail of MacPhail Family Wines and respected grower Jim Pratt, this wine opens with a splash of white pepper that persists on the soft, silky palate. Roses and black tea provide savory flavor, with an intensity of forest floor.",88,Sante Arcangeli 2014 Mardikian Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Varietal aromas of tomato vine, elderflower, gooseberry and citrus lead the nose and follow through to the palate along with grapefruit, sage and mineral. Racy acidity leaves a crisp finish.",87,Erste Neue 2014 Classic Sauvignon (Alto Adige),,,,
"This appealing, very varietal wine offers notes of high-toned dried herbs, flowers, dry chocolate and cherry. It's full bodied in feel yet elegant in style with rich, textured cherry and chocolate flavors backed by a light grip of tannins, showing some warmth on the finish.",91,Trust 2012 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A fine wine, dry and bright in zesty acidity, and an excellent example of a tight, young Anderson Valley Pinot Noir. This shows flavors of sour cherry candy, persimmon and spice flavors, grounded with minerals. Drink now, with decanting, or age it for up to six years.",91,Maggy Hawk 2009 Afleet Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),,,,
"Translucent red in color, this coastal Pinot is light and peppery on the nose, with saline and celery stalk scents along with baked plum and raspberry notes. Oak aging has left a buttery texture that's cut by acidity, while flavors of cherry and plum are supported by barrel notes and acid-based juiciness.",88,Errazuriz 2012 Aconcagua Costa Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Aconcagua Valley),,,,
"Gumball aromas yield to scents of spice and wet animal fur, while the flavor profile settles on tart and thin, with a watery mouthfeel. This is a lean, funky wine that doesn't have a whole lot of Rioja character.",82,Bodegas Valdemar 2006 Esencia Valdemar  (Rioja),,,,
"The vineyard needs a warm vintage to fully ripen, which 2010 definitely wasn't. The wine is acidic and green, with an ammonia edge to the pineapples, mangoes and limes.",85,Kunde 2010 Magnolia Lane Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"The Ehrhart style is for rich wines and this impressive Grand Cru is no exception. It has intense flavors of white fruits, lemon, spice and a hint of thyme. Its acidity balances that richness, cutting a path that gives a great lift and leaves the wine fresh at the end. Drink from 2017.",93,Domaine Ehrhart 2011 Domaine Saint-Rémy Hengst Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"While low in alcohol and austere in dryness, there's a remarkable richness of texture that lends an impression of volume and density on the palate. Brisk notes of lemon and tart tangerine shine brightly, but are juxtaposed by an intensely stony, mineral finish. Drink now through 2020.",92,Peter Jakob Kühn 2014 Jacobus Trocken Riesling (Rheingau),,,,
"Fantastically concentrated fruit flavors seem to turbocharge this very full-bodied, superripe wine. Blackberry, boysenberry and dark chocolate weave in and out of the almost-thick and nicely viscous texture, lingering on the finish.",91,Boeger 2014 Zinfandel (El Dorado),,,,
"This late-release wine has distinctive, enticing aromas like cedar, mushrooms and cigar box. Along with mellow fruity, savory flavors, these contribute to a beautifully mature character. It is medium to full in body, very smooth in texture due to softened tannins, and lasting on the finish.",91,Martin Lane Winery 2011 Estate Syrah (Sierra Foothills),,,,
"Sultry notions of honeycomb, pine sap and something more tropical—perhaps pineapple, perhaps passion fruit—converge in an incredibly concentrated and at the same time tight and light-footed palate. Passion fruit notes intensify on the palate and while this is very sweet, racy, zesty acidity holds wonderful sway. This expresses the much-lauded purity of Eiswein perfectly.",92,Nigl 2012 Eiswein Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),,,,
"A tremendous wine. Made from 100% Cabernet and raised for nearly two years in 40% new French oak, it defines the ripe, hedonistic Napa style. Yet it's no mere fruit bomb, offering a tobaccoey earthiness to the berries. A touch of raisins and heat in the finish seems to limit ageability, though, so drink up.",89,Venge 2009 Silencieux Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"A touch of blossom honey enriches the tart but ripe apple notes of the nose. On the palate that honeyed touch turns into lemony, golden shortbread while the tart apple notes are joined by fresh, ripe lemon. Thousands of tiny, pin-prick bubbles make for a creamy, elegant mousse. The contrast between honeyed, autolytic richness and bright, pure citrus is a joy. This wine is exciting and elegant, drawing you to its mellower, richer core. The purity on the finish is luminous and long.",94,Hoffmann & Rathbone 2011 Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (England),,,,
"Dry, minerally and acidic, this Chardonnay offers pineapple, lemon and mineral flavors. It's a food-friendly wine that won't compete with what you eat. At this price, it's a good restaurant wine, and easy to find, with 7,500 cases produced.",86,Black Stallion 2010 Estate Chardonnay (Napa Valley),,,,
"Dark, sweet and rooty on the nose, with a warm, soft outlook. The palate is bold and thorough, with ripe berry, plum and chocolate flavors. Per usual, Punto Final is ripe, sweet and big, with a peppery finish and toasty, jammy warmth.",89,Bodega Renacer 2007 Punto Final Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Easygoing and fresh, but with solid natural structure and density at the back, this Italian white would pair with spaghetti con vongole or fried calamari rings. Lasting flavors of peach, citrus and honey characterize the finish.",87,Petrussa 2009 Pinot Bianco (Colli Orientali del Friuli),,,,
"Inviting citrus and herbal notes lead to yeasty freshness, bright lemon acidity and the peppery savoriness of watercress and arugula. It's wonderfully concentrated, long and streamlined with a full and lasting flavor. Good now but will open up nicely.",93,Fischer 2013 Ried Steiger Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),,,,
"An aromatic, full-bodied wine from a rich vintage, this has firm tannins and an approachable red-fruit flavor, with spice and toast notes from wood aging. Age this for at least two years.",89,Domaine Laporte 2009 Les Royaux  (Sancerre),,,,
"There's power in this concentrated wine. The texture is rich, velvet, touched by pepper, ripe acidity and pear skins. Along with its creamy, rounded character, the wine has the bite of tight spice and a dry, firm core.",91,Alzinger 2007 Steinertal Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),,,,
"Sweet, frothy and very pink, this is a strawberry-jelly rosé, light and fruity. The touch of acidity at the end is very welcome.",83,Quinta das Arcas 2013 Conde Villar Rosé (Vinho Verde),,,,
"Very dry, tannic and acidic, in the manner of Barbera, a wine that's not offering much charm now. Fans of the variety will like its unrelieved austerity. The flavors of are blackberries and espresso.",86,Easton 2007 Monarch Mine Vineyard Barbera (Sierra Foothills),,,,
"Dark garnet in the glass, this wine has a bouquet of black cherry, vanilla and anise. Flavors of black cherry, raspberry, chocolate and violet roll on the tongue amidst almost chewy tannins that are kept in check by bright acidity. There is a strong note of cranberry on the finish and a touch of chocolate on the post-palate.",89,Barkan 2013 Classic Pinot Noir (Negev),,,,
"This is still a young wine, with its youthful structure of dark, stalky tannins still in place. It offers juicy black-currant flavors as well as fresh acidity and a dry aftertaste. The wine comes from a vineyard named after the 17th-century French philosopher Montesquieu. Drink from 2017.",87,Château des Fougères 2012 Clos Montesquieu  (Graves),,,,
"This Port is structured, with notes of mint and herb. It has blackberry jam flavor and a firm, solid structure, while it also shows intense youthful fruitiness. It is rich and full, showing some firm tannins. Either drink it right now, or leave it for 10 years.",88,Quevedo 2010 Quinta Vale d'Agodinho Vintage  (Port),,,,
"A very nice wine, kind of a mongrel with its array of varietals, but rich and satisfying. Braced with crisp acidity, it offers flavors of tangerines, peaches, Meyer lemons, limes, green apples and honey, with a pleasant minerality. The blend is Viognier, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Pinot Gris.",87,San Antonio 2009 Heritage Blanc White (Central Coast),,,,

"Ripe, luscious black cherries and berries are framed by whispers of bramble and tannin in this enticingly fruity, forward Syrah. A showcase of fresh, primary fruit, it's juicy and delightfully gulp-worthy. Drink now through 2017.",88,Billsboro 2013 Sawmill Creek Vineyards Syrah (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This second wine from Château Lagrézette is rich with ripe, generous fruits and tannins in the background. It has concentration, dusty texture and generous acidity. Expect this wine to be ready to drink in the next year.",90,Château Lagrézette 2009 Château Chevaliers Lagrézette Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"This blend of 60% Grenache Blanc and 40% Viognier is quite lively. Chalk, lemon-lime, cider apples and yeast show strongly on the nose. A sourdough-bread element also pops on the palate, giving intrigue to the red apple, yellow pear and ambrosia-melon flavors.",88,Kempe 2016 Bianco White (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"This overtly woody wine smells like cedar chips and fresh-cut oak and tastes like pine, menthol and cherry candy. While it's fun to pick out its different flavors, this is not what most people expect from Cabernet.",84,Predator 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),,,,
"Honey and saffron mingle with blossomy perfume in this lavish semidry Riesling. A streak of lemon-lime acidity adds zip to sweet, concentrated white peach and tangerine flavors. It's irresistibly juicy with a lingering finish.",91,Fritz Haag 2013 Brauneberger Juffer Feinherb Semi Dry Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Named for the producer's farmhouse and its surrounding vineyard, this offers rich cherry cordial and weedy sage notes—a seamless mix of fruit and earth. Sage, cardamom and spicy white pepper flavors give it intrigue and complexity, wrapped in a thick, velvety texture.",91,Blue Farm 2014 Anne Katherina Vineyard Farmhouse Estate Farmed Pinot Noir (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"This isn't sweet, but just so wonderfully rich. It's the concentration of botrytis that makes the wine. The texture is velvet, but with a spicy bite to it. Apricot, honey and marzipan all contribute to a wine that will age over decades.",97,Château d'Yquem 2005  Sauternes,,,,
"Underbrush, plum, blue flower and coffee aromas lead the nose on this concentrated blend of 50% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc. The dense, one-dimensional palate doles out blackberry, prune, licorice, grilled pepper and milk chocolate alongside velvety tannins.",89,Ceralti 2012 Alfeo  (Bolgheri Superiore),,,,
"This is well balanced, ripe and with a good link between the structure and the fragrant, perfumed red berries. The wine is full of fruit and acidity while having a core of dark tannins that will allow it to age. It will be best drunk after 2018.",90,Louis Latour 2012  Vosne-Romanée,,,,
"This is a very friendly wine that is medium bodied, has a brownish tint to the color, slightly earthy aromas, warm fruit flavors like cooked cherries and a touch of brown sugar, plus a mellow lightly tannic texture.",87,Easton 2014 Durate-Georgetown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sierra Foothills),,,,
"A rich, tight, warm wine from organic grapes. Red plum, firm tannins and a sophisticated feel give this wine both structure, dark fruits and an ageworthy character. This is a fine wine, balanced and with fine acidity.",90,Mas de Gourgonnier 2009 Red (Les Baux de Provence),,,,
"The importance of a great vintage is evident in this crianza holdover from the lauded 2001 harvest. The wine is loaded with cola, root beer, molasses and leather aromas, while the flavors of earthy cherry, plum and raspberry are subtle and upright, yet still a touch angular. Will go well with food; drink now.",88,Torrederos 2001 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"This is a dark and brooding blend of Barbera and Bonarda that veers towards tobacco, leather and tar to such a far extreme, the fruit is almost overwhelmed in the bouquet. Prune and cassis do make an appearance on the palate, and there's a ripe-fruit note on the close.",87,La Stoppa 2007 Macchiona Red (Emilia),,,,
"Dry, lightly oaked and mild on the nose, this Pinot from a cold vintage offers modest but honest plum and raspberry scents in front of a crisp, juicy, fresh palate.

"Still firm and structured, this pure Malbec wine is rich and tannic. At the same time, it has layers of ripe black fruits that are coming through strongly. The smoky, textured character of this wine comes from the wood aging that has added an extra layer. Drink from 2018.",91,Château Lamartine 2013 Prestige du Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"The name Mãe translates as “mother vine” and this wine, made from the oldest vines on the estate, delves back into the roots of winemaking by using traditional open fermenting tanks and long wood aging. It is concentrated and ripe, still full of tannins and a powerful, dry and smoky structure. Age this wine for several years and drink from 2020.",94,Quinta de Chocapalha 2012 Vinha Mãe Red (Lisboa),,,,
"Spicy scents introduce a fresh and fleshy pear-flavored Pinot Gris, with a crisp underpinning of wet stone and medium acids. Citrus peel, light orange and pineapple weave into the midpalate, and the wine fills the mouth without being heavy.",88,King Estate 2009 Signature Pinot Gris (Oregon),,,,
"This vibrant young red opens with aromas of strawberry, dark cherry and a whisper of graphite. The bright, polished palate doles out morello cherry, white pepper and a hint of licorice alongside firm but refined tannins. Drink through 2018.",89,Cantina del Pino 2013 Nebbiolo (Langhe),,,,
"The modest cherry, dark berry and black tea notes of this light wine show tell-tale orange-peel notes of decline. This feels just too thin and tired at an early age.",81,Valiano 1997  Chianti Classico,,,,
"Lime pith and tangerine notes lend an intensely zesty, racy feel to this dry, medium-bodied Riesling. The palate is lean but vivaciously fresh, with a pristine, mineral finish.",89,Domdechant Werner 2013 Hochheimer Kirchenstück Trocken Gold Cap Riesling (Rheingau),,,,
90-92 All structure and tannin over the austere black fruits. The wine at this stage is powered by its texture rather than the fruit.,91,Château Chasse-Spleen 2010 Barrel sample  (Moulis-en-Médoc),,,,
"This is an expressive rendition of Malvasia Bianca with long, mineral flavors and cheerful notes of peach, banana and apricot. You could pair this wine with Thai or Chinese dishes.",86,Tenute Rubino 2006 Giancòla Malvasia Bianca (Salento),,,,
"A perfect mixing agent for Campari or peach cocktails, this bright Prosecco delivers stone fruit, lime and honey. Or, drink it on its own with spicy chicken wings.",83,Canella NV Brut  (Prosecco),,,,
"This has memorable aromas of warm hat, green herbs and perfumed fruit candy. It is a delicious wine that has been aged in cask before bottling.",92,Kirchmayr 1992 Solist Riesling (Kamptal),,,,
"This ripe, concentrated wine has rounded tannins plus a structure that gives weight as well as richness. It comes from vines close to Morey Saint-Denis. The richness promises good aging. Drink from 2017.",91,Domaine René Bouvier 2011 Les Fuées Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),,,,
"An alluring nose of smoke, herbs and tobacco spice start this red. On the palate, the wine has a tart cherry and spice profile combined with some blackberry—a bit lean and acidic but with a good steak or grilled chop, will calm down.",84,Fox Run 2006 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),,,,
"It's a shame only the equivalent of one barrel of this wine was exported to the U.S., as it means only a handful of people here will get to experience it. It's perhaps the closest thing to great white Burgundy to come from Australia; subtly smoky at first, like grilled white peaches, adding hints of lime and vanilla on the palate. It's plump and slightly creamy in texture, but finishes with crisp, acidic verve. Drink now–2025.",94,Cullen 2013 Kevin John Chardonnay (Margaret River),,,,
"A magical blend of 73% Sauvignon Blanc with 27% Sauvignon Musque, from a landmark producer of the variety, this is a complex and elegant expression of lushly layered peach and mandarin orange, balanced and structured for years to come. From vineyards both within Napa Valley and throughout Sonoma, including Knights Valley and Sonoma Mountain, it's eminently sippable and a fine wine for the table.",94,Spottswoode 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa-Sonoma),,,,
"This young wine is finding its way, tight and grippy still, with a strong sense of oak and tannin. Leathery and savory, with a suggestion of the rustic, it offers a crispness of black cherry and plum on the finish. Drink now after a slight decanting.",90,Siduri 2013 Bucher Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This wine has the dark fruit typical of this quinta, but this year shows more elegance than usual, with dusty tannins and concentrated, sweet fruit.",90,Quinta do Vesuvio 1998 Port (Douro),,,,
Red fruit and citrus notes show through tight acidity on this slightly bitter wine touched with sulfur aromas. It's dry and sharp in style. Screwcap.,83,Hermann Moser 2012 Rosi Mosi Red (Niederösterreich),,,,
"This wine comes from this vineyard's original Cabernet blocks planted in 1980. Wound-up aromas of woodspice, herb, pencil lead and dark fruit are followed by concentrated but still supple black-fruit flavors. It's high up on the hedonistic scale, accentuated by a lengthy finish. Decant to let it open up.",92,Seven Hills 2014 Seven Hills Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"The nose of this light-footed Riesling is demure, showing whiffs of lemon and crushed stone. Yet on the palate, preserved rose petal and cherry blossom notes seem to explode, mingling into crisp grapefruit and honeydew flavors. Effusive yet elegant, it's a stunning dry Riesling with dramatic build and complexity.",93,Domdechant Werner 2012 Hochheimer Kirchenstück Trocken GG Erste Lage Riesling (Rheingau),,,,
"This has all the touchstones of good Chardonnay: just enough body and richness, apple, pineapple and melon fruit flavors and a crisp, citrusy finish. Solid Chardonnay for under $10.",87,Henry's Drive Vignerons 2009 Morse Code Chardonnay (Padthaway),,,,
"Pungent, sweaty aromas include match stick and green citrus. Flavors of citrus, melon and green apple mark the palate and finish pithy and bitter, with strong pyrazines.",84,Morandé 2014 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"Acidity and dryness mark this reserve-style Pinot. The severity is relieved by California-rich cherries and red currants, as well as sweet, smoky oak notes. With a fine, silky texture, it's ready to drink now.",89,MacMurray Ranch 2011 Winemaker's Block Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"In general O. Fournier gets it right, be it in Spain or Argentina. But this Ribera del Duero struggles from the outset. It's rubbery, damp and lacks clarity of fruit. And the feel is sharp and lemony, seemingly a combo of excessive oak and raw fruit. Imported by Fine Wines from Spain.",80,O. Fournier 2002 Spiga  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"Starts off with slightly confected yet delicious aromas of cherries, almond paste and vanilla, but turns slightly more savory on the palate, where it picks up some herbal shadings. This is relatively light in body, with a crisp structure that suggests it may last longer than most Marlborough Pinots; drink now–2017.",88,Churton 2007 Pinot Noir (Marlborough),,,,
"A lovely wine, unique and distinctive. Has the rich creaminess and citrus and tropical fruit flavors of an upscale Chardonnay, but with a nutty, exotic sweetness, like roasted cashews. Very fine, soft and opulent wine.",91,Arrowood 2008 Reserve Speciale Chardonnay (Sonoma County),,,,
"This is a big, fat, almost sweet-tasting Cabernet Sauvignon, with ripe fruit framed by lavish French oak redolent of cedar, vanilla and toasted coconut. Cassis and tobacco flavors wear the oak well, with berry-cherry flavors coming through on the finish. A good choice for steak, and it won't break the bank.",90,Tapestry 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale),,,,
"Dusty, clammy, white fruit aromas are generic. This is pulpy in feel with a vague focus. Leesy, pithy citrus flavors are standard and short on personality, while this finishes adequately with a mild citric lift.",87,La Val 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"Black licorice, raisiny fruit and a little sweaty oak are the name of the game here. Acidity on the palate is searing and tannins are soft, not giving quite enough support. The fruit is on the sour side and the oak a little bitter.",87,Moorooroo 2015 3 Sisters & A Brother Shiraz (Barossa Valley),,,,
"This is really lean and tightly focused, seemingly built for aging—or for drinking young with raw oysters. Complex aromas of damp moss and petrichor give way to simpler flavors of mixed citrus that finish long and tart. Drink now–2025.",90,Frankland Estate 2013 Isolation Ridge Vineyard Riesling (Frankland River),,,,
"Riesling has always been a strength of this winery, and this wine clearly shows why. It has a lightness and delicacy missing from most other domestic Riesling, yet it is not simple. Its complex, subtle, food-friendly flavors are right on the money. Best Buy. —P.G.",88,Ste. Chapelle 2001 Dry Riesling (Idaho),,,,
"Here's a beautifully aged Amarone from an excellent vintage. Masi's Mazzano is a benchmark wine for Valpolicella thanks to its intriguing complexity of aromas: black cherry, dried fruit, porcini mushroom, dark chocolate, vanilla bean and dark resin like the kind you'd smell in an antique furniture shop. The wine has a slightly brownish hue and remarkable penetration.",94,Masi 2001 Mazzano  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),,,,
"Made from Elerding Vineyard fruit, this wine is aged in 100% new oak for 24 months. It's dark and concentrated, and it deals attention-grabbing barrel-derived flavors of dark chocolate, licorice and espresso. The black cherry flavor has the grip and power to handle the barrel influence, but the wine will profit from additional bottle age.",88,Seven Bridges 2009 Elerding Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Black cherry, dark pomegranate and sagebrush show on the nose of this decently priced bottling for midweek sipping. Ripe cranberry dominates the palate along with allspice, nutmeg and oak components, set against an intriguing texture.",87,The Archivist 2014 Pinot Noir (Monterey County),,,,
"This Merlot requires some extended breathing time before opening up. The fruit sources include Cold Creek, Canoe Ridge and the Wahluke Slope, bringing lush cherry/berry fruit to the fore, ripened to a level just below jammy. The tannins carry a hint of green, turning a little rough in the finish.",88,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2006 Ethos Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Seductive and complex, the inviting aromas mix incense, blueberries, cassis, licorice and threads of herb and graphite. Flavors are wrapped tightly and unfold gracefully through a long finish. The herbal side of Cabernet is noted without being intrusive. Classic, deep and expressive.",95,Betz Family 2008 Père de Famille Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Earthy plum and blackberry aromas are crisp and raw, with overt wood grain riding heavily on the bouquet. This is 60% Merlot and 40% Malbec; it feels grabby, while toasty, heavily oaked flavors of clove and bitter chocolate smother the wine's fruit before turning charred and roasted on the finish.",85,Intipalka 2012 Valle del Sol Reserva Malbec-Merlot (Ica),,,,
"One of Italy's truly great 100% Merlots, this wine opens with aromas of plum, black currants and exotic spices. The opulent, smooth palate delivers blackberry, white pepper and a note of creamy milk chocolate alongside firm, velvety tannins. Soft and round, it's delicious now, but it will also develop for a decade or more. Drink 2016–2026.",94,Tua Rita 2011 Redigaffi Merlot (Toscana),,,,
"A zippy blend of bright lemon and herb flavors that presage a powerful mix of Mandarin orange, grapefruit, peach, melon, spice, clove, apricot and honeyed notes. Ultralong on the finish",93,Williams Selyem 2000 Windsor Oaks Vineyard Late Harvest Muscat Canelli (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Alluring aromas of tobacco, forest floor, smoking incense and chocolate are well defined. Supportive tannins frame its soft core, while conspicuous acids ramp up the earthy flavors. It finishes long, with a lingering note of dark stone fruit.",85,Mount Pleasant Winery 2008 Bethlehem Valley Norton (Missouri),,,,
"De Villiers is one of Calera's newest vineyards, and whether it's a warmer site or simply comprised of showier clones, it's forward in raspberry and cherry jam flavors, with lots of sweet, caramelized oak. The finish is long and sweet in fruit, and the alcohol is well below 14% by volume.",89,Calera 2010 de Villiers Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan),,,,
"Made entirely with Ciliegiolo, this opens with aromas of red berry, violet and allspice, while the approachable palate doles out morello cherry, raspberry and baking spice. Supple tannins and fresh acidity provide balance. Drink soon to enjoy the juicy fruit flavors.",88,Sator 2015 Sileno Red (Toscana),,,,
"A hint of deli meat marks the bouquet of this wine, before smoke, leather and blackberry characterize the palate, the texture soft yet tannic. The finish takes a heartier tone, as the tannins slightly pucker and stick around.",86,Wattle Creek 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"This is a fairly ordinary Merlot. It's dry and pleasantly oaked, with some modest cherry and spice flavors. Yet it's a bit off in texture, with jagged tannins.",86,Robert Mondavi 2009 Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"This is a ripe, generous wine. The structure typical of Touriga Nacional is submerged in the perfumed blackberry and ripe plum flavors. It's a big wine, with tannins softly cushioned in the rich fruitiness. Drink from 2018.",88,Adega Cooperativa do Cartaxo 2015 Bridão Colheita Seleccionada Touriga Nacional (Tejo),,,,
"This is a focused, riveting expression of Red Mountain Syrah from a great vineyard. It's packed with juicy flavors of fresh raspberries, tinged with tangerine-flavored acids. Elegant and fascinating, it's a pure, fruit-driven expression of the grape, bolstered by the natural minerality of Ciel du Cheval fruit.",95,Syncline 2011 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Syrah (Red Mountain),,,,
"A blend of typical Gascon grapes gives a lemon and citrus wine, very fresh, tangy. There is plenty of acidity and an attractive lightness. Screwcap.",85,Lionel Osmin & Cie 2009 Villa Beaurivage White (Vin de France),,,,
"Wiry plum and oaky aromas are powerful. This is fresh, racy and medium-bodied, with dry spice, vanilla, plum and cherry flavors. Peppery spice notes, dry oak and red-fruit ending flavors make for a straight-ahead, modest finish.",87,Casa Primicia 2008  Rioja,,,,
"With 12 months oak of aging, this is a rich wine, still showing spice and toast from the wood. That character is finely balanced by the rich black fruit and the acidity. It is a fine wine, ripe and still developing. Drink from 2018.",91,Quinta de São Sebastião 2013 Lima Mayer Red (Alentejano),,,,
"This feisty, fragrant blend unites the citrus zestiness of Riesling and the herbal savor of Grüner Veltliner. The palate is light and bright but gently spiced, with Grüner's toothsome texture. Fresh, easy-drinking and ideal for summer.",89,Tinhof 2016 Blanc White (Burgenland),,,,
This Valpolicella shows a nice level of heft and density with ripe cherry and blueberry aromas. There's a slight tannic touch here and enough natural acidity to pair with cream cheese and chives on crackers.,84,Pietro Clementi 2005  Valpolicella Classico Superiore,,,,
"This is a gigantic Cabernet, deeply concentrated and enormously tannic and dry. Waves of black currants, blueberries, violets and sweet toasted oak are wrapped into a firm astringency. This needs plenty of time; hold until 2017, at least.",92,W.H. Smith 2009 Purple Label Piedra Hill Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),,,,
"Good fruit from the Riverbend vineyard brings earthy complexity to the wine. Sappy boysenberry fruit, soaked in barrel flavors of Kahlua and cinnamon, shows just a bit of alcoholic heat heading into the finish.",87,Hard Row To Hoe 2007 Shameless Hussy Syrah (Wahluke Slope),,,,
"This linear blend of Sangiovese and 15% Colorino, Canaiolo and Mammolo opens with a subtle fragrance of violet, red berry and licorice. The focused palate offers dried plum, ripe black cherry, leather and grilled herb alongside fine-grained tannins.",89,Boscarelli 2012  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,,,,
"Though labeled merlot, this is truly a Bordeaux-style blend with Cabernet Sauvignon (6%), Malbec (5%), and Petit Verdot (2%) added to the mix. It is reserved in style with notes of cherry, dried herbs and pickling spices backed by firm, dry tannins.",87,Abacela 2009 Merlot (Southern Oregon),,,,
"Pazo Señorans generally makes great wine, but this aged Albariño is past its prime. The nose is soft and smells mostly of toffee and vanilla, while the wine has a maderized tint and stalky, geriatric flavors of bland apple and oxidized citrus. This wine should have been drunk five years ago.",82,Pazo de Señorans 2005 Selección de Añada Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"This is citrusy and also a bit tropical on the bouquet, and together the aromatic mix is appealing. A fresh mouthfeel is a bonus, and standard Torrontés flavors of melon, lychee and banana finish with balance and bright acidity. This hails from La Rioja, and it captures most of what's good about the variety.",88,Recuerdo 2012 Torrontés (La Rioja),,,,
"This is a stunning Pinot Noir, especially from a Syrah-focused winery. Beautiful aromas of lavender, thyme, wild mint and dewy spring sage meet with crushed graphite and fresh raspberries on the nose. The palate coalesces those elements expertly, with red cherry and strawberry syrup dusted by herbs and finished by licorice, all presented on a soft yet engaging texture.",95,Zaca Mesa 2015 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"Lush and decadent, with intensely sweet notes of demarara syrup, peach and citrus, yet there's enough acidity to bring you back for another sip, and another. The sugar clings to the palate for a long time on the finish. Drink now–2030.",93,S.A. Prüm 2009 Graacher Himmelreich Vat 69 Eiswein Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Attractive, just off-dry wine, very fresh, packed with apples, tangy citrus and a lively prickle on the tongue.",85,Adega Cooperativa Ponte de Lima 2010 Adamado White (Vinho Verde),,,,
"Crisp and refreshing, this opens with scents recalling citrus, cranberry and aromatic herb. The vibrant palate delivers fresh strawberry, sour cherry, nectarine and a note of white pepper alongside racy acidity a vivacious but refined perlage.",89,Germano Ettore 2014 Rosanna Brut Rosé Metodo Classico Nebbiolo (Vino Spumante),,,,
"This offers great value for the quality, a mix of salty brine, stone and caramel apple that delves into more voluptuous dabs of pineapple. Light-bodied and food-friendly, it shows focused acidity and restrained oak.",90,Simi 2015 Chardonnay (Sonoma County),,,,
"In the crowd-pleasing style that is the hallmark of the brand, this good value bottling shows bold vanilla and coconut aromas overlaying strawberry and cherry fruit. Raspberry coulis dominates the palate which offers just the faintest tannic grip. For near-term consumption.",86,Yellow Tail 2006 The Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (South Eastern Australia),,,,
"Leathery on the tongue, this lovely Merlot, with 7% Cabernet Sauvignon blended in, offers inviting notes of plum and cherry, completely juicy, around firm, strong tannins and balanced acidity. From two separate, rocky blocks on the winery property, this wine is concentrated and smooth. Enjoy through 2021–2025.",93,Pride Mountain 2011 Merlot (Napa County-Sonoma County),,,,
"A very herbaceous, aromatic wine. The acidity cuts through the grapefruit flavor, giving a touch of minerality at the end.",88,Domaine des Levrys 2012  Sancerre,,,,
"Light aromas of flowers, dried herbs and barrel spices lead to velvety cherry and chocolate flavors that have a fine sense of presence, but could use a bit more tannic structure to stitch them together.",89,Revelry 2012 Block 13 Clone 2 Weinbau Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope),,,,
"This blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Merlot, 19% Cab Franc and 10% Petit Verdot is sourced from the Hedges, Stillwater, and Conner Lee vineyards. At first soft and smooth, it morphs into a textural wine with a mouthful of purple and black fruits—from blackberry on through cassis. Streaks of smoke, graphite and espresso highlight the finish.",90,Elevation Cellars 2011 Jammin' Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This blend remains severely tannic, but it's also very ripe, with flavors of baked cherries, blackberries and prunes. It's a big, deep, dark, brooding wine that's probably at its best now.",87,Star Lane Vineyard 2007 Estate Red (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),,,,
"This nonvintage rosé, modeled after a Bandol, is a blend of grapes and vintages, yet retains superb freshness and offers unusual complexity. Rich and tart, with a creamy strawberry core, it also shows sandalwood highlights and a hint of barrel toast.",91,Domaine Serene NV R Dry Rosé (Oregon),,,,
"Dilute melony aromas are slightly spoiled. This feels bland and unfocused. Modest white-fruit flavors are short and mildly bitter, while almond skin is the key flavor on a struggling finish.",83,Larchago 2016 Viura (Rioja),,,,
"Unctuous and bold with toasted oak flavor, this wine shines with layers of ripe, round pineapple and pear flavor.",86,Folie à Deux 2015 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"With minty wood flavors, this wine is smooth and polished. It offers berry fruits from the blend of 10 varieties in this old-vine vineyard. With spice and some firm tannins in the background, it is ready to drink.",90,Wines & Winemakers 2014 Aguia Moura em Vinhas Velhas Reserva Red (Douro),,,,
"This Barbera's black cherry, blackberry and clove aromas segue to its simple palate. Supple tannins and brisk acidity lend support. Drink through 2019.",87,Vinchio-Vaglio Serra 2015 I Tre Vescovi  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore),,,,
"Normal berry and cherry aromas are composed and lead to a narrow, tight palate with medicinal plum and berry flavors. Bounces along nicely to the finish, which is short and regular in feel. This is all fruit and cheer; no oak and not complicated.",85,Sierra de Viento 2009 Tempranillo (Cariñena),,,,
"The price on this high-end Chilean Shiraz keeps climbing, but on the plus side so does the quality. This is the best La Cumbre Errazuriz has made; it's sweet on the nose, with marzipan, earth, sautéed mushroom and big black-fruit aromas. The palate is round and rewarding, with huge blackberry and raspberry flavors. Deep, leathery, meaty and impressive. Drink now through 2011.",91,Errazuriz 2006 La Cumbre Shiraz (Aconcagua Valley),,,,
"This light-weight, easygoing wine offers subtle notes of red cherry, plum and currant on the nose and mouth. A hint of fresh mint adds a touch of interest to the nose. Drink now.",84,Château de Jonquieres 2015 Cuvée Cersius Rosé (Languedoc),,,,
"This wine's a steal for the price, a no-oak white that's stony, tropical, ripe and simple. It'll serve well at larger gatherings or anytime with friends sitting on the porch or picnic blanket, staying balanced and refreshing in the glass.",86,Pedroncelli 2014 East Side Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"This blend of Merlot and Mourvèdre melds fruit from the Kestrel View and Olsen Vineyards. Bursting with mixed plum and cherry flavors, it's accented by a spice note and a streak of nougat.",90,Kestrel 2009 Tribute Red Red (Yakima Valley),,,,
"You'll love the density and richness of this dark, velvety Ripasso. Bright aromas include mature berry, moist earth, tobacco and ground white pepper. It's a smooth, enduring drink with soft tannins and texture.",88,CampoReale 2007  Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso,,,,
"Pretty orange blossom notes morph into zesty white grapefruit and lime in this exceptionally light off-dry Riesling. It's delicately concentrated on the palate but offers loads of invigorating, waterfall-like refreshment.",89,Silver Thread 2015 Doyle Fournier Vineyard Riesling (Seneca Lake),,,,
"Situated at the highest point of the Entre-deux-Mers region, the estate is dominated by the ripe Merlot in this wine. It is fruity and soft with lively acidity and gentle tannins. There is a touch of wood from the aging, although the fruitiness is what this wine is about. Drink from 2017.",86,Château Saint-Florin 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot  (Bordeaux),,,,
"Prunar is a deep and sophisticated Pinot Bianco (aged 50-50 in large oak casks and stainless steel) that excels in terms of mouthfeel. It delivers a long, creamy finish accented by tones of apricot, pear and grapefruit.",88,Erste Neue 2010 Prunar Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige),,,,
"Bold, aggressive aromas of shoe polish, grainy oak, campfire and heat lead to a grabby, wide palate with sweet flavors of candied fruit and marshmallow. There's a lot of superficiality here, particular oak, but there's also legitimate Malbec fruit and character that make it worthwhile.",85,Doña Paula 2008 Estate Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Light-bodied and lithe, this is not as fruity or flashy as many of its brethren from this vintage. Instead, it offers mineral complexity only slightly buffered by notes of ripe apples and stone fruit, and a long, citrusy finish. Give it some time in the cellar, where it should blossom in another 5–7 years.",90,Joh. Jos. Prüm 2009 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Shows young vine jamminess, with fresh, ripe raspberry, cherry and cola flavors. The Williams Selyem balance of acids and tannins of dry elegance is evident, as is the new oak. Complex and supple, this wine needs time in the bottle to show its best. Give it until 2008, and should drink well for years beyond.",92,Williams Selyem 2005 Bucher Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Lemon zest tempered by juicy, crunchy apple is the central theme here. This is fresh Riesling not from rock but from deeper loess soils: its usual verve is slightly more cushioned here and will make the most charming, soft intro for those learning to love Riesling. Purity and poise are a given and the aromatics will round even more with every month in bottle.",90,Leth 2015 Felser Weinberge Riesling (Wagram),,,,
"Rich already, this wine is darkly tannic and powered by solid tannins. The weight of fruit behind the tannins also brings out acidity and black currant flavors. It will remain dry but well structured and with good fruitiness. Drink from 2017.",87,Château Reysson 2011  Haut-Médoc,,,,
"This Cab has the fruity concentration of its famous mountain origin, and is explosive in blackberries, blueberries and currants, along with plenty of caramelized oak. It's also quite tannic, which gives it a jaw-breaking astringency. Interestingly, it's already throwing some sediment. The long-term prospects are unclear, but it should have no trouble negotiating the next six years.",88,Lazy Susan Ranch 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),,,,
"A lanolin note hits the nose first, followed by yellow pear, pineapple and subtle legume tones. The medium-bodied palate of this Viognier-Marsanne-Roussanne blend bears waxy, concentrated apple and pear sauce notes, which are lifted by bright acids.",86,Page Springs 2009 La Serrana White (Cochise County),,,,
"Based in Burgundy, Tramier should know something about Chardonnay. This wine has some structure that tastes of cool vineyards. It is crisp, with refreshing white fruit and green-plum flavors, and is ready to drink.",87,L. Tramier & Fils 2015 Romantic Chardonnay (Vin de France),,,,
"Sizzling acidity enlivens the succulent, juicy fruit in this lush expression of the appellation. Made from grapes sourced in the Olivet Lane area, it builds in exotic spiciness, with forest, herb, earth and tea accents that grace the foundation of strawberry and blackberry flavors.",93,La Crema 2015 Fog Veil Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Richness in the texture and a buttery vanilla-like flavor make this wine easy to dive into. It has lots of ripe apple, peach and white cherry flavor and an energetic complexity due to those pastry spices, plus a lingering, creamy finish.",90,Lichen Estate 2013 Blanc de Gris Pinot Gris (Anderson Valley),,,,
"This begins with a light red-fruit aroma that falls into the cherry-berry vein. It feels bouncy, rubbery and pleasant, with roasted, rubbery berry and savory spice flavors. The finish is light on fruit but good in feel.",86,Castillo de Jumilla 2010 Monastrell (Jumilla),,,,
"Dark berry, underbrush and tobacco aromas lead the nose of this vibrant, structured wine while the palate doles out black cherry, fresh raspberry, licorice and clove. Fresh acidity and supple tannins balance the juicy flavors. Drink through 2018.",92,Felsina 2013 Berardenga  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"This vibrant white features delicate but enticing aromas of black locust flower, jasmine and stone fruit. The round, bright palate offers creamy peach, crisp apple and juicy nectarine alongside firm acidity. It closes on a mineral note.",92,Ottella 2012 Molceo  (Lugana),,,,
"This wine delivers creamy, divine deliciousness from some of the vineyard's oldest vines. It's voluptuous and nutty, layered with preserved lemon, brioche, quince and kumquat flavors. A touch of green olive savoriness dances on the finish, framed by fresh acidity.",95,Arista 2014 Ritchie Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"A year older than the Riboli family's higher-end San Simeon brand, this bargain bottling is a steal for the oft-ridiculed vintage. Dense elderberry fruit, smoked cedar and dried oregano show on the nose, while the palate is complex and herbacesously Bordelaise in style, with oregano, thyme and dill giving nuance to tart blueberries and black plum fruit.",88,Maddalena 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"A totally refreshing blend of citrus, apple, peach and pear flavors, all couched in bright textured acidity. The wine makes a fine aperitif as well as a mealtime beverage. Off dry, but hardly sweet, it's crisp and fresh to the end.",87,Handley 2002 Riesling (Mendocino),,,,
"Yellow grapefruit peel, crushed white peppercorns and fresh chervil paint a picture of a quintessential Grüner here: flavorsome but not heavy, concentrated but slender, easy to enjoy but never facile. More ripe pear fruit lurks temptingly at the core while that grapefruit theme is utterly convincing and captivating.",92,Gruber Röschitz 2015 Hundspoint Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel),,,,
"Earthy, dried-fruit aromas are dessicated, while oaky scents of vanilla and licorice offer complexity. This Garnacha-led blend feels jammy in structure; flavors of plum and raspberry come with herbal notes, while the finish is tangy due to pointed acidity, with strawberry flavors in support.",88,Palacios Remondo 2010 Propiedad  (Rioja),,,,
"Sourced from excellent Yakima Valley sites, fermented in stainless steel, and ripened perfectly to 13.5% alcohol, this juicy, fresh, fruit-laden wine captures the ideal mix of snappy citrus and luscious stone fruits. Delicious.",89,Waterbrook 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Drink this effusively scented, supple wine over the next few years for its bold notes of garrigue and buoyant berry flavors. It's almost creamy in texture, with a reasonably long finish for the modest tariff.",89,Louis Bernard 2012 Domaine le Garrigon Cuvée des Vieux Truffiers Red (Côtes du Rhône),,,,
"Fresh and fragrant like a thicket of raspberries on a summer day, this is a luxuriously fruity, yet impeccably balanced Pinot Noir. The palate is deeply concentrated with cassis and red berry flavors, along with streaks of cranberry acidity and granite that lend elegance and style. Layers of soft, finely grained tannins characterize the long finish.",90,Bloomer Creek 2010 Unfined & Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Loads of black fruit intensity is backed by soft notes of chocolate, leather and spice. The wine boasts a very plump and round style that makes it a pleasure to savor.",90,Querciavalle 2007 Armonia Famiglia Losi Sangiovese (Colli della Toscana Centrale),,,,
"Most of the local grapes seem to have been blended into this smooth wine. It is soft, generous and fruity with ripe tannins contrasting with the stalky black fruits. The wine should age another few months, so drink from 2018.",87,Château Clément Termes 2015 Red (Gaillac),,,,
"A clean, everyday Zinfandel, this shows the varietal's full body, tannins and spiciness. The flavors are of raspberries, cherries, cola, olives and pepper.",83,Four Vines 2010 Truant Zinfandel (California),,,,
"It's hard to break through this syrupy late-harvest wine's heavy hand. Intense, tannic and full-bodied, it's made in a semidry style.",85,Sorelle Winery 2012 Late-Harvest Piccolo Primitivo (Lodi),,,,
"Made with 100% Chardonnay, this creamy sparkler opens with aromas of hawthorn, peach and a whiff of bread crust. The palate reveals candied nectarine zest and golden apple alongside a soft perlage. It ends on a note of white almond.",89,Lantieri de Paratico NV Saten Chardonnay (Franciacorta),,,,
"This is a rich style of rosé with caramel as well as red-fruit flavors. It has enough acidity to carry its ripe character, giving the wine a fresh, crisp aftertaste. Drink now.",87,Château Routas 2015 Rosé (Coteaux Varois en Provence),,,,
"This is a Zweigelt with an identity crisis that thinks it may be Pinot Noir. It's elegant and silky, with a gentle tannic touch, refreshing acidity and restrained but evocative redcurrant and cranberry fruit. Overtones of peony and iris make this more intriguing, while there is substance despite its light body. This is delicious now, but will reward cellaring for one to two years to let earthy, tertiary flavors develop. Drink from 2014.",92,Schloss Gobelsburg 2011 Haide Zweigelt (Niederösterreich),,,,
"Despite the excessively hot vintage, this is a compelling riserva from one of La Morra's top vineyards, crafted by a master Barolo maker. The fragrance shows ripe plum and floral notes, while the palate delivers ripe black fruit laced with cinnamon and Alpine herbs. With its lovely depth and balance, this is almost ready now.",94,Paolo Scavino 2007 Rocche dell'Annunziata Riserva  (Barolo),,,,
"This is a rich wine with the wood aging giving extra complexity and structure. It has cherry, plum and spice flavors, a dark sense that comes from the texture and the minerality. Drink this solid wine from 2014.",91,Domaine de la Bonne Tonne 2011 Côte du Py  (Morgon),,,,
"Dry, lean and sawdusted on the nose, with vanilla aromas blending with simple plum and berry notes. Whole on the palate, with a creamy, mildly tacky feel, while the flavors of red fruits are regular at best and smothered with butter and wood resin. Solid enough but probably too woody given the wine's weight and overall quality.",85,Aresti 2006 Reserva Merlot (Curicó Valley),,,,
"The oak is primary at present, with aromas of vanilla and cocoa out in front of herbs, plum and cherry. Palate-coating dark fruit flavors are full bodied and sweet, supported by dry tannins.",89,Golden Ridge 2012 Estate Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Pale for a rosé, with a slight pink color. It's an enormously fragrant wine, brimming with peach, strawberry, smoke and vanilla notes. Lively and fresh in the mouth, with a creamy feel and the merest suggestion of strawberries. Finishes dry and elegant.",90,Roederer Estate NV Brut Rosé  (Anderson Valley),,,,
"Winemaker Matt Dicey has teased out Pinot Noir's silky texture and ample complexity in this wine, one of his finest to date. Cherry fruit hints at rose petals and picks up subtle earth and spice shadings on the palate, finishing with elegance and class. Drink now–2012, although its balance may permit it to hold for several more years after that.",90,Mt. Difficulty 2007 Pinot Noir (Central Otago),,,,
"Aggressive black-fruit aromas come with earthy, spicy notes that include licorice root. This feels tight, linear and a bit sharp. Flavors of plum, berry, pepper and toast set up a finish that's oaky, spicy and acidic.",87,Fernández Gómez 2012 Crianza  (Rioja),,,,
"Bright, forward fruit and spice characterize this very rich, complex wine. The aromas veer toward banana and ripe peach and pear, with oriental spices, vanilla, and toast. In the mouth, the flavors are fruity, with a leesy streak. High acidity makes it a little sharp, while the texture is creamy. All in all, it's very balanced, except for that sharpness, which a year or two of aging should mellow.",89,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 1998 Beckstoffer Ranch Chardonnay (Napa Valley),,,,
"The unique nose on this wine—which is comprised of cherry, chocolate and warm spice aromas—is followed on the palate by a delicate wave of cherry, raspberry and vanilla. It's balanced, but has a sweet touch.",87,Lyrarakis 2011 Idyll Rosé (Crete),,,,
"Made from Chardonnay, this is a dry sparkling wine, pert in acidity, with rich flavors of yeast and citrus fruits. It's a bit scoury in the mouth, with edgy bubbles. Drink now.",87,Goat Bubbles 2010 Sierra Madre Vineyard Blanc de Blancs Sparkling (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"If the name of this wine suggests that it's comforting to drink now, it's perfectly apt. Although it hails from Oakville, whose Cabernets are among the most ageable in Napa Valley, this shows an accessibility that makes the black currant and cedar flavors immediately appealing.",91,Meyer Family Cellars 2009 Fluffy Billows Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),,,,
"Red berry, baking spice and leather aromas meld together along with a whiff of aromatic herb. The already accessible palate offers dried cherry, tobacco, smoke and a salty note of cured meat framed in seasoned tannins. Drink through 2021.",90,Marchesato degli Aleramici 2011 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"A straightforward, easy drinker, this wine starts out a bit reductive before opening to show aromas of herbs, tire rubber, woodspice and blue fruit. It's medium bodied in style with a touch of sugar pulling it all together.",85,StoneCap 2013 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Very ripe, juicy yellow Comice pear seems to drip from this lip-smacking, charming wine. At the core a vein of wonderful, lively acidity gives acidity and lots of drive. For now this concentrated wine shows zesty fruit but it also has stores of minerality.",94,Salomon-Undhof 2013 Pfaffenberg Reserve Riesling (Kremstal),,,,
"This is a rich, ripe and tropical white, with a mix of sweetness and salinity that plays well off each other. It becomes simple on the finish.",86,Rock Wall 2014 Chardonnay (Knights Valley),,,,
"This is a densely textured wine, full of flavors of lemon zest and green apples. The intense fruitiness lights the palate with a crisp feel as well as final, tight acidity.",90,Rijckaert 2011 En Paradis Chardonnay (Arbois),,,,
"The palest pink grey in color, it is ripe and caramel flavored. Sweet red fruits give a soft texture, full-bodied and rounded. The aftertaste is all fruit.",87,Château de Berne 2013 Romance Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"This blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon opens with aromas of blueberry and black plum accented with vanilla and coffee notes. Still tight, the palate offers up a core of rich black cherry accented with espresso, oak, vanilla and licorice alongside astringent, drying tannins. Give this a few years to unwind and fully develop.",88,Fattoria San Felo 2010 Dicioccatore  (Morellino di Scansano),,,,
"Notes of honeysuckle, white peach and fresh green herb are intensely aromatic. This off-dry effort balances zippy, lemon-lime acidity with layers of ripe, rich fruit. It's lushly textured, yet it finishes delicately with a bristle of white-tea astringency.",88,Belhurst 2011 Semi-Dry Riesling (Seneca Lake),,,,
"This is a light but classy take on Oregon Pinot, with leaf and herb in front of spicy cranberry and sour cherry fruit. The balance is fine-tuned and the wine carries the elegance of the grape through a persistent finish.",88,I'M 2005 Oregon Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Not sure what's going on at StoneCap, but after a couple of outstanding Merlot vintages, it seems to have lost its way in 2011. Spritzy, bitter and herbal, there's a big splash of vanilla, as if intended to cover the vegetal flavors of unripe grapes.",82,StoneCap 2011 Estate Grown Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Aromas of apricot and white spring flower lift out of the glass. The apricot note follows through to the palate, along with yellow peach, honeydew melon and almond, all framed in bright acidity. This one closes on a flinty note.",89,Tenuta La Marchesa 2015 Gold Label  (Gavi),,,,
"The wood, with its heavy toast and licorice flavors, is dominant. That element makes for a wine that has weight but loses its fruit amid the firm extraction.",87,Château Fombrauge 2009  Saint-Émilion,,,,
"Right out of the chute this has sappy, delicious black cherry fruit, accented with scents of tobacco and graphite. Streaks of ash and more juicy berries fill the middle, as it unfolds into a taut, sculpted finish. A classical style from a vintage that favors it; accessible, yet built for cellaring.",93,Seven Hills 2008 Seven Hills Vineyard Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Quite deep and brooding on the nose, this blend of Syrah, Cabernet Franc and Merlot shows mocha, blood, blueberry, smoke, loam and gingerbread on the nose. The showy, ripe purple fruit is restrained by a lava-rock minerality, oregano herbals and cedar tannins that give a grippy texture.",91,Brave & Maiden 2012 Union Red (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Attractive, best-selling Crémant d'Alsace, with its crisp apple and almond flavors to go with the acidity. It is lively, well-balanced, a great value in sparkling wines.",88,Wolfberger NV Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),,,,
"Rich, full bodied and smooth, this wine is driven by its black fruits and dark tannins. Acidity lines the fruitiness, which gives a juicy edge to the solid texture. It shows potential, so keep it for at least four years.",89,Campolargo 2009 Valdazar Red (Bairrada),,,,
"This is intensely rich, with very concentrated ripe fruit. Apple and peach flavors are cut by acidity. A note of pepper details the finish. Age for 3–4 years.",93,Forstreiter 2010 Tabor Reserve Die Räritat Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),,,,
"From vines planted in 1959 on old rootstock, this is an intensely concentrated wine, dense and meaty, with flavors of bouillon, cedar, leather and clove. Lengthy and complex, it offers structure and balance within ripe black fruit seasoned by peppercorn.",92,Grgich Hills 2012 Old Vine Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville),,,,
"This is a smooth and soft wine with attractive white-fruit aromas and bold acidity. It's finely textured with juicy, fresh apple and pear flavors. It is ready to drink now, but will age over the medium term.",87,Château Philippe-le-Hardi 2011  Mercurey,,,,
"Fruity with enough tannins to give support, this ripe wine has filled out well. Black currant and spice from wood dominate, leaving juicy acidity as the attractive aftertaste. François Bouquier bought this property in 1939. Grandson François now runs the property: 60% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc on 40 acres.",87,Domaine de Grandmaison 2013  Pessac-Léognan,,,,
"Shows that distinctive Edna Valley acidity and pure, laser-like Meyer lemon and lime fruit, while new oak and considerable sur lie aging adds richer notes of cream and yeast. Drink now for its vibrant youthfulness.",88,Talley 2006 Chardonnay (Edna Valley),,,,
"Cocoa powder is met by overfilling notions of wild blackberry and black cherry in this memorably textured and complex wine from the mountain. A smoothness on the midpalate roughs out the rockiness of the back tannins and fistfuls of supportive oak, finishing in a high-toned minerality that echoes volcanic soils and gravel.",94,Pine Ridge 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),,,,
"The red-juice grape Alicante Bouschet gives a fine performance here. It has produced a firm, structured wine with fine tannins as well as generous black fruit. It comes from a hot year in the region, producing great ripe, sweet fruit as well as intense acidity. The wine is just now ready to drink and will still mature further, at least until 2022.",93,Herdade da Comporta 2010 Comporta Alicante Bouschet (Península de Setúbal),,,,
"True to past vintages, this is a peppery Syrah from a cooler site, putting the accent on very tart and tight fruit flavors of wild berries and aromatic herbs. It's well balanced and the tannins are reasonably ripe, with good grip.",87,Chatter Creek 2006 Lonesome Spring Ranch Syrah (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Light and muted, with sharp, leafy and herbal flavors. It seems to be drying out, leaving an impression of mushrooms rather than fruit. Drink now.",87,Chateau Rollat 2010 Edouard de Rollat Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Underbrush, toast and prune aromas lead the way. The lean, evolved palate offers raisin, dried blackcurrant, sage and anise but the fruit richness has dried out.",86,Feudo Disisa 2011 Vuaria Nero d'Avola (Monreale),,,,
"A blend of Vignoles and Vidal Blanc, this wine is mildly aromatic, with white peach, apple and orange tones. Light bodied and semisweet in style, the palate brings juicy red apple and pear into the mix, balanced by a tropical-citrus twang.",86,Mackinaw Trail NV White Ibis Sweet White (Michigan),,,,
"Smoky, spicy plum and berry aromas turn more stalky and herbal as this Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon blend unwinds. In the mouth, screechy acidity yields scratchiness, while flavors of mocha, black plum, vanilla and stalky berry fruits finish tough, with oversize residual tartaric acidity; drink through 2022.",91,Luigi Bosca 2010 Icono Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon (Luján de Cuyo),,,,
"This yeasty funky Chardonnay is on its last legs. The mouthfeel is mealy and the flavors are dull, yeasty, generic and lightly oxidized on the finish.",80,Love 2015 Chardonnay (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),,,,
"This Bonarda could be your everyday red or house pour with no issues. Solid berry aromas are fairly woody and a bit earthy. A bouncy, fresh palate is cheerful, while flavors of plum, blackberry, cassis and spices are toasty and forward-moving on the finish.",89,Lamadrid 2016 Single Vineyard Bonarda (Agrelo),,,,
"This single-vineyard wine is rich and crisply fruity. It has the bright, tight texture of the vintage, giving a tense character while retaining the lush, poised fruit of the vintage. It's delicious now and ready to drink.",90,Vignerons des Terres Secrètes 2014 Les Plantés  (Saint-Véran),,,,
"T-L's 2007s from the Northern Rhône came out well, including this example from Saint-Joseph. Intense espresso, cracked pepper and black olive notes scream of cool-climate Syrah, while the feel in the mouth is supple, ending on a silky note.",91,Tardieu-Laurent 2007 Vieilles Vignes  (Saint-Joseph),,,,
"This bottling from EOS is almost always one of the most dependable and satisfying dessert wines in California, and the price is good compared to its peers. The '07 is a very good sweetie, a pace or two off the previous four vintages. But it offers rich, honeyed apricot, pineapple and crème brûlée flavors and is very sweet.",91,EOS 2007 Tears of Dew Late Harvest Moscato (Paso Robles),,,,
"Soft-textured wine, with an edge of minerality, this is deliciously rich, while presenting plenty of fresh acidity. It is ripe, full in the mouth, an explosion of white and yellow fruits, with a great burst of acidity.",90,Quinta do Quetzal 2009 Guadalupe Selection Branco Antão Vaz (Alentejano),,,,
"Fruity and citrus flavored, this is a wine that combines plenty of acidity with a ripe strawberry character. It has a tight, firm aftertaste.",87,Maison Ginestet 2015 Clairet des Carrelets Red (Bordeaux Clairet),,,,
"A pink-tinged copper color and a pleasing blend of flavors make this sparkling wine from Schramsberg easy to enjoy. The aromas suggest cherries and cinnamon, the flavor is like tart raspberry and the texture is smooth with fine bubbles.",88,Mirabelle NV Brut Rose Sparkling (California),,,,
"Tight wild berry and cherry aromas come with a soapy accent. This is blocky and fiercely tannic, with muscular, grapy flavors that hint at blackberry before turning hot and bitter on the finish.",84,Mascota 2014 ROD Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"This appealing offering has aromas of smoke, char, coffee and berry. It shows a sense of restraint and elegance while still displaying depth and balance to the lingering dark fruit and savory flavors.",89,For a Song 2013 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A big, rich, vital Cabernet with immediate attraction that is deceptive. Sure, you can enjoy it now, while it's brimming in cherry jam and red and black currants with a finish of rich, caramelized oak. But it will soften and mellow over the next eight years, and maybe even longer. This is Round Pond's best estate Cabernet in years.",92,Round Pond 2010 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),,,,
"From La Moussière vineyard, this Pinot Noir-based wine is refreshingly crisp with red fruits and tight lemon and orange-zest acidity. It is lightly textured, with a minerality that comes from the chalk soil of the vineyard. Drink now.",88,Alphonse Mellot 2014 La Moussière Rosé (Sancerre),,,,
"With small amounts of Carignane and Petite Sirah, this hails from the winery's estate vineyard in Dry Creek Valley, one of the great sources of Zinfandel in California. It is a very fine Zin, showing near perfect balance. Tannic and dry, the blackberry, blueberry, cherry, chocolate, sweet leather and spice flavors are enriched with the vanilla and smoky char of oak.",92,Ferrari-Carano 2005 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"This is aged in barrel, but the power of the source's granitic soils is such that the oak is barely noticeable. Nasturtium blossom and apricot mark the nose, while the palate adds pineapple, cinnamon and clove. The wine is a bit oily in texture, but with a long, tropical-fruit-laced finish that brings admirable freshness, focus and energy.",92,Gilles Flacher 2013 Les Rouelles  (Condrieu),,,,
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot combines the sharp, herbal edges of Cabernet with the plumminess of Merlot to fine results. Umami notes of brine, mushroom and forest floor add savory complexity. It's a complex yet thoroughly approachable wine that's drinking elegantly now.",90,Atwater 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Seneca Lake),,,,
"In comparison with other new releases from the winery, this seems dilute. With its watery raspberry fruit and astringent acidity, it lacks the stuffing to handle the 55% new oak it was aged in, making the barrel flavors apparent. More time in the bottle may help.",87,Chehalem 2015 Stoller Vineyards Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),,,,
"This is a concentrated wine with fine tannins and juicy black-plum fruits. It is densely textured, packed with great fruit and developing well. Drink from 2018.",87,Château La Jalgue 2015  Bordeaux,,,,
"High alcohol lends an uncomfortable heat to this blend of Syrah, Grenache and Viognier. Raspberry and cherry flavors are brightened by citrusy acidity. It's ready to drink now.",86,Edmond August 2010 Indelible Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"Light in body, shades of green plum and freshly cut grass lend freshness to riper flavors of apricot and honey in this off-dry Riesling. Fresh and fruity, it's sprightly on the palate, with wide appeal.",88,Carl Ehrhard 2016 Rüdesheim Kabinett Feinherb Riesling (Rheingau),,,,
"Tender, freshly cut yellow pears and yellow plums play on a rounded, rich and almost oily palate that remains dry but expresses richness in terms of texture and mouthfeel, edged with earthy and nutty notes. This finishes exquisitely clean.",90,Domaine Bott-Geyl 2012 Les Élements Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"Smoky aromas lead to a palate with firm tannins and a dry, extracted character. All this masks the fruit for the moment, but let the flavors develop over the next few months, to mid-2016.",84,Château Queyssard 2013  Bordeaux Supérieur,,,,
"From older vines planted on the producer's estate Quail Hill Vineyard, this wine is thickly concentrated, with a generosity of oak. Creamy, intense and well made, it features complex layers of golden apple, butter and lemon bar.",94,Lynmar 2015 Old Vines Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Bone dry, deliciously crisp, this young Riesling exudes minerality, steel and flint while giving flavors of green apple, grapefruit and white currant. It shows great acidity in its tight, taut finish.",90,Bründlmayer 2007 Steinmassel Riesling (Kamptal),,,,
"This is a very dry, elegant Pinot Noir that's sleeker and earthier than many other comparably priced Pinots out there. It has what you might call a Burgundian profile, with the cherry, raspberry, cola and spice fruit balanced by truffles, leather and a suggestion of dried pine needles.",93,Loring Wine Company 2006 Brosseau Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chalone),,,,
"This is a fun, flavorful blend of 63% Merlot, 14% Syrah, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Petit Verdot and 4% Malbec. Soft, juicy red fruit meets sizable tannin and leathery oak laced in vanilla.",88,Highway 12 2014 SRB Red (Sonoma County),,,,
"As a contrast to Jonathan Maltus's Le Carré, this single-vineyard wine, from vines situated only 100 yards away, has a taut, mineral flavor, with an initial austere character which then opens out to give dark bitter chocolate and plum skin flavors. It is potentially a richer, more impressive wine, but it needs aging for 4–5 years.",92,Les Astéries 2006  Saint-Émilion,,,,
"This is a beautifully pure wine with good acidity and a very crisp texture. It's all about fresh citrus while keeping a place for the tight, cool character of this vineyard. The end shows grapefruit and steeliness in equal combination. Drink from 2016.",91,Jean-Marc Brocard 2014 Vaudevey Premier Cru  (Chablis),,,,
"There is an odd, piercing edge to the aromas, a mix of acetic acid and pungent herb, with a hint of diesel. Somehow it's not off-putting, just atypical. The light, tart fruit is a mix of rhubarb and cranberry, very earthy and tasting of dirt and bark in the finish. This could be quite pleasant with a hearty, rustic dish such as beef Bourgogne.",85,Silvan Ridge 2006 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"The lack of new oak on this wine unleashes a torrent of ripe tropical fruit, including guava, as well as ripe pear. It's briny on the palate yet with quite perfumed and pungent flavors, more typical of a Rhône white than a California chardonnay.",87,Wrath 2013 Ex Anima Chardonnay (Monterey),,,,
"Layered aromas and rich but vibrant flavors help this medium-bodied wine stand out. It has a medium color with a brickish rim, while aromas suggest black tea and black cherry. A dry, tangy, but ripe fruit expression on the tongue lingers on the finish.",90,Freeman 2013 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"There is a good bite to this tight, mineral wine. It has candied orange, a bite of brandy and fine acidity. This is a well-balanced wine, never too sweet with a burst of final freshness.",88,Quinta de Santa Eufemia NV Finest Reserve Tawny  (Port),,,,
"Apple and pear cider aromas mix with grapefruit peel, lime marmalade, peach blossoms and stone fruit on the nose of this rarely made varietal. The palate shows slightly sour, bitter apple peels and lemon skin.",86,J Wilkes 2014 Pinot Blanc (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"Comes across as being on the sweet side of the brut spectrum, but it's still a solid value, offering bold pineapple flavors and just a hint of toast on the finish.",85,De Bortoli NV DB Family Selection Sparkling Brut Sparkling (South Eastern Australia),,,,
"Very spicy, this soft and rounded wine comes packed with lychee and quince flavors. There is a pepper element to the wine and a gentle spicy aftertaste. Drink now.",84,Domaine Specht 2012 Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"This soapy, unfocused wine has tannins and red berry fruit but little structure. The fruit shows a green streak that will not improve.",83,Château des Tourtes 2011 Classic  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),,,,
"This property is flying below the radar...for now. This is yet another excellent wine from Clos Berenguer. The nose is full of butterscotch and oxidized aromas of fine Sherry. The palate has a big feel, purity and fine acidity, while flavors of smoke, toast and oxidized white fruits finish waxy, creamy, oaky and long. This Garnacha-heavy blend would go great with fish or lobster done in a butter sauce.",92,Clos Berenguer del Molar 2007 Blanc de Botes White (Priorat),,,,
"Pervaded by lively, friendly, zippy freshness, this easy-drinking Riesling comes with a sprightly, fruity balance on its dry palate that is made all the more summery by the faintest amount of fizz.",89,Josef Ehmoser 2015 Vom gelben Löss Riesling (Niederösterreich),,,,
"With an underlying current of power and tension, this wine offers a wealth of chocolate, dust and tobacco leaf flavors, its texture softly layered with integrated tannin and oak. Complex and long on the finish, it continues to unravel in the glass.",93,Alpha Omega 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Floral berry, olive and spice aromas make for a rustic nose with polish. This wine feels lively and a bit jumpy, with woody plum and berry flavors that are braced and framed by crisp Patagonian acidity. A lightly herbal, salty finish is powerful but steady. Drink through 2020.",90,Verum 2016 Reserva Cabernet Franc (Alto Valle del Río Negro),,,,
"This smells and tastes rich and abundant, yet it is not overtly fruity or full bodied. The nuances are more like fig and toasted almond with a subtle buttery note. A slight brassy effect in the golden color seems to agree with the mature, complex flavor components.",88,Cold Water Creek 2013 Chardonnay (North Coast),,,,
"Organically grown, this fruit is from the estate vineyard in the Chehalem Mountains. Old vine elegance and subtlety are much in evidence, even in this bottling from a difficult, rain-soaked vintage. It's a delicate wine that nonetheless offers persistent, complex flavors: strawberry and sour cherry, dried Italian herbs and a finishing lick of chocolate.",89,Rex Hill 2007 Jacob-Hart Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"A mix of grapes from southern Portugal and the north along with a hint of Syrah, this is a stylish wine, feeling fresher and lighter than its alcohol would suggest. It has that cool feel of Lisboa wines, a touch saline, and balances firm, impressive fruit and tannins with juicy acidity. Drink from 2018.",92,Quinta de Chocapalha 2010 Tinto Red (Lisboa),,,,
"Simple and high in high alcohol, this bears semiripe berry and spice flavors. There's also a tug of boiled asparagus.",82,Tower 15 2009 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),,,,
"Deep brick-red in color, this wine leads with aromas of stewed black fruits, petrol and green pepper. Flavors of cherry preserves, smoked meat, vanilla and a pop of tart cherry make their way across the palate, encased in silky tannins. The finish is simultaneously cool and bright.",92,Tzuba 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Judean Hills),,,,
"This is a slightly more intense version of the regular Castoro bottling, with an extra punch to the berries and a little more zip in the finish. A clean, bright, focused wine, precise and polished, with a natural elegance. Good balance throughout.",89,Castoro Cellars 1998 Vineyard Tribute Zinfandel (Paso Robles),,,,
"Licorice aromas are matched by herbal, horsey notes on this earthy, muscular Monastrell. A bold, high-volume palate is home to plum, currant and blackened flavors, while an integrated, lightly herbal finish is fresh and powerful, with a firm structure that will ensure at least several additional years of life. Drink through 2023.",92,Enrique Mendoza 2010 Las Quebradas Monastrell (Alicante),,,,
"This new cuvée is 60% Malbec, 35% Syrah and the rest Merlot. It seems to have been given extra barrel time, and the overpowering and heavy toast scents and flavors dominate. The raspberry fruit flavors are somewhat buried as a result, and the wine seems over-matched. But more bottle age may help to open it up.",87,Gordon Estate 2009 Decadence Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"One of Jolivet's single-vineyard wines, this comes from a south-facing parcel in the heartland of Sancerre. It is a classic fruity wine, but is developing an opulent character that brings in spice as well as wonderfully ripe flavors. The wine is very drinkable now, although still young and with a great future. Drink ideally from 2018.",93,Pascal Jolivet 2014 Le Grand Chemarin  (Sancerre),,,,
"The poster child for Tardieu's winemaking style is this 2009 Rasteau. It features masses of luscious oak—toasted coconut, cedar, vanilla—with just enough raspberry fruit to support it. It's full bodied and lushly textured, even a bit dessert-like despite being totally dry. Probably best consumed on its own over the next few years.",92,Tardieu-Laurent 2009 Vieilles Vignes Red (Rasteau),,,,
"The glass gives off a great waft of delicate citrus and pear-flavored fruits, lightly perfumed and with a layer of minerality that sits easily underneath the freshness.",88,F X Pichler 2006 Loibner Klostersatz Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),,,,
"Tightly wound aromas of blueberry and black currant ride a cedar backbone on the elegant nose of this blend of 60% Merlot, 22% Cabernet Franc, 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, 2% Malbec and 1% Petit Verdot, which also offers a touch of vanilla. The palate balances dill and marjoram with tangy red fruit and cinnamon spice.",91,Jamie Slone Wines 2013 BoRific Red (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),,,,
"Dry, leathery aromas precede a grabby but fresh palate. Tomato and plum flavors are in the lead, with herbal, soupy notes running close behind. Similar to the primary attack, this finishes herbal and briny but solid in feel.",86,Morandé 2014 Gran Reserva Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"Complex and composed, this vineyard-designate wine is brightly decorated in flavors of grapefruit pith and lemon zest, with zippy acidity. As it develops in the glass, richer elements of peach and apricot flesh out the palate with succulent aplomb.",93,Aesthete 2016 Dry Stack Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Bennett Valley),,,,
"California Malbec by itself tends to be straightforward, which might be why the winemaker blended this one with a bit of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. The result is excellent, one of the best Malbecs in California, with rich blackberry, currant and cedar flavors. The strong tannins suggest it should pair well with beef.",92,St. Supéry 2009 Dollarhide Malbec (Napa Valley),,,,
"A terrific Merlot, especially at this price. Impresses for its soft lushness and intricate flavors of berries, currants, cola, anise, pepper and sandalwood. A real bargain. Production was 2,500 cases. Drink soon.",90,Pedroncelli 2008 Bench Vineyards Merlot (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Wow, what a wonderful wine, delivering rich notes of black fruit, vanilla, cherry and spice. But the aromas are in no way obvious. In fact, this is an ethereal and elegant wine that pays attention to the little details,   like the light shadings of polished stone and violets that liven up the long finish. Drink after 2018.",94,Elvio Cogno 2006 Cascina Nuova  (Barolo),,,,
"Roasted, smoky initial aromas give way to olive and sassy red-fruit scents. This feels rubbery and grabby, with strong tannins. Rubbery, herbal flavors of plum and red berry finish racy and a bit tart.",84,Viña Requingua 2011 Toro de Piedra Gran Reserva Single Vineyard Merlot (Curicó Valley),,,,
"Made from some great vineyards, but tastes ordinary, with over-oaked flavors of citrus and tropical fruits. Strongly flavored, but coarse and sweet.",84,Morgan 2009 Highland Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"The wine has a jammy character that gives it concentration. It is sweet although with enough acidity. The blackberry jelly flavors are firmed out with some fine tannins, certainly plenty to promise good aging. Drink from 2025.",90,Quinta do Crasto 2015 Vintage  (Port),,,,
"Tar and smoke add a note of intrigue to dark, dense plum, blueberry and black cherry fruit. Everything is still held back, still taut, still tightly coiled. There is fine structure and smoky-tinged spice. Medium-bodied midpalate weight is countered by freshness and an elegant structure, what echoes is spiced blueberry. A very classy bottle indeed.",93,Jalits 2012 Steinberg Red (Südburgenland),,,,
"This is a tasty Pinot Noir, but it's not particularly characteristic of Doctor's Vineyard or Santa Lucia Highlands. It's soft, ripe and sweet, and while the raspberry, cherry and red currant flavors are balanced with acidity, the wine tastes like it could have been grown anywhere. Drink now.",86,Adelaida 2011 Vineyard Series Doctor's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Medium in build and concentration, this perfumed Roero exhibits tones of pressed violets, tealeaf, forest fruit and wet earth. Pair this wine with buttery or cheesy foods that will benefits from the naturally high tannins and acidity.",87,Cascina Chicco 2007 Montespinato  (Roero),,,,
"Supple, round and ready to drink, this blend features hints of tomato leaf, watermelon and clove layered over ripe cherries. Drink now–2016.",86,Gotham 2013 Wine Men of Gotham Shiraz-Grenache (South Australia),,,,
"Aromas of apple, nut and citrus lead the nose. The lively palate offers pear, lime and a hint of bitter almond accompanied by bright acidity.",87,Castello di Buttrio 2014 Friulano (Friuli Colli Orientali),,,,
"Ripe, juicy notes of yellow pear on the nose are shot through with lively, zesty lemon freshness. Smatterings of white pepper play around the sleek edges of this slender but super-juicy wine. This is totally enlivening and sings with fruit and freshness—with all the verve of its vintage.",92,Schloss Gobelsburg 2014 Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),,,,
"The 2004 gives some easy aromas of milk chocolate, mint, herbs, olives and eucalyptus. As it opens, the tannins get stickier and the flavors of chocolate, plum, cassis and tobacco expand. On the finish, look for vanilla and good herbal length.",91,Seña 2004 Red (Aconcagua Valley),,,,
"Blue fruit character comes softly layered with exotic clove and cardamom scents in this elegantly light and vibrant wine. Given less time in oak than some of the producer's single-vineyard wines, it's focused and varietal, with a gravelly, complex finish.",92,Alma Fria 2014 Plural Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"This is a crisp, medium-bodied wine, with pleasant aromas of apricot, lemon and pineapple. A smidgen of almond nuttiness marks the finish.",87,Paul Dolan 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Potter Valley),,,,
"Robust on the bouquet, with ample red berry fruit and vanilla. The palate has a deep, layered feel and flavors of plum, berry and peppery spice. A tight blend of Carignan, Garnacha and Syrah that's forward and wiry, with power in reserve. Drink now through 2015.",89,Besllum 2008 Red (Montsant),,,,
"This lively, medium-bodied and well-balanced wine smells of raspberries and dried herbs. It tastes invitingly fresh, combining bright fruit with earthy and savory accents. The color is relatively light, matching the overall tangy personality.",87,Oak Grove 2013 Family Reserve Zinfandel (California),,,,
"Just released after nearly eight years, this wine still tastes lively and timely. It's marked by complex waves of blackberries, mocha, currants, cola and spices, although the fruit is beginning to move into drier, secondary characteristics. It's delicious, and fully ready to drink now. Give it a decanting, and watch as it changes in the glass.",90,Indigené 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"Demure in stature yet brooding with power, this late-release 2012 Riesling is compelling evidence of winemaker Steve Shaw's soft-spoken dynamism. Semidry in style, it's light as a feather, yet richly layered with shades of grapefruit, spice and smoke. While delicious now, it's rigidly structured still, and likely to continue to improve for many years to come.",92,Shaw 2012 Road Block Reserve Riesling (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Earth and hay aromas open to an earthy tart-apple palate. There's an unusual mushroom note overall, and only a faint bead. Although the tart, dry finish is clean, it's low on zip and personality.",83,Grandin NV Brut Sparkling (Vin Mousseux),,,,
"Lemon zest, lime and melon aromas lead this elegant white blend. Zesty citrus and lush melon on the palate offers a refined character that is nonetheless fine for everyday enjoyment. The finish is expressive and slightly floral.",87,Estate Biblia Chora 2011 Ovilos White (Pangeon),,,,
"Aromas of forest floor, violet, red berry and a whiff of dark baking spice unfold in the glass while wild cherry, black raspberry, ground pepper and star anise drive the palate. Framed in firm, fine-grained tannins, this is a classic Tuscan red. Drink through 2020.",90,Avignonesi 2012  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,,,,
"Straw colored in the glass with aromas of green apple, citrus blossom and freshly cut grass, this Bulgarian Sauvignon Blanc has flavors of lemon curd, guava and pineapple. It is medium bodied in the midpalate and has a crisp, clean finish.",89,K Cellars 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Thracian Valley),,,,
"Off-dry, with initial flavors of orange candy and a slight medicinal graininess. It develops some honeyed lemon in the midpalate, and smoothes into a pleasant-drinking, low alcohol and high acid Riesling.",87,Snake River 2010 Arena Valley Vineyard Riesling,,,,
"A rich depth of flavor is at the heart of this wine, a mix of blueberry, blackberry and cherry that shows a generosity on the nose and palate. Bright acidity lifts the deeper, darker notes of toasted oak and cola.",92,Buena Vista 2014 Geza's Selection Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Sourced entirely from the Chelle den Millie vineyard, the grapes were picked and processed specifically for rosé. A deep, delicious and rather potent summer wine, it captures the brisk cherry fruit without entangling it in too much tannin or herb. It's all about the fruit, and bravo for that.",90,Va Piano 2013 Rosé of Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Wood, ripe fruit and a tight texture give this wine a very complete feeling. It is structured, mineral-driven and packed with fresh apples and yellow fruit. The impressive structure and balance suggest the wine will age well; drink from 2024.",96,Louis Latour 2015  Bâtard-Montrachet,,,,
"Dry, mild, dusty berry aromas are simple but correct for the variety. This feels scattered across the palate, with some stickiness. Resiny, oaky, buttery flavors of generic berry fruits finish short, with a mild but lasting green note.",86,Viña Requingua 2014 Puerto Viejo Estate Bottled Reserve Carmenère (Curicó Valley),,,,
"Celebrating both the wide beret worn by Gascon men and the local Tannat grape, this firm wine is rich and concentrated. It has dusty tannins that support the dark berry fruits and balancing acidity. The bright, fruity character suggests it will keep until 2018.",90,Producteurs Plaimont 2012 Beret Noir  (Saint-Mont),,,,
"This Cabernet has a wonderfully smooth texture. It's tasty and rich in blackberry fruit, with a touch of sweet, savory raisin and lots of exotic spice. Easy to drink this dry wine over the next few years.",88,Owl Ridge 2007 T.R. Passalacqua Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Honey, peach, citrus and dried herbs comprise the nose of this simple Pinot Grigio. In appearance, the wine is almost transparent with a touch of gold and the mouthfeel is equally light and easy. The screwcap bottle has a cute picture of a green Vespa on the label to reinforce its all-Italy, Dolce Vita appeal.",85,Adria Vini 2006 Rapido White Pinot Grigio (Provincia di Pavia),,,,
"Ripe black plum, leather, game, truffle, blackberry and tobacco aromas unfold in the glass. These follow through to the rich palate along with black cherry, clove and baking spice. It's structured but elegant, with velvety tannins and a smooth texture. Drink 2016–2028.",94,Tenute Lunelli 2008 Carapace  (Montefalco Sagrantino),,,,
"Seared black cherries and savory hoisin umami notes mix with cinnamon, sandalwood, incense and brown spice on the nose of this bottling by Jake Knotts of the Jocko's Steakhouse family. It's lively, energetic and easy to quaff on the palate, with bright boysenberries and aromatic purple flowers, proving medium weight in body and style.",89,Mollie 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Aromas of forced oak, plastic and berry fruits don't forecast how tight, shrill and acidic the palate is. Snappy flavors of red plum and red currant teeter on being sour, while acidity is what keeps this cranking through a sharp, oaky finish.",83,Viña La Fortuna 2011 Culpeo Made with Organic Grapes Cabernet Sauvignon (Curicó Valley),,,,
"Here's a nice and fresh Sauv Blanc with notes of tropical fruit, ripe gooseberry, tangerine and sweet grass supported by pineapple acidity. Balanced and easy to drink with a crisp, clean finish.",84,Two Oceans 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape),,,,
"Aromas of black fruit, baking spices and meat juices carry over to the palate along with ripe berry, vanilla and hints of mocha. This is very soft and ready with a sweet, almost sugary finish. Drink soon.",87,San Filippo 2009 Le Lucere  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"Oak, coconut, toasted nut, porcini mushroom, steeped prune and dried sage aromas lead the nose on this robust wine. The warm, one-dimensional palate offers dried berry, raisin, vanilla, anise, oak-driven spice and mocha framed in velvety tannins. The heat of alcohol marks the close.",87,Ferrero 2011  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Delicious drinkability is the hallmark of this Pinot Noir, which comes from the winery's vineyard in the Carneros District. The wine is dry and silky, with complex flavors of berries, cherries and spices, brightened with brisk acidity. Should hold and develop in the bottle over the next five years.",93,Artesa 2009 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),,,,
"Applesauce aromas are sweet and dusty. Then in the mouth it's weighty and cloys, with candied white fruit flavors, vanilla and a sugary aftertaste. Hints of lemon and proper acidity give it some quality.",83,Tacama 2010 Semi-Seco Blanco White (Ica),,,,
"Fresh, fruity cranberry and raspberry flavors penetrate through this vivaciously brisk blend of Cabernet Franc and Lemberger. It's fairly straightforward in style, but hints of herb and bramble lend a savory complexity to the midpalate. The finish is moderately long, marked by a spray of fine tannins.",87,Anthony Road 2013 Cabernet Franc-Lemberger Red (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Sweet, juicy blueberry scents are elevated with teriyaki, beef jerky and vanilla-bean aromas on this dense blend of 45% Petite Verdot, 28% Cabernet Sauvignon and 27% Malbec. It's thick and rich on the palate, as the nose indicates, showing dark purple fruits, charred beef and a bit of pepper spice.",89,Clavo Cellars 2010 Collusion Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"Opaque and thick in color, this bombastically powerful and concentrated wine has pruney sweetness lurking on the back palate, softened by sprinkles of vanilla and black pepper atop a sturdy helping of blackberry pie.",90,Louis M. Martini 2013 Monte Rosso Vineyard Gnarly Vine Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"Light strawberry, raspberry and Bing cherry fruit, medium weight, straight-ahead, nicely ripened. The tannins are soft and the balance works just fine.",87,Gård 2006 Lawrence Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"The wine shows its youth with firm, mineral tannins and only a light hint at the fruit. It does have plenty of acidity so it will develop a fresh, fruity character in a few months. The aftertaste is firm and still needing time. Drink from 2017.",85,Quinta da Rede 2014 Rede Colheita Tinto Red (Douro),,,,
"Fresh raspberry flavors highlight this fruity, softly creamy wine that has a fresh, clean and bright aftertaste. It's a fine apéritif style of wine.",86,Cave de Turckheim NV Mayerling Brut Rosé Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),,,,
"Soft ctirus notes appear first. The palate follows with gentle but focused mandarin peel and a bright, luminous core of citrus freshness and weightlessness. Nonetheless, this wine offers a depth of citrus fruit with clear focus and precision. This is lovely, pure and lasting.",91,Domaine Bott-Geyl 2014 Points Cardinaux Métiss White (Alsace),,,,
"Green apple and tangerine figure into this thin-layered wine that's sourced from estate vineyards as well as purchased Russian River Valley fruit. Straightforward and unfussy, the wine is ready to enjoy now.",84,Simi 2012 Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Big, oaky and concentrated, it's rich in coffee and leathery toffee, the tannins firm and feisty.",87,Unum 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),,,,
"The dark color and high acidity of this wine are both typical of the Sousão grape which is normally found only in Douro blends. It is ripe, fruity and juicy although with tight acidity and black currant fruits. The wine's tannins suggest it needs to age, so drink from 2017.",88,Quinta do Vallado 2013 Sousão (Douro),,,,
"Spicy, with clove and juicy black-cherry flavors, this approachable, densely packed wine is full of fruit and integrated power, yet surprisingly balanced. Soft chocolate and tobacco notes accent the fruit as a long finish wraps up the experience.",90,Black Stallion 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"This is an incredibly young wine with its spice and red-berry fruits right up there and still almost just fruit juice. That means that it has the potential to be an attractive, easy, spicy wine and will need to age. It will be best from 2017.",87,Château Grand Jean 2015  Bordeaux,,,,
"With 20% Petite Sirah blended in and aged in a mixture of American, French and European oak, barrel notes of vanilla and sweet spices play nicely against plump, jammy red fruit aromas and flavors, with the oak leading the way on the finish.",88,Knight Hill 2010 StoneTree Vineyard Syrah (Wahluke Slope),,,,
"89-91 Barrel sample. A rounded wine, packed with rich fruits, feeling generous. The plum and damson juice flavors are dominant, ripe and powerful.",90,Château d'Angludet 2009 Barrel sample  (Margaux),,,,
"Attractive lemon flavors and some vanilla give this wine a good, lightweight pleasurability. The fruit is fresh, although the edge of candy shop sugar detracts.",84,Bouchard Père & Fils 2006  Bourgogne,,,,
"Generous on the palate, this wine from the famous site is ripe with wild strawberry and pomegranate fruit and accented with the distinct spiciness of cardamom. It displays its youth through assertive tannins and oak-derived scents, layering the thick finish with cinnamon bark.",91,Siduri 2015 Saralee's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Super-fresh, this is tight, full of green fruit and crisp apple flavors. It has some concentration under all this freshness, a structure coming from the cool year. This is classic, but very superior, seafood-friendly Muscadet.",89,Domaine Luneau-Papin 2007 Clos des Allées Vieilles Vignes  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),,,,
"Slivers of smoke and nut lend an earthy undertone to pristine grapefruit and lemon flavors in this elegantly balanced Silvaner. Dry on the palate and silken in texture, it finishes with racy edges of tart green plum and lime pith.",90,Castell 2014 Schlossberg GG Trocken Silvaner (Franken),,,,
"Aromas of brioche and caramelized sugar waft amidst apple jelly and quince in this elegantly pétillant Riesling sparkling. It's strikingly brisk, but the mousse feels lavish and comforting. The finish is marked by a meandering salty tang.",90,Von Buhl 2013 Traditionelle Flaschengärung Brut Riesling (Pfalz),,,,
"Rocamadour has been one of France's top pilgrimage sites since the Middle Ages but the vines only returned a decade ago. So Lagrézette's director-enologist, Claude Boudamani, went to the rock. The result is a pure Viognier, ripe and impressively rich. Classic apricot flavors come through strongly long with spice from wood aging. The wine pushes forward with its powerful fruitiness and intense flavors. Drink from 2017.",91,Château Lagrézette 2014 Mas de Merveilles Viognier (Côtes du Lot),,,,
"Gritty stalky aromas suggest that the original material for this Gran Reserva was not fully ripe. This feels wide chunky and grabby, with harsh tannins. Stalky flavors of herbal raspberry and plum come with oaky vanilla accents and tomatoey spice on the finish.",86,Baron De Ley 2008 Gran Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"Black as night in the glass, this heavy duty, Cabernet-led Bordeaux blend from one of the most visually stunning properties on the Central Coast is loaded with rich, luscious fruit and tannins that are built to last. There are stewed plums on the nose with warm slices of blueberry pie on the palate. Wait until at least 2019 for full enjoyment.",90,Star Lane Vineyard 2009 Astral Cabernet Sauvignon (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),,,,
"Aged in stainless steel and small barrels of French oak, this wine remains smooth and silky with interweaved acidity, a classic, fresh expression of the variety with very subtle oak. Vanilla and pear find their way onto the finish, providing additional layers of flavor and finesse.",91,Freemark Abbey 2014 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),,,,
"True as dry oloroso comes, with nutty aromas combined with caramel richness. Feels raring to go, with pumped-up acidity that boosts otherwise normal flavors of dried white fruits, mixed nuts and brine. Tight, long and driving on the finish.",90,Hidalgo NV Villapanés Oloroso Seco Sherry (Jerez),,,,
"Simple in its bright embrace of plummy flavor, this wine contains smaller additions of Syrah. Mocha and leather lurk beneath the full-bodied concentration of fruit.",87,Ferrari-Carano 2014 Merlot (Sonoma County),,,,
"From the recent appellation at the southern end of the Côte de Beaune, this is a light and very fruity wine with little discernible tannin or structure. Red cherries and fresh acidity dominate and the wine should be drunk young.",86,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2012 Clos des Rois Premier Cru  (Maranges),,,,
"This vintage of Fusion V is already approachable and enjoyable, with ripe aromas and flavors of brambly berry and cherry that are accented by attractive notes of cocoa powder, cigar tobacco, sweet spice and leather. The fine tannins are grippy and structured, complementing the black pepper, toast and licorice elements that linger on the finish. A blend of 51% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Malbec, 15% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc and 4% Petit Verdot, drink now–2019.",91,De Toren 2011 Fusion V Red (Stellenbosch),,,,
"Planted in the 1970s, the Frank Herbert Vineyard is owned by winemaker Marco Cappelli. Newsome-Harlow winemaker Scott Klann made a great Zin from this vineyard in 2009, but the 2010 seems sweeter, dialed up on a lot of levels, with more intensity of fruit and alcohol and less of the savory spice that was so attractive last vintage. Still, it's worth tasting for the sake of understanding the vicissitudes of vineyard, vintage and vintner.",87,Newsome-Harlow 2010 Frank Herbert Vineyard Zinfandel (El Dorado County),,,,
"Dry and structured, the wine has a way to go before the fruit shows. It is over-extracted giving a hard bitter edge. Give the fruit a chance and wait until mid 2018.",84,Château La Rose Gadys 2015  Bordeaux,,,,
"Light, fresh and direct describes the white-fruit aromas this brut nature is exuding. In the mouth, this is just round enough but mostly linear in plane. Flavors of dry lime, apple and fresh-baked white bread finish mild yet agile. This is affordable brut nature taken to a high level.",90,Alta Alella 2015 Mirgin Reserva Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"Briny, minerally aromas of vitamin dust and lees feed into a yeasty, round, melony palate. Flavors of yellow apple, mango and mustard finish yeasty, soft and briny.",84,Pagos del Rey 2014 Blume Verdejo (Rueda),,,,
"Rich, tannic and brambly, a juiciness of blackberry jam forms the substantive core of this wine, made in larger quantities for larger distribution. The finish is leathery and well integrated in oak.",86,Frei Brothers 2013 Reserve Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"This 100% varietal wine is a nice one, approachable and interesting in baked plum, licorice and leather. Tannins are sizable yet integrated.",89,Miro 2013 Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"From a vineyard just behind the beach at Pampelonne, this wine has 20% Tibouren, a rare grape in Provence rosé. That adds to the spiciness as well as the crisp acidity. It is a light and lively wine, fresh and full of lime as well as red berries. Drink now.",88,Les Maîtres Vignerons de la Presqu'île de Saint-Tropez 2016 Mas de Pampelonne Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"Made mistelle fashion, with fortification taking place prior to fermentation to help preserve the variety's citrus and tea-leaf aromas and flavors. Honeyed orange and lemon flavors take on a leafy edge, showing a hint of bitterness on the finish.",86,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards NV Muscadelle Tokay (Rutherglen),,,,
"A firmly tannic wine, bursting with the herbs of Provence, layers of new wood and pure sweet plum and blackberry fruits. The balance of this maturing wine is just right, giving an intense flavor.",90,Henri Milan 2007 L. Robert Milan 57 Red (Vin de Table Francais),,,,
"John and Helen Falcone blend multiple vintages and grapes into this annual experiment, and this is one of the best ones yet. Brown sugar, maple, blueberry pie, vanilla, gingerbread and caramel-laced coffee aromas show on the nose. There's a silky mouthfeel once sipped, with oaky flavors of chocolate, coffee, dried pepper, bay leaf and vanilla into the finish.",94,Falcone NV Annate VII Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"Dark yellow-hay in color, this is a waxy, sumptuous and full-bodied white, not for everyone in its touch of barrel reduction and whiff of petrol that saves itself by releasing subtle waves of melon on the palate.",90,VGS Chateau Potelle 2015 Eau de Tony Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"For a wine at this price, this is an impressive performance. It is rich, finely structured, the juicy blackberry flavors filling the mouth. It may lack complexity, but the spice, tobacco and berry flavors are enjoyably drinkable.",86,Dão Sul 2006 Cortello Touriga Nacional (Estremadura),,,,
"Firmly structured, this opens with scents of dark cherry marinated in spirits, baking spices, forest floor and a balsamic accent. The focused palate offers red berry, dried black cherry, clove, licorice and dried herbs alongside bracing but refined tannins and nervous acidity. Give this time to unwind and blossom. Drink 2018–2026.",92,Brovia 2011 Rocche di Castiglione  (Barolo),,,,
"This one-dimensional wine has muted aromas that recall tropical fruit. The palate doesn't give much away either, revealing subtle citrus and pear notes alongside racy acidity.",84,Tinazzi 2013 Ca' de' Rocchi  (Lugana),,,,
"Vanilla and ripe fruit aromas and a creamy texture give this wine its rounded fruity character. White fruits, caramel and light spice all come into play. The wine is ready to drink.",86,Domaine des Tilleuls 2016 Sélection Chardonnay (Val de Loire),,,,
"Jack Hill is a steep, cold site near Occidental, made hearty by the winds of the Pacific Ocean. The grapes in this bottling take on a caramelized, grenadine/kirsch-like richness. Tangy cranberry and citrus, layered atop a light, bright body, are girded by an underlying juiciness.",90,Cobb 2013 Jack Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"With an addition of 3% Petit Verdot, this wine sources from Andy Beckstoffer's Missouri Hopper Vineyard in Oakville and Benessere in St. Helena. It impresses in brown sugar and berry pie, the underlying foundation succulently fruity as savory touches of clove and pencil shavings begin to show amidst the firm tannin.",89,Marilyn Merlot 2013 Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"Shows the edgy tannins that Dry Creek red wines invariably display, with a sandpapery texture. That makes the wine, which is a Bordeaux blend of five varieties, a little rustic. But the dryness and bite are a nice alternative to the riper, softer Napa style, and more versatile at the table. Good now, and should slowly develop in the bottle for years.",92,Dry Creek Vineyard 2006 The Mariner Red (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"This is a terrific wine, extremely powerful in fruity flavors. It impresses for its sheer volume. Waves of apricots, nectarines, pears, green apples, butterscotch, buttered toast and smoky, vanilla-tinged oak surf the palate, carried along on a wave of crisp acidity.",92,Vine Cliff 2006 Chardonnay (Carneros),,,,
"A very ripe white Rhone style, this blend of 59% Roussanne, 28% Grenache Blanc and 13% Viognier offers peach custard, browned butter, seared banana and strong white flower aromas, from tuberose and honeysuckle into daffodil. Golden apples, walnut oil and ripe yellow peach and walnut oil flavors combine for a lush, unctuous palate.",87,Eberle 2014 Cotes-Du-Robles Blanc White (Paso Robles),,,,
"Floral berry and plum aromas are direct and pure, emphasizing fruit over oak. A punchy palate follows the nose, while bright plum and berry flavors complete the package. This captures the essence of Malbec while not going overboard.",89,Nieto Senetiner 2015 Don Nicanor Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),,,,
"This  Alvarinho, grown in the southern part of the Vinho Verde region, has richness as well as typical peach and pear flavors. The acidity comes through with its citrus edge to give a crisp aftertaste to a ripe-fruit flavored wine.",88,Aveleda 2012 Alvarinho (Minho),,,,
"Soft and creamy, with pear and melon flavors dominating the bright acidity. It's an attractive wine, easy on the palate with a light touch of nuttiness to finish.",86,Dopff & Irion NV Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),,,,
"Zenith is the winery's estate vineyard, and this wine is a standout among St. Innocent's 2015 Pinots. It's firm, dark and toasty, with full-flavored black-cherry fruit accented with dense veins of espresso, charred nuts and bitter chocolate. The structure supports those dark notes, and the chewy tannins and lengthy finish amplify them. Drink now through 2028.",92,St. Innocent 2015 Zenith Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
"A delicately fruity, fresh wine, this is very refreshing with its crisp acidity and citrus flavors. It's linear in focus with a lively, light aftertaste. It's ready to drink.",87,Domaine Pfister 2011 Pinot Blanc (Alsace),,,,
"Ripe and creamy wine, with some herbaceousness and yellow fruits. Layering citrus and a tangy texture, it's fruity, full of lively acidity and ready to drink this year. Screwcap.",86,Joseph Mellot 2012 La Gravelière  (Sancerre),,,,
"At first this lively, fairly full-bodied Rioja smells rubbery and earthy, with baked plum and raspberry aromas, but it eventually opens and smells more elegant and classy. Wild berry, plum and oak spice are the key flavors, followed by pepper and resiny wood notes on a fresh, racy finish. Drink through 2022.",90,Aspaldi 2009 Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"A sound, useful Zin, good for casual purposes, at an everyday price. Dry and velvety, it shows flavors of blackberries, currants, mocha, leather, anise and pepper.",84,Pepperwood Grove 2007 Zinfandel (California),,,,
"Konrad's 2008 Pinot Noir shows quite a bit of toast and vanilla to go alongside its cherry fruit. Gently toasted marshmallows impart a sweet succulence to the wine, making it attractive despite some woody tannins on the finish. Drink now–2014.",86,Konrad 2008 Pinot Noir (Marlborough),,,,
"Showing the rustic edge that sometimes characterizes wines from Listrac, this still offers smooth new wood and tight blackberry fruit flavors. It is still developing, with the wood probably too prominent.",87,Château Fourcas Hosten 2006  Listrac-Médoc,,,,
"Aromas recall exotic fruit, lemon blossom and slate. The crisp palate offers tart green apple, tangerine and lime zest alongside bright acidity.",88,Dorigo 2013 Pinot Grigio (Colli Orientali del Friuli),,,,

"Lifted purity of ripe Williams pear and a streamlined but not unsubstantial body combine to make a compelling, abundantly pear-fruited wine. It manages to be slender, rich and mineral at the same time.",91,Gebeshuber 2013 Klassik Zierfandler-Rotgipfler (Thermenregion),,,,
"Made in a German style, this Riesling is off-dry. Crisp, zingy acidity provides balance, and the flavors, of green apples, pineapples, honeysuckle flowers, vanilla and spices, are clean and deep.",86,Spellbound 2006 Riesling (California),,,,
"Co-fermented with 5% Viognier, this wine's appealing fresh flower, orange peel, ham hock and black olive tapenade aromas jump out of the glass. The palate is light, tart and sleek, not delivering on all that the aromas suggest but still providing plenty of intrigue.",90,Eternal 2015 Eternal Restraint Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"This wine gets the all-star treatment, blending fruit from 14 vineyards, and aging it in 60% new French oak. It's a substantial, muscular effort, with dark fruit, earth and tar components. A small addition of Petit Verdot darkens the color and thickens the tannins. There is just a hint of alcoholic burn in the finish.",91,Northstar 2008 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Saffron and orange blossoms perfume this intensely ripe, almost honey-slick Kabinett. There's a zesty backbone of tangerine acidity, but the palate is a crush of ruddy yellow peach and nectarine flavors. It's a luscious, forward wine to enjoy young.",87,Leonard Kreusch 2014 Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Whiffs of potpourri florals, orange rind and pressed pears lend a musky tone to this deep golden Gewürztraminer. Soft acidity accentuates its robust body and texture. Bold alcohol lends a sizzle of heat to the finish.",86,Hector Wine Company 2014 Gewürztraminer (Seneca Lake),,,,
"Creamy aromas predominate on the nose and carry through to a round, rich palate. This is generous, full and bready, with a lot of earthy flavors on the midpalate. While there is balance, there is little fruit and lots of yeasty character.",88,Sipp Mack 2011 Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),,,,
"The nose on this blend of Gewurztraminer and Macabeo defines neutral; it's clean but shows little more than a whiff of apple. The palate is fresh and quick moving, with mild peach, pear, apple and melon flavors that culminate in a solid finish that's not very exciting but doesn't stray.",88,Oliver Conti 2011 Treyu White (Empordà),,,,
"From the home estate of wine academic and guru Denis Dubourdieu, this tight, nervy wine has a mineral character rounded by wild-strawberry flavors. An attractive citrus tang gives it good bite at the end. Drink now.",85,Clos Floridène 2015 Le Rosé de Floridène Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),,,,
"The aromas and flavors of this wine are ripe to overripe, like dried plums and raisins. An earthy vein runs through them, too. It is full bodied and rather soft in texture.",82,Truscott 2012 Weibel Family Vineyards Zinfandel (Mendocino County),,,,
"Aromas of underbrush, dark-skinned berry, espresso menthol and scorched soil lead the nose. On the elegant, structured palate, firm, polished tannins carry dried black cherry, raspberry, cinnamon toast and a touch of anise. Drink 2017–2023.",91,Castello di Monsanto 2011 Il Poggio Riserva  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"A marvelous vintage for Freedom Hill, this high-acid Pinot is loaded with black cherry fruit. Rich, ripe, full, tart and penetrating, it might seem one-dimensional at first, but it has such excellent focus and depth that the fruit simply rocks. The finish weaves in threads of smoke and mocha, but this is a wine to cellar for a couple more years at least.",94,Ken Wright 2010 Freedom Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Dusty earth, leather and tobacco notes juxtapose rich, luscious blackberry and plum in this bold, big-bodied wine. Intensely fruit forward but also balanced and complex, it finishes on a seductively dark mineral tone.",89,Ventosa 2013 Lemberger (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Pineapple and grapefruit flavors are accented by hints of tomato leaf, meaning this conforms to the basic Marlborough profile that blends fruit with grassy, herbal notes. Pretty good, it just fades a bit quickly on the finish.",86,Dashwood 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"Dark in color, this soft, leathery Zin offers tangents of blackberry, chocolate and espresso within a heavy-handed package of serious fruit and weight.",86,Wilson 2011 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Smooth and supple, Amavi's 2005 Cabernet includes a healthy bit of Syrah, which adds details of spice and pepper to the smooth and supple cassis and black cherry fruit. Tannins are ripe and well-defined, and the wine carries subtle suggestions of olive and tea. It's focused and bright, polished and immediately delicious, though it could certainly cellar for a few years.",90,Amavi 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Fabiano's pretty Valpolicella Classico Superiore offers very nice aromas of plump red cherry followed by spice, leather, tobacco and moist earth. It's a simple wine in the mouth but it's not without its own distinct personality and appeal.",87,Fabiano 2008  Valpolicella Classico Superiore,,,,
"Bryan Babcock heads to Bentrock Vineyard on the southwestern edge of the appellation to deliver this wine redolent of red cherry, plum, mulberry, peppery spice and sagebrush. The palate is rich and full bodied, with tangy red plum skin and eucalyptus touches, finishing on a fresh, menthol-like note.",93,Babcock 2014 Deja Vu Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"The nose gives little away but the palate holds red, rounded fruit diffused by frothy, lively fizz. The foamy bubbles spell exuberance and easy-drinking enjoyment. Dry, light and rounded, this is a perfect party wine in a most appealing shade of coppery pink.",89,Ruhlmann NV Rosé Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),,,,
"Lemon zest and peppermint are the scents associated with this 100% Rkatsiteli. It's bright on entry, tasting of lemon peel and grapefruit pith.",88,Stobi 2014 Rkatsiteli (Tikves),,,,
"This bottling, which features an elephant's painting on the label, is extremely rich and ripe, showing caramel-laced blackberry, coffee cake, brown sugar and molasses aromas on the nose. Luxurious tannins rein in its sweet flavors on the palate, blending Vietnamese coffee, vanilla and espresso cordial notes. A great wine to accompany cigars.",91,Austin Hope 2014 Syrah (Templeton Gap District),,,,
"Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon and aged in mostly new French oak, this is a very elaborate wine. It's quite good, a full-bodied, powerful Cab with a molten core of blackberries and black currants and, of course, a thick, dry layer of firm tannins. It does not seem to have quite the depth of vintages from certain earlier vintages, but it should develop nicely in the cellar over the next decade or longer.",92,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2007 Cask 23 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Very dark and charred, but at the same time it smells like a fudge milkshake mixed with espresso. It's plump but loose in structure, with generic black-fruit flavors and strange acidic kick.",83,Zolo 2005 Bonarda (Mendoza),,,,
"Jasmine and lychee form the basis of this wine's bouquet, with fresh-cut peach making for a delicious experience on the palate. Rich, dense and lengthy, it comes from a cool vineyard site that provides lots of natural minerality and a taste of wet stone.",90,Landmark 2013 Rodgers Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Young, tart and tannic, this offers primary fruit flavors of cranberry and pie cherry. A hint of smoked meat wafts across the palate and through the finish.",91,Raptor Ridge 2012 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir,,,,
"Riboli-owned Opaque has been exploring the Petit Verdot waters for several years, with mixed results. This bottling is a little rustic, with awkward tannins, but it has plenty of ripe, fresh blackberry and cherry fruit, with a charred meat note that suggests pairing with grilled beef.",86,Opaque 2009 Petit Verdot (Paso Robles),,,,
"A finely balanced wine, with acidity, a soft texture, new wood and flavors of cocoa and smoke. There is beautiful red cherry fruit, laced with spice and buried tannins for aging. Keep this impressive wine for 6-7 years.",94,Domaine Bertagna 2008 Clos Saint-Denis  (Clos Saint-Denis),,,,
"Smoky aromas of burning hickory are matched by lemon peel and earthy berry scents. This is a rubbery feeling wine, with grabby tannins. Flavors of black cherry, cassis and rubber suggest plastic. On the finish, lactic oak wrestles with a residual hint of green.",87,Viña Requingua 2011 Toro de Piedra Gran Reserva Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"Closed and youthful, this wine is medium in build and subtle in oak. It conveys a briny streak throughout the palate, and a distinct taste of candied lemon.",87,Previous 2013 Chardonnay (Sonoma County),,,,
"The wine comes from the Leflaive home village and the blend (from more than 20 parcels) demonstrates the intimate knowledge the family has with its terroir. It has a fine balance between the ripe yellow and white stone fruits and acidity. These are given structure by the wood aging and strong mineral texture. This is still developing and still filling out, so drink from 2018.",91,Olivier Leflaive 2014  Puligny-Montrachet,,,,
"A bouquet of blueberry, pomegranate and juniper berry braces the palate for flavors of blueberry, raspberry, anise, juniper berry and eucalyptus that sit in a plexus of comforting tannins. Fruity and cool flavors battle it out for dominance, with fruit remaining victorious on the bright and juicy finish.",90,Segal's 2013 Fusion Red (Galilee),,,,
"Rich and ripe, this full-bodied wine offers lush black-plum aromas, a palate-coating texture, ripe but not sweet cherry and raisin flavors and a soft velvety mouthfeel. For a varietal known for its acidity, this wine is surprisingly soothing to sip.",89,Bella Grace 2015 Barbera (Amador County),,,,
"Here's a pearl for sparkling wine lovers. This bubbly rosato is made from the hearty Aglianico grape, usually reserved for one of Italy's most austere and masculine red wines. Yet here the variety shows a delicate, soft side with notes of wild berry and creamy almond paste.",90,Feudi di San Gregorio 2010 DUBL Aglianico (Campania),,,,
"A lovely note of mirabelle plum and sponge cake appears on the nose. The palate is fresh and vivid, light-bodied and dry, enlivened by frothy fizz that highlights fresh citrus accents. The finish is very clean, dry and appetizing—ideal apéritif material.",89,Bott Frères NV Blanc de Noirs Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),,,,
Hints of lovage tantalize on the nose. The palate is soft and generous. Juicy pear and a pervading spiciness of white pepper create savory layers.,89,Martinshof 2012 Hausberg Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel),,,,
"Deep red-violet in the glass, this wine has a nose of black cherry, smoked meat and a hint of green pepper. It is a well-balanced wine with sturdy tannins and flavors of black cherry, blackberry, anisette, violet and ground black pepper. The finish is characterized by a touch of orange peel and a sense of salinity.",91,Jerusalem Wineries 2013 4990 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Judean Hills),,,,
91-93 Delicious initial fruit is followed by dense swathes of tannin. Concentrated wine that has all the weight without any sign of bitterness. The aftertaste brings back the delicious opening.,92,Château Marquis de Terme 2010 Barrel sample  (Margaux),,,,
"Amazing how the addition of just 3% of Viognier lifts the winery's Syrah and makes this wine so fine. The white variety's citrusy acidity and lime flavor uplifts and brightens Syrah's blackberry and blueberry fruit, giving the wine a zesty punch. Drink now for it's freshness.",92,Montemaggiore 2009 Syrafina Estate Grown Syrah-Viognier (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Earthy, savory, seaside flavors dominate the mild fruit component of this rich-feeling but light-tasting wine.",85,"Naggiar 2015 Estate Grown, Produced and Bottled Viognier (Sierra Foothills)",,,,
"Flashy notes of wood-grilled apple, brioche and apricot fill the nose. The mouth is round and the palate spicy, as flavors of ginger and cedar dominate the stone fruit.",86,Radford Dale 2009 Viognier (Stellenbosch),,,,
"Tight and tannic, like red brick, bread and caramel, this Lodi Primitivo has 5% Barbera mixed in but the entire effort tastes of not-quite-ripe blackberries.",84,Sorelle Winery 2009 Sorriso Primitivo (Lodi),,,,
"This Chardonnay is creamy and scented with vanilla, ripe apple and pineapple. The fruit has a slightly overripe quality, a suggestion of funk on the finish, and the vanilla seems artificial. It says unoaked, but that's a lot of vanilla nonetheless.",84,David Hill 2006 Unoaked Estate Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Crisp and bright, this wine has retained plenty of acidity even in this ripe vintage. Attractive and spicy, it offers citrus fruits as well as apricots. Drink now.",88,Rijckaert 2015 Verchères  (Viré-Clessé),,,,
"Jumpy cherry and berry aromas are basic. A fruity, fresh palate delivers straightforward berry flavors prior to a quick finish.",85,Altavins 2015 Almodí Petit Red (Terra Alta),,,,
"An incredibly pure and piercing note of lemon oil hits the nose. The medium-sweet palate impresses with both fresh and dried notes of fruit: plum, white sultana, white currant and the ripest pear and apple you can imagine. This is full-on and big but balanced by tingling, fresh and precise acidity. A field blend of polar opposites, Riesling and Gewurztraminer, this unites their virtues of aromatic textured richness and poised finesse. Again, this is not a wine that is easily categorized with its medium-sweet, soil- and fruit-driven profile, but it is a joy to experience and savor. The finish lasts and lasts. Drink 2017–2035.",95,Biecher & Schaal 2015 Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru White (Alsace),,,,
"This smoky, earthy, soft and delicate wine comes from an estate vineyard planted in 1999 in the Occidental Hills. Rose petals and cranberry mingle effortlessly on the silky palate, while a bite of black tea and tannin tease on the finish.",94,Small Vines 2014 MK Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Made using fruit that was sourced from vines planted in 1939, this wine shows the great concentration low yields and old vines can give. It has Gamay's natural freshness, with firm, dry tannins, a spice note and a fragrant finish. It's drinkable now, but it will be better in two years.",92,Pascal Aufranc 2011 Vignes de 1939  (Chénas),,,,
"Crafted from a mix of 48% Syrah, 45% Grenache and 7% Mourvèdre, this aromatic rosé is spicy and bursting with star fruit, citrus, apple, pear, apricot and more. It's a lively full-bodied wine with a smooth finish.",89,Quady North 2016 Rosé (Rogue Valley),,,,
"This Barbaresco's pressed violet, Asian spice, menthol and woodland berry aromas lift out of the glass. Fresh, structured and elegant, the palate evokes juicy Marasca cherry, pomegranate, white pepper and a blast of orange zest while youthfully assertive tannins and racy acidity provide support. Drink after 2024.",93,Pertinace 2014 Nervo  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Melon, apple and peach pit aromas are dusty but that's about it. This feels flat, with little acidity or kick. Flavors of peach and apple cider end similarly, with no vitality to the finish.",83,Castro Martin 2013 A2O Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"This is a Sauvignon Blanc with more meat and punch than the average white. The nose, crisp, clean and fresh but rounded, leads into a balanced, substantial wine with good acidity and an assertive mouthfeel. Elegant but has character. Could pair with richer dishes.",87,Buitenverwachting 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Constantia),,,,
"Soft and fruity, a mix of apples and peaches, with a hint of toasted cracker. A simple, light Sauv Blanc that is smooth and easy-drinking.",85,Vin du Lac 2008 Savvy! Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,

It's well-balanced, with an energetic acidic finish.",88,Katunar 2012 Kvalitetno Vino Vinogorje Zlahtina (Krk),,,,
"Based on Petit Verdot, with the other four Bordeaux varieties blended in, this is ripe and rich in blackberries, mocha and oak. It distinguishes itself from Napa Valley—which is the unavoidable comparison—with a pleasurable earthiness and tartness, reflecting the Santa Ynez's cool climate.",93,Proximity 2009 Twenty Six Red (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"The tropical nose on this wine is inviting at first, then seems sweet, with aromas of Key lime and guava sorbet. Fruit-punchy flavors pop on the palate, where honeydew melon, peach, apple juice and tuberose battle for attention.",85,Limited by Cambridge Cellars 2015 Chardonnay (Central Coast),,,,
"Pencil lead and rubbery, mature berry aromas open this wine. The palate is driven by energetic, pounding tannins and flavors of black cherry and tomato, which become more prominent as the tannins and acid rebound. This is an indication of how Argentine Cabernet Sauvignon ages.",89,Finca Los Maza 2004 FLM Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"Modeled after an Italian Pinot Bianco, this tart, citrusy wine sports fresh-cut green apple fruit flavors. It's done in stainless steel, nicely balanced but definitely made to go with spicy Pacific Rim foods.",86,Apolloni 2008 Estate Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Dark-skinned berry, menthol, dark cooking spice and aromatic herb aromas unfold on this. The fresh, juicy palate offers dried black cherry, red currant, coffee and licorice alongside smooth, polished tannins. Enjoy through 2019.",89,Barone Ricasoli 2013 Brolio Bettino  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"Violet, dark-skinned berry and chopped herb aromas lift out of the glass. The lean firm palate offers dried sour cherry and a hint of spice but not much fruit richness while bracing, drying tannins leave an astringent finish.",86,Illuminati Dino 2015 Spiano  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),,,,
"Fragrant and fresh, this easy-drinking red has alluring scents of woodland berry, violet and a whiff of freshly tilled soil. The taut, luminous palate offers sour cherry and star anise accompanied by polished tannins and racy acidity.",87,Travaglini 2014 Nebbiolo (Coste della Sesia),,,,
"From a warm vintage, this blend is ripe yet still balanced, with aromas of prune, blackberry, tree bark and leather. The palate is saturated and broad, boasting flavors of dark, baked, black fruit accented by pepper and chocolate on the finish. Drink now.",91,Lapostolle 2012 Canto de Apalta Cellar Selection Red (Rapel Valley),,,,
"Floral, oily aromas are not typical of Chardonnay. A plump, melony mouthfeel is chunky, while this wine tastes both tropical and bitter, with a bath-soap character.",83,Famiglia Meschini 2015 Reserva Chardonnay (Mendoza),,,,
"Nice and dry, with rich mountain tannins and focused, concentrated blackberry and black currant flavors that finish with a dark chocolate and spice flourish. Dense and full-bodied, it should develop over the next 2–3 years.",87,Thomas Fogarty 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"There's no denying this wine's stalky, oily aromas. In the mouth, this blend of Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier is chunky, with flavors that follow suit: the palate is bitter, slightly oxidized and melony. For $40, not much is clicking here.",84,Errazuriz 2011 The Blend Collection White (Aconcagua Valley),,,,
"This beautiful blend of Barbera and Dolcetto shows characteristics of both native grapes (although the Barbera component is an overwhelming 90%). There are mature fruit aromas here with cherry, blackberry and raspberry but there's also a touch of spice cake and leather. From the 2004 vintage, the wine shows a soft and sophisticated side.",90,Anna Maria Abbona 2004 Cadò Red (Langhe),,,,
"Andis remains a name to watch in Amador, producing consistently great reds and whites. Here, they've made an invitingly floral Semillon, only 12% alcohol, that's light and bright in melon and fig with a richness on the mid-palate and a zesty finish. This will pair nicely with a range of equally light foods.",89,Andis 2012 Bill Dillian Vineyard Semillon (Amador County),,,,
"Rich, full tasting wine from the Sorin family, with smoothly ripe red berry fruits. There's an attractive orange zest character that gives piquancy to this great food rosé.",90,Domaine Sorin 2012 Terra Amata Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"Very light on the nose, this wine from an extreme coastal site shows key limes, wet slate and pear flesh on the delicate, well-integrated nose. Ripe Pink Lady apples and lemonade show on the surprisingly juicy sip before settling into tighter lemon peel flavors and a chalky structure.",90,Beauregard 2014 Bald Mountain Vineyard Chardonnay (Ben Lomond Mountain),,,,
"This opens with aromas suggesting spearmint, blackcurrant jam, toasted oak and roasted coffee bean. The aromas follow through to the evolved palate along with raisin and anise while raspy tannins clench the finish.",88,Paradiso di Frassina 2010 Flauto Magico Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,

"Celebrates its lusty volume proudly as a big, gutsy Zinfandel that makes no apology for high alcohol and extract. The flavors are huge, of ripe blackberries, loganberries, mulberries, red licorice, figs, black olives, Asian spices and oak, but despite all that, the wine finishes fully dry and balanced. Drink now through 2010.",92,Hendry 2004 Block 28 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),,,,
"This wine shows grapey and plummy purple fruit notes lead to an earthy palate, with hints of stem and coffee. No new oak was used, but it spent 22 months in barrel prior to bottling.",87,Twill 2014 Steelhead Run Vineyard Syrah (Applegate Valley),,,,
"Tasty flavors like Pippin apple and tangy cherry, plus a smooth and lively texture bring a lot of appeal to this light-bodied wine. The combination of crisp acidity, luxurious mouthfeel and bright but subtle flavors is a winning one.",88,Angel's Cup 2013 Vineyard Selection Pinot Grigio (California),,,,
"Here's a delightful rosso, offering spicy and earthy fragrances of clove and pepper as well as whiffs of leather and forest floor. The palate offers delicious dark plum flavors layered with spice. This is enjoyable, very well balanced and is perfect to pair with salami or seasoned cheese.",88,Poggio alla Sala 2012  Rosso di Montepulciano,,,,
"Cutting crisp tangerine, peach and honeydew melons abound on the nose of this full-bodied textured Sauvignon Blanc. Sprightly lemon-lime acidity lends balance and edge, and a hint of bitterness on the finish lends elegant structure.",90,McCall 2016 Cuvée Nicola North Ridge Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"Saline and basic citrus aromas feed into a fresh, light-bodied palate with citrus, lettuce and minerally flavors. A modest, firm finish is light but clean. This epitomizes the good qualities of value-priced Chilean SB.",86,Echeverria 2013 Classic Collection Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley),,,,
"Fragrant on the nose, with hints of black cherry and graham cracker, this is a ripe, rich, velvety Cabernet Franc with cassis flavor marked with just a hint of green stem.

"Crisp, yet fuller bodied, with a creamy voluptuousness to the mouthfeel, this wine offers a taste of lemon pith and peach, accented by a floral bouquet of orange blossom. Measured acidity keeps it ebullient in the glass, ending in a hit of Tahitian vanilla.",91,Cuvaison 2013 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Carneros),,,,
"Bründlmayer's flagship wine is made from old vines grown on the Heiligenstein hill. It is as intense as a great Riesling can be, a pure expression of steel, mineral and bitter orange and pineapple flavors. It has great structure and a ripe, concentrated character. This will age long and well.",96,Bründlmayer 2011 Zöbinger Heiligenstein Erste Lage Alte Reben Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),,,,
"True to its legacy, K-J's V.R. Chard is almost off-dry and soft in style, with pleasant mango, peach, orange and vanilla flavors. It's an easy-drinking wine to enjoy with everyday picnic or beach fare.",85,Kendall-Jackson 2012 Vintner's Reserve Chardonnay (California),,,,

"Fresh citrus and tangy orange give this perfumed wine both fruitiness and a tight, mineral texture. It has enough structure to age; drink from 2018.

"Starts out varietally correct, with zest in the mouth and citrusy, green aromas. Time doesn't really help it along; the lime and grapefruity crispness is surface-level. Turns more pithy and less focused as it airs out. Drink immediately before it fades.",85,Sundance 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Maule Valley),,,,
"This is a tangy wine, packed with fruit, orange and lemon zest and a background hint of herbaceousness. A tight, steely texture gives both acidity and the promise of aging. Drink from early 2016.",90,Château la Verrière 2014  Bordeaux Blanc,,,,
"Floral melon and peach aromas are mellow. This feels round, with citrusy acidity cutting into the body. Basic grapefruit and apricot flavors are friendly, while this is a touch foamy on the finish.",89,Vilarnau NV Reserva Brut Rosé Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"Las Brisas has been one of Lost Canyon's most consistent bottlings, and the '06 is simply delicious. It's light and elegant and silky, but that doesn't mean it doesn't pack layers of complexity. Cherries, black raspberries, cola, smoky vanilla and Asian spices flood together, leading to a long, perfectly Pinot finish. Drink now.",91,Lost Canyon 2006 Las Brisas Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),,,,

One of the best examples of Roussanne out there.",92,Clos Solène 2011 Essence de Roussanne Roussanne (Paso Robles),,,,

Drinking through 2020.",91,La Follette 2011 Van Der Kamp Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain),,,,
"Almost overripe, with oak-inspired currant and plum flavors that veer into raisins. But the wine is bone-dry and soft, with mellowing notes of chocolate. Finishes in a swirl of peppery spice.",87,Forchini 2006 Proprietor's Reserve Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"This is a spicy wine that is full of juicy red-berry fruit notes. It is soft and gentle, with a core of dry tannins that gives the wine structure. Young and fruity, it is ready to drink, but will also age. Drink until 2018.",86,Wines & Winemakers 2011 Companhia das Lezírias Catapereiro Red (Tejo),,,,
"Lean and compact with subdued aromas of cherry and wild berry, this is an informal Rosso to drink with roast chicken or home-cooked meatloaf. The wine is smooth and rich on the palate and it offers a cleaning touch of acidity on the finish.",87,La Fornace 2007  Rosso di Montalcino,,,,
"This Chianti Classico Riserva is a balanced and intense wine with beautiful aromas of dark fruit, sweet spice, chocolate fudge, espresso bean and pipe tobacco. That bright Sangiovese freshness pops in on the finish.",92,Mazzei 2008 Ser Lapo Riserva  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"This is very crisp, touched by red berry fruits but more dominated by tight, structured tannins. There's a balanced mix of acidity, texture and a hint of wood flavor, giving the Champagne a very wine-like feel.",89,Tarlant NV Rosé Zéro Extra Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"Forest floor, spiced blueberry, prune, resin and a mocha note lead the nose on this full-bodied red. The smooth palate offers dried black cherry, nutmeg, cinnamon and anise alongside fine-grained tannins.",89,Colle Spinello 2012  Morellino di Scansano,,,,
"Thick and rich, with a menthol-like streak in the background, this 89% Zin is complemented by a wealth of mixed blacks, from Alicante Bouschet to Trousseau Noir. It opens with a bouquet of fresh, brambly blackberry, raspberry and sage, reaching a powerful conclusion of brown sugar and spice, staying structured atop soft, sizable tannins. Drink now through 2020.",90,Carlisle 2013 Montafi Ranch Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Roccolo Grassi is a point of reference in Valpolicella and a symbol of the overextracted, super-dense style epitomized here. The wine is redolent of black fruit, jammy blackberry, plum cake, bitter chocolate and polished granite. There's a pretty, linear and clean quality behind all that bold fruit.",94,Roccolo Grassi 2007  Amarone della Valpolicella,,,,
"The Jaen grape, local to the Dão, has produced a perfumed juicy wine that is ripe and intensely full of acidity at the same time. It has only light tannins and red berry flavors that are right up front. The wine is ready to drink.",87,Casa da Passarella 2012 Enxertia Jaen (Dão),,,,
"Made from 35% Obeidi, an indigenous grape usually reserved for Arak production, 35% Clairette, 15% Sauvignon Blanc and 15% Chardonnay, this wine is medium straw in the glass and has a nose of peach, Turkish delight and lilac. It is full in the mouth, offering flavors of ripe summer peach, rose petal and eucalyptus. The final moments are punctuated by a delightful blend of soft peach and strong mint flavors.",88,Massaya 2014 White (Bekaa Valley),,,,
"Heady aromas suggesting tropical fruit, honeysuckle and citrus zest lead the nose. Bright and refreshing, the lively palate offers mature white stone fruit, tangerine peel and a pleasantly bitter-almond note.",88,Stemmari 2016 Estate Grown Grillo (Sicilia),,,,
"This premier-cru vineyard, wholly owned by the Devillard family, has produced a broad, ripe wine. It is generous, somewhat muted at this stage although promising plenty of citrus and yellow fruits and acidity as it ages. The wood aging creates a smooth hint at the back. Drink from 2021.",91,Domaines Devillard 2015 Château de Chamirey La Mission Premier Cru  (Mercurey),,,,
"This is a great Chianti Classico Riserva that offers everything you look for in a wine from Tuscany. There's freshness and pristine cherry aromas along with spice, black mineral and fresh acidity on the close. The wine is approachable, soft and ultimately very food-friendly.",90,Tenimenti Angelini 2005 San Leonino Riserva  (Chianti Classico),,,,
Light volatile aromas distract from this blend of Seven Hills (75%) and Les Collines vineyards. The fruit flavors seem a bit leaner than expected and also somewhat dried out.,87,North by Northwest 2012 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"This is a super-ripe, still very young wine. It's showing all its concentrated fruits, wood aging flavors and dense texture as well as the firm tannins that will allow it to age. With its combination of black plum skin, blackberry and dark concentration, leave the wine until 2018.",91,Herdade do Rocim 2012 Red (Alentejano),,,,
"Black cherry, mocha and pepper lead on this easy-drinking red from Chaddsford. On the palate, soft cherry fruit, cedar spice and chocolate give the wine a luscious edge. Pair with Mexican mole, spiced ribs or pasta.",86,Chaddsford 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Pennsylvania),,,,
"Subtle aromas of plum, blackberry and a whiff of baking spice emerge in the glass. The polished palate offers black cherry, clove and a hint of tobacco alongside sleek, smooth tannins. Drink through 2018.",88,Gattavecchi 2012  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,,,,
"A finely balanced wine, bringing together the new wood flavors with structured tropical fruits. Plangent acidity is the binding agent, giving an excitingly refreshing wine with a bright finish.",90,Pierre André 2008 Premier Cru  (Saint-Aubin),,,,
"The red cherry fruit bears some mushroom notes among the cedar and clove accents, and there's a sense of hollowing-out that should not be evidenced at this age. It's light, showing some nice berry and spice flavors and a sweet woodiness. But it's too developed now for a 1997 riserva.",83,Piccini 1997 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"There is an attractive herbaceous character to this wine, yet it also has a softer, ripe and broad creamy side. Acidity keeps it all fruity and fresh. This 50-50 organic blend is ready to drink. Winemaker/owner Jean Labérenne, an opera fan, attributes his Presto wine to Mozart's Don Giovanni.",86,Domaine Seailles 2014 Presto Sauvignon Blanc-Sauvignon Gris (Côtes de Gascogne),,,,
"Blended from Red Willow, Marcoux and Oldfield vineyards, this 100% Syrah offers aromas of green olives, brown stems, dried herbs and raspberries. The palate has densely rich yet exceptionally well balanced fruit and savory flavors that are creamy in feel. It's flat-out stunning, winning on grace and elegance rather than sheer power alone.",95,Gramercy 2012 Lagniappe Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Cola, forest floor and black fruit give this an almost ominous bouquet, but the wine is sweet, ripe and true. Extracted but rewarding, with lots of fruit, flavor and fun. Don't expect elegance but rather big fruit and generosity.",87,Odfjell 2006 Armador Carmenère (Maipo Valley),,,,
"It leads with classic varietal aromas of stone fruit, crushed tomato vine and dried hay. The round palate delivers white peach, cantaloupe, and tropical fruit edged with notes of sage and mineral. Pair this with dishes based on asparagus.",89,Conti Formentini 2013 Caligo Sauvignon (Collio),,,,
"Rich and full in the mouth, packed with red fruits and black cherries. The wine is sweet, while keeping a tannic core. Drink next year.",87,Domaine Bertagna 2009 Les Dames Huguettes  (Côte de Nuits-Villages),,,,
"The Awatere Valley is a cooler subsection of Marlborough, where the wines can sometimes be a bit more leafy or herbal. This wine holds true to that pattern, but balances the celery leaf and tomato stalk character with melon and fig notes. It's verging on full-bodied, even a touch oily in texture, with a long, vibrant finish.",90,Eradus 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Awatere Valley),,,,
"This is opaque in color, with oaky, balsamic aromas of black fruits, mint and vanilla. In the mouth, this is muscular, with full and somewhat rough tannins. Toasty roasted blackberry flavors are peppery, minty and fully spiced, while on the finish this is packing all sorts of power and oak. Drink through 2021.",90,Montes 2014 Alpha Syrah (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"With 15% residual sugar, this dessert wine is decidedly sweet in apricot, pineapple, pear, honey, vanilla fudge and smoky flavors, with a brisk minerality. It maintains a zesty balance, with crisp acidity.",93,Ojai 2006 Solomon Hills Special Bottling Two Barrels Made Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"There's a dusty, musty note to this wine that mutes it and doesn't blow off, even after a long time in the glass. The underlying Pinot seems fine. It's dry and silky and elegant, with cherry and smoky oak flavors. Hard to predict its future.",87,Dutton-Goldfield 2006 Devil's Gulch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Marin County),,,,
"This is a rich and creamy white with balanced acidity, a wine made in a voluptuous style without being heavy. Grassy notes meld seamlessly with juicier aspects of pineapple and pear, with a crisp undercurrent of refreshment.",88,Foppiano 2016 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),,,,
"From fruit grown in Carneros, 74% of it Chardonnay and 26% Pinot Noir, this includes grapes from both Hudson and Hyde vineyards. Gorgeously full bodied and elegant, it's dry on the palate with vibrant acidity to balance the tangy flavors of cherry, pomegranate and cranberry.",92,Schramsberg 2012 Querencia Brut Rosé Sparkling (Napa Valley),,,,
"La Grava (gravel) shows only modest differences from the silt, stone and sand wines in TintoNegro's soil-based series of 2012 Malbecs. Black-fruit aromas, herbal notes and solidity define the nose, while the palate is tight, juicy and racy, with red-fruit acidity. Nervy plum and raspberry flavors come with chocolaty oak and an agile, spicy finish. Drink through 2021.",91,TintoNegro 2012 Finca La Escuela La Grava Soil Experts Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Cotton candy and apple cider aromas give way to a mild palate with soft acidity but a sense of complexity. Plump red-fruit flavors are not specific, and overall this blend of Tempranillo, Syrah and Garnacha is appealing but slightly vacuous.",86,Alcardet 2015 Sommelier Tempranillo-Syrah-Garnacha Rosé (La Mancha),,,,
"Lightly flavored with red fruits, it's pleasant but rather generic. It carries some alcohol heat through a thin finish.",86,Cave B 2011 Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Opening aromatically effusive as a rose garden, this wine takes on darker, thicker overtones of baked strawberry rhubarb as a heaviness of tannin and oak permeates the midpalate. Its youthful power should mellow as an underlying, almost carbonic freshness lurks.",91,Belden Barns 2015 Estate Grown Grenache (Sonoma Mountain),,,,
"Wild red berry and crushed flower aromas lead the nose on this lively red. The juicy palate doles out sour cherry, raspberry, almond and a lightly balsamic note. It's nicely balanced with bright acidity and soft, polished tannins.",89,St. Pauls 2013 Passion Vernatsch Schiava (Alto Adige),,,,
"Initially closed, this releases subdued aromas suggesting toasted nut, menthol, wild berry and blue flower after a hearty swirl. The palate is equally shy, offering red cherry and white pepper hints, with racy acidity and taut tannins that lend a firm finish. Give it a few more years to unwind, and drink after 2020.",88,Fontanafredda 2014 Coste Rubin  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Here's a bright and delicious ripasso, loaded with notes of black cherry, exotic spice, white pepper and a hint of bitter almond. It has both freshness and structure, making this perfect to pair with savory stews, salami or grilled steaks.",88,Manara 2010 Le Morete  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso),,,,
"Creamy peach and vanilla aromas are perfectly attractive, as is the palate. There's plenty of peach, mango and citrus pith flavors to make it worthy, and the finish is long and citrusy. Surprisingly good given the paltry price and Argentina's dearth of success with Viognier.",87,Santa Julia 2007 Viognier (Mendoza),,,,
"COS is a natural, biodynamic and organic wine estate in southern Sicily and a leader in the rising popularity of the Cerasuolo di Vittoria denomination. This expression is particularly delicate and expressive, with nuanced layers of wild berry, white chocolate and cola.",91,COS 2008  Cerasuolo di Vittoria Classico,,,,
"A floral tease of jasmine provides a perfumed opening to this wine, which follows in bright acidity and fresh, ripe layers of tangerine and peach. The oak is moderately present and integrated well.",88,Pacific Heights Wines 2015 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Bright and savory, this opens with aromas of blue flowers, mint, dark berry and an earthy whiff of underbrush. The firm palate doles out black cherry, crushed raspberry, peppermint and white pepper alongside firm, sleek tannins. Drink through 2020.",90,Gagliole 2012 Rubiolo  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"A fresh and fruity wine with soft tannins and black currant fruits. The wine has the warmth of the vintage, giving some roundness the texture and stalkiness which would be more apparent in a lesser vintage. Drink now and until 2018.",86,Château Grand Picard 2009  Bordeaux,,,,
"The winery pulled out all the stops on this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, yet the wine is so tannic and sharp now. Shows massively extracted black currant and oak flavors that run deep and long in the finish. Who knows what this wine might do in 10–15 years, but it's a roll of the dice.",91,V. Sattui 2009 Paradiso Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"This simple wine has aromas that recall red berries, espresso and toast. The palate is on the lean side, displaying notes of clove, cinnamon and coffee bean. Pair it with hearty first courses, like pasta topped with ragù.",86,Brunelli Martoccia 2012  Rosso di Montalcino,,,,
"A perplexing wine that should be better than it is. It's fairly dense and concentrated, with good depth of flavor. Beets, tomatoes, blackberries, sugared espresso and a myriad of crushed, dusty oriental spices fill the mouth. It's good and dry, with crisp acids and easy tannins. So what's the problem? It just lacks that extra kick. Maybe Rex Hill is diverting the best fruit to their three expensive Pinots.",85,Rex Hill 1999 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This label has had its ups and downs over the years. The 2010 Pinot Noir is one of the successes, and it boasts an effusive nose of roses, cherries, dusty earth and mocha. It's medium to full in the mouth, delivering cherry fruit and underpinnings of earth and spice. The finish is long, spicy and firm without being hard.",90,The Crossings 2010 Pinot Noir (Awatere Valley),,,,
"Among St. Clair's 2009 range of block Savvies, this is among the sweatiest, with pungent nettle and almost-asparagus notes on the nose. Yet on the palate, the wine is full-bodied, round and concentrated, with nectarine and honey elements punched up by bright herbal tones. Long and intense on the finish. Drink now.",89,Saint Clair 2009 Pioneer Block 20 Cash Block Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"The first red grape harvested each vintage—hence the Watchdog name—this Westside Paso wine shows vanilla-laden red-cherry sauce, allspice, plums and grapeseed on the nose. It's light and easy on the palate, with grape juice flavors picking up smoke, vanilla, cola, cream soda and mocha elements.",88,Pulchella 2013 Watchdog Bella Collina Vineyard Tempranillo (Adelaida District),,,,
"A fairly complex, rich and layered nose of stewed plum, root beer, mace and allspice is set against an oak-laden, vanilla-based structure on the nose of this bottling. The palate offers rich black plum, but with decent tang, as well as earthy chipped slate and iron elements, before settling into light licorice spice.",91,J. Lohr 2013 Fog's Reach Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco),,,,
"Touches of caramel and apple cider offset intense lemon acidity in this medium-dry spätlese. It's refreshingly juicy, with a reverberating citrus-rind finish.",87,Peter Nicolay 2013 Ürziger Goldwingert Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Lots of fruit power flows through this full-bodied wine, making it focused and delicious. A firm coating of tannin kicks in to add weight to the texture and help the flavors linger on the finish. Plum, smoke and black pepper are among the complex flavors. It's made from vines planted in 1910 at a nearly 2,000-foot elevation.",90,Sobon Estate 2013 Zinfandel (Fiddletown),,,,
"Here's a wine made with an unusual blend of Sangiovese, Syrah, Alicante and Carignan grapes. It opens with aromas of toasted oak, espresso and charred earth. The dense, extracted palate offers dried blackberry, baked plum, tobacco and licorice alongside a backbone of firm tannins. The fruit is drying up so drink soon.",87,La Mozza 2010 Aragone  (Maremma Toscana),,,,
Caramel and ripe red fruits show the weight of this wine. It has freshness from the warm plum flavors along with ripe accents of spice and pepper. The end has tangy acidity. Bordeaux Clairet lies between rosé and red in color and in taste.,87,Château Queyssard 2014  Bordeaux Clairet,,,,
"Roasted tomatoes, root vegetable and anise conspire on this sanguine nose from a winery based in the Gilroy area. It's light, even dainty on the palate, but packed with a spice bomb of flavors from fennel seed to Dr Pepper.",89,Sarah's Vineyard 2011 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Some raspberry fruit in the aroma, but things turn rapidly earthy and herbal, suggesting dried tomato, rhubarb and oregano. The flavors are simple and uninspiring. Soft, mild, rustic and thin are other words that come to mind.",82,Camelot 1997 Pinot Noir (California),,,,
"A wine that needs some aging. It is restrained at the moment, holding back its rich, very textured fruit flavors, along with acidity and a core of citrus. Keep for 2–3 years. Screwcap.",90,Maurer 2010 Urkristal Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),,,,
"Roasted, leathery and rubbery berry aromas are gritty and short on brightness. This feels rugged but good. Jammy cassis and cherry flavors show notes of cocoa and herbs.",86,Bodega Classica 2015 Hacienda Lopez de Haro  (Rioja),,,,
"Heavy, chunky and waxy, and really not that appealing. There's more than enough baked notes, corn and mealy qualities. Not much else to say.",81,Asunto de Vino 2008 Chardonnay (Central Valley),,,,
"This zesty Moldovan Feteasca Regala has aromas of pineapple, lemon zest and pear. In the mouth there are flavors of lemon juice, lime pith and a hint of cantaloupe.",87,Château Vartely 2014 D'Or Feteascǎ Regalǎ (Moldova),,,,
"Among Genium's fine lineup of 2010 Priorat reds, this one stands out for it's schisty nose of cherry, currant and raspberry. A ripe, layered, chiseled palate is tough but rewarding. Cherry, cassis and plum flavors finish fiery and minerally, even by Priorat standards. Drink through 2025.",92,Genium Celler 2010 Ecològic Red (Priorat),,,,
"The producer's first release from this vineyard site, and 100% varietal, this is a sultry wine, generously aromatic in cinnamon and clove. Spicy, soft and elegant, it also offers cassis and currant, finishing in earthy waves that end lean.",92,Davies 2012 Winfield Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Calistoga),,,,
"A pure expression of the Garganega grape, Rocca Sveva is a fresh and tart Soave Classico with spicy notes of stone fruit, yellow flower and dried herbs. Pair this wine with easy grilled tuna steak and sesame sauce.",87,Cantina di Soave 2010 Rocca Sveva  (Soave Classico),,,,
"Soft and simple, with ultraripe blackberry and cherry flavors that veer into currants, dark chocolate and raisins, this Merlot has the benefit of being bone dry, with smooth, fine tannins. Drink now.",83,Ancient Peaks 2006 Merlot (Paso Robles),,,,
"This is a fresh, bright Syrah that's also rich in flavor and texture, lush in plum and raspberry with a proper hit of pepper on the finish. With 6% Viognier in the mix, it shows some floral bouquet among the depth of earthy caramel and coconut.",90,Baxter 2009 Valenti Vineyard Syrah (Mendocino County),,,,
"Lavish aromas of honeysuckle, peach and lemon abound in this vivacious, zippy Riesling. Dry in style, the palate is a bracing crush of white grapefruit and lime flavors that intensify through the long finish, accented by ripples of slate-like mineral.",90,Schloss Vollrads 2013 Volratz 1573 Riesling (Rheingau),,,,
"This wine is produced by the Malan family of Simonsig Estate from purchased grapes. Light, fresh, with crisp, green fruit, it is an easy, pleasant wine to drink, well-made and delicious. There's a lovely, creamy, toffee aftertaste. Best Buy.",86,Malan 2000 Family Vinter's Chardonnay (Stellenbosch),,,,
"This is a classic style of California Cabernet that puts fascinating mint, black-cherry and black-olive flavors on a firm frame of fine-grained tannins and a medium body. It has excellent concentration and good balance. Best through 2024.",90,Briceland 2014 Ishi Pishi Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Humboldt County),,,,
"Rich, fruity and with a full texture, this smooth, creamy wine has great fruit, deliciously cut with acidity. The wine is smooth, hinting at toast, with a tighter, more textured aftertaste. Drink from 2020.",92,Roux Père et Fils 2015 Les Corton Premier Cru  (Saint-Aubin),,,,
"Approachable and fresh, this is a wine to pair with seafood salad or grilled tuna. It offers pretty fragrances of stone fruit, citrus and honey. Peter Warren Selections & Planet Wine.",87,Podere San Cristoforo 2010 Luminoso White (Maremma Toscana),,,,
"Soft and richly fruity, this has all the right red cherry and banana flavors that are immediately attractive. A delicious, juicy wine. Screwcap.",85,Mommessin 2011 Nouveau  (Beaujolais),,,,
"Pretty cranberry and light red berry fruits are swathed in a decidedly herbal, earthy blanket. Nothing is over-matched however, as all these 2012 Winderlea Pinots show perfect balance. The finish brings a light dusting of cocoa.",89,Winderlea 2012 Crawford Beck Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
"Soft and full in the mouth, with spice adding an extra dimension to the broad berry fruits. The wine is ready to drink, its acidity melding well into the richness. The final taste is solid and dense.",88,Château la Croix Melin 2008  Saint-Émilion,,,,
"Rudimentary aromas of lemon-lime and apple set up a flat palate. This tastes of dried apricots before turning decidedly bitter. On the finish, flavors of dried white fruits are modest.",83,Valentin Bianchi NV Casa Bianchi Brut Traditional Method  (Mendoza),,,,
"Made with organically grown Catarratto and Pinot Grigio grapes, this offers intense honeysuckle aromas that recall room freshener. The lean, simple palate offers tart green apple and a hint of citrus.",84,Tresa 2013 Purato White (Terre Siciliane),,,,

"Jumilla is a red-wine region, but this Sauvignon Blanc is a citrusy example of a tastyquaffable white from the area. Aromas of citrus peel are mildly pyrazinic, while this feels plump and balanced, but with spritz. Core citrus flavors come with a sprinkle of salt.",87,Monterebro 2015 Blanco Sauvignon Blanc (Jumilla),,,,
"Soft, attractively fresh, but simple, this shows lively apple and cream flavors, rounded by light tannins. It's pleasant, but it does need to fill out.",86,Guilbaud Frères 2007 Domaine de la Moutonnière  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),,,,
"This is a lovely Sauvignon that opens with huge aromatic intensity and flavors of stone fruit, chopped basil and citrus. Expressive and bright, it's true to the semi-aromatic variety. Screwcap.",90,Livio Felluga 2011 Sauvignon (Collio),,,,
"Bright and crisp, but with nice depth and length, too, this medium-bodied wine is delicious to drink and holds interest with a light touch of oak. Tangy grapefruit and lime flavors have a hint of brioche and the texture is very lively.",92,Darcie Kent Vineyards 2014 Old Gum Tree Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Livermore Valley),,,,
"Selected from barrel tastings, this mineral, vibrant wine demands aging. The flavors are bright white fruits, with a tropical touch, followed by a dense biting texture. Final grapefruit acidity tops this ageworthy wine.",93,Niepoort 2009 Redoma Reserva White (Douro),,,,
"Over the centuries, lava flows from Mount Etna have formed natural vineyard terracing and tiny farming pockets, each characterized by a unique microclimate. The Calderara Sottana is a particularly fortunate niche that produces high quality fruit, elegant aromas and firmly polished structure. This wine is silky, long and very beautiful.",93,Tenuta delle Terre Nere 2008 Calderara Sottana  (Etna),,,,
"Dominated by new oak, it opens with aromas of toasted wood and vanilla that muffle the ripe black fruit sensations struggling in the background. The concentrated palate offers oak, toast, overripe black cherry and vanilla alongside the warmth of alcohol despite the modest 14% abv. The finish is muddled, with sugar-plum sensations cut short by bitter, drying wood tannins.",86,Fanti 2009  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Produced by John Grochau (Grochau Cellars), this is stubbornly shut down, with hints of rubber tire in the aromas. Once you work past the reductive scents and flavors, it's a short wine with generic fruit and a quick finish.",85,Besadien 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This lean wine has light melon and dried herb aromas, an almost neutral flavor profile and short finish.",81,Cambridge & Sunset 2013 California Series Chardonnay (California),,,,
"Very deep color, potent aromas and a dense, but velvety texture paint a bold picture for this full-bodied wine. It has the drama and flavor recalling an expensive red, without overpowering tannins or a high price.",87,Bota Box 2013 Nighthawk Black Red (California),,,,
"A little rough all the way along, with olive, black cherry and blackberry aromas yielding to mildly tart berry flavors. Acidity is jumpy and twangy, making the wine a little hot and streaky. But that intensity will serve it well if you're drinking it with a burger or skirt steak. Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.",84,Concha y Toro 2006 Casillero del Diablo Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),,,,
"A light style, with straightforward citrus and green apple fruit, this widely available Chardonnay is clean and generic, unoaked and bone dry.",86,Hogue 2008 Genesis Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Although this is grassy and wiry smelling, there's enough ripe raspberry and red plum aromas to make the grade. A zesty, choppy feeling palate features plum, pie cherry and leafy berry flavors in front of a racy finish with decent follow through. This is 60% Malbec and 40% CS.",88,Finca Flichman 2011 Expresiones Reserve Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"This is a balanced, ripe wine. Soft tannins support the fruit well, offering some good potential. It is ready to drink, fruity and with acidity in the aftertaste.",87,Quinta dos Avidagos 2012 Premium Red (Douro),,,,
"A very light yellow-plum fruitiness colors nose and palate of this fresh, easy and soft white. Plummy friendliness is matched by equally sunny lemon freshness, resulting in a balanced, fruity, easy-drinking wine.",88,Domaine Charles Baur 2014 Pinot Blanc (Alsace),,,,
"Sweet scents of cherry and cola lead into a juicy, fruit-forward Pinot that mixes strawberry jam and raspberry pie. It sags a bit in the midpalate, then regroups and lays on some chewy tannins. The (apparent) acidification feels chalky and not quite resolved, but overall it's a tasty bottle of wine.",87,Methven Family Vineyards 2005 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This quite tart, young and spicy red pulls sharp and puckery cranberry fruit into focus. It's best enjoyed chilled, and would be a fine option for the base of a wine punch.",87,Walnut City WineWorks 2013 Jubilee Vineyard Dolcetto (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
It's all about oak in this Chardonnnay. Not much going on beyond the obvious attempt at flattery with buttered toast and vanilla flavors. Maybe a little peach and pineapple candy thrown in for good measure.,83,Starmont 2009 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),,,,
"Of the many flamboyant Champagne bottles, this is one of the most stylish with its elegant frosted glass. This aromatic wine is a 50-50 Chardonnay and Pinot Noir blend, with a crisp texture and fruits that are maturing well. It is ready to drink now.",93,Chanoine NV Tzarina No. 1  (Champagne),,,,
"As all the Icon Pinot Noirs have over the years, this one shows a fair amount of oak: cinnamon, toast and vanilla all mark the nose. But this medium-bodied wine also shows layers of soft, supple fruit underneath. Give it another year to integrate, then drink it over the next 3–4.",89,House of Nobilo 2007 Icon Pinot Noir (Marlborough),,,,
"This predominately Duras wine is fresh and fruity with an attractive depth of smoky tannins and structure. It is rich enough to age although its red currant fruitiness is delicious and juicy now. Drink now, or age until 2018.",87,Domaine d'Escausses 2014 Cuvée des Drilles Red (Gaillac),,,,
"While forward with stonefruit and honey, along with toasty oak and vanilla notes, this is a structured Viognier that's crisp and fresh. Drink with Thai food or buttery lobster.",89,Miraflores 2012 Estate Viognier (El Dorado),,,,
"This is a lean, tart, high-acid vintage for Washington State white wines. Hogue's reliable Pinot Grigio is herbaceous and clean, fresh and tangy.",86,Hogue 2011 Pinot Grigio (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A blend of Nebbiolo, Vespolina and Croatina, this opens with a medley of aromas that include ripe berry, underbrush, truffle, menthol, leather and spice. The firm palate delivers crushed black cherry, game, grilled herb, ground pepper and a balsamic note. It still has youthfully assertive tannins that need to unwind and soften. Drink 2016–2026.",90,Proprietà Sperino 2011 Uvaggio Red (Coste della Sesia),,,,
"A five-grape Bordeaux blend dominated by Merlot and Cab Franc, this is a deft mix of grapes nicely melded into a complete and satisfying wine. It's anchored by black cherry and cassis fruit, supple and focused. Surrounding that core fruit are layers of smoke, black olive, pencil lead and coffee grounds. It resonates gracefully through a long finish.",93,Baer 2007 Ursa Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"After a faulty first bottle of this wine, the second was a revelation: sexy, polished and lushly endowed with a mix of orange, apple, pear and apricot flavors. Its texture, length and definition are truly impressive.",92,Roco 2015 Gravel Road Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Herbal tones of bay and rosemary are upfront on the nose of this copper-pink rosé, grounded by notes of small red berries, currants and watermelon rind. It's light and easy, with fleeting flavors and a quick close. Drink up.",84,Château Ribaute 2015 Senhal d'Aric Rosé (Corbières),,,,
"Very fresh and vibrant, filled with zesty pear, citrus and pineapple fruit. Just a pleasure to drink, balancing lush fruit with zippy acids. Hints of apples and butter linger in the background.",89,Sherwood Estate 2000 Reserve Chardonnay (Canterbury),,,,

"This thrilling wine, sourced from the Phinny Hill vineyard in the Horse Heaven Hills, displays all the tense power of great Washington Cabernet Sauvignon. Deep flavors of berry, plum and cassis are threaded with gravelly streaks of tar, coffee and anise. Aged in 40% new French oak, it strikes a perfect balance through a long finish.",95,Gramercy 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Black-skinned fruit, underbrush and game aromas lead the nose of this wine. The round, simple palate evokes mature black cherry and clove. Drink soon.",86,Veglio 2015  Dolcetto d'Alba,,,,
"This exotic Cabernet Sauvignon, which is aged entirely in new French oak, needs time to develop. A savory edge of forest floor and cranberry drive the palate, while notes of pencil shavings, cedar and garrigue add depth. The palate is lifted in acidity, with tightly gripped tannins on the finish. Cellar through 2019.",94,En Garde 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),,,,
"This wine is a blend of Sangiovese (52%), Cabernet Sauvignon (32%) and Syrah. Aromas of bittersweet chocolate, herb, pencil lead, smoke, cranberry and dark fruit lead to palate-coating black-fruit flavors that display depth and density. It shows a lovely sense of balance and detail.",91,Saggi 2014 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Solid but flat aromas of olive and leafy berry fruits introduce a midland palate of moderate bounce and average body. Raspberry, plum, currant and herbal flavors finish fresh, but also woody and slightly bitter in taste.",86,Miguel Torres 2012 Santa Digna Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),,,,
"The top of the range from Château Ponzac, this is, as its alcohol suggests, pretty powerful. Almost black in color, it's a solid, chunky wine that still has its youthful tannins. Black fruits, berries and damsons are layered with wood and fruit tannins, giving a dense and concentrated character. It needs to age, so drink from 2018.",92,Château Ponzac 2012 Eternellement Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"Already showing some bricking around the rim, this estate-grown Pinot Noir mixes spicy strawberry and some residual fermentation flavors of biscuit and blood. Difficult to know how this one is going to age.",86,Luminous Hills 2009 Lux Pinot Noir,,,,
"Fleshy, ripe plum fruit is immediately apparent on the nose. The palate echoes similar flavors, albeit in a more dilute form. This is full of easy fruit with a slightly smoky edge. An uncomplicated, juicy wine for drinking while the flavors are still fresh.",86,Lenz Moser 2015 Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),,,,
"This rough and tumble Cabernet is oaky and smoky in both scent and flavor. It's a rustic, country wine, big and bold and raw around the edges, but packed with flavor.",86,Jacob Williams 2010 Eagle Ranch Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (OR)),,,,
"Nice Cabernet flavors in this dry, softly appealing wine. Satisfies with waves of blackberries and black currants, touched with oak. Drink now, and easy to find, with 38,000 cases produced.",86,Souverain 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Bright citrus and apple aromas and flavors meet light vanilla and butter nuances in this medium-bodied, dry and nicely complex wine. It goes beyond the simple description of refreshment and takes on more personality and interest.",90,Handley 2014 Pinot Gris (Anderson Valley),,,,
Ripe pear is bathed in honey on the nose and palate of this wine. There is a touch of pleasant bitterness reminiscent of fir honey. All this is countered by lemon zest freshness that brightens and lightens and brings beautiful balance and poise. The finish is moreish and refreshing. Drink 2017–2030.,93,Cave de Turckheim 2013 Hengst Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"A fruity, fresh and crisp wine, this is given some weight by the inclusion of Chardonnay in the blend. It has an attractive texture, and the lemon and grapefruit flavors dominate.",85,Herdade dos Templários 2011 Vale das Donas Branco White (Tejo),,,,
"There's no other wine like this in the world, and it won't appeal to everyone. Anfora is matured in ceramic amphorae for seven months in a throwback to ancient winemaking techniques to achieve a deep golden color and penetrating aromas of resin, caramel, chestnut honey and cola. The firmstructure could match that of a mature red and the wine imparts resinous, almost syrupy density.",93,Gravner 2003 Anfora Ribolla Gialla (Venezia Giulia),,,,
"Plum and red berry aromas start this integrated red blend, which is released only in the best years. On the palate, plum, warm spice and oak tones create a rich but clean character. The wine is structured and has room to age.",89,Lyrarakis 2008 Symbolo Grand Cuvée Red (Crete),,,,
"This is one of those special Lambruscos that you know will pair with regional foods such as tortellini with melted butter and cheese. The wine's bright fruit tones, crisp acidity and delicate effervescence will keep the palate clean. There's a touch of sweetness on the thin finish.",84,Cà Montanari 2012 Operapura  (Lambrusco Grasparossa di Castelvetro),,,,
"This offers ripe notes of prune and blackberry, with a nutty nuance. The mouthfeel is round, plush and smooth.",87,Viticultori Associati Canicatti 2010 Centuno Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),,,,
"This wine is produced from the best parcels of the estate, located an hour east of the Atlantic Ocean. The result gives an intense, concentrated character with crisp, tight lemon and pink grapefruit flavors. Still developing, the texture is mineral and nervy. The wine will benefit from a bit more time in the bottle so drink from 2016.",88,Domaine des Tilleuls 2014 Essentielle  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),,,,
"The Ratti proved to be a rich, pleasant, gentle wine, showing lots of plummy fruit, not much acidity and a medium finish. The wine will marry well with a variety of foods, thanks to its hefty texture and its easygoing personality.",85,Renato Ratti 2004 Villa Pattono Red (Monferrato),,,,
"Although it's 100% varietal and comes from one of the state's oldest Cabernet vineyards, this wine is somewhat blue-fruited for the variety, with notes of plum and mountain blueberry along with herb, graphite, espresso and spice. The palate shows more of the same, bringing a sense of restraint and polish along with lightly grainy tannins that need some time to stretch their legs. It doesn't scream Cabernet but it still brings plenty of appeal. Best after 2022.",90,Rasa 2014 Plus One Kiona Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),,,,
"Pink-orange in color, this is a tangy, high-acid wine that's not for everyone, given its bracing mix of tangerine and grapefruit. Light-bodied, yet textured, it's a good quaffer and food-friendly companion.",88,Merriam 2015 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This superconcentrated red delivers savory aromas of cured meat, wild mushroom, exotic spice with bold fruit tones of prune, plum and dried blackberry. It's a bold wine that would pair with fire-grilled steak.",90,Lungarotti 2007 Toralco Red (Umbria),,,,
"Dark and brawny, this opens with almost impenetrable concentration and bold aromas of jammy fruit, blackberry, espresso, cedar and moist tobacco. It has a smooth, rich texture, with lively highlights of teriyaki, ginger and cola.",91,Brunelli 2009  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,,,,
"A 80-20 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this opens with a polished bouquet that's comprised of red fruit, spice and rubber notes, enhanced by leather, tobacco, dark cherry fruit and exotic spice accents. A hint of Band-Aid brings up the rear.",86,Poggio alle Querce 2009 Il Guado  (Bolgheri),,,,
"Round but lifted with racy pineapple-infused acidity in the mouth, this Chard offers ripe melon and red apple flavors to balance the serious cut. A hint of peach pit nuttiness stays through the finish.",86,Glenelly 2010 The Glass Collection Chardonnay (Stellenbosch),,,,
"Easygoing and not particularly intense, this fresh Chianti from the hills around Siena offers good integrity of cherry, blueberry and red currant flavors. The short finish is highlighted by a sprinkle of spice and cinnamon.",84,Vèscine 2006  Chianti Colli Senesi,,,,
"Honeysuckle, mineral, honey and botrytis aromas lead the way. This drinks off dry with exceptionally well-balanced acidity that carries through the lingering finish.",90,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2014 Cold Creek Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"The aromatics immediately catch your attention: an inviting mix of raspberry and tart citrus. The wine is tightly focused, with crisp edges around wild-berry flavors. Just a tiny hint of bloody beef moves it toward more Northern Rhône Syrah flavors.",87,Sweet Cheeks 2013 Barrel Select Syrah (Southern Oregon),,,,
"A little bramble and pickle on the nose tells us that this may never have gotten 100% ripe and over the top. Still, we admire and are intrigued by this Alicante blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% each of Syrah and Merlot. Feelwise, it's a little bit chunky but hardly fat, and the flavors are plummy, red and a touch sharp in the middle. Drink now.",87,Enrique Mendoza 2002 Reserva Santa Rosa Red (Alicante),,,,
"Sourced from six different vineyards, this is a broadly pleasing wine, fruity in blackberry and raspberry that veers even into cranberry and cassis territory without getting bogged down. Substantial and lush, it's tightly woven in tannin and savory herb, ready to open itself over time. Patience will reward with more exotic interweavings of vanilla-cola and tea.",90,Merry Edwards 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"It leads with dense aromas of black fruit, plum, spice and dried rose petals. The rich palate offers juicy black cherry and red raspberry accented with notes of white pepper, cinnamon clove and cocoa alongside bracing tannins. It closes on a note of black licorice. Drink 2020–2030.",91,Clavesana 2010 Olo  (Barolo),,,,
"Fragrant and fresh, this is a luminous and creamy sparkler with frothy foam and persistent perlage. The wine is flatter and broader in the mouth than most and has a smooth but thick texture.",86,Carpenè Malvolti NV Cuvée Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Conegliano),,,,
"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Franc (33%), Cabernet Sauvignon (30%) and Merlot (20%) topped off with Malbec and Petit Verdot. It brings aromas of leafy herbs and dark brewed coffee that lead to easy-drinking flavors that persist.",90,Wilridge 2013 Mélange Noir Estate Wilridge Vineyard Red (Naches Heights),,,,
"Stalky, briary raspberry aromas set up a tannic palate with more burnt bitterness than bright fruit flavors. Tart plum and red currant notes are leafy and peppery, with heat and burn.",83,Anko 2013 Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Either there's some residual sugar or the high alcohol, 15.8%, gives this wine a sweet taste, or both. Either way, it tastes like liquified raspberry, cherry and blackberry jam, with a squeeze of chocolate syrup. One-third new oak adds caramel and butterscotch.",84,St. Amant 2005 Marian's Vineyard Zinfandel (Lodi),,,,
"This salmon-hued rosé Cava opens with aromas of cotton candy, vanilla and yeast. On the tongue, it's simple in structure and feels a lot like citrus juice with bubbles.

"Aromas of sweet plum, leather and spicebox lead to chocolate, coffee and cherry flavors with a soft, supple feel. It shows a pleasing mixture of fruit and barrel.",89,Tamarack Cellars 2012 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
This wine is listed at 19.5% alcohol and it smells every bit of it. Alcohol aromas overwhelm any sense of the variety and provide a burn to the floral flavors.,81,Wilridge 2014 Estate Dessert Wine Wilridge Estate Vineyard Muscat Blanc (Naches Heights),,,,
"Fattoria La Massa has produced an exciting wine that will appeal to those who love a big, opulent style. A blend of Sangiovese and Merlot, this boasts an inky appearance, and delivers enormous tones of tobacco, leather, coffee bean, blue flowers and lead pencil. It's soft and lush and certainly does not lack power or concentration.",92,Fattoria La Massa 2003 Giorgio Primo Red (Toscana),,,,
"Intense and elegant, it brings together sensations of violet, crushed red berry, mineral and cake spices that are supported by firm but fine tannins and brisk acidity. Fermented with wild yeasts, it illustrates the vibrant character of the vintage. Drink 2018–2040. Acid Inc Selections, Stefano Miretti Imports.",94,Brezza 2010  Barolo,,,,
"This has all the size and weight you've come to expect from Australia's most famous wine. Huge fruit and huge oak combine in a full-bodied, richly textured package that delivers waves of toasted coconut, vanilla and intense dark berries yet remains embryonic more than five years after the harvest. That said, the texture isn't quite as tight or as fine as some other vintages—expect this to be early maturing by Grange standards, and best from 2020–2040.",98,Penfolds 2008 Grange Shiraz (South Australia),,,,

Velvety tannins carry the warm, ripe flavors.",89,Tenuta di Arceno 2011 Strada al Sasso Riserva  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"This medium-bodied, easygoing red offers aromas of blue flowers, dark berry, underbrush and a whiff of cake spice.

"This medium- to full-bodied red features bright fruit accented by oak. Vanilla strongly marks the nose, yet cherry and raspberry also come through, tinged with baking spices. Crisp and firm on the finish; try pairing with rich cuts of red meat.",90,Pauletts 2007 Andreas Premium Polish Hill River Shiraz (Clare Valley),,,,
"Tightly wound raspberry fruit is the dominant flavor here, with slightly chalky, lemony acids wrapping up the finish.

"This wine offers caramelized apple, seared pear, honeysuckle, a touch of buttercream and vanilla ice cream on the even, well-measured nose.

"This property excels in some vintages,and the 2015 is a huge success. It's certainly complex, effortlessly combining hints of pungency with soothing notes of grapefruit. In the mouth, it's fairly full and creamy in texture, then punctuates that richness with a long, vibrant finish.",93,Clos Henri 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"Blackberry, clove and violet aromas make for a full and pleasant bouquet. This young RDD is tight and firm in the mouth, but not overly tannic or hard. Oak, roasted berry and spice flavors settle on a lightly woody, fairly long finish.",88,Viña Mayor 2012 Tinto Roble  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"Floral and honey aromas are touched with earthy hints of saffron and pollen on this bold, lushly textured Riesling. The palate is quite full bodied, with intense flavors of stone fruits, poached pears and spice, but finishes long and elegant.",89,Hermann J. Wiemer 2011 Magdalena Vineyard Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This salmon-hued bottling from Pinot Noir shows cantaloupe, watermelon Jolly Rancher and pink rose petal scents on the nose. The palate delivers bright acidity, presenting more watermelon flavors, a compelling texture and a gunmetal finish.",88,Cambria 2016 Rose of Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"Intense, alcoholic, and wonderfully complex, with layers of toast, spice and fruit. The vines range from 50 to 80 years old or more; the wine is robust, balanced and muscular. St. Francis makes a flat-out wonderful Zin year after year, vintage after vintage, big and bellisimo.",91,St. Francis 1998 Old Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma County),,,,
"Light and crisp, it offers layers of lemon chiffon and spicy pear. The at-first luxurious mouthfeel evolves smoothly into crisper, citrus-wrapped acidity. This is a sippable, ideal summer wine.",88,Dry Creek Vineyard 2011 Foggy Oaks Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,

"There are tons of rich, ripe flavors in this soft, high-alcohol California rendition of Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Based on Mourvèdre and Grenache, it offers a blast of sweet cherry jam, blackberry, creamy mocha and spice.",88,Adelaida 2009 Anna's Vineyard Version Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"A bit overripe, with a raisiny taste behind the black currants, and also quite dry and tannic, with a hard, mouth-locking, dusty astringency. The combination definitely strikes you as unbalanced, and not likely to age out.",86,Swanson 2006 Alexis Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),,,,
"A powerful, tannic wine, very dry and firm. Underneath the dry exterior, there are great fruits waiting to fully express themselves. It will always be a structured wine, the black fruits a serious component along with the spice from wood aging. Keep for 4–5 more years.",89,Quinta de São Sebastião 2009 Reserva Red (Lisboa),,,,
"A light orange-pink colored wine, this is poised, bright and fruity. Raspberries dominate, giving fresh character as well as bringing in great fruitiness.",86,Domaine du Claouset 2014 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),,,,

"Tropical fruit aromas come with notes of bath soap and white-flower blossom. This is easygoing and healthy on the palate, with just enough snappy acidity.

"Shows some older notes: a bouquet of toasted white bread, cinnamon, brown sugar and smoky yeast, with just the slightest hint of white pepper. Really rich and complex, with supple lime flavors offsetting the earthy impression. Very dry, with an overall excellent palate impression. Should continue to age and grow finer.",91,Jacquart 1992 Blanc de Blancs Brut Mosaïque  (Champagne),,,,

"Impressive at any price, but especially notable at this cost, this 100% varietal red is a testament to the power and concentration of the vintage, integrated with a push of tannin on the back of the tongue. Spicy clove and pepper ride a wave of cassis, dark cherry and chocolate, needing time to unwind in the glass. It will do well in the cellar through 2028.",92,Vinum Cellars 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Made with 100% Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of new wood, roasted coffee bean and menthol.

"A fine wine from Septima, most likely with Malbec at its base (though the label says nothing of the sort). Aromas of blackberry, raspberry, perfume, pepper and asphalt are attractive, and the rooty richness and slight medicinality of the core flavors are unique but not out of focus. One of the winery's best wines to date.",91,Septima 2007 Gran Reserva Red (Mendoza),,,,

"Big and bold, this is going to be an impressive Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon blend from a 2.5-acre plot on the Queyrens family estate. It has great red fruits and generous acidity, both of which are given a strong sense of structure by the tannins. At the moment, it is about potential, so wait until 2017.",90,Château Pilet 2012 Cuvée Prestige  (Côtes de Bordeaux),,,,
"An off-dry character sets the scene for this concentrated, already balanced wine. The Hatschbourg vineyard in the southern Alsace village of Voegtlinshoffen is composed of clay and chalk soil on a southeast-facing slope. It gives exceptional ripeness, as here, a warm and full-bodied wine with great swathes of fruitiness. Drink from 2017.",91,Joseph Cattin 2013 Hatschbourg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,

"A smoky, sharp aroma mingles with fruitiness. The wine tastes like raspberries and dried cranberries, and feels firm with tannins and acidity.",84,Wise Villa 2012 Estate Grown and Produced Sangiovese (Sierra Foothills),,,,
"Girard's recent Petite Sirahs have been great, really defining a Napa approach to the variety, and their 2010 is right up there. It's fairly high in alcohol, but there's no trace of overripeness. You'll find delicious blackberry jam, black currant, grilled bacon and black pepper flavors that finish dry, spicy and above all, satisfying. Wonderful now, but it should easily negotiate the next 10 years in the bottle.",92,Girard 2010 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),,,,
"Charred beef, blackberries, elderberries and sweet tar aromas show on this small-batch wine made by a couple from Texas. There's decent density on the palate, with lots of blackberry fruit and black pepper as well as extremely bright acidity that will keep this wine alive for years.",91,Kagan 2010 White Hawk Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Very dense and layered in grilled cherry, raspberry, cocoa, spice and cola flavors, this full-bodied wine needs rich barbecues and stews to tame its bigtime tannins. The fruit is so ripe, it tastes sweet, but this Zin is actually very dry.",87,Sobon Estate 2008 Old Vines Zinfandel (Amador County),,,,
"A lush fruit nose, with plenty of blackberry jam, woodsmoke and anise. Quite chunky on the palate, but amaiable and easy going, although not a particularly long finish. A pleasant food friendly wine for a weekday night after a hard day at work.",89,Ca' Viola 2005 Barturot  (Dolcetto d'Alba),,,,
"Almost as yellow as a white wine with just a tiny touch of blush coloring, this blend of 60% Counoise and 40% Cinsault shows lychee, ripe pears, watermelon juice, lemon juice and a touch of orange rind on the nose. The flavors are very light, so it's more about texture, with lime juice acidity and pear skin grip.",87,Martellotto 2014 La Rosa Rosé (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"A hint of honeysuckle perfume lends flair to this dry, easy-quaffing Riesling. It's fairly straightforward on the palate, with fresh apple and lemon flavors, but brisk and bright, with pineapple acidity and a swathe of fresh herbs on the finish.",87,Schmitges 2011 Grey Slate Dry Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Here's a compact and easy Müller-Thurgau that shows medium aromatic intensity with citrus, peach and brimstone. The wine's crisp, dry close with its subtle touch of honey makes it perfect for fried finger foods or tempura.",86,Girlan 2011 Müller-Thurgau (Alto Adige),,,,
"Blended with some Merlot, this Cab has high alcohol that makes it hot and glyceriney sweet. The blackberry and black cherry fruit flavors show jammy richness. The wine isn't going anywhere, so drink up.",86,Sculpterra 2010 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"Pressed honeysuckle, beeswax and orchard fruit aromas come together on this. The medium-bodied palate offers passion fruit, creamy white peach, vanilla and mineral while a hint of toasted almond closes the finish.",89,Cornarea 2011 Enritard  (Roero),,,,
"This is labeled as Cabernet but is a Bordeaux-style blend that includes small percentages of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. At the moment the wine is not especially expressive. There are hints of peppery herb in the nose, lightly ripe red fruits, and a pleasing, buttery finish.",88,Abeja 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Tart and fruity, this mixes strawberry and citrus flavors. There is some indication of stem contact, and the tannins have some grip to them. Drink now through 2020.",87,Apolloni 2014 Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Hints of ceder, bramble and smoked nuts add savory complexity to this ripe, full-bodied Syrah full of succulent black cherry and berry flavors. It's approachable yet elegant, framed by soft, feathery tannins and a zesty spray of cranberry acidity add. Drink now through 2018.",90,Chateau Lafayette Reneau 2013 Syrah (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This gold-colored sweet Xarello is lightly oxidized, with aromas of butterscotch, baked squash and honey. The longer it sits, the better it gets, and that's despite blazing acidity. Flavors of pears in syrup, melon and honey finish long due to intense acidity.",89,Alta Alella 2015 Blanc de Neu Pansa Blanca (Alella),,,,
"Made in a sweetly ripe, oaky manner, this is a drink-me-now Pinot Noir. Easy to like for its jammy raspberry, cherry and Dr. Pepper cola flavors. The acidity and soft tannins define the modern Russian River style.",88,Signaterra 2009 Bella Luna Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This bottling is an ode to Bill Foley's Texas roots. It shows dried strawberry, rich olallieberry, baked cherry, black-cardamom cream and plum cookies on the deliciously spiced, fruit-forward nose. The palate is refreshing and fresh, with black raspberry and black-pepper flavors.",88,Foley 2013 T Anchor Ranch Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Chapoutier has crafted a beautiful Condrieu. It may have high levels of new wood flavors, but of greater importance is the ripe Viognier, with powerful spice flavors and concentration. There is a sense of elegance as well as power which gives the wine a fine presence.",92,M. Chapoutier 2000  Condrieu,,,,
"As sweet as Port, with chocolate and prune flavors. Feels as hot as a chile pepper, with nearly 17% alcohol.",81,Mazzocco 2006 Reserve West Dry Creek Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"An oaky, concentrated wine, this is briary in robust black and blue fruit that offers a smidgen of black tea. Tannic, this is a powerful wine from a powerful vintage, exuding much of the appellation's earthy signature.",87,Buena Vista 2013 Pinot Noir (Carneros),,,,
"Extreme pepper elements, from peppercorn to bell pepper, carry through this entire experience. The nose also shows red berries, while the palate offers barely ripe strawberry notes. Fans of the peppery style, which often benefits from a slight chill, will be enthused. Those who hate pyrazines should stay away.",88,Jason-Stephens 2012 Estate Cabernet Franc (Santa Clara Valley),,,,
"An aroma like black pepper and turned earth leads to flavors that are more savory and smoky than fruity. This is a sturdy, fairly tannic and full-bodied wine that wants to pair with rich proteins.",88,Lyeth 2012 Merlot (North Coast),,,,
"Tart, leafy, with light strawberry fruit. This has little depth, just a pleasant strawberry nose and a simple, fruity palate.",84,Columbia Crest 2008 Reserve Tempranillo (Wahluke Slope),,,,
"Smoky and dusty on the palate, this wine is soft and approachable, but also full bodied and ripe. It offers thick layers of chocolate mocha and vanilla.",88,Peter Paul Wines 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),,,,
"This smells like a cherry crumble pie that's been heavily hit with cinnamon and other brown spices and served on slate. It dances across the palate with hearty spice, very vibrant fruit, cola and acidity that carries from beginning to end.",90,San Simeon 2012 Pinot Noir (Monterey),,,,
"Earthy, alluring fragrances suggest bright berry, rose petal and tilled soil. The palate delivers ripe, wild cherry completed by notes of vanilla, white and black pepper alongside youthful, bracing tannins. Drink 2016–2024.",90,Albino Rocca 2011 Ovello Vigna Loreto  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Lots of richness in this smoky young Merlot. You'll find detailed flavors of grilled blackberries, red and black cherry preserves, leather, anise and cedar. It's a finely structured, dry wine whose tannins will work against rosemary-scented broiled lamb chops.",88,Matanzas Creek 2005 Merlot (Bennett Valley),,,,
"This is an up-and-coming variety for Washington and this wine displays why. Hailing from Olsen Vineyard, it's all about acid and texture, with the sleek starfruit and citrus-peel flavors playing second fiddle. Pair it with shellfish.",89,Rôtie Cellars 2014 Grenache Blanc (Washington),,,,
"Opulent yet refined with notes of rich black raspberry, plum flesh and cocoa flooding the nose and mouth. A touch of tar and acidic notes appear in the bouquet, but they are nuanced and balanced by the richer fruit and oak flavors. The finish is long and chocolate infused, with the dusty tannins lingering throughout.",89,DeWaal 2006 CT De Waal Pinotage (Stellenbosch),,,,
"This restina balances traditional flavor with a modern refinement. On the nose, subdued herbal/pine notes with a spry citrus edge. On the palate, a lively dance of acidity, lemon and lime peel and crushed herbs is playful and subtle. This is a fantastic food wine that will stretch from beginning to end of the meal.",90,Papagiannakos NV Retsina of Mesogaia Savatiano (Retsina),,,,
"Intense perfume and floral notes overcome ripe apple aromas. It's dry on the palate with flavors of savory apple and green herbs, but feels a bit flat and heavy in mouthfeel.",83,Palmer 2012 Albariño (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"Dark berry and lemony oak lead the aromas on this barrel-driven Malbec. In the mouth, it's resiny and creamy, while blackberry and woody flavors yield to café mocha. A resiny finish is loaded with overt oak character. Drink through 2018.",89,Valentin Bianchi 2011 Famiglia Bianchi Malbec,,,,
"Calling a wine romantic is perhaps a new approach for Bordeaux. The wine itself is ripe and jammy, with wood tannins that will be softer in a year. Drink from 2016.",86,Les Vignerons Réunis de Monségur 2012 Romantique  (Bordeaux),,,,
"Thick in tannins and smoothly textured, Graziano's old-vine Carignane has a taste of baked plum in cinnamon and nutmeg spice.",86,Graziano 2010 Old Vine Carignane (Mendocino County),,,,

"Although this Zin has a touch of overripeness in the form of raisins covered in chocolate, followed by a lot of blackberry and foxy mulberry. The wine is dry, smooth and balanced, with plenty of complexity.",89,Occidental Road Cellars 2009 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Made in a honey-sweet style, but the acidity is excellent, and balances the richness so that the finish is dry and clean. The flavors are very ripe in peaches, Key lime pie and vanilla custard. A nice cocktail sipper.",87,Coquelicot 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"The lighter of the two second wines of classed-growth Suduiraut, this is a more accessible reflection of the richness of the grand vin. At four years old, it's still young, its acidity and crisp lemon flavors contrasting its core of botrytis and delicious fruit. Drink this balanced wine from 2020.",92,Château Suduiraut 2013 Lions de Suduiraut  (Sauternes),,,,
"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (60%), Merlot (20%), Malbec (15%) and Cabernet Franc. It brings notes of herb, espresso and cherry that are followed by concentrated fruit flavors backed by burly tannins that need significant time to stretch their legs. Best after 2021.",91,L'Ecole No. 41 2013 Apogee Pepper Bridge Vineyard Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Counoise—a southern Rhône blending grape—only rarely appears as a varietal wine, but this distinctive bottling makes a strong case for it. It's not just another generic red wine; it has a particular mouthfeel—elegant, almost Pinot-like—coupled with firm, slightly metallic tannins, sharp acids and accents of pepper on stone. Somehow the wine feels, more than tastes, European.",89,Andrew Rich 2005 Counoise (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This is a light and fruity wine, with crisp citrus- and peppered-apple-driven acidity. It is bright, lined with straight, pure acidity.",85,André Kientzler 2010 Sylvaner (Alsace),,,,
"With some wood aging in French oak, the wine seems to have smoothed out the fruitiness. It is soft with a light spice and hints of green apple. The wine is ready to drink.",85,DFJ Vinhos 2014 Scancio Branco Reserva Alvarinho-Chardonnay (Lisboa),,,,
"This remarkably balanced semi-dry wine is intensely aromatic, with scents of preserved yellow peaches, saffron and spice. Juicy and ripe in stone fruit flavor, it's unabashedly forward, yet piercing acidity and delicate mineral tones lend elegance and style. Finishes with a lingering kiss of honey.",90,Dr. Konstantin Frank 2012 Reserve Riesling (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Aromas of yellow flower, candied orange zest and a balsamic note emerge in the glass. On the enveloping palate, a ginger note accents baked Gala apple and eucalyptus honey. Fresh acidity brightens the rich flavors.",91,Gigante 2008 Picolit (Friuli Colli Orientali),,,,
"Very floral, citrusy and perfumed upfront, retaining that lemony edge to help the retained carbon dioxide balance the inherent sweetness. Clean and refreshing on the finish.",84,Jacob's Creek 2010 Moscato (South Eastern Australia),,,,
True ice wines are a rarity in the Northwest. This one brings honeyed aromas of dried pineapple and mango that draw you into the glass. The flavors are sweet and rich but still manage to remain light on their feet. It's a perfect end to any meal.,92,Kiona 2016 Estate Grown Ice Wine Chenin Blanc (Red Mountain),,,,
"From a small family vineyard along the appellation's highest slopes, this is a powerfully concentrated, mountain-driven wine, leathery, grippy and dusty in tannin. Black licorice, raspberry and blackberry jam flavors provide weight and expansion on the palate, with a touch of heat on the finish.",90,Makana 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),,,,
"Sassoalloro offers good quality for a great price. This vintage is on the ripe side, with aromas of mature berry, maple syrup, resin and leather. Chewy, succulent tannins characterize this plush, fruit-forward Sangiovese.",91,Jacopo Biondi-Santi 2005 Sassoalloro Sangiovese Grosso (Toscana),,,,
"Restrained and soft on the nose, this light-bodied white offers subtle lemon zestiness and a phenolic seam that provide structure and food-friendliness with a savory, almost herbal edge.",89,Domäne Wachau 2013 Terrassen Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),,,,
"Just terrific, a classic Santa Cruz Mountain Cabernet from this consistent producer. It's bone dry, fine in balancing acidity and very tannic, with a sandpapery, lockdown mouthfeel. Yet it's wonderfully rich in blackberries, currants, cassis and chocolate. This outstanding young Cabernet should easily develop beyond 2015.",93,Thomas Fogarty 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"A high-acid, weighty and complex white, this vintage is even better than the last, gorgeous in a golden tannish color. Tropical guava and white flowers weave seamlessly through a web of minerality and freshness, without compromising body and texture. This is a delicious wine.",95,Wayfarer 2013 Wayfarer Vineyard Chardonnay (Fort Ross-Seaview),,,,
"Ripe, black-skinned fruit, dark spice and chopped herbs abound on this structured red. The big, bold palate offers ripe black cherry, blackberry extract, mocha and licorice while round tannins envelop the palate.",91,Le Salette 2012  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,,,,
"Big and ripe, this rich wine offers a good combination of spice and tropical fruits. It is bold, smooth and creamy. Deliciously ripe, it's ready to drink.",90,Domaine Michel 2015  Viré-Clessé,,,,
"Ripe plum, blue flower and an earthy whiff of truffle lead the nose, while the juicy palate offers black cherry and clove flavors with a hint of game. Chewy tannins provide the framework.",90,La Calonica 2013  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,,,,
Aromas of slightly overripe fruit lead to just off-dry fruit flavors. It lacks a sense of cohesion.,83,The Great Oregon Wine Company 2015 Rascal Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Oak extract, spearmint, espresso and mature plum aromas lead the nose on this simple, medium-bodied wine. The forward palate delivers overripe black berry fruit, vanilla and oak that finish on an almost sugary-sweet note. It's already evolved so drink soon.",86,San Polo 2012  Rosso di Montalcino,,,,
"Bright and refreshing, this opens with scents of honeysuckle, jasmine, pear and yellow stone fruit. The round but lively palate offers peach, green apple and a hint of white almond. Fresh acidity lifts the rich flavors.",89,Ceretto 2015 Blangè Arneis (Langhe),,,,
"Raspy berry and plum aromas lead to a palate dominated by tartaric acid. That, in turn, leads to sharp berry and plum flavors backed by a bracing finish.",85,The Seeker 2015 Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Jammy in raspberries and cherries, with a mouthwatering burst of acidity. But fundamentally this is a simple wine, and it also has some overripe raisin flavors.",84,Clos La Chance 2010 Reserve Merlot (Central Coast),,,,
"Showing the heat of the vintage, this opens with aromas of stewed fruit, scorched earth and a whiff of nail varnish that carry over to the extracted palate along with fleshy black cherry. A green note of powdered sage closes the finish. Drink 2018–2026.",88,Franco Conterno 2011 Panerole  (Barolo),,,,
"Fresh and fruity, this wine is all about red-currant fruitiness. It has only light tannins and plenty of juicy acidity. Drink from 2018.",87,Michel et Joana Ecard 2014 Aux Gravains Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),,,,
"Bright and spicy, this wine makes an immediate impact. The blueberry fruit has a sassy edge, and it penetrates through the middle into a finish with notes of black licorice, baking spices and coffee grounds. Firm, full and tight, the wine should age nicely now through 2025.",92,Colene Clemens 2012 Margo Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),,,,
"There may be a good wine here, but this Bordeaux blend is still very hard in tannins and acids, giving it a tough, unyielding mouthfeel. Yet there are deep flavors of currants, cassis and mocha. Could develop over the long haul. Try after 2011.",87,Dry Creek Vineyard 2005 The Mariner Meritage (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"From a Loire Valley-based producer, this wine is crisp and cool. It has herbal touches and lively, citrusy acidity. Drink now.",84,Villebois 2016 Loupart Le Petit Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de France),,,,
"This is a ripe Chardonnay with aromas of pineapple, Golden Delicious apple and honey. It's slightly thick and sticky on the close.",84,Caldora Vini 2010 Chardonnay (Terre di Chieti),,,,
"Off-dry in taste, this wine has an intense sweet-and-sour flavor. It didn't undergo malolactic fermentation, so there's plenty of green-apple-like acidity, and as it partially fermented in barrel, there is a vanilla-cream-like sweetness. This will pair well with Asian fare, ham or sausage.",86,Tin Barn 2011 Hi Vista Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Carneros),,,,
"Aromas of butterscotch, toasted oak, roasted coffee and espresso follow through to the palate along with notes of black pepper. There's not enough fruit richness to stand up to the astringent, woody tannins.",86,Prinsi 2011 Gaia Principe  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Made with organically farmed grapes, this offers enticing aromas of juicy black fruit, spiced blueberry, graphite and violet. The round, savory palate delivers layers of ripe dark cherry, white pepper and mineral alongside firm but polished tannins.",90,Vigna di Pettineo 2012  Cerasuolo di Vittoria Classico,,,,
"While dry in style, sumptuous black cherry and cassis notes lend a plummy feel to this Lemberger. It's an uncomplicated welcoming wine that's a bit plush in mouthfeel but invigorated by bright cranberry acidity on the finish. Drink now.",88,Grafen Neipperg 2012 Trocken Lemberger (Württemberg),,,,

"Silverado has a mixed track record with Sauvignon Blanc, a difficult variety to get right in Napa Valley, as it's very vintage specific. It tastes a little on the sweet side, bearing flavors of green peas and oranges, with a savory spiciness.",87,Silverado 2010 Miller Ranch Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"Deep, pure blackberry, cassis and minerally aromas are fresh, clean and authentic for Priorat. This is bold, chunky and ripe, with an acidic streak that maintains clarity.

Drink through 2018.",90,Celler Pasanau 2012 Ceps Nous Red (Priorat),,,,

"Baked strawberry pastry aromas meet with star anise, savory herbs and an earthy forest floor funk full of composting underbrush on the dynamic nose of this bottling by pioneer Bryan Babcock. There is lively energy to the sip, carrying flavors of bay leaf, eucalyptus and tobacco against a backbone of black plum fruit.",94,Babcock 2014 Slice of Heaven Rita's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Spicy oak aromas suggest sandalwood, while this Tannat blend also deals scents of plum, cherry and rose petal.

Drink through 2021.",91,Pizzorno 2011 Primo Red (Uruguay),,,,
"The ripe, appetizing zestiness of Amalfi lemon peel, paired with a green streak of lime and herb conquers nose and palate immediately.

"This savory blend of 50% Merlot, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Petit Verdot has aromas of red currants, toast, cedar and baking spices.

Steely acidity drives a long, lean finish.",88,St. Christopher 2011 Piesporter Michelsberg Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Young and round on the nose, with black cherry, blackberry and dry spice aromas.

"This gorgeous wine from southern Italy shows the true potential of native grape Aglianico. It opens with an intense fragrance of black cherry, leather, truffle, underbrush and spice.

Drink through 2027.",94,Mastroberardino 2007 Radici  (Taurasi),,,,
"Ripe and broad shouldered, this blend of Zinfandel, Syrah, Petite Sirah and Cabernet Sauvignon is full in flavor and tannins. It's a perfect pizza wine.",85,Vigilance 2010 Cimarron Red (Lake County),,,,
"There are elements of a restrained ripeness to the nose of this wine: Kalamata olive, pressed cranberrry and herbs, along with slightly sweet figs and plums. It's quite easy to drink yet rather intriguing with strawberry-raspberry juice and crushed herb notes of oregano and marjoram.",94,Wrights Station 2012 Far Away Block Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"Black berry, plum, red currant and cedar aromas take center stage in this fantastic vintage of one of Italy's most iconic wines. The structured, poised palate delivers a great depth of flavors that include succulent black cherry, cracked black pepper and mocha that are energized by a flinty mineral note.

"While intensely youthful on the nose with aromas of fresh red cherries and blossom, the wine seems to build in depth and maturity on the palate. Fresh red fruit turns deeper and darker, and pretty floral notes pick up hints of potpourri and fall foliage. Elegant yet seductive, it is delicious now, but should mature beautifully through 2019–2021.",91,Thörle 2011 Trocken Spätburgunder (Rheinhessen),,,,
"More tannic than in previous vintages, and not as immediately rich, this Cab-dominated Bordeaux blend will benefit from decanting. It needs some air to open up and reveal its heart of cassis. Will develop with six or so years of aging, but doesn't seem like a longterm cellar candidate.",89,J. Davies 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),,,,
"Made entirely with Cabernet Franc, this displays subtle aromas of cassis and baking spice that carry over to the juicy palate together with bell pepper and vanilla. Round tannins provide the approachable framework. Drink through 2020.",88,Fornacelle 2013 Foglio 38 Red (Toscana),,,,
"Very youthful, so the first aromas are of a wild field, with some cranberry. It’s a full-volume wine, with an appealing chunky forwardness but also bright acidity, style and character. In a word, it’s “balanced.” Will go with almost anything, from baked salmon to dark chocolate. A real pleaser, especially at this price point. Best Buy.",90,Elk Cove 1998 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Blue flower, red berry, forest floor and a whiff of Mediterranean herb lead the nose. The racy, linear palate delivers black cherry, pomegranate and clove framed in sleek tannins and bracing acidity. A note of powdered sage closes the finish.",87,San Lorenzo 2014  Rosso di Montalcino,,,,
"This off-dry sparkling is made from 78% Flora, 13% Pinot Noir and 9% Chardonnay. It works in its inviting, rich array of stone-fruit and tropical accents, met by a floral underbelly of inviting aroma.

"Not many Grand Cru wines are made into a Sec style of Champagne. This wine is more soft than sweet, with plenty of acidity as well as a touch of honey. Soft and round at the end, the wine is balanced and ready to drink.",88,Jean Milan NV Tendresse Grand Cru Sec  (Champagne),,,,
"The blend is Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. The Brut X designation refers to the winery's driest sparkler, but the wine retains plenty of sweet, ripe strawberries, raspberries, limes, vanilla and honey. It's very good, but a minor critique is a certain roughness of texture. Drink now.",88,Iron Horse 2008 Brut X Sparkling (Green Valley),,,,
"Smoky and earthy smelling, with aromas of tobacco, subtle spice and dried cherry. This feels tight, with more acidity than body at this point in its evolution. Flavors of dried raspberry, plum, earth and brown sugar are solid and classic. Drink now through 2013.",90,Bodegas Riojanas 2001 Monte Real Gran Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"This Bordeaux-style red blend, made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc, opens with pleasant herbal tones of green pepper, blackcurrant leaf, plum skin and tobacco leaf. Black fruit flavors abound on the solidly structured palate, finishing with hits of milk chocolate and charred earth.",87,Indaba 2016 Mosaic Red (Western Cape),,,,
"This low-production Zin gets extra credit for sheer power. It's explosive, with briary, brambly flavors of wild raspberry, cherry and blackberry, complete with spice notes of anise, cinnamon and pepper, all wrapped in soft tannins. This would be great now with spicy beef and poultry dishes or pizza.",90,Bella Vetta 2008 Jack's Cabin Vineyard Zinfandel (Rockpile),,,,
"Smooth berry aromas have a vanilla leaning due to ample oak. The mouthfeel is fresh and a touch clipped and choppy, while flavors of vanilla and wood accent traditional red-berry and plum flavors. On the finish, vanilla and cocoa flavors create a good ending. Drink now.",89,Marqués de Cáceres 2008 Reserva  (Rioja),,,,

"This variety is an extreme rarity in this appellation. This one offers aromas of wet penny, spice and red fruit. The palate is medium bodied, with the tannins bringing some grit.",87,Liberty Lake 2012 Tempranillo (Red Mountain),,,,
"Kind of hard, pasty and candied on the nose, with a thick and chunky palate feel along with sweet, sugary, generic red fruit flavors. Hailing from Patagonia, this is a basic, creamy Cabernet with body and size but not too much character.",84,Alpataco 2006 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Neuquén),,,,
"Brawny and forward, it leads with alluring fragrances of blue flower, underbrush, forest berries, balsamic herbs and leather. The juicy palate delivers mature wild cherry layered with white pepper, cinnamon, thyme and mint. While already deliciously accessible, it should develop some complexity in the next few years but don't hold too long. Drink through 2019.",90,Terre Nere 2009  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,

"Gentle tannins and a streak of black pepper stand out in this well-crafted, powerful wine. It offers up pillowy texture and just enough grip to remain seamless and compelling on the palate. Moderate acidity adds structure and brightness to the concentrated black fruit.",92,J. Davies 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),,,,
"This lemon- and pear-flavored wine has an attractive, fresh fruitiness, tight acidity and a very crisp feeling. It is light and bright.",86,Gadais Père et Fils 2012 Domaine de la Tourmaline Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),,,,
"A perennial favorite, it's reassuring to see that the quality continues to remain high even from Guigal's least expensive cuvée. Red fruits—cherries and raspberries—marry easily with hints of clove, cracked pepper, black olive and espresso. It's round on the midpalate, showing more focus and ample length on the finish.",90,E. Guigal 2011 Red (Côtes du Rhône),,,,
"Crisp red cherry and a taste of grenadine characterize this light, bright wine, with accents of orange and rhubarb. Fruity and straightforward in structure and body, it retains nicely interwoven acidity through the finish.",90,WesMar 2013 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"A very good Cabernet, although a young one. It's classically structured, with fine tannins and acidity framing ripe, luxurious flavors of blackberries, black currants and cocoa, accentuated by smoky oak. Good now, with decanting, but should be better by late 2010.",89,Vinifera 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"This dark, ripe and modern Syrah features wild berry, leather and cheesy smelling oak on the bouquet. It's plump and grabby, with plenty of oak and raw tannin to support black-fruit, vanilla and spice flavors. Oak dominates the finish, which has good density, weight and length.",89,Clunia 2010 Syrah (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),,,,
"Earthy notes of licorice, bark and bramble are prominent on the nose of this wine, framing the black berry, plum and boysenberry core. The mouthfeel is lush and ripe, with a subtle creaminess that's complemented by notes of baking spice and cocoa powder on the finish. Drink now–2018.",88,Graham Beck 2012 The Game Reserve Pinotage (Western Cape),,,,
"A full spectrum of Chilean SB aromas are present, from grass to citrus to tropical fruits to vegetal notes. This feels fresh but more or less regular. Flavors of green fruits come with grassy interjections, while the finish is good and clean.",89,Matetic 2013 Corralillo Sauvignon Blanc (San Antonio),,,,
"Solid and tannic, this is a full-bodied wine with potential. Ripe fruits are dense and juicy.  With both structure and fruit, this wine will develop well. Drink from 2017.",88,Domaine Alain Jeanniard 2011 En Combe Roy  (Fixin),,,,
"Made from yet another up and coming white grape from Central Italy, this opens with a pretty floral fragrance of wisteria and jasmine. The linear white peach, pear and citrus flavors are balanced by bright acidity.",86,Cantina Offida 2012 Passerina (Marche),,,,
"Avignonesi takes a traditionalists' approach to most of its wines, including this ruby-colored Rosso di Montepulciano. Slightly muddled aromas of cherry and dried raspberry mingle with tobacco, leather and spice.",87,Avignonesi 2008  Rosso di Montepulciano,,,,
"Crisp and young, this wine, from 50-year-old vines, is tangy and strongly mineral in texture. It is full of fresh fruit that reflects the of organic and biodynamic farming. The green fruits will fill out as it ages. Drink from 2017.",90,Château de Lavernette 2014 Maison du Villard  (Pouilly-Fuissé),,,,
"Saia Grande is a blend of Merlot, Syrah and Pinot Noir that offers plump fruit flavors of cherry and wild berry followed by toasted almond and crushed white pepper.",86,Maurigi 2007 Saia Grande Red (Sicilia),,,,
"A wonderful treat with smoked salmon canapés, this elegant rosé sparkler opens with a delicate pink color with highlights of peach and gold. Its perfumes recall stone fruit, citrus and toasted nut and those characteristics are followed by lively acidity and firm perlage.",90,Contadi Castaldi NV Rosé Sparkling (Franciacorta),,,,
"Principally Syrah, this includes 15% Grenache and 3% Mourvèdre. Rich and complex, supple and subtle, the mix of red, blue and purple fruits is potent, but also brings a welcome wash of wet stone and a dash of pepper. The focus and intensity are exemplary.",94,Kevin White 2012 En Hommage G-S-M (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Thick, heavy, potent and mouth-coating, this is a liquorous, almost syrupy wine, sure to please those who like big fruit, big tannins, and big barrel flavors. Chocolate, espresso, tar and bourbon barrel flavors dominate, in keeping with the house style.",90,Barrister 2009 Bacchus Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Distinct aromas of sour plum and dried pomegranate meet with damp tobacco, forest floor, green olive and Greek spice on the nose of this clonal study. It's herbal on the palate, with oregano, marjoram and green cardamom notes, alongside cranberry and red cherry fruit in the midpalate. Altogether, it's a light, bright and highly seasoned wine.",92,Fess Parker 2013 Clone 115 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Made entirely with Chardonnay, this opens with aromas of toast and whiffs of banana and mango. The aromas carry on to the palate along with a creamy hint of butter.",88,Ambrogio e Giovanni Folonari 2014 Cabreo La Pietra Chardonnay (Toscana),,,,
"Made entirely with Merlot, this densely extracted wine opens with aromas of toasted oak, black currants and vanilla. The tightly packed palate delivers dried blackberries, tobacco, espresso and licorice alongside raspy wood tannins that leave an astringent finish. It lacks the fruit richness to stand up to the heavy oak influence.",88,Castellare di Castellina 2013 Poggio ai Merli Merlot (Toscana),,,,
"The winery struggled last year with this bottling, but has made good progress with this dry, richly balanced 2006. It's an easy wine to drink now, medium-bodied and silky, with lush flavors of black currants, chocolate, licorice and cedar.",87,Peter Franus 2006 Brandlin Vineyard Zinfandel (Mount Veeder),,,,
"Cassis, cherry and coconut aromas are toasty and offer a minerally note. Lively and juicy across the palate, this Maipo Cabernet brings a typical Chilean mix of plum, currant, herb, spice and chocolate flavors. A dry, peppery finish shows some unresolved oak, meaning this has more time to mature. Drink through 2018.",91,Viña Maipo 2010 Protegido Cabernet Sauvignon (Buin),,,,
"This is a little rustic in tannins, but it has plenty of charm. It offers pleasure with its cherry, berry, tobacco and spice flavors, plus a jacket of smoky oak. Nice as an everyday sipper.",87,Toad Hollow 2009 Richard McDowell Vineyard Merlot (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Flat doughy aromas smell cooked and stewy. In the mouth, this shows pointy acidity and overripe fruit flavors. Raisiny flavors are stewy on the finish.",83,Bodegas Olarra 2014 Clásico Crianza  (Rioja),,,,
"Freshly cut Granny Smith vies with Golden Delicious on the fruit-driven nose and palate. The palate has a tart edge but the flavors are fresh, citric and clean—autolysis is barely perceptible while the fizz is rather frothy yet easily dissipates. If you don't like aggressive mousse, this is a softer choice.",89,Jean-Baptiste Adam NV Les Natures Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),,,,
"Juicy and powerfully structured, this vibrant red boasts aromas of underbrush, game and mature plum. The palate offers cherry marinated in spirits, juicy raspberry, white pepper, clove, tobacco and licorice alongside firm, velvety tannins. Drink through 2019.",92,Castello di Cacchiano 2009 Millenio Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"Profile has been an important, but sometimes overlooked, member of the Napa Valley pantheon for many years, and their '06 shows why. It's a rich, complex and smooth wine. Packed with blackberry, cassis and smoky, new oak flavors, it shows a firm structure of tannins and acidity. Beautiful now with a grilled steak, and should age well for at least a decade.",94,Merryvale 2006 Profile Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"This négociant-style wine offers immediate appeal. Aromas of lemon, candle wax, mineral, lees and toast are followed by lively, sleek citrus flavors. This was a banner vintage for Washington whites and this wine is batting cleanup.",90,Full Pull & Friends 2011 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Very spicy, full-in-the-mouth wine. It has just the right amount of acidity to keep it fresh, but its main thrust is towards rich pepper and weight. At the end, a tighter mineral character appears. Keep for 2–3 years.",90,Domaine Roland Schmitt 2012 Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"Here's a full-bodied, succulent wine with a sunny character that opens with aromas of perfumed berry, blue flower and a hint of cake spice. The smooth, structured palate doles out juicy dark cherry, crushed plum and a hint of mocha alongside velvety tannins. This is already enjoyable but will age well for several years.",90,Folonari 2011 Torcalvano  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),,,,
"A six-grape Rhône blend, this does not lose focus or intensity. It strikes the palate head-on with flavors of dried leaf, prune, cooked cherry, cinnamon and mocha. But despite the raisin/prune flavors, it does not seem overripe or in any way over the hill. Rather, these superripe flavors have somehow been tamed, the alcohol is just over 14%, and the wine leaves a sinuous, sensuous trail of flavor as it moves through the palate.",90,Olsen Estates 2008 Rouge des Coteaux Red (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Flowery aromas suggest air freshener. This feels plump, round and oily. Salty orange flavors are just ripe enough to be good, while this pushes the limits of brininess on a finish that offers a taste of the ocean.",87,Pazo Pondal 2015 Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"Full bodied and viscous on the palate, the wine is balanced by bright acidity that gives it good focus. Peach, grapefruit, apple and spice notes are at the core here, followed by a lemony fresh finish. Quite fruity in style and fairly sweet. Try it as an aperitif or with duck and sweet sauces.",87,Maddalena 2002 Riesling (Monterey),,,,
"Fresh bell pepper and passion fruit aromas are a bit underripe in character. The palate feels juicy and bright, with zesty acidity. Nectarine and green-herb flavors hint at vegetal undertones, while the finish is short but fresh. Drink now.",86,Miguel Torres 2014 Santa Digna Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),,,,
"Bramble and forest floor, cherry cola and savory bresaola notes amount to pretty aromatics with less bulkiness in the mouth. The structure is there but this wine is a bit dry, sharp and less fleshy than many others.",90,Marchesi Antinori 2007 Pian delle Vigne  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"This single vineyard Carmenere from the Horse Heaven Hills is 100% varietal with notes of freshly cut bell pepper and cherry. It's tart fruit flavors are backed by (quite) dry, grainy tannins.",86,Clearwater Canyon 2010 Phinny Hill Vineyard Carmenère (Washington),,,,
"Mint marks the nose of this otherwise darkly attractive wine. Notes of mocha and plum nicely set up the wine, as do the supple tannins, but then there's a jarring edge of prickly acidity that cuts across the palate and disrupts the flow. There are some nice parts here that don't quite come together.",87,Mitolo 2009 Reiver Shiraz (Barossa Valley),,,,
"Using fruit sourced from old vines, this is concentrated, with some richness and weight. Ripe red-cherry fruit mingles with balanced, dry tannins.",86,Domaine Dupré 2011 Vignes de 1940  (Beaujolais-Villages),,,,
"Much better than prior vintages, when it was known as Finca El Portillo. The nose is jammy and shows black fruit aromas, while the palate is complete and full but juicy, with plum and black cherry flavors. Pepper and toast flavors infiltrate the finish.",86,Salentein 2009 Portillo Estate Bottled Merlot (Uco Valley),,,,
"Tangy and varietal, this emphasizes some pleasing grassiness, with a touch of petrol in the nose. The fresh, herbal components are set against a mix of lemon, grapefruit and pineapple fruits.",88,Brandborg 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Umpqua Valley),,,,
"Made entirely of the Alpine grape Prié Blanc, planted in the highest vineyards in Europe, this vibrant sparkler opens with aromas of green apple, white spring flowers and a hint of resin. The palate offers ripe Bartlett pear, creamy Granny Smith and Alpine herb alongside brisk acidity and persistent bubbles.",87,Cave du Vin Blanc de Morgex et de la Salle 2011 Extra Brut Metodo Classico Prié Blanc (Vino Spumante),,,,
"Crisp, attractive fruit flavors produce a wine that is bright, light, open. There's a good tang of lemon zest accompanying the acidity that comes from the green fruit flavor. Ready to drink.",86,Dopff Au Moulin 2011 Pinot Blanc (Alsace),,,,
"This rich wine has a good proportion (31%) of Cabernet Franc to give it a perfumed structured character. It is dense and with considerable tannins at this stage. By contrast, the fruit has enormous potential with rich blackberry and black-plum flavors. This chateau has made a considerable stride in this vintage. Drink from 2022.",94,Château Quintus 2014  Saint-Émilion,,,,
"This opens with alluring aromas of raspberry jam, blue flower, ground pepper and grilled herb. The savory, succulent palate offers juicy black cherry, black raspberry, clove and mineral. Firm tannins provide seamless support while fresh acidity lifts the ripe, mouthwatering fruit.",90,Caruso & Minini 2014 Perricone (Terre Siciliane),,,,
"This smells yeasty and peachy, with a maderized quality to the bouquet. It tastes cidery and citrusy, with a light body and not much in the way of bubbles or vitality. The flavors of apple, lemon and peach are fair and fleshy. Tastes pithy on the finish.",86,Bodegas Antaño NV Añ Vino Espumoso de Calidad Brut Nature Verdejo (Rueda),,,,
"This light-bodied, assertive Sauvignon Blanc exudes classic aromas and flavors of fresh herb and snap pea, helping it taste crisp, dry and true to type.",86,Sand Point 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Lodi),,,,

"This opens with earthy aromas of ripe dark fruit, scorched earth, game and truffle. The concentrated palate doles out juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, sweet cake spice, tobacco and herb accompanied by firm, fine-grained tannins and a vein of fresh acidity.",92,Giovanni Rosso 2011 del Comune di Serralunga d'Alba  (Barolo),,,,
"With a light, silky texture, this Pinot glides over the palate, carrying rich fruit and spice flavors. They include raspberries, pomegranates, cola, red licorice, cinnamon and pepper. It's lovely in many respects, but it's also notably sharp in acidity, a problem that's unlikely to go away.",86,Casa Torres 2006 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"This soft fruity wine has a candied character. It is light, crisp and ready to drink. Produced from Malbec, it just hints at the tannins natural to the grape, preferring fruitiness and acidity. Drink now.",84,Georges Vigouroux 2015 Gouleyant Malbec Rosé (Côtes du Lot),,,,
"The Savatiano-whisperer Papagiannakos continues his mastery here, traditionally the variety used for retsina. Here, the single variety is barrel fermented and left on the lees to offer a richer expression of the grape's lemon, spice and peach notes. This is an elegant white with aging ability. Try with grilled fish, salty cheeses.",90,Papagiannakos 2013 Vareli Skin Contact Savatiano (Markopoulo),,,,
"A buttery style, this bottling offers popcorn, sea salt caramel and vanilla cookies on the nose alongside tropical coconut, ripe peach and banana fruit, all judiciously presented. There's an immediate sizzle of acidity to cut through the butter on the palate, where pan-fried apples, squeezed lemons and almonds make for an excellent California Chardonnay.",91,Scott Family 2014 Dijon Clone Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),,,,
"Not quite as showy as its cousin Zinfandel, this Primitivo takes more time to emerge from its shell, eventually revealing scents of white pepper and graphite. There is absolutely no show of Zin's traditional hamminess either; instead, mouth-watering minerality and a vibrant acid structure lingers on the palate.",86,Oso Libre 2011 Nativo Estate Primitivo (Paso Robles),,,,
"Using grapes sourced from Klipsun Vineyard, this is a roughly even Sauvignon Blanc–Sémillon blend. Flavors of sweet toast, lemon verbena and melon, with a hint of mint and a splash of orange soda are all in evidence. Nicely nuanced, this does not overreach, but rather zooms in on the details of aroma and flavor that keep it interesting.",88,Covington 2011 Blanc Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Red Mountain),,,,
"Penetrating tones of stone, lemon and wax lend a stately feel to this dry, intensely mineral Riesling. It's full-bodied in style with a rich, rounded mouthfeel, but invigorated with acidity on the finish.",90,Prinz Salm 2012 Rotschiefer Trocken Riesling (Nahe),,,,
"A coppery tinge to this wine's hue suggests a bit of skin contact, and the wine does show some aromas reminscent of Pinot Noir—earth, spice and underbrush. But those are offset by ripe melon flavors that finish clean and refreshing, despite a hint of residual sugar. Consume it over the next year or two.",89,Bird 2007 Old Schoolhouse Vineyard Pinot Gris (Marlborough),,,,
"Elderton is making classically styled Barossa Shiraz, marrying raspberry fruit with rich chocolaty overtones and wrapping them in a soft cocoon of supple tannins and balanced acidity. Drink now–2014.",90,Elderton 2006 Shiraz (Barossa),,,,
"Taut grapefruit zest on the nose relaxes into lovely mandarin fruit and zest on the palate. This is fresh and fruity, flavorsome and rounded by rich mandarin flavor as only a slender, willowy Riesling can be. Totally refreshing with a pristine finish. This dances and pirouettes like a ballerina.",93,Markus Huber 2014 Berg Reserve Riesling (Traisental),,,,
"Oregon Lagrein has to be about as rare as it gets. It's almost jet black, yet just 10% alcohol. It's a dark musky tannic wine, yet dilute and acidic, with little fruit flavor. Best paired with a burger or flank steak.",86,Remy 2013 Lone Madrone Vineyard Lagrein (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Medium straw in color, this white blend offers the unexpected fragrance of toast and espresso. It is an easy-drinking wine with flavors of apple, lemon curd, peach preserves and toast. Soft floral notes are present on the palate, and the finish is marked by white peach.",86,Clos de Gat 2015 Chanson Blanc White (Judean Hills),,,,
"This may be simple Zweigelt, but it has a great structure, bringing out an impressively complex juice and tannin combination, with a ripe sweet character, black berry fruits and a core of tight, mineral tannins. The finish is open, warm and juicy.",88,Nittnaus Anita und Hans 2008 Zweigelt (Burgenland),,,,
"Cogno helped put the Novello village on the Barolo-lovers' map. This wine opens with fragrances of red and black berries, rose, baking spice and leather. The vibrant palate delivers wild cherry, raspberry, mint, sage, thyme and cocoa accents alongside bracing tannins and nervous acidity. Drink after 2020.",95,Elvio Cogno 2010 Ravera  (Barolo),,,,
"Oak, toast, coffee, espresso, chocolate and vanilla sensations dominate this wine along with notes of black plum. There's not enough fruit richness to stand up to the oak or the astringent wood tannins on the finish.",87,Ellena 2010 Ascheri  (Barolo),,,,
"A refreshing wine, tart in acidity, with savory green leaf, gooseberry and tropical fruit flavors. Feels really clean and zesty in the mouth, finishing with a swirl of exotic spices.",88,Dutton Estate 2011 Kylie's Cuvée Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This elegant bottling is named after the late actor-turned-vintner's daughter, who still runs the company. It features well-integrated aromas of cherry, rhubarb and smoke. That smoke also shows on the palate, where piquant raspberry, dried lavender, thyme, rosemary and allspice sizzle toward a lively finish.",93,Fess Parker 2015 Ashley's Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"This small-production Tuscan-inspired wine shows sour cherry fruit and a funky note of peat. Low in oak and tannin, it's softly layered and slightly salty, appealing in its Old World style.",88,Orsi Family Vineyards 2013 Sangiovese (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Pure minerals, peach and melon aromas come with a hint of leesy dust. This wine is elegant, chiseled and minerally on the palate. Flavors of dusty apple and citrus end long and stony, with class. Laxas is a top-flight Albariño producer and this vintage is one of its best. Drink now.",92,As Laxas 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"The winery releases an extensive lineup of single vineyard Pinots; here is the mix of leftover barrels. Purple fruits, earth, slightly green tannins and a hint of toast come into play.",89,Penner-Ash 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,

"Aromas of herb, pressed rose, ripe berry and a funky whiff of farm animal come together on this. The firm palate offers tart red cherry, chopped herb and a balsamic note alongside bracing tannins and bright acidity. An earthy, bitter note of game marks the finish.",87,Cantina Tomaso Gianolio 2010  Barolo,,,,
"Dense dusty tannins dominate this 100% Touriga Nacional wine, powering its black fruits and acidity. The serious structure and firm, dry core contrast with the juicy berry flavors that will give a bright character as the wine matures. Drink from 2018.",90,Casa Agricola Alexandre Relvas 2015 Segredos de São Miguel Touriga Nacional (Alentejano),,,,
"A fruity wine that's laced with wood, this is smooth and lightly tannic. The red and black berry fruits are at the fore, supported by a toast character and lifting acidity Age for 1–2 years, but the wine is drinkable now.",86,Château de la Jaubertie 2010 Red (Bergerac),,,,
"Aromas of fragrant yellow flower, apple and a whiff of hazelnut come together on this structured white. The bright palate offers Kaiser pear, nectarine zest and a honeyed note alongside vibrant acidity.",89,Ronco Blanchis 2013 Friulano (Collio),,,,
"Coming from Uvas Valley earth that was originally planted in the 1920s by Italian immigrants, this wine shows leather, plum sauce and dark chocolate on the nose. It's light on the palate, but possesses strong tannic grip and refreshing acidity that boost the dried flower, blueberry juice and graphite flavors.",90,Solis 2011 Estate Barbera (Santa Clara Valley),,,,
"This wine feels flat, with no life to the palate. It's been fermented to complete dryness, leaving only tired skin flavors of dried lemon and mixed citrus. Two bottles were tasted, with identical results.",84,North 42 Degrees 2016 Reserve Riesling (Lake Erie North Shore),,,,
"Light, leafy, earthy aromas of plum and tomato accurately announce a lively, fresh palate with spicy, peppery flavors of earth, red plum and cranberry. Juicy acidity, dry but ripe red fruit and earthy complexity make for a strong finish.",89,Verum 2013 Pinot Noir (Alto Valle del Río Negro),,,,
"Roccolo Grassi takes Valpolicella Superiore to the next level. While Valpolicella Superiore is mostly recognized as an easy-drinking red to wash down with pizza or pasta, this has touches of ripe fruit and exotic spice that lend extra sophistication, elegance and texture.",90,Roccolo Grassi 2009  Valpolicella Superiore,,,,
"This is a perfumed, complex wine that veers between showcasing the freshest fruit flavors and hints of maturity. It's fresh with berry notes and intense with acidity, but rich in texture as well. This is a wine to age much longer, so don't drink before 2017.",94,Domaines Schlumberger 2010 Saering Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"This is a herbal, earthy wine with as many tannins as fruit at this stage. That gives it a dense, dusty texture that seeps into the ripe, sweet plum flavors. With the wood giving an extra push of richness as well as spice, it needs to age. Drink from 2017.",89,Caves Velhas 2013 D. Fuas Reserva Red (Terras do Dão),,,,
"Spring flower aromas mingle with a hint of orchard fruit. On the lean, extremely simple palate, yellow apple fruit mixes with a lemon zest note.",84,Sant'Anjelus 2015  Soave,,,,
"In the blend are smaller percentages of Cab Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot. The Red Mountain AVA is noted for thick, tannic wines, with superior aging potential. Here the earthy, peppery red fruits are buttressed with vivid acids and somewhat chewy tannins. The wine was aged two years in 40% new French oak.",87,Lachini 2011 La Bestia Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),,,,
"Radiator dust and Animal Cracker aromas are not typical of Sauvignon Blanc. On the palate, this opens with mild citric notes but quickly shifts to flatness.

Sorelle Bronca is a boutique producer that makes some of the finest Prosecco available today. This sparkling Brut expression shows finesse and focus with lively aromas of white flower and smooth peach.,88,Sorelle Bronca NV Brut  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
"Delicate and retrained in aroma, this wine hails from an extreme coastal vineyard between Pismo Beach and the Edna Valley. With patience, Meyer lemon curd and scratched-lime elements emerge, and the flavors are also light, with more lemon and lime as well as Gala apple and Anjou pear flesh.",88,Last Light 2014 Spanish Springs Vineyard Chardonnay (San Luis Obispo County),,,,
"Given the local competition, this Pinot Noir-dominated sparkler is pretty good. It has a peachy color along with creamy aromas that might be a little oxidized but are soft and easy nonetheless. The palate feel is frothy, while the flavors are of peach pits and underripe cantaloupe. Finishes dry and lively.",86,Viniterra NV Método Tradicional Extra Brut  (Mendoza),,,,
"Baked apple and baking spice aromas lead to a lightly creamy palate capped off by a tart, lemony finish. It provides a lot of appeal.",89,Balancing Act 2015 Chardonnay (Washington),,,,

"The nose is a tease of subtle mandarin and lemon zest, promising but not giving away very much at all. The alluring juiciness of the palate hints at small, yellow mirabelle plums but as of yet merely plays at the surface. Underneath it all is a solid powerhouse bursting with Seville orange, freshness and precision. Another one to keep, guard and treasure for a precious but enlightening soirée. The endless length reinforces that promise. Drink 2018–2025.",95,F X Pichler 2014 Loibner Loibenberg Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),,,,
"Saint-Amour is the most northern of the Beaujolais cru villages, close to Pouilly-Fuissé. Its specialty is structured, rich wine like this. It is a ripe wine, full of black fruits and dense tannins. Still young, it is a style of Beaujolais that needs to age. Drink from 2019.",88,Château de Lavernette 2015 Le Chatelet  (Saint-Amour),,,,
"Earthy, herbal aromas are heavy and consistent with the winery's other 2011s. A choppy, raw, tannic palate and herbal, saucy berry flavors finish with notes of green herbs, tomato and bell pepper. This has a fine texture, yet the flavors are not ripe or appealing.",85,Valtravieso 2011 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"It's hard to overstate how deliciously irresistible this wine is, a celebration of the variety that makes a statement of greatness from the first sip to the last. Golden-hued minerality is the star and pillar of support, a worthy dance partner to the twirls of lacy lemon pith, fully expressive tangerine, grapefruit and stone. Lively and complex, it showcases beauty in a glass.",97,Lynmar 2014 La Sereinité Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Dried strawberries, plum and an iron character combine for a lush yet balanced nose on this entry-level bottling from the longtime Foxen Canyon winery.

"There are some exquisite flavors in this Cab Franc: cassis, cherries, raspberries, cocoa, smoky oak and a rich array of dusty crushed brown spices. The wine is fully dry, with finely meshed tannins, but the main quibble is that it's too soft to be completely balanced.",88,Ledson 2004 Cabernet Franc (Alexander Valley),,,,
"This blend is comprised of Grenache, Syrah, Mourvèdre and Cabernet Sauvignon. The GSM combination gives it rich, accessible flavors of cherries, raspberries and red currants, while the Cabernet, at just 7% of the blend, brings dark, brooding fruit notes, as well as depth and tannins. This rich wine combines power with elegance.",92,ONX 2011 Crux Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"Pretty good for the price, a balanced, smooth Cab with polished blackberry, cherry, plum, cedar and rosemary flavors. Good value in a dry red table wine.",84,Surf Point 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),,,,
"Thanks to its vertical aromatic delivery, you can enjoy this sparkler's upfront fresh notes of green apple, peach, crushed white pepper and mineral.

"While a tad pulpy and overripe on the nose, there's a purity to the dark red fruit on the palate of this Virginia Cab Franc that penetrates amidst notes of fresh green leaves and herbs. Full bodied in style with just a hint of green bramble on the finish.",85,Bogati 2010 Cabernet Franc (Virginia),,,,
"This is a highly structured wine with an abundance of fine-grained tannins and firm acidity to support pure raspberry and blackberry flavors. It tastes as if it was made for aging, so wait and drink after 2019.",87,Yorkville Cellars 2013 Rennie Vineyard Organic Grapes Petit Verdot (Yorkville Highlands),,,,
"This wine comes from a small Chardonnay enclave in the predominantly red premier cru of Beaune Grèves. With its intense exotic fruit and apricot flavors, it's both ripe and crisp with acidity. That makes for a delicious reflection of the vintage, needing time to mature. Drink from 2020.",92,Louis Jadot 2014 Beaune Grèves Premier Cru Le Clos Blanc  (Beaune),,,,
"A beautiful, fancy Sauvignon Blanc, crisp and dry and complex. If you're looking for a California white to drink with a perfect roast chicken, it's a fine choice. Shows ripe, lush citrus, tropical fruit, peach, mineral and white flower flavors, finished with dusty cinnamon spices.",93,Conspire 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford),,,,
"This ripe, juicy wine is packed with red fruit. Its tannins are already soft, suggesting it will age quickly. With its crisp aftertaste and plenty of fruitiness, it will be best from 2019.",87,Château Peneau 2015 Cuvée Tradition  (Côtes de Bordeaux),,,,
"Milk chocolate, plastic and wet dog aromas improve with airing. It's abrasive and scratchy on the palate, with blackberry and milk chocolate flavors that lead to a finish with one last dosage of milk chocolaty sweetness. This contains 15% Garnacha.",85,Familia Solana 2009  Toro,,,,
"Dark berry aromas, chocolate and grit define the nose on this blend of Syrah, Cabernet and Tempranillo. The palate feels ripe and fresh, but the tannins are hard and grabby. Black plum flavors are bold and offer notes of spice, herbs and earthiness. This is composed on the finish despite a reprise of hard smacking tannins.",89,Icono 2013 Selección Red (Valencia),,,,
"A standout among the winery's single-vineyard selections, this big-boned effort brings flavors of chewy cherry alongside a citrus highlight and a definite underpinning of wet stone and clay. Texturally compelling, it should age gracefully through 2024.",93,Elk Cove 2014 Clay Court Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),,,,
"This is just the third Sauvignon Blanc from Stevens (none was made in 2008), sourced from Klipsun vineyard and stainless steel fermented. Richly textural, with a creamy minerality, this has a pleasing intensity, a sort of nervosity (as the French might put it), limned with a sweet grain character. The fruits are tart and racy, a mix of citrus rind and pulp, tangerine and pineapple, finished with natural acidity.",91,Stevens 2009 AfterThought Sauvignon Blanc (Yakima Valley),,,,
"This is flat and lemony on the nose, with a hint of asparagus. It feels zesty and tastes of tart lemon-lime and green bean. Tangy but not edgy or razor-like on the finish. This is a classic cool-climate white with citrus and green elements running the show.",84,Zudugarai 2011 White (Getariako Txakolina),,,,
"Delicate floral tones build throughout this zesty off-dry Riesling. While sweet with honeydew flavor, the palate is zippy and tart with cutting notes of lime zest and pineapple. It's a classically styled Mosel kabinett at an accessible price.",91,Dr. Loosen 2013 Blue Slate Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"On the nose, this suggests thyme, toasted nut and ripe orchard fruit. The firm palate offers mature citrus zest and ripe pear flavors while a bitter almond note marks the finish.",87,CàMaiol 2015  Lugana,,,,
Pithoi opens with light aromas of forest berry and raw fruit backed by touches of spice and bitter almond. It's an easy wine that could pair with pizza or take-out fried chicken.,84,Maggiovini 2008 Pithoi Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),,,,
"Nice wine, and just misses a higher score for a trace of herbaceousness, which is due to the vintage. Otherwise there's some sweet blackcurrant fruit wrapped in fine, velvety tannins, and the touch of smoky oak is just right.",90,Terra Valentine 2000 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),,,,
"This barrel fermented wine is full-bodied and rich with ripe yellow fruit and spicy toast notes. The wine has a fine tangy edge that gives it a real lift and contrasts with the dense, vanilla and fruit finish. Drink now.",90,Roquevale 2013 Branco Reserva White (Alentejo),,,,
"This is a thick and somewhat heavy white wine, wrapped in oak and ripe concentrated fruit. The profile is baked apple and pear with a side note of Good & Plenty candy anise.",84,Salvestrin 2016 Le Blanc Crystal Springs Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (St. Helena),,,,
"Plum and raspberry aromas come with a spicy topping and distant notes of dried cheese and leather. This feels fresh and feminine on the palate, where dry plum and cherry flavors come with hints of vanilla, loam and cocoa. A smooth finish with tea notes is finely composed and elegant. Drink through 2019.",92,Finca Mayor 2004 Gran Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"Organic grapes grown on the estate's schist soil go into this delicious, ripe and clean wine. Shot through with a good balance of red berries, red currants and tight acidity, it has good depth of flavor along with a surface glitter of bright freshness.",91,Domaine Saint-André de Figuière 2015 Première de Figuière Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"Quite light in both aroma and flavor, this hits the palate softly, with tart, thin fruit and a jarring, somewhat plastic note that persists into the finish. There's a hint of chocolate, but not much going on here.",84,Torii Mor 2008 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"A herbal touch of crushed lemon balm and apple peel makes for an intriguing, inviting nose. The palate adds fresh apple notes to these subtle herb notes and remains totally juicy and lively. This seems far fresher than its six years and the herbal tinges are just the beginning of maturity. This is lovely, concentrated and spirited stuff with a whistle-clean utterly dry finish. Testaments to Riesling's longevity.",94,Louis Sipp 2010 Osterberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"A thin, watery wine that does a great job of keeping the mouth refreshed and clean. Would pair well with sliced cheese or cured meat.",83,Begali 2008  Valpolicella Classico,,,,
"A bit difficult to approach now, this has tight tannins that lock down the wine with astringency. Blended with a little Petit Verdot and Malbec, it slowly reveals massive layers of blackberries, cassis liqueur and dark chocolate, remaining stubbornly tight throughout. Many people will drink it soon with beef, and that's fine, especially with a good decant, but it should reward even more with 8–10 years in a proper cellar.",95,Trefethen 2007 HaLo Cabernet Sauvignon (Oak Knoll District),,,,
"Acidity cuts through strongly, leaving a wave of freshness. The fruit is less obvious, none the less still delicious and well flavored. It's a balanced wine, the acidity keeping it dry.",86,Borges NV Quinta da Soalheira 10-Year-Old Tawny  (Port),,,,
"With great acidity, this wine that comes from vines close to Château Pavie, is ripe with fine tannins and a generous structure. It is fruity with red-berry fruits and a crisp texture. The wine, with its tannins, will take time to develop. Drink from 2022.",92,Clos Badon-Thunevin 2014  Saint-Émilion,,,,
"Mild aromas of tar, baking spice and charred meat lead onto the tannin-driven, muscular palate. It finishes with plenty of grip, which seems to clip some of the flavors.",84,The Williamsburg Winery 2009 Virginia Trianon Cabernet Franc (Virginia),,,,
"A pleasant, nondescript wine. There's 10% Sauvignon Blanc in the blend, which gives it a little spicy lift, but the mainstay Chardonnay core seems generically lemony and falls away in the finish.",83,Pine & Post 2007 Chardonnay (Washington),,,,
"Subdued aromas of ripe dark-skinned berry, espresso and tobacco lead the nose while the soft, dense palate offers fleshy black cherry, blackberry extract, coffee and a hint of ground cooking spice. It's ripe and ready so enjoy soon.",88,Di Majo Norante 2012 Contado Riserva Aglianico (Molise),,,,
"A barrel selection, principally from the estate's Lazy River vineyard, this is solid, forward and medium weight. It offers a mix of ripe black cherry, cola and a hint of sassafras, while settling comfortably into midpalate pleasureville before trailing out in a lively, mineral-touched finish.",91,Panther Creek 2012 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"A handful of Petit Verdot adds power and color to this wine, which opens in a dusty, rich bouquet of dark cherry. Compressed tannins give way to a concentration of pomegranate and cassis, the fruit grown predominantly on Spring Mountain. The finish captures mountainside minerality. Drink now through 2020.",92,Vitesse 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Dark red in color this Pinot has a sweetness on the nose and is otherwise flat, not offering much in terms of flavor, texture or finish.",81,Lola 2011 Pinot Noir (North Coast),,,,
"A scent of juicy black plum commingles with notes of milk chocolate, game and sun-baked straw. Medium to full bodied, this wine is structured with lively acidity and leathery tannins. A bitterness that's akin to grapefruit pith adds tension to the finish.",86,Doukénie 2010 Petit Verdot (Virginia),,,,
"Currently a hard-edged wine that has tight structure and lacks sweetness. All the elements are there, the botrytis dryness, a racy vivid acidity, richness and balance. But they have yet to come together. Wait at least two years.",91,Château Sigalas Rabaud 2006  Sauternes,,,,
"This is a soft wine, light and fresh. It has a citrus character, lemon squeezed over apples that give crispness. Some minerality to the texture adds interest and puts the wine in the food-friendly category. Drink now.",84,Château de Pizay 2014  Beaujolais Blanc,,,,
"Just what the doctor ordered in a likeable, affordable white wine. Packs plenty of ripe spearmint and lemon flavors with enough acidity to make it bright and clean. A tiny amount of sugar will satisfy your sweet tooth without compromising the wine's basic dryness. Best Buy.",87,Peirano 1999 Sauvignon Blanc (Lodi),,,,
"Nutty, toasty and tropical-fruit elements are nicely balanced in this wine's appealing bouquet. Subdued tropical-fruit flavors, mineral notes and a buttery, elegant mouthfeel with good acidity follow. The lengthy finish shows lingering, complex fruit flavors.",90,Jacob's Creek 1997 Limited Release Chardonnay (Padthaway),,,,
"From a selection of old vines, this grand wine is rich and firmly structured. With dark tannins and powerful black plum fruit flavors, it is concentrated and with considerable aging potential. The wine is still young, packed with tannins and will not be ready to drink until 2019.",93,Quinta do Passadouro 2013 Passadouro Red (Douro),,,,
"The 16 months wood aging has smoothed the wrinkles in this wine, giving solid tannins, a dry core and red cherry and wild strawberry flavors. It is a fine performance, dense but not losing sight of the varietal character.",90,Johanneshof Reinisch 2007 Grillenhügel Pinot Noir (Thermenregion),,,,
"This has green-leaning aromas of tobacco, tomato and grass that are matched by more standard plum and berry notes. It feels tight, tannic and rubbery, with medicinal flavors of herbal black fruits and mint. Solid as a whole, this holds its pose on the finish, although even there it's a touch green. This is a blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Merlot.",87,Viña La Rosa 2009 La Capitana Barrel Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Cachapoal Valley),,,,
"If you like tart, less-than-ripe Sauvignon Blanc, you'll enjoy this one. It's acidic, but relieved by lemon, lime and honey flavors.",84,White Oak 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Easygoing and fresh, with black fruit, herbs, spice and smoked meat on the nose. The palate is generally smooth and proper, while the cherry cola, mince meat and other savory flavors work well together. Nothing outrageous, but gets it more right than wrong. Definitely smells and tastes like Carmenère.",86,Agustinos 2007 Reserva Carmenère (Rapel Valley),,,,
"Full-bodied wine with ripe pear and red apple flavors, laced with delicate acidity. It's an elegant wine, a fine balance with a more mineral, tight texture as a counterpoint. Drink from 2014.",88,Domaines Devillard 2011 Château de Chamirey  (Mercurey),,,,
"From a single vineyard of old vines, this is a deeply structured wine. The rare Jaen (in Spain the Mencia grape of the northwest) dominates and here gives a dark and dense wine. It has power, of course, but also style and elegance from the fruit and tannin balance. The strong mineral aftertaste promises further aging, so drink from 2016.",94,Casca Wines 2010 Monte Cascas Vinha da Carpanha Red (Dão),,,,
"Soft and simple, but the price makes it a pretty good value. Shows cherry, violet, cocoa and smoky oak flavors in a smooth package that finishes dry and spicy.",84,Mandolin 2005 Merlot (Central Coast),,,,
"Great fruit flavors, firm texture and vivid acidity make this an especially lively and dynamic wine. It bursts with red cherry, raspberry and black-grape flavors that wake up the palate and vibrate through the finish. It contains 30% Syrah and 30% Tempranillo, plus Grenache and Malbec.",89,"Naggiar 2014 Root 49 Estate Grown, Produced & Bottled Red (Sierra Foothills)",,,,
"Nice flavor concentration and light body make this wine a standout. It starts with vivid black cherry aromas that lead to riper, almost-sweet cherry and blackberry flavors. The texture is structured with moderate tannins that keep the flavors going through the finish.",88,Michael Sullberg 2014 Lot 91 Reserve Merlot (California),,,,
"Reserve is rarely a word found in front of rosé, but here it seems meaningful. The 82% Merlot and 18% Grenache complement each other nicely. Cherry-pie tartness with a bit of sweet blueberry flavor make for a full-bodied, round and bone dry rosé that's substantial and delicious.",88,3 Horse Ranch Vineyards 2011 Reserve Rosé,,,,
"Here's another raring red from Bordeaux-born Rivière that needs time to settle. Ripe aromas are all about fruit, while this wine is clamping on the palate, with a sense of skins one hopes will resolve with time. Peppery plum and wild berry flavors finish with cheek-grabbing tannins and lasting toastiness. Drink 2019–2035.",93,Olivier Rivière 2015 Ganko  (Rioja),,,,
"All varietal, this offers aromas of coffee, cherry, chocolate, oak spices and green herbs that show a touch of underripeness. The palate displays elegance, restraint and polish along with a tart finish.",89,Abeja 2011 Heather Hill Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"This reserve wine is a four grape, Bordeaux-style blend, with Cabernet Sauvignon holding the principal spot. The flavors are diffuse, lightly herbal and peppery, with little concentration or definition.",85,Challenger Ridge 2010 Thornwood Reserve Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A blend of fruit from up-and-coming Red Heaven and Scooteney Flats vineyards, this wine brings aromas of game, medicine cabinet and cherry. The fruit flavors are soft in feel, seeming somewhat dried out.",87,Archeus 2013 Two Storms Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),,,,
"91–93. Barrel sample. This is a densely tannic wine with juiciness showing quite tardily through the tannins. The wine has a very dry, firm character with acidity that finishes on a bright, fresh note.",92,Château Beaumont 2012 Barrel Sample  (Haut-Médoc),,,,
"White raisin and touches of lettuce and celery give this multigrape blend some richness but also a bit of green character. The palate shows lemon, green apple and pineapple, and this lean quality is confirmed by the wine's modest 11% alcohol level. Drink now to catch it at its scouring, sorbet-like best.",85,Bodegas Campante 2006 Versatus White (Ribeiro),,,,
"Initial oaky aromas of dried cheese, coffee grinds, lemon peel and vanilla welcome in plum and other red-berry scents. This rings loudly across the palate, with punchy acidity attributable to the Graciano in this Tempranillo-led blend. Flavors of tomato, raspberry, dried Manchego cheese and vanilla finish savory, long and fresh, with elegance. Drink 2017–2026.",92,Contino 2009 Viña del Olivo  (Rioja),,,,
"This is tight and sturdy as a rock up front, with licorice, hard spice, leather and black cherry aromas. It feels round, chewy, tough and healthy, with flavors of baked black fruit, chocolate, molasses and hickory. Roasted and oaky, but cool and collected. Drink now through 2016.",91,Viña Cobos 2010 Bramare Cabernet Sauvignon (Luján de Cuyo),,,,
"The bold aromas are chili peppery, just hinting at riper fruit below, but the flavors are reversed, with peach and pineapple in the lead followed by peppery notes. This medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc ends on notes of grapefruit and jalapeno; really good for the price.",89,Barker's Marque 2008 3 Brooms Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"From the highest point in the Meursault vineyards, this wine is crisp and cool. It has a tight, bright character that is driven by the steely, mineral texture. The grapefruit flavors go with the riper apple and pear roundness to give a wine that will take a little time to develop. Drink from 2018.",92,Louis Latour 2014 Château de Blagny Premier Cru  (Meursault),,,,
"Whether by virtue of vintage or bottle variation, Boudreaux wines seem to gyrate a bit wildly when first released. This new 2005 is no exception. At first sniff it explodes into life, the aromas a mix of herb, spice, tar, smoke, earth and fruit. Flavors are threaded together into a seamless, saturated whole—plum, cassis and cherry liqueur up front, earth and tannin right behind. Some tasters may find it leaning toward the medicinal, but for those who love Rob Newsom's full-speed-ahead style, this is a gorgeous bottle.",94,Boudreaux Cellars 2005 Merlot (Washington),,,,
The apple and cider aromas are vibrant while the palate offers plenty of dry tart fruit flavors. It brings appeal.,87,Karma Vineyards 2011 Brut de Brut Méthode Champenoise Sparkling (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Rich, flowery wine that shows the potential for white wines in the Dão region. While it keeps plenty of lemon zest acidity, the apricot and peach flavors combine well with pears. There is spice from wood, but the fruit is the thing with this great food wine.",90,Dão Sul 2007 Cabriz Colheita Seleccionada White (Dão),,,,
"As fresh and crisp as possible, this is a wonderful thirst-quenching rosé. Packed in reinterpretation of the classic Provence rosé skittle bottle, it has delicious fresh acidity, raspberry flavors and an edge of minerality that make this a great food wine.",90,Château Minuty 2009 Rose et Or Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"A rich Pinot that offers power and density, this is stuffed with cherry, cola and pomegranate notes. It has sizable tannins, so give it 5–6 years to let them mellow.",89,Flying Goat Cellars 2010 Solomon Hills VIneyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"Wild berry and spice aromas are herbal. This is not that lively in feel, with herbal blue-fruit flavors of blackberry and juniper. This is more green on the finish, which is modestly structured.",86,Casa Silva 2012 Cuvée Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"A Right Bank style—48% Merlot/46% Cab Franc/6% Petit Verdot—this is meaty, spicy, herbal and earthy. There's nothing subtle here, but flavors a'plenty, everything from tomato and strawberry to riper hints of black cherry, cassis and plum. Spice, black coffee and earth dominate the back palate, which slides into very dry, mouth-scraping tannins.",92,Mark Ryan 2006 Long Haul Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),,,,
"Here's a satiny, approachable red blend with notes of black currant, brandy-soaked cherry and a touch of vanilla bean on the nose and mouth. A savory peppery spice reveals itself on the end, with moderate tannins lingering through the close.",87,Hartenberg 2008 Ecurie Red (Stellenbosch),,,,
"Tropical fruit and floral notes abound on this intensely perfumed white. Aged six months in neutral oak, it maintains all it's fruity, forward charms along with a backbone of acidity that's pert and mouthwatering. It's blossomy bouquet might be a bit overwhelming for some.",87,Millbrook 2014 Lollipop Hill Estate Bottled Tocai Friulano (Hudson River Region),,,,
"Thin and simple, this Viognier just doesn't have enough to satisfy. While it's nicely dry and crisp, the orange and peach flavors are watery.",83,Millésimé 2012 Le Jardin Viognier (Paso Robles),,,,
"Small percentages of Merlot and Petit Verdot soften this robustly ripe red, hugely extracted in black currant and blackberry. Mocha, cigar smoke and leather saddle contribute a more muscular imprint, as a rounded weightiness holds on tenaciously to the finish.",90,Castello di Amorosa 2013 Il Barone Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Every wine from this house has exotic aromas and flavors that aren't matched elsewhere, which isn't to say that Valdelana's wines offer fool-proof likability. This wine smells funky and tastes of tobacco, butter and cumin. Lean on the finish, but interesting for its unique character, aromas and flavors.",86,Valdelana 2004 Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
This pale-colored rosé is all about fruit. It is packed with attractive raspberry and red currant flavors that are lifted by the crisp texture and acidity. It has a good depth of flavor with its tangy aftertaste and final burst of fruit.,90,Louis de Sacy NV Brut Rosé Grand Cru  (Champagne),,,,
"Very ripe, juicy and spicy, this is a forward, fruity wine that should be consumed within the year. It has rich plum and jam flavors, light tannins and a soft aftertaste.",84,Quinta do Casal Monteiro 2012 Colheita Seleccionada Red (Tejo),,,,
"This late harvest wine from Hungary is comprised of Furmint, Hárslevelu and Muscat. It has aromas of acacia flower and pear, with flavors of apricot, pear juice and dried rosemary. The finish is pleasantly sweet without being too cloying.",94,Royal Tokaji 2016 Late Harvest  (Tokaji),,,,
"This estate-grown wine comes from the vineyard that provides the backbone to the producer's well-known Les Pommiers Pinot Noir. Tart in rhubarb, pomegranate and plush, herb-kissed red fruit, it's juicy and young, complex yet approachable. Full bodied and grainy in tannin, it'll provide years of pleasure for drinkers who can wait.",92,EnRoute 2014 Amber Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Aromas of tropical fruit, yellow flower and a hint of nut lead the nose. On the informal palate, brisk acidity brightens banana, white peach and pear.",85,Italo Cescon 2014 Pinot Grigio (Veneto),,,,
"Ripe wild berry, dark spice and a whiff of leather unfold in the glass while the solid palate offers up stewed prune, vanilla and roasted coffee bean. Chewy tannins provide the framework. Drink through 2017.",89,Caldaro 2011 Solos Lagrein (Alto Adige),,,,
A ripe red-fruit flavored wine that comes from the Douro village of Murça. It has light tannins as well as red-berry fruits and balanced acidity. There is a mineral textured touch at the end.,88,Real Companhia Velha 2015 Porca de Murça Tinto Red (Douro),,,,
"Pinot Grigio has yet to find a distinguishing style in Washington State. This is borderline generic, almost beery, a plain, pleasant, fairly neutral white wine with a mix of white peaches and green apples.",85,Columbia Crest 2008 Grand Estates Pinot Grigio (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Oaky aromas of coconut, balsam wood and vanilla control the nose on this Cabernet blend that's raw, rugged, acidic, tannic and grating on the palate. Big biting flavors of plum, oak grain and vanilla finish with screechy acidity and snap. Drink through 2021.",89,Aresti 2012 Family Collection Red (Curicó Valley),,,,
"Aromas of dark-skinned berry, blue flowers and a whiff of baking spices lead the nose on this vibrant red. The juicy palate doles out black cherry, red raspberry, white pepper and star anise alongside vibrant acidity. It's made to be drunk young so enjoy soon.",88,Paolo Scavino 2014  Barbera d'Alba,,,,
"Lush prune and raisin aromas stop short of being mushy and make way for fresher notes of black currant and toast. Saturated, dense and chewy on the palate, this tastes ripe and toasty, with hefty blackberry and chocolate flavors. Additional toastiness and peppery spice flavors work the finish on this generous Tempranillo from an excellent vintage. Drink from 2017–2030.",94,Dominio de Atauta 2011 Valdegatiles  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"Sourced from several different Dundee Hills vineyards, this wraps its black cherry fruit in tart acids, chalky minerals, and a hint of iron. Substantial, muscular and stiff out of the bottle, it will blossom with further bottle age. It's already a sturdy, expressive, impressive wine with deep flavors of fruit, earth and rock.",92,J. Christopher 2012 Dundee Hills Cuvée Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),,,,
"This wood-aged Pinot Bianco offers ripe, full fruit with accompanying wood and spice flavors. It is rich and quite soft, but has a touch of crisp acidity.",88,San Michele Eppan 2002 Sanct Valentin Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige),,,,
"This runs to the tart, lemony style of Pinot Gris, common in cool vintages. Citrus and gooseberry flavors are balanced against refreshing minerality, and the acidity is neither harsh nor simply sour.",87,Acrobat 2011 Pinot Gris (Oregon),,,,
"A full-bodied wine with layers of toast over the ripe peach and lime fruits. With good structure, intense acidity and a general feeling of fruitiness, this already-attractive wine could age further. Drink until 2019.",92,Rijckaert 2011 Vignes des Voises Chardonnay (Côtes du Jura),,,,
"This deeply colored, full-bodied wine adds chocolaty richness to ripe plum and blackberry flavors, backed with light tannins that counter a bit of sweetness.",86,Stolen Identity 2014 Red (California),,,,
"Pretty good price for a Cab of this richness and balance. Offers dry, forward flavors of blackberries, cocoa, anise, spice and cedar, with an olivaceous streak. Drink now.",87,Sean Minor 2006 4B Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Brisk minerality and a hint of hazelnut add savory tones to this blend of indigenous Georgian Rkatsiteli and Chardonnay. It's dry and full-bodied, yet surprisingly sprightly, with bright acidity and delicate flavors of stone fruit and citrus rind.",87,Telavi 2010 Marani Rkatsiteli-Chardonnay White (Kakheti),,,,
"Aromas of a closed cellar blow off in the glass to reveal underbrush, violet, woodland berries and a hint of white pepper that all carry over to the palate. It's one-dimensional with fresh acidity and would work well with deep-dish pizza covered with toppings.",86,Dosio 2012  Nebbiolo d'Alba,,,,
"This is as well-balanced an interpretation of Roussanne as they come in California—proudly plump but not flabby. Light gold in color, it offers caramelized banana, custard, beeswax and apple blossom aromas. A backbone of lemony acidity runs through the palate, buttressed with ripe melon, mango and more tropical fruit flavors.",92,Jaffurs 2015 Stolpman Vineyard Roussanne (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"From premier cru vineyards on the Montagne de Reims, this finely balanced wine is tight and crisp with fine acidity. Its white fruits and lively feel are allied to a creamy texture to produce a Champagne that is ready to drink now.",88,Forget-Brimont NV Brut Premier Cru  (Champagne),,,,
"Densely planted 20-year-old vines provide the fruit for this wine. With its layer of tannins over the red fruits and acidity, it is fruity while having structure. Drink now.",87,Domaine des Terres Dorées 2015 Le Ronsay  (Beaujolais),,,,
"Substantially tannic and robust in tar and tobacco, this wine smells and tastes big and broad, a good choice for generous cuts of meat, preferably grilled. Black cherry and blackberry expand in waves around the oak and tobacco.",86,Chateau St. Jean 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Ripe, fresh and crisp, this wine has layers of apples and cream, a sense of structure and full-bodied, lively fruit. This is a great apéritif wine.",86,Elena Walch 2002 Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige),,,,
"Gentle scents of perfume, wild berry and cedar blend seamlessly on the nose. The palate is more punchy and tight, with heavy extraction creating narrow flavors of blackberry and cassis. A short, sinewy finish limits the wine's breadth.",91,Vicentin 2011 Blend de Malbecs Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Organically grown grapes have produced a clear, crisp wine with freshness and lively acidity. These blend effortlessly into the red fruits and light squeeze of lemon juice. The wine is bright and ready to drink.",90,Château Margüi 2015 Perle de Margüi Rosé (Coteaux Varois en Provence),,,,
"Earthy aromas of brandied cherry, spiced berry and coconut require lengthy airing to shed murky, damp notes. This feels tight, with rubbery tannins. Spiced plum, raspberry and foresty flavors finish grabby and lightly herbal.",89,Finca del Marquesado 2008 Gran Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"Darkly toasted oak lends a veil of smoke and char to apple and lemon flavors in this dry, full-bodied Chardonnay. There are hints of stems and leaves on the midpalate, but overall, it's a well-composed wine with balanced acidity and alcohol.",84,SERVE 2010 Terra Romana Chardonnay (Dealu Mare),,,,
"Rose and violet aromas sit comfortably with tight, gritty cherry and plum scents. A tight medium-to-full palate is the staging ground for fresh plum and berry flavors that are powerful but not heavy. A long, warming finish maintains the wine's core potency. This is not ready to drink; best from 2019–2028.",92,Terroir Al Límit 2015 Torroja Red (Priorat),,,,
"This lively white is floral in honeysuckle aromas, while creamy, rounded layers of apricot play on the full-bodied palate. A spicy nutmeg chaser closes things out. Well balanced and accessible, this is ready to drink now.",90,Lawer 2015 Betsy's Vineyard Viognier (Knights Valley),,,,
"If you're going to try just one Uruguayan Tannat, then let it be Bouza. This friendly, nicely balanced offering opens on forest floor and dusty berry aromas. Toasty, peppery oak lends spice notes to core berry fruit, while the finish is lush and round. Drink through 2020.",91,Bouza 2015 Reserva Tannat (Montevideo),,,,
"Citrusy in style, with aromas of orange, passion fruit and grapefruit. Feels flush and full-bodied, with basic tangerine and navel orange flavors. Fresh on the finish but hollow in terms of depth, with a light fade.",87,Alfredo Roca 2011 Dedicación Personal Sauvignon Blanc,,,,
"Syrupy and dense, this is a burly wine, soft but powerful, that keeps coming back to the theme of blackberry syrup. Velvety tannins buoy the midpoint, before it finishes in a burst of intense ripeness.",86,Truett Hurst 2012 Rattler Rock Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Subtle aromas of dried berry, Mediterranean brush, game and savory herb lead off this vibrant blend of Pinot Nero and Nero d'Avola. The sleek palate offers candied red cherry, cinnamon and thyme alongside fine-grained tannins.",89,Tenuta Rapitalà 2012 Nuhar Red (Sicilia),,,,
"There is something that makes me think about a summer forest: Is it the fresh moss, the fresh green foliage, the implied ease and freshness of light green foliage on a warm day? The palate stuns with white pepper and purity and combines fruit ripeness with ballerina-like poise. Wonderful texture. Prepare to be moved.",93,Ingrid Groiss 2015 Pankraz Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),,,,
"Yeasty, bready aromas of toast and apple set up a smooth, mature palate with good acidity. Apple, quince and dry yeasty, toasty flavors end with length, complexity and a mild note of baked apple. Drink now.",90,Vins El Cep 2010 Cla Ror Gran Reserva Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"Finesse is a wine created to exhibit elegance, showing restrained fruits, poised tannins and plenty of the trademark 2004 fresh acidity.",88,Château de Portets 2004 Finesse de Portets  (Graves),,,,
"This bottling, from a vineyard planted in 1972, is still fresh despite being six-years-old, and represents a much lighter style of Cabernet Sauvignon that goes great with a chill. Aromas of strawberry, pepper, bay leaf, leather and black pepper lead into a tart and tangy palate, which shows a light hint of barnyard funk.",90,Cooper-Garrod 2011 George's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"The aromas are pretty and pure, with perfumed notes of plum and blackberry speckled with spice and herb. The flavors are seamless and full, showing a real sense of freshness and vibrancy capped off by a tart finish that hangs together impressively.",94,Charles Smith 2013 Broncho Stoneridge Vineyard Malbec (Washington),,,,
"A rustic, simple Merlot. It's soft and a little sweet in jammy fruit flavors, and isn't showing much depth.",84,Beaver Creek 2008 Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"The intense floral fragrance suggests dog rose, broom, violet and perfumed berry. The vibrant, linear palate offers red cherry-berry, cinnamon, white pepper, Mediterranean herb, licorice and orange zest alongside assertive but polished tannins and vibrant acidity. It's beautifully balanced, with a mineral-driven finish. Drink 2017–2025.",92,Biondi 2013 Outis Rosso  (Etna),,,,
"This herb-laced wine comes from a 1,100-feet elevation outpost five miles from the ocean and shows both feral notes and robust fruit. Tart cranberry flavor dominates, complemented by orange peel nuances. Its tannins are in full force, calling for more time in the glass if not in the cellar. Best the second day after opening, if one can wait.",93,Blue Farm 2014 King Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),,,,
"This perennial offering from the producer, the longtime proprietor of this fine vineyard, showcases cassis and chocolate in full-bodied, undulating waves of big, brash flavor. Despite the mountain provenance, the tannins are soft and well integrated, never distracting from the ripeness of the fruit.",90,Louis M. Martini 2012 Monte Rosso Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"90-92 Rich and fruity, a real juice bomb of a wine that has black currant and spice fruit to go with its solid, well-integrated tannins.",91,Château d'Agassac 2010 Barrel sample  (Haut-Médoc),,,,
"This structured wine opens with earthy aromas of tilled soil, underbrush, leather, cedar, bright berries and baking spices. The vibrant palate displays classic Nebbiolo flavors of crushed dark cherry, clove, cinnamon, truffle, sage, thyme and licorice alongside brisk acidity and bracing but noble tannins. It will bloom into a beauty. Drink 2020–2040.",95,Aurelio Settimo 2010 Rocche dell'Annunziata  (Barolo),,,,
"Clean, straightforward aromas of berry, cassis and mineral are nice, while the palate has ample lushness, purity and focus. Flavors of cola, black currant and blackberry are solid, and the finish keeps its pose. On the money for a regular, journeyman's Malbec.",88,Familia Schroeder 2007 Saurus Patagonia Select Malbec (Neuquén),,,,
"Produced in the west of Gascony, with a strong oceanic influence, this Chardonnay is cool, fruity and with bright acidity. It does have a creamy texture that fills out the fruitiness. It is an attractive, ripe wine that is ready to drink.",85,Domaine de l'Herré 2015 La Galope Chardonnay (Côtes de Gascogne),,,,
"Some tasters will celebrate the elegance and finesse of this lightweight Pinot; time will be the ultimate judge. At the moment it is a bit out of balance; there is light cherry fruit, plenty of alcohol, some grainy, earthy tannins and overall a lack of integration. Maybe it just needs more time in the bottle; the components are good enough—tart cranberry and strawberry flavors, sharp acids, some minerality and an earthy underpinning. It just hasn't (yet) come together.",87,The Four Graces 2006 Reserve Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),,,,
"Spicy, fresh and clean, this would pair with fried seafood or spaghetti con vongole. It offers pretty citrus tones followed by a drying mineral nuance.",86,Tasca d'Almerita 2011 Sallier de la Tour Inzolia (Sicilia),,,,
"Dark and dense, this has loads of ripe fruit and leather aromas on the bouquet. It shows a soft, supple side on the palate, with a tangy touch of black licorice on the finish.",87,Tenuta Gorghi Tondi 2010 Coste a Preola Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),,,,
"A delicious apple flavored wine, fruity-crisp and packed with lively acidity. It has a fine, light mousse, smoothly textured and with lively, perfumed final acidity. Drink now.",87,Dão Sul 2010 Condessa de Santar Extra Brut Sparkling (Dão),,,,
"Hints of brine and sea water lend rusticity to pressed-apple flavors in this dry, delicately framed wine. Fruit flavors seem rather oxidized on the palate, but a tart, lemony zing adds some freshness.",84,Osprey's Dominion 2010 Reserve Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"Really fragrant, with this vineyard's near-perfect mix of fruit, rock and barrel. This is restrained, elegant but powerful—raspberry fruit over crushed rock, with vertical structure, an immaculate mouthfeel, and a finish that continues to resonate for minutes after the swallow.",91,AlmaTerra 2006 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Syrah (Red Mountain),,,,
"This is a beautiful and delicate dessert wine with lightly musty notes that appear in the back of candied fruit, orange zest, almond paste, stone fruit and vanilla cream. It feels light and buoyant on the close but also delivers the heft and personality you need for a pairing with aged goat cheese and apricot jelly.",94,Tre Monti 2007 Casa Lola  (Albana di Romagna),,,,
"With the addition of 20% Grenache, this pushes the rich fruit flavors front and center. Ripe blueberries are in the foreground, cutting through some astringent tannins. There is little evidence of the herbal character that many Washington Syrahs evoke, but it's a bold, fruit-driven wine that is immediately enjoyable.",90,L'Ecole No. 41 2010 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This single-vineyard exploration shows a more tropical side than the winery's other Chardonnays. Rich, rounded notes of honeysuckle, lemon custard and apple cider characterize the nose. The palate is reserved compared to the showy aromas, with buttered peach and green-apple flavors.",90,Testarossa 2013 Rincon VIneyard Chardonnay (Arroyo Grande Valley),,,,
"Stewed prune and cake spice aromas lead the nose along with a balsamic note. Showing the intense heat of the vintage, the warm palate offers dried cherry, raisin, powdered sage and a hint of clove alongside polished tannins. Drink soon to capture the remaining fruit and freshness.",89,Viberti 2011 San Pietro Riserva  (Barolo),,,,
Jammy aromas of blackberry and cassis start out gaseous and muddled but find their way with airing. This feels wide and low on zest. Flavors of prune and stewed berry end with toasty oak but also heavy ripe prune and berry flavors. Drink now.,88,Dominio de Tares 2012 Baltos Mencía (Bierzo),,,,
"Luscious green plum and white grapefruit flavors mark this taut, steely off-dry Riesling. While light in body, it's creamy in texture, filling the mouth with juicy fruit flavors off set by zesty, lime-inflected acidity. The finish is long and persistent.",91,Richard Böcking 2015 Schlossberg Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Subdued aromas of pear peel give way to fleshy pear fruit framed with grapefruit acidity. Harmonious and reined-in, the wine combines elegance with fruity concentration.",90,Fritsch 2012 Mordthal Grüner Veltliner (Wagram-Donauland),,,,
"Herb, stem, green olive and floral aromas lead to generous fruit and savory flavors that carry though the finish. It shows a lot of finesse and a beautiful sense of balance.",92,Va Piano 2014 Stoney Vine Vineyard Black Label Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"There's a dark green dankness on the nose of this single-vineyard wine, with wet basil and damp oregano mixing with lawn cuttings and dark-green lime peels. The sip shows tangy lime zest, lime juice and a wet-cement minerality.",88,Brander 2014 Buttonwood Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Perhaps this is starting to tire? There's a slightly waxy dullness to the wine's otherwise interesting citrus aromas, while the flavors of lemon and white grapefruit are pleasant without being captivating. Drink up.",85,Stone Paddock 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Hawke's Bay),,,,
"Aromas of freshly cut flowers, green apple, lime and white peach leap from the glass. The creamy texture is brightened by lively acidity. It's simple but well executed.",89,Cantina Produttori Cortaccia 2012 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),,,,
"A serious, considered wine with its full, ripe and soft flavors tempered with a complex structure. It will not age as impressively as other Pol Roger vintages, and already the yeast and toast element is creeping in. But the weight of Pinot Noir is there, leaving a powerful, creamy mousse finish.",94,Pol Roger 2000 Vintage Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"A mouthwateringly fresh wine, its acidity giving a classic steely, mineral texture. The citrus fruit is fresh, while it also has a rounded character. Toast from wood aging adds another softer aspect.",89,Pascal Bouchard 2008 Beauroy Premier Cru  (Chablis),,,,
"This seems a bit riper and rounder than most Marlborough Sauvignon Blancs, but it remains varietally on target. Gooseberry and pink grapefruit aromas and flavors finish on a mouthwatering note. Drink now.",88,Makara 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"A high level of char introduces this saturated, high-energy Rioja, which also shows animal and wild herb aromas. Oak and vanilla flavors share space with plum and blackberry fruit on the palate, a mocha note echoing on the strong, acid-driven finish. Drink through 2027.",90,Quasar 2012 Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"Unusually fragrant, even sharp-edged for a sparkling wine, this has aggressive, Sauvignon-like aromas of thistle, grapefruit and thyme, and those strong flavors carry through on the palate. Nonetheless, it is dry and zesty and clean. If you like these sorts of herbaceous flavors in a sparkler, this one's for you.",84,Alain Poulet NV  Clairette de Die Méthode Dioise Ancestrale,,,,
"Enticing scents of spring flower, beeswax and orchard fruit come together in the glass. The elegant, linear palate shows juicy lemon, nectarine, hazelnut and a saline note framed in firm acidity. It closes crisp and clean.",90,Baglio del Cristo di Campobello 2015 Adenzia White (Sicilia),,,,
"Attractive notes of dried red berry and bramble mingle with hints of savory herb and soft peppery spice on the bouquet of this blend. Skin-driven fruit flavors dominate the palate, followed by a clean finish. A blend of 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon; Mevushal.",85,Recanati 2011 Yasmin Red (Galilee),,,,
"Clove, leather and cherry aromas lead the way, followed by more of the same flavors on the palate, joined by hints of darker, plummier fruit. This full-bodied blend of 95% Grenache and 5% Mourvèdre has some dusty tannins, but they're balanced by ample fruit, at least for the moment. Drink now–2025.",92,Domaine de Nalys 2013 Le Châtaignier Grenache-Mourvèdre (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),,,,
"This superripe, late-harvest style of wine smells like raisins and dried plums. It tastes so fruity and ripe that it's sweet, with a full body to match. It would be best as a dessert wine.",84,2Plank 2014 Zinfandel (Amador County),,,,
"One of a pair of single variety rosés from Eric Poli, this is crisp, with an earthy edge typical of this grape. Its red currant fruit and acidity offer a delicious, refreshing contrast. Drink now.",86,Domaine Poli 2016 Sciaccarellu Rosé (Ile de Beauté),,,,
"Made from only Grand Cru vineyards, this ripe, full and wonderfully textured wine is rich and complex. It brings out tangy orange and lemon zest, a tightly mineral texture, fragrant fruit and acidity. Dense and concentrated, the wine would benefit from some bottle age to bring out all its flavors.",94,Taittinger NV Prélude Grands Crus Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"This is a heady, seriously generous Pinot Noir from a coolish site in the Sonoma Coast AVA that clearly had a banner ripening year in 2012. The fruit is smoky and concentrated in dark berry and cherry, an intriguing bit of spearmint playing around in the background. Rodgers Creek is an estate vineyard for the brand, planted to Pommard clones. A steal at this price.",90,Garnet 2012 Rodgers Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Densely purple scents of blackberry jam, plum, cola, cherry extract and dried violet syrup overcome the nose on this wine from a property once owned by a famous composer. The flavors are quite jammy, but given complexity by nuances of dark chocolate and espresso beans. Decent acidity and solid tannins will make this last. Drink 2018–2024.",90,Epoch Estate Wines 2011 Paderewski Tempranillo (Paso Robles),,,,
"This extremely limited-production Merlot (about 250 cases) is Alex and Paul Golitzin's “other” great red. It's all Klipsun Vineyard fruit, 75% Merlot and 25% Cabernet, and its soft, chocolatey tannins envelope the taste buds in a sensual, textured landscape comprised of luscious cherry fruit and laced with hints of anise and roasted coffee. Big and extracted, yet more approachable than the Cabernet.",92,Quilceda Creek 1998 Merlot (Washington),,,,
"A very sweet red blend, this has easy-to-like raspberry and vanilla flavors. Give it a slight chill and drink it with ham sandwiches.",84,Barefoot NV Sweet Red Red (California),,,,
"This is a punchy wine that's fresh on the nose. The palate sports a viscous feel that's related to Viognier and Chardonnay, while the Sauvignon Blanc and Sauvignon Gris in the blend bring a citrus-like quality and an asparagus flavor.  The finish quickly loses steam.",87,Casa Silva 2010 Quinta Generación White (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"Jammy blue fruit and cherries immerse themselves within a context of inviting and densely packed earth in this coastal, estate-grown wine. Spicy acidity and pronounced wood add additional weight and complexity as the texture takes on velvety lushness that's fully balanced and considerate.",94,Fort Ross 2012 Fort Ross Vineyard Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),,,,
"Boisterous and juicy with blackberry-pie aromas on the nose, touched by caramel, milk chocolate and some lilac, this is a porch-pounding, crowd-pleasing red wine. Cola and black-cherry juice pop on the palate, which is hedonistically pleasing although not too complex.",86,Chronic Cellars 2014 Suite Petite Petite Sirah (California),,,,
"The wine is rich and soft with some fine tannins. It has red fruit and blackberry flavors along with juicy acidity. Lightly structured, it will develop quickly and should be ready starting from 2017.",87,Château Haut Mouleyre 2014  Bordeaux Supérieur,,,,
"Lightly wood aged, this is a rich wine that has tropical fruits as well as toast and pepper from the alcohol. Unfortunately, there's a streak of citrus that sits awkwardly with the rest of the wine. Drink now.",84,Quinta do Judeu 2012 White (Douro),,,,
"Enticing aromas of wild berry, pine forest, aromatic herbs, iris and a hint of leather emerge on this full-bodied red. The bold, chewy palate delivers crunchy red berry, anise white pepper, clove and sage alongside youthfully assertive tannins and bright acidity. The ripe fruit seamlessly supports the hefty alcohol level.",93,G D Vajra 2011 Albe  (Barolo),,,,
"Ripe fruit, prune, sticky pipe tobacco and rum cake notes are bold and big, with thick aromatic embroidery and broader brush strokes. Structured and incredibly smooth on the finish. This wine shows a fine, velvety texture.",92,San Lorenzo 2007 Bramante  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"A high mark of acidity complements the crisp flavors of cherry, strawberry and cranberry here, accented by woody forest notes and a bitter, savory component of black tea. Light-bodied, it has enough body and weight to stay relevant through the finish.",89,Moshin 2013 Rosalina Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Extraordinarily ripe, this Cab erupts with pie-filling blackberry, cherry, currant and chocolate flavors. It's not exactly sweet, but seems so, especially with the caramelized oak coating. Drink now with a grilled steak.",87,Clos La Chance 2005 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast),,,,
"Enticing aromas of wild berry, spring blossom, citrus and orchard fruit take center stage on this savory rosato. The vibrant palate doles out crushed raspberry, juicy Marasca cherry, fennel seed and a hint of nutmeg alongside refreshing acidity. It closes crisp and clean.",89,Giovanna Tantini 2016  Bardolino Chiaretto,,,,
"Very strong white peach and lemon blossom aromas meet with roasted chicken, honeysuckle and chamomile on the nose of this bottling. Apple, pear and nectarine show on the palate, as does fresh cherimoya, graphite and more white peach toward the finish.",91,Talbott 2013 Diamond T Vineyard Chardonnay (Monterey),,,,
"You'll find subtle but alluring mature orchard fruit, dried herb, citrus zest and balsamic aromas in this rounded white. They carry over to the bright palate, along with a hint of hazelnut.",88,Vadiaperti 2015  Greco di Tufo,,,,
"The wine is spicy, fruity with soft tannins and plenty of ripe red berries. Its dry core gives it shape along with a firm anchor for the generous fruitiness. Drink now.",86,Quinta do Conde 2016 Canoa Red (Lisboa),,,,
"Made of 80% Sangiovese and 20% Merlot, this simple red opens with a whiff of black currant and brown spice. Informal and easygoing in structure, it shows plum and clove flavors on the palate. Drink soon.",85,Fattoria Il Muro 2015 Spigallo  (Chianti),,,,
"Elegant black currant, clove and leather appear on the nose of this well-priced blend from a San Diego-based winery founded by millennial marketing wiz Dylan Steeves. Dried black cherries and licorice show on the slightly leathery palate.",88,Riché NV Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"Briny pickled aromas are just clean enough to pass muster. This simple Viura is lemony and tangy on the palate, with saline-influenced flavors of citrus fruits and bell pepper. On a snappy finish, a briny flavor leads the way.",84,Conde de Altava 2015 Joven Viura (Rioja),,,,
"The smell of tart green apple frying in butter introduces this bottling from Dan Lee's historic winery. On the palate, lemon-lime spritzer and pear flow into a saline minerality in the midpalate, with acidic tartness emerging on the finish. This is a very tight and focused Chardonnay.",87,Morgan 2012 Highland Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"From vines now a dozen years old, this unusual Walla Walla AVA Sauvignon Blanc is a brilliant straw color—aromatic with light scents of ripe grain and tangy fruits, and fills the mouth with delicious flavors of melon, white peach, lemon verbena and a dash of pepper. Complex and engaging, it finishes dry but leaves an impression of slight sweetness. Drink it slightly chilled.",91,Woodward Canyon 2013 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Classic Rutherford Cab. Dry, dusty and slightly herbal, with refined, jammy flavors of red and black cherries, currants, mocha and cedar. The alcohol is a little high, giving this 100% Cabernet a warm, full-bodied feel. The tannins suggest mid-term aging. 2013–2018.",92,Piña 2007 Firehouse Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),,,,
"Notes of tart strawberry and wood sorrel rise delicately from the glass and scent the light, softly hued palate beautifully. There is interest here beyond mere fruit and the spicy core mingles beautifully with ripe lemon freshness. Drink soon but slowly to savor the spice.",90,Bründlmayer 2015 Langenloiser Rosé (Niederösterreich),,,,
"Baked plum, grilled mushroom and a potpourri of spicy aromas emerge on this firmly structured red. The concentrated, full-bodied palate delivers ripe black cherry, tobacco, fig, ground pepper and a licorice note. Firm, ripe tannins provide support.",92,Mastroberardino 2009 Radici  (Taurasi),,,,
"The tanginess of grapefruit peel, paired with very ripe Bosc pear, is already apparent on the nose before becoming full-blown on the palate. There is concentration and precision. The ripeness of this vintage is nicely corralled and held in check by citrus freshness and countered by yeasty richness and spice. The finish is gloriously enlivening, fresh and moreish.",94,Tegernseerhof 2015 Loibenberg Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),,,,
"Ripe, almost candied aromas of berry fruits are offset by creamy oak scents and a touch of olive. This is chunky, weighty and trying hard to keep its form. Flavors of roasted black fruits, chocolate and herbs finish soft and low on structure. Drink this warm-vintage, full-flavored Cab through 2017.",90,Santa Carolina 2012 Reserva de Familia Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),,,,
"Tart red-berry and savory herb aromas lead the nose of this rosé made from 70% Barbera and 30% Merlot. The palate offers light tannins and red-fruit-skin flavors, ending clean and crisp.",85,Recanati 2011 Rosé (Galilee),,,,

"Lusty and robust, this Cab, Merlot and Syrah blend combines peppery, briary flavors with riper fruit notes of blackberries and plums. The texture is especially appealing, with its rich, complex tannins, from both the grapes and from oak. Good job in a dry red wine at a fair price.",87,Peirano 2006 The Other Red (Lodi),,,,
"This is a sort of junior version of Swan's awesome Trenton Estate Pinot. It shows the same dryness and acidity, with appealing flavors of cherries, raspberries and mushrooms. It's not quite as dense and complex, but it's a gorgeously silky Pinot Noir.",91,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2007 Trenton View Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Aromas of citrus blossom, white stone fruit and a whiff of wet flint float from the glass.

Notes of almond and ginger add depth.",90,Ronco del Gelso 2015 Rive Alte Pinot Grigio (Friuli Isonzo),,,,
"A good value, this is an easy-pleasing Syrah with vibrant notes of red plum, cherry and blueberry. Fine, dusty tannins reminiscent of cocoa powder and dried crushed berries stay after swallow alongside a hint of sweet smoke flavor.",89,Goats do Roam Wine Co. 2008 Goat-Roti Syrah-Viognier (Coastal Region),,,,
"There is a racy, spicy, biting edge to this young Pinot that nicely expresses the Chehalem Mountains AVA terroir, authoritative and unapologetic for the herbal side of the grape. It lingers and opens into a mélange of red fruits, forest, leaf and loam, still stiff and compact after hours of breathing.",92,Siduri 2010 Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),,,,
"Extremely rocky and dusty aromas of turned earth and tobacco meet with snapped dark chocolate on the nose of this bottling from a little-known region 30 miles inland from the Monterey Bay. Espresso bean and black plums show on the impressively dark palate that is well structured, finishing on slight hints of roasted pepper and peppercorns.",88,Donati 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paicines),,,,
"This blend of the very local Petit Courbu and Petit Manseng grapes comes from the same region as Madiran. The wine is dry but rich—very rich—with apricot and honey flavors.

This is ready to drink.",89,Vignobles Brumont 2012 Château Bouscassé Les Jardins  (Pacherenc du Vic Bilh),,,,
"Marginally better than the regular Chardonnay, this offers thin flavors of sour apple in a wash of acidity.",82,Deer Creek 2011 Private Reserve Chardonnay (Rogue Valley),,,,
"Vibrant, dense purple in color, this is ultraconcentrated on the nose, offering kirsch, blueberry reduction and dusty-earth aromas. The palate is heavy, rich and laden with dark fruit, yet there's a balance of grainy tannins and snappy acidity to keep the weight in check.",89,Michael Shaps 2012 Tannat (Monticello),,,,
"A nice Cabernet for drinking now. It's rich in berries, cherries, currants and oak, with smooth tannins and soft acidity. Shows an elaboration that makes it upscale and elegant.",86,Simple Math Cellars 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),,,,
"Smooth and rich, its creamy texture is rounded out with a toast note. Flavors of peppered apricot and green plum work well together to give a warm, concentrated wine that shows all of its ripe fruit up front.",89,Château Routas 2010 Coquelicot Viognier-Chardonnay (Vin de Pays Var),,,,
This concentrated wine brings tannins together with superripe black fruits and a firm aftertaste. A bite of alcohol spoils the rich fruitiness. Drink from 2018.,88,Douro Prime 2011 Inquieto Reserva Red (Douro),,,,
"Winemaker Nick Elliott taps into the biodynamic vineyard planted by Syrah legend Bob Lindquist to deliver this rich bottling. It's full of roasted black fruit aromasl, with nori, soy and even organ meat touches on the nose. Peppery spice and charred beef flavors accent the lavish palate, while thick tannins frame ripe black-currant flavors on a bed of unwavering acidity.",92,Nicora 2014 Slide Hill Vineyard Syrah (Edna Valley),,,,
"This structured, concentrated wine is from an estate in the north of Saint-Estèphe. A dominance of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend lends it firm, solid tannins as well as a juicy black-currant note. It's a wine for long-term aging; don't drink before 7–8 years.",91,Château Beau-Site 2010  Saint-Estèphe,,,,
"Right on target, the toasty, smoky nose here opens to full green-apple and mineral flavors on the palate. Hints of apricot and lime add interest and complexity, and the wine finishes smooth and long. Shows nice precision of flavor and texture.",89,Pacific Echo 1995 Blanc de Blancs  (Anderson Valley),,,,
"Dried yellow flower, yellow stone fruit and a whiff of acacia honey meld together in the glass. The vibrant, linear palate includes lemon zest, lime, pineapple, dried herb and flinty mineral framed in tangy acidity. A note of wild fennel closes the finish. Hold for even more complexity. Drink through 2024.",91,Feudi di San Gregorio 2014 Studi Arianiello  (Fiano di Avellino),,,,
"This is a very delicious Pinot, made in a drink-me-now style. It's dry and crisp and silky, and enormously rich in raspberry, cherry and strawberry jam flavors. The texture is pure silk and satin. Drink now for sheer lusciousness.",88,Perception 2008 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"While the nose is savory with dusty mineral and earth tones, the palate of this semi-sweet Riesling is intensely concentrated with juicy, ripe peach and marmalade flavors. It's lacy and light in texture, but penetrating fruit flavors linger long on the finish.",92,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch) 2012 Berncasteler Doctor Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"This wine shows the fresh, juicy raspberry character of the grape. It has fruity aromas, fresh berry and cherry flavors and a deceptively full body, with a good streak of crispness on the palate.",89,Portalupi 2014 Pauli Ranch Barbera (Mendocino County),,,,
"The estate is under the same ownership as Château la Dominique in Saint-Émilion. This dense wine balances acidity with intense fruitiness. The tannins are now softening, giving a rich structure plus a concentrated leather and spice character. Drink from 2016.",91,Château Clément-Pichon 2010  Haut-Médoc,,,,
"This is a wonderful wine, very ripe, the blackberry and sweet fruits all here, While the tannins are solid and concentrated, they are in the center of a lush, beautifully rich series of flavors that range from fruit to licorice to spice. The wine shows great aging potential.",95,Louis Jadot 2005 Les Baudes Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),,,,
"Massively fruity and oaky, this is an atom bomb of a Chardonnay. You either love this style or you hate it. The pineapple tart, apricot, pear, peach, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice flavors go on and on. Beyond the utter richness is firm acidity and a bracing minerality. Defines California-style decadence, but drink now, as the wine will quickly go downhill.",95,Au Bon Climat 2007 Los Alamos Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"A bold and ripe wine, it's full of black currant fruits accompanied by wood and acidity. It's obviously young and will soften and calm into a smooth and rich wine. The finish brings out a dry character. Drink from 2017.",85,Château Cayla 2012  Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux,,,,
"A significant price drop and a riper vintage make this a fine, every day go-to Pinot Gris. Apple and pear fruit, spiced up with cinnamon highlights, lead into a clean finish. Drink it young.",87,Kudos 2012 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Tart, firm and (for this lighter vintage) showing good concentration, this well-constructed effort is built around tangy cherry/berry fruit. With above-average length and depth, and naturally high acidity, this can continue to develop further refinement through 2026.",91,Winderlea 2013 Crawford Beck Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
"Herbal and juicy in acidity, this perennially well-made white is stainless steel-fermented with just a small percentage put in French oak. Voluptuously rich and full bodied, it offers strongly etched flavors of peach and pineapple that work alongside a spicy hint of lemongrass.",88,Rodney Strong 2016 Charlotte's Home Sauvignon Blanc (Northern Sonoma),,,,
"A smooth, soft, creamy wine, revolving around ripe fruit, limes and an enticing spice character. The wine is full in the mouth, keeping a sense of structure, but using that as a framework for concentrated fruit. Not for aging, but already delicious to drink. Screwcap.",90,Holzapfel 2007 Vorderselber Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),,,,
"The hot 2003 vintage was probably not the year to make a vintage Champagne. Soft and rounded, this is missing texture and poise. Certainly now mature, it offers attractive acidity at the end.",87,Vincent Couche 2003 Millésime Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"Quite a good Cabernet, especially at this price. They blended some other varieties, including Zinfandel, Malbec and Petite Sirah, which bring extra layers. It's a fine everyday wine—fruity, spicy, full-bodied and dry.",87,Black Box 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),,,,
"Rustic aromas recall game, fetid flower, barnyard and black fruit past its prime. The bitter palate shows flint and a hint of tire rubber but no fruit richness. Tried twice with consistent results.",82,Tenute Mater Domini 2012 Marangi Negroamaro (Salento),,,,
"Named after a pioneer of wood-aged Sauvignon Blanc, this wine has toast as well as rounded fruit. The subtle wood focuses on enriching the fruit and bringing out its steel and citrus character. The wine can certainly age, drink until 2020.",92,Henri Bourgeois 2011 Etienne Henri  (Sancerre),,,,
"Powerful fruit flavors and a firm, high-octane feeling on the palate make this a big, imposing wine. It offers tasty, ripe boysenberry-jam flavors, moderate tannins and a lip-smacking finish.",89,Kendall-Jackson 2014 Vintner's Reserve Zinfandel (California),,,,
"Soft and already approachable, this is a red-fruited wine, with ripe, well-integrated tannins and juicy acidity. It's round, fruity and ready to drink.",88,Château du Port 2010 Tertre-Perdigous Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"Aromas of blackberry, cassis, raisin and woodspice suggest that this varietal Garnacha is ripe. That's confirmed on the palate, which feels chunky and full, with modest acidic edge. Ripe, roasted, fully oaked flavors of black fruits finish minty and spicy, with notes of clove and coffee. Drink this full-bodied, fairly soft wine through 2018.",89,Cellers Tarroné 2013 Seguit Grenache (Terra Alta),,,,
"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon smells of cassis, underbrush and vanilla. It's easygoing and made to be enjoyed young, its black currant, licorice and cinnamon flavors smoothed with round tannins.",86,Stemmari 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sicilia),,,,
"The wine is fresh, its baked apple and green plum fruit cut with intense citrus. The vineyard, with its pure chalk soil, shows strongly in the minerality and steely texture of the wine, promising aging. Drink this complex wine from 2016.",92,Simonnet-Febvre 2012 Mont de Milieu Premier Cru  (Chablis),,,,
"A mere youth, this blend of 68% Syrah, 30% Grenache and 2% Viognier needs time, suggesting a decant before enjoying. High-toned and juicy blueberry and blackberry remain shy on the palate, while the wine's more exotic handfuls of black licorice and tea are more pronounced, alongside a dark chocolate vibe and pinches of white pepper.",90,Kale 2012 Kick Ranch Vineyard Home Run Cuvée Syrah-Grenache-Viognier (Sonoma County),,,,
"Some Zins handle high alcohol well, and so it is with this lusty, delicious example from Lodi. It's soft and easy to drink, with rich flavors of berries, cherries, currants, smoky oak and spices that turn chocolaty on the finish.",88,Mettler Family Vineyards 2007 Epicenter Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),,,,
"A twist of clove, fig and chocolate figure into this powerful, concentrated wine, with baked plum, tobacco and maple taking on secondary roles. It's full bodied and thick, so pair appropriately. It finishes in black pepper.",90,Rock Wall 2012 Westphall Ridge Vineyard Zinfandel (Rockpile),,,,
"Fresh, savory herb and barrel-spice aromas intertwine, with dark fruit lurking in the background. The black-fruit flavors are supple and show a sense of polish.",91,William Church 2013 Tres Bien Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Three things characterize this wine: exceptionally intense blackberry and currant flavors, thick, hard tannins and a bone dry finish. It's big and firm with a lot of promise, so do try to cellar it for at least six years, but people who like their wines young could try it sooner.",92,Valance 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"With up-front spiciness, this is an attractive, light and fragrant wine. There is no complexity, just pleasant off-flavors of honey and lychees. Drink now.",88,Frédéric Mallo 2010 Cuvée Saint-Jacques Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"This pretty Prosecco delivers elegant aromas of pear, white flower and honey. Thanks to a tangy touch of sweetness and the wine's creamy mousse, this could be paired with smoked salmon or prosciutto di Parma.",88,Le Colture NV Cruner Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
"A unique take on Manzanilla Sherry, which is often light and sea-flecked but in this case is more amber, hazy and full. The nose is racy and spicy, while the palate offers dried apricots, orange peel and salt. Finishes with tang offsetting hazelnut and walnut notes. Oily, interesting and very good if you are a Sherry fan.",90,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L. NV Manzanilla Sherry (Jerez),,,,
"A veritable kaleidoscope of scents, this off-dry Riesling transitions frenetically from a range of aromas—grassy and herbal, to stony and mineral, then suddenly ripe with stone fruit and honey. The palate is juicy and quaffable with sweet pink-grapefruit flavor accented by a brisk, lemon-lime finish.",88,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler 2012 Wehlener Klosterberg Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"There's so much raspberry, cherry, cola, clove, cinnamon and pepper flavor in this wine, it's hard to know where to begin. It's also dry, with smoky, vanilla oak notes. Yet it lacks the vital structure a good Rhône blend wants in order to house all this richness. Drink now. Grenache-Syrah.",87,Jorian Hill 2007 Beespoke Red (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"This delivers about the same intensity and concentration as a top shelf Amarone—but for half the price. It offers loads of spice, ripe fruit, leather, tobacco and black olive flavors that drive the long, supple mouthfeel.",91,Le Salette 2009 I Progni  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso),,,,
"How unusual—a Pinot Noir from Wachau! Appetizing notes of fresh red currants give this a delicate, light-bodied aspect. The tart berry fruit is again reinforced on the palate where red currants are joined by cranberry. White pepper fizzes around the edges and makes for a lot of charm on a slender, smooth and translucent body.",91,Tegernseerhof 2013 Pinot Noir (Wachau),,,,
"Aromas of yellow flower and orchard fruit take center stage in this round, medium-bodied white. The spicy palate offers yellow apple, citrus zest and a note of candied ginger alongside crisp acidity.",87,Il Colombaio di Santa Chiara 2013 Selvabianca  (Vernaccia di San Gimignano),,,,
"Immediately attractive red fruit flavors are cut with delicious acidity. This is a crisp, fruity wine, fresh with just a tang of orange peel, ready to drink now.",86,Joseph Mellot 2012 Le Rabault Rosé (Sancerre),,,,
"Gamy aromas lead to a sinewy, lean palate. This funky Cabernet tastes of creamy oak, plum and green herbs. It finishes a bit weedy, with savory offsets.",86,Salentein 2014 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Uco Valley),,,,
"Exuberant on the nose, with aromas of fresh blossoms, luscious melon and peach, this wine is a welcome harbinger of long summer nights to come. It's rich and ripe with red cherry and berry flavor, but refreshingly brisk. A chalky minerality lingers on the finish.",90,Anthony Nappa 2013 Anomaly Pinot Noir (New York),,,,
"This rare varietal offering, blended with 25% Petite Sirah, displays notes of dark plum, herbs and black and green olive. The fruit flavors are sweet, lush and concentrated with abundant olive flavors on the finish.",90,Cairdeas 2012 Counoise (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Sweet floral notes open the way for soft flavors of peach, apricot cream and honey. This Prosecco sparkler offers foamy, creamy peach flavors backed by well-balanced levels of sweetness and acidity and impressive complexity. This is one of the best Proseccos on the market today.",90,Bortolomiol 2008 Cartizze Dry  (Prosecco Superiore di Cartizze),,,,
"This is plump wine is redolent of ripe red fruit, blackberry, spice, cola and teriyaki. It will pair well with stewed beef, roasted pork with garlic and rosemary or lamb chops.",87,Scriani 2008  Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso,,,,
"Owned by a branch of the family that also owns nearby Château Pontet-Canet, this estate is really improving. The 2013 is attractive with ripe fruit and delicious acidity, supported by a firm, dry backdrop of solid tannins. Drink from 2020.",92,Château Lafon Rochet 2013  Saint-Estèphe,,,,
"This Bulgarian red blend is produced under the supervision of flying winemaker Michele Rolland. It consists of 60% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Cabernet Franc. It has aromas of black raspberry, black plum and a touch of graphite. In the mouth, there are flavors of dark cherry, blackberry and pomegranate with chewy tannins and a pleasantly tart finish.",91,Castra Rubra 2010 CR Red (Thracian Valley),,,,
"Banana and ripe red-berry notes create the attractive open of this bright wine. It comes with a raw edge, but if slightly chilled it would make for a fine apéritif.",87,Henry Fessy 2012 Nouveau  (Beaujolais-Villages),,,,
"The bouquet is generous, offering loads of pineapple, peach, canned peas, blossoms and grapefruit. The palate is fresh and zippy with a grassy and citrus combo will please lovers of this style.",88,Huntaway Reserve 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"This is a medium-bodied, silky rendering of Pinot Noir. Restrained aromas of cherries, dried herbs and vanilla lead into similar flavors, then pick up a touch of mocha on the long finish. Drink now–2020.",90,Giesen 2013 The Brothers Pinot Noir (Marlborough),,,,
"This appealing, easy drinker offers notes of vanilla and pear. It's ripe and sweet, fleshy in feel with flavors that lean toward the tropical.",86,Snoqualmie 2013 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Murky, earthy aromas mark the nose—a blend of tomato, herb and meat notes. It feels good, with herbal-berry flavors and grapy thickness. It finishes with a flash of acidity, a note of coconutty oak and a final herbal blast.",85,Calina 2010 Carmenère (Central Valley),,,,
"Entirely varietal, and given five months to gel in stainless steel, this is a dark copper-red wine that's noticeably earthy on the nose. Dry, woody and a touch sour in cherry and strawberry, it should be enjoyed chilled and with ceviche.",84,Lawer 2015 Rosé of Syrah (Knights Valley),,,,
"Produced from 60-year-old vines, with some new wood aging, this complex, ripe wine has an intense structure, with layers of vanilla and spice. The crisp nature of Sauvignon Blanc adds brightness to the ripe roundness. Drink now.",92,Domaine Gérard Fiou 2014 Le Grand Roc  (Sancerre),,,,
"A smoky note of flint signals youth, while a pliable, light and fresh body of grapefruit zest and yeasty brings a slender but juicy feel. A slim but impressive package of lively, taut fruit.",90,Jäger 2014 Achleiten Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),,,,
"This beautiful riserva offers bright aromas of ginger, cola, dried mint, forest berry and cassis. The wine is bright and lively, with dusty tannins and balanced acidity. Overall, the wine shows incredibly clean and polished characteristics that linger long on the palate.",94,Collelceto 2007 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"Lush, jammy, soft aromas of black plum and cassis are full but a touch lazy. On first take, this feels saturated but deeper examination reveals zesty tartaric acidity. Flavors of jammy black fruits are a touch citric, while this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is plump on the finish. Drink through 2020.",91,Mascota 2012 Unánime Gran Vino Tinto Red (Mendoza),,,,
"This is a sophisticated, stylish and ultimately tasty wine, given time in mostly stainless steel, with 10% in neutral oak. Fleshy, floral and full bodied without ever becoming obtrusive, it offers a nice mix of Meyer lemon and vanilla. The elements are integrated and the punchy texture offers both depth and breadth.",92,Kelleher 2014 Block 21 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
The “Reserve” on the label is hardly appropriate in this banal version of what is normally a racy varietal. This version shows a mild fruit in a somewhat stewed version.,80,Turning Leaf 2001 Reserve Riesling (Monterey),,,,
"At first, this black-colored Garnacha smells horsey and reduced, but with time it exudes more aromatic harmony and quality. A big tannic palate is rough like sandpaper. Blackberry, pepper and chocolate flavors don't rise to a level of excellence, while a heavy saturated finish closes out this muscular red.",88,Bodegas Hidalgo 2015 Picos Pardos Grenache (Calatayud),,,,
"Named after the grandfather of the present Reynolds, this oak-aged bend of Alicante Bouschet, Trincadeira and Syrah is firm and solid. It has perfumed black fruits, generous tannins and a concentrated structure. Drink from 2017.",88,Julian Reynolds 2011 Carlos Reynolds Red (Alentejano),,,,
"Dark-skinned berry, underbrush and leather are some of the aromas you'll find in this juicy Brunello. The palate doles out fleshy black cherry, raspberry jam and clove flavors held together by fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity. Enjoy 2018–2023.",90,Brunelli Martoccia 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"This Merlot/Cabernet Sauvignon/Petit Verdot blend has a tannic character, smoky flavors and a solid structure. It is also perfumed with ripe berry fruits and a juicy taste that is developing behind the firm tannins. It's made by the same team as the Médoc Cru Bourgeois Haut Breton Larigaudière. Drink from 2016.",86,Château Tayet 2013 Cuvée Prestige  (Bordeaux Supérieur),,,,
"It's nice to see an ever-increasing number of serviceable kosher wines like this one being made available to consumers from around the world. That said, this one isn't much more than adequate. There's a modest amount of cassis fruit dressed up with earthy chocolate and vaguely minty aromas, but it lacks depth. Still, it's better than the kosher stuff I remember from my friends' bar mitzvahs.",82,Alfasi 1998 Cabernet Sauvignon (Maule Valley),,,,
"The nose is earthy and savory, with brash mineral and lemon tones, but the palate on this dry Riesling is surprisingly pretty, with dashes of blossoms, tart stone fruits and fresh herbs. It's a bit demure in concentration, but an elegant, refreshing quaffer.",88,Dr. Nägler 2012 Rüdesheimer Berg Rottland Kabinett Trocken Riesling (Rheingau),,,,
"Like all Thomas Fogarty's Chardonnays, this is dry, acidic and minerally. It is not one of those ultrarich Chards dripping with buttered popcorn and tropical fruit jam. Wine aficionados will appreciate the Chablis-like citrus fruit, white flower and steel elegance.",91,Thomas Fogarty 2007 Langley Hill Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"One of a pair of blanc de blancs from grand cru vineyards, this is a chalky, flinty-textured wine. It is crisp and tight, still young and needing to age. It offers an appealing aromatic character, shot through with citrus and green-fruit acidity. Drink this bottling (disgorged January 2016) from 2018.",93,Lombard et Cie NV Brut Nature Cramant Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Chardonnay (Champagne),,,,
"A unique blend of Pinot Gris, Muscat, Riesling and Gewürztraminer, it is—as its name suggests—quite floral, along with notes of lychee and white grapefruit. It drinks off dry, with a medium-bodied feel. Citrus and spice flavors carry through the finish.",88,Eufloria 2014 Aromatic Blend White (Washington),,,,
"A powerhouse, but one that shows a certain degree of lushness to its robust blackberry and mint flavors. Finishes long and minerally, bolstered by slightly drying tannins. Should be more approachable by 2015 and last for three decades beyond that.",93,Dow's 2003 Vintage  (Port),,,,
"Savory, earthy notes similar to soy precede plump and fleshy notes of almost overripe black cherry and plum. The palate is light and fresh but bouncy with full fruitiness and the slightest tannic texture and a lip-smacking finish. A summer red of sorts that could even be chilled.",90,Meinklang 2013 Graupert Zweigelt (Burgenland),,,,
"Full bodied, complex, oaky and concentrated, this wine has a broad palette of flavors from spicy cinnamon-like oak shadings to ripe blueberry and dark chocolate. The texture is appropriately and moderately tannic.",90,Klinker Brick 2013 Dolcetto (Lodi),,,,
"Alluring aromas of cigar box, cedar shavings, olive and berry fruits are magnetic with this Carmenère-led blend. In its youth, it is pushy and vibrant in the mouth. Flavors of tobacco, chocolate and leafy, lightly herbal berry fruits finish smooth, long and with just enough acidic cut. Drink through 2022.",93,Lapostolle 2010 Clos Apalta Red (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"White peaches and pink grapefruits lend perfume and brightness to this racy, lean-bodied Riesling. Dry in style with a zesty mineral-focused palate, it's endlessly refreshing and invigorating.",90,Villa Huesgen 2014 Schiefer Trocken Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Pure Pinot Meunier from a select parcel of vines called La Grosse Pierre, this impressive limited-production bottling is an anomaly in Champagne. It fits Huré's crisp style yet also has rich fruitiness and generous acidity. Drink now.",92,Huré Frères NV 4 Eléments Pinot Meunier (Champagne),,,,
"Pretty good price for such a nice Sauvignon Blanc. It's a little one-dimensional in ripe tangerine, mango and lime flavors, but the acidity is bright and clean, and the finish is long and spicy.",86,Koehler 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"A beautifully ripe wine, layering all the dense botrytis of the vintage with freshest acidity. It has weight, the texture of grainy honey, ripe yellow fruits, mango and orange zest. Impressive and certainly for aging.",94,Château Sigalas Rabaud 2007  Sauternes,,,,
"An awkward wine. While it's very ripe, the raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors are simple and jammy, and there's a sweet-sour taste that's accompanied by gritty tannins.",83,Paradise Ridge 2003 Garrod Ranch Syrah (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"From an estate vineyard located in the heart of Rutherford that was purchased by the producer in 2006, this vineyard-designate is the star of the show, a blend of mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with 9% Cabernet Franc. Thick, dense and robust in tannin and oak, it offers structured red and black fruit, dried herb, pencil lead, cedar and cigar, combining ripeness with cooler-climate characteristics. It should cellar well through 2021.",93,Sequoia Grove 2011 Tonella Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Unfocused, and jumbled aromas of clove, mint, latex and gritty oak barely allow for any fruit to show through. This is clampy and acidic. Roasted oaky plum and berry flavors finish jagged, with roasted flavors.",82,Tercos 2015 Bonarda (Mendoza),,,,
"Beautifully balanced, this conveys both rich fruit and a tense, intense minerality. Combining the two strands impeccably, it brings out tangy apple and pink grapefruit flavors and a steely, tight acidity. It's a structured wine that needs to age. Drink from 2018.",93,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2012 Clos Häuserer Wintzenheim Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"Firm and polished, this barrel-fermented wine is just rounded off enough, without damping the bright, almost crunchy fruit. There's a light touch of toast and the structure for further bottle age to improve it. Drink 2017–2025.",90,Bethel Heights 2013 Estate Chardonnay (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
"Ripe, dry and forward in fruit, with a soft texture, this Cab appeals now for its wealth of blackberries, cherries, plums, herbs and spices. It's a lovely wine that should be decanted for a few hours before serving.",89,EOS 2007 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"Aromas of brioche, strawberry and citrus are fresh in style. The citrus and smoke flavors are light and lively, broadening at the finish.",89,Siren Song 2013 The Muse Brut Blanc de Noirs Méthode Champenoise Estate Grown Sparkling (Lake Chelan),,,,
"A soft but spicy nose starts this flavorful sip from Thorntree. Open, fresh and friendly on the palate, the wine has a simple but elegant character. Pair with poultry, grilled seafood or enjoy every day on its own.",86,Thorntree 2007 Chardonnay (Western Cape),,,,
"Juicy currant, plum, leather, spice and sandalwood flavors abound in this dry, interesting blend of Syrah, Grenache, Petite Sirah and Viognier. The fruit is framed by brisk acids and firm tannins. All of the profits from the sale of this wine go to the winery's full-time vineyard crew.",87,Stolpman 2010 La Caudrilla Red (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"The producer's highest-end bottling, this is tightly wound in fine-grained tannins with complex, diverse undertones of chocolate mocha, cherry-vanilla, black tea and garrigue. Layered and balanced, it sends gentle waves of black currant and cassis to the palate, a floral element lurking behind the proceedings. This well-made wine will cellar nicely, through 2032.",95,Ramey 2012 Pedregal Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),,,,
"Big, ripe and delicious, this is packed with spice and sweet apricot fruits. It's full and opulent, very much a wine of 2009, yet it retains its sense of balance and structure.",94,Château Malartic-Lagravière 2009  Pessac-Léognan,,,,
"This is a pure Pinot Noir cuvée from an Aube-based producer. It has a curious candied character reminiscent of fruit drops due, perhaps, to its youth. Give it a few more months to gain depth and drink from 2018.",85,Jean Josselin NV Cuvée des Jean Pinot Noir (Champagne),,,,
This bottling shows great promise for the San Diego region's potential. Lavish and rich blackberry aromas are enhanced by cocoa dust on the nose. Savory flavors of pepper and soy give depth to the blackberry and roasted-meat flavors. Tannins are firm but gracious.,91,2Plank 2014 Bonsall Cabernet Sauvignon (San Diego County),,,,
"Starts with strong, assaultive wildflower, dried apricot, butterscotch and sautéed banana aromas, then turns dry and acidic in the mouth. A difficult wine to like.",84,Terra Valentine 2009 Riesling (Spring Mountain District),,,,
"This blend of 80% Syrah and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon reveals plenty of blackberry and plum fruit, carried along by a full-bodied, somewhat tannic mouthfeel. Finishes with soft tannins, making it approachable in the near term.",87,Château Miraval 2004 Red (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"Using many biodynamic practices, Werner Michlits has crafted a rich, sweet and juicy wine, full of intense fruit, touched by spice, but more to do with black plum, fresh figs and vivid acidity. This is a hearty wine, ready to drink, its final tannins soft. Screwcap.",85,Michlits 2007 Biokult Zweigelt Pinot Noir Red (Burgenland),,,,
"Fresh and juicy, this easy-drinking blend provides simple mint and cassis aromas and flavors at a reasonable price, with just enough structure to stand up to burgers and the like. Drink now–2013.",86,St Hallett 2008 Gamekeeper's Shiraz-Grenache-Touriga Red (Barossa),,,,
"One can only hope for Friulano to make more inroads in the USA. Perfectly suited to our cuisine, this northern Italian grape variety offers the texture and intensity to pair with our fusion flavors and wide range of fresh ingredients and seasonal vegetables.",87,Comelli 2010 Friulano (Colli Orientali del Friuli),,,,
"The mellow scent of baked apple rises from the glass, cut by ripe, equally mellow freshness on the palate. This wine is mild for a Riesling but very enjoyable, clean and fruity, with a mellow apple note that really gets you in the end.",89,Domaine Zinck 2015 Portrait Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"Finely tannic, this is a solid wine, full of dark fruit skins, dry, dense and impressive in structure. It shows every sign of aging potential, from its solid tannins to its tight, red berry fruits and black fig flavors.",92,Ramos-Pinto 2007 Vintage  (Port),,,,
"Top lots from Sheridan, Dineen and Meek vineyard grapes go into this reserve. This is always the most thick and dense of the Stevens wines, and the tannins, though very well managed, are chewy and substantial. They dominate this young wine, but the stacked and subtle layers of red and black fruits, leaf and forest floor materials, moist earth and ashes keep the flavors complex and interesting. This wine absolutely must be decanted, and can be cellared almost indefinitely.",94,Stevens 2007 XY Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Ripe and fruity, this immediately attractive wine has a crisp texture, giving prominence to apple and grapefruit freshness. The light spritz from bottling from the lees adds bright lift to the aftertaste. Drink now.",89,Domaines Landron 2013 La Louvetrie Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),,,,
"Made using organically farmed fruit, this wine opens with spicy aromas of dried herb and basil, followed by tones of wild raspberry and cassis. The palate's freshness would pair with cheese-based appetizers.",87,Feudo di Santa Tresa 2011 Frappato (Sicilia),,,,
"Moderately aromatic, this has notes of woodspice, dill, fruit leather and cherry. It's medium bodied with firm tannins and tart cherry and chocolate flavors that carry through the finish.",86,Stemilt Creek 2010 Caring Passion Estate Grown Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Anywhere but in Oregon, this could be labeled Pinot Noir, which makes up 80% of the blend; the rest is Zinfandel. It's a combination that makes sense in the Columbia Gorge. The Pinot is more earthy and tannic than in the Willamette Valley, and the Zin lighter than you find in California. The result is a wine tasting of wild cherries, tart, spicy and quite quaffable.",87,Cathedral Ridge 2008 Necessity Red Red (Columbia Valley (OR)),,,,
"A beautiful Cabernet Sauvignon, balanced and elegant. It's flashy in blackberries and currants, with an elaborate coating of oak, yet not over the top, withdrawing its fruit at the last minute to finish in a swirl of minerality and spice. Should develop over the next six years.",91,Broman 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Fresh and fragrant, this offers notes of apple, vanilla spice and lemon rind on the nose and palate. The palate of this Croatian white feels surprisingly voluptuous. Dry in style, with penetrating fruit flavors, this has lavish minerality on the midpalate that lends the finish a brisk, crisp feel.",89,Grgić Vina 2010 Posip (Korčula),,,,
"Raspberries with hints of cranberry dominate this juicy but structured wine. This is a wine that shows a very elegant style, certainly not forceful, but deliciously direct.",91,Louis Jadot 2006 Clos de la Barre Premier Cru  (Volnay),,,,
"This is a dry Prosecco, meaning it is slightly sweeter than a brut or extra dry. Traditionally, Prosecco has this level of sugar, making it a very true rendition of what the wine is intended to taste like: Fresh peach, basil, pineapple, yellow apple and even an understated touch of banana come into play.",87,Adami NV Vigneto Giardino Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene),,,,
"A solidly structured rosé with a bit of weight and great ripeness in the mouth. Strawberry and somewhat medicinal cherry fill the bouquet and palate, with a touch of herbaceousness on the finish.",84,Gayda 2008 Rosé (Vin de Pays d'Oc),,,,
"This delicate rosé offers a subtle bouquet of muddled cherry, carnation and mentholated berry. The light and slightly astringent palate boasts tangy, tart notes of currant and lime rind that linger through the medium-length finish.",84,La Vieille Ferme 2015 Rosé (Vin de France),,,,
"This blend of 60% Carmenère and 40% Carignan opens with campfire, cassis, chocolate, oak and minty aromas. A wall of acidity greets you on the palate, creating a clampy, rough feel. In terms of flavor, oak is up front and behind that there's graphite and minty, herbal fruit in front of a finish with tobacco, vanilla and length.",88,Vistamar 2009 Enki Carmenère-Carignan Red (Central Valley),,,,
"This plump, dry-style Pinot Gris features plenty of fruit, which ranges from apple to pear and through to pineapple. The finish comes with a cool, refreshing note and ample length.",88,Yealands 2016 Pinot Gris (Marlborough),,,,
"In Cahors Tradition means a wine that doesn't go into barrels for aging. That keeps the fruit vibrant and crisp, as it is here. The wine is ripe, full in the mouth with fruit tannins and black-currant acidity. It is a year away from maturity, so drink from 2017.",88,Château Eugénie 2014 Tradition Malbec-Merlot (Cahors),,,,
"With seven years on lees before disgorgement, this wine already shows some maturity. It is rich while also having the intense acidity of the vintage. Turning to gold in color, it is balanced and dry as with all the Paillard wines, although with age that character becomes less obvious. Drink now for the fruit or until 2024.",93,Bruno Paillard 2008 Assemblage Extra Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"Still quite compact with youthful tension and energy, this will reward your patience. Dense flavors of raspberry, boysenberry and cassis are streaked with espresso and dark chocolate. The length is impressive.",91,Tamarack Cellars 2011 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A heady, floral aroma of rose petal meets faint tones of grapefruit rind and unripe tropical fruit on the nose. Round in weight, the palate is riper in character, with an additional note of honey on the close.",86,St. Julian 2013 Reserve Traminette (Lake Michigan Shore),,,,
"On the juicy nose, this bottling shows Concord grape, suave violet and lilac flowers and the slightest touch of tar. It's lighter in body and quite easy to quaff, with flavors of sea-salt caramel and dense olallieberry.",88,Robert Hall 2013 Syrah (Paso Robles),,,,
"This semisweet Viura-Malvasia blend is neutral on the nose, then sweet as expected on the palate, with upfront residual sugar driving a flavor profile that includes mango, banana and apple juice. Sugary and bit cloying from start to finish, but good acidity keeps it in balance.",85,Marqués de Cáceres 2015 Satinela Semi Dulce White (Rioja),,,,
"This fresh white has delicate aromas of white spring flower and yellow stone fruit. The bright, easygoing palate offers yellow peach, bitter almond and a light saline note alongside bright acidity. It's simple but well made.",86,Tenuta dell'Ugolino 2015 Le Piaole  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico),,,,
"Scents of smoke, forest floor and leather lend rustic elegance to this bright briskly concentrated wine. Blackberry and cherry flavors are pleasantly crisp, framed by soft ripe tannins and an earthy lingering finish.",87,Fox Run 2015 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Hints of spice and marzipan accompany the mandarin fruit of this ripe, rounded, linear but dry Riesling. There is quite some power here, you can feel the edges of heat. There is serious palate weight but ample fruit: of apricot and ripe citrus.",89,Wieninger 2015 Vienna Hills Riesling (Vienna),,,,
"Tastes sweet, with citrus, white flower and green pea notes.",82,Michael Pozzan 2012 Dante Reserve Pinot Grigio (Paso Robles),,,,
"With 90% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc, this is an unusual blend for a Haut-Médoc wine. The result is a wine that's light and already soft. Fresh red-berry flavors are lightly underlined by tannins. It will develop fast, so drink from 2017.",86,Château Reysson 2013  Haut-Médoc,,,,
"This is warm and loose, with fruit that is very ripe and just on the verge of pruney. The ripe fruit flavors seem to soften the tannins, which are also quite ripe and smooth. It tastes a bit like prune juice, but not unpleasantly so, with an acid base that compensates for the volatility of the finish. A drink-now wine, but it has its charms.",86,Tagaris 2006 Alice Vineyard Petit Verdot (Wahluke Slope),,,,
"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this earthy wine leads off with aromas of red berries and wet soil. The juicy palate delivers wild cherry lightly accented with notes of white pepper alongside smooth tannins and fresh acidity. It's an ideal match with a variety of dishes, including pizza. Enjoy soon.",87,Tenuta Santo Pietro 2010 Pio II  (Chianti),,,,
"This smoky wine is full of wood and spice notes. Ripe fruit is also there, with some solid tannins to back it up. It will develop well. Drink from 2020.",88,Château Bourdieu 2015  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,,,,
"Delicious in pastry-filling raspberry and cherry flavors, with a baked brown sugar richness and exotic touches of vanilla, cinnamon, anise and toast. Dazzles with a direct hit to the palate; is soft and dry. But it has a certain surface one dimensionality. Seems at its best now–2013.",88,Paul Hobbs 2008 Lindsay Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"An old-vine wine, this is powerful, concentrated and impressively dense for a Marsannay. It is full of red plum and berry flavors, plus firm tannins that suggest this could age for several years.",90,Domaine Sylvain Pataille 2010 L'Ancestrale  (Marsannay),,,,
"Still young and nervous, this opens with aromas of resin, pressed rose petal, dark berry and a whiff of coffee. The tightly packed palate offers a ripe black cherry core backed up by notes of sage and anise. It's still tense, with youthfully assertive tannins that need to loosen up. Drink 2018–2025.",90,Livio Voghera 2012  Barbaresco,,,,
"Quince, starfruit and white melon share the spotlight here, with acidity and sugar in balance, yielding a slightly off-dry wine. Forward and fresh, it brings in highlights of lemon tea as it sails across the palate, and could do nicely for a lunch of cold whitefish or trout.",88,Swiftwater Cellars 2013 No. 9 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"From vines planted in 1984 and 1990, this offers subtle, strawberry, raspberry and cherry flavors, accented with refreshing minerality. Its acidity a faint lime flavor, and as is true of all this winery's offerings, the overall balance is impeccable.",92,Patricia Green Cellars 2015 Estate Vineyard Old Vine Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),,,,
"Leathery, spicy, herbal berry aromas are a bit feral but remain typical of this variety. Jammy, fleshy and fruity on the palate, this exudes herbal plum and raspberry flavors with toasty, green notes. A minty, chunky, solid finish brings herbal notes that are indicative of the grape.",90,Concha y Toro 2012 Marques de Casa Concha Carmenère (Peumo),,,,
"This rare blend of Cabernet, Syrah, Petit Verdot and Touriga Nacional works surprisingly well, emphasizing tannic structure rather than fruit. The acidity of the Cab is what keeps it from being heavy, while the dense color and herbal flavors show its southern warmth and richness. Dried plums and fresh acidity to finish.",89,Dona Maria 2004 Amantis Red (Alentejano),,,,
"This complex, ripe wine reflects the steely character of Dão whites along with perfumed acidity and rich white fruit flavors. Lime, apples and pears are smoothed by wood aging and given a final burst of freshness. It's ready to drink.",90,Dão Sul 2012 Casa de Santar Reserva Branco White (Dão),,,,
"The bringing together of Malbec and Tempranillo works like a charm here. There's a touch of complexity to the fruit-forward nose, and better depth than what most under-$10 red varietals offer. Look for sweet, smooth raspberry and plum flavors with a tasty, balanced finish.",87,O. Fournier 2005 Urban Uco Blend Malbec-Tempranillo (Uco Valley),,,,
"Yellow pear skin, crushed pine needles and white rocks bolster traditional cat-pee aromas on this wine from the ancient river stone-laden Arroyo Seco appellation. Sharper grassy elements deftly integrate into the palate, with apple and pear flavors as well. Serve with vinaigrette-doused oysters.",89,Comartin 2013 Stone Row Zabala VIneyard Sauvignon Blanc (Arroyo Seco),,,,
"Even better than the highly acclaimed 2001 vintage, this Merlot from a tiny, clay soil vineyard in Bolgheri is just about everything you've ever dreamed of tasting. Gorgeous, generous, voluptuous, cheerful, succulent and intense: Masseto is all those things. The aromas are seamless and capture the essence of chocolate fudge, sweet cherry, blackberry, spice and vanilla. It boasts thick, dense extraction, excellent structure and amazing persistence.",99,Tenuta dell'Ornellaia 2004 Masseto Merlot (Toscana),,,,
"This hallmark Chianti Classico boasts a heady perfume of violet, underbrush, peach blossom and clove. The palate delivers bright red fruit, pepper and cinnamon with crushed cherry in the forefront. It's nicely balanced and should develop complexity over the next few years but is already delicious.",93,San Giusto a Rentennano 2010  Chianti Classico,,,,
"The scent of lemon and orange flesh is contained by lovely zestiness on the nose. The palate is no different and holds ripe juicy stone fruit with exquisitely drawn tangy zestiness. This is concentrated and refreshing, energetic, serious and lively. Its lemony verve characterizes everything from the first whiff to the lasting finish. This is racy and delicious now but will drink well from 2019 through 2035.",94,Tegernseerhof 2015 Kellerberg Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),,,,
"Gamy aromas of raw lamb, leather and beef jerky meet with sweet thyme, rose, vanilla and lilac. The palate of this obscure grape shows lots of iron and raw beef notes, with tangy red cherry, red plum and strong acidity.",91,Bevela 2010 Matela Le Bon Climat Vineyard Teroldego (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Soft, simple and a little sweet, with candied pineapple, lemon and lime flavors touched with butterscotchy, vanilla oak.",84,Simi 2007 Chardonnay (Sonoma County),,,,

"Light Pinot Noir showing an undergrowth aroma, red fruits, soft tannins and a smooth texture. It's not a wine for aging, attractive now with its rounded aftertaste.",86,Domaine Roblin 2010 Grande Côte de la Vallée  (Sancerre),,,,
"The red wine is rich, dense and packed with fruit and tannins. It comes from the heart of the Lisboa region, giving plenty of structure from the cool-climate vineyards. There are fine red-fruit flavors shot through by juicy acidity. The wine has a drier, still developing tannic aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",89,Parras Vinhos 2014 Castelo do Sulco Reserva Red (Lisboa),,,,
"This is a heavily wood-aged wine with a bitter character redeemed by the ripe blackberry fruits from a blend of 65% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc. It is structured, with firm tannins over the fresh and juicy fruitiness. Give the wine another year and the two will come into balance. Drink from 2016.",85,Château de Bordes-Quancard 2012  Bordeaux,,,,
"Sweet pea blossoms and fresh apples make this dry, medium-bodied Chardonnay quite floral on the nose, but the palate is decidedly savory with a pleasantly creamy palate marked by brisk apple flavors, bright acidity and a smoked nut finish.",85,Knapp 2009 Barrel Reserve Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),,,,
"A good to very good wine with medicinality on the nose that takes over the aromatics. There's also the slightest bit of hard cheese and stem on the bouquet, so overall it is fighting an uphill battle. Along the way it delivers flavors of cough drop, cherry and a good, solid finish.",88,Neo 2007  Ribera del Duero,,,,
"Intended as a commemorative wine to celebrate the estate's first 1,000 years, Millanni is a wine that doles out sophisticated aromas of soy sauce, root beer, spice, beef jerky, balsam and blackberry fruit. It glides over the palate with ease.",90,Guicciardini Strozzi 2001 Millanni 994 Red (Toscana),,,,
"Seriously savory watercress and yeast notes take the aromatic lead. The palate follows suit with pepperiness and lemony, citric verve. Zippy, lively and fresh, but with weight and resonance.",90,Steininger 2013 Grand Grü Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),,,,
"This well structured wine from sunny Sardinia opens with an off-gold color and intense aromas of ripe melon, apricot, honey and almond. Spice and acidity make for a crisp finish.",87,Argiolas 2009 Is Argiolas  (Vermentino di Sardegna),,,,
"Made from foot-trodden grapes, this is a rich, structured style of Reserva Port. Higher-than-usual alcohol does give a burn on the palate. but get past that and there's an impressive array of dried fruits, ripe damsons and a structure that will allow the wine to age. It will drink at its best from 2017.",88,Quinta Vale Dona Maria NV Reserva Porto Lote no 12  (Port),,,,
"Spicy and still showing some youthful sharpness, this pure Merlot is loaded with penetrating raspberry fruit, juicy and tart. The mouth-cleaning acidity both sharpens the palate and intensifies the flavors, and leads into a finish dotted with super dark chocolate.",91,Reininger 2009 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Good price, but the wine is green and unripe, with that unpleasant meow odor that turns many people off.",80,Hess 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County),,,,
"A yellowish color and mix of petrol, candle wax and dried white-fruit aromas precede an intense palate that's oily in texture and displays a strong sense of grape-skin tannins. Flavors of lemon, pineapple and tarragon run long on a warm, chunky finish. Drink through 2019.",89,Leyda 2014 Single Vineyard Neblina Riesling (Leyda Valley),,,,
A ripe red-fruit note offers a perfumed character to this fruity wine. A touch of banana is the only quibble with what is otherwise a bright selection.,87,Pardon et Fils 2011 Domaine Pardon  (Fleurie),,,,
"Crisp aromas of celery and lime set up a fresh citrusy palate that's light to medium in both body and weight. Flavors of green-grape skins and lemon-lime finish a bit salty, but with proper acidity and balance.",87,Palma Real 2015 Verdejo (Rueda),,,,
"Juicy and high in acidity, this is an easy quaffer, begging to be paired with fresh sea fare, be it oysters or cracked crab. Rare in California and usually considered a blending agent for Rhône whites, the grape shows potential from this estate.",90,Mounts 2015 Estate Grown Picpoul (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"A very rich, ripe, oaky Chardonnay. Made in an appealing style, with likeable pineapple jam, golden mango, buttered toast and spice flavors. It's an opulent wine to drink now.",89,Lobo 2009 Wulff Vineyards Chardonnay (Oak Knoll District),,,,
"The meaty, spicy aromas of this medium-bodied wine are quickly followed by a flood of ripe, grapy fruit flavors that seem lightly sweet as they coat the sides of the mouth. It's big in flavor and rather soft and easy in texture.",86,Gen5 2014 Ancestral Red (California),,,,
"New leather, menthol, woodland berry, dark spice and a whiff of pressed rose petal are just some of the scents you'll find on this radiant red. Vibrant and loaded with finesse, the structured palate delivers juicy Maraca cherry, cranberry, white pepper, star anise and a hint of pipe tobacco while youthfully taut noble tannins and firm acidity provide an age-worthy framework. It's already stunning but needs time to develop to its full potential. Drink 2023–2043.",96,Cavallotto 2013 Bricco Boschis  (Barolo),,,,
"This Aglianico opens with aromas of new oak, vanilla, chocolate and overripe black fruit, all of which carry over to the one-dimensional palate. It seems tired, and the sugary sweetness, dense concentration and evident alcohol give the wine a lumbering character.",86,Fattoria La Rivolta 2009 Terre di Rivolta Riserva  (Aglianico del Taburno),,,,
"Minerally lime and peach-pit aromas set up a crisp, stony, elegant palate with lees-based flavors of vanilla that are softly matched by melon and papaya. Fresh and not too demanding, it's made from 70% Garnatxa Blanca and 30% Macabeo (Viura).",88,Jaspi 2012 Blanc White (Terra Alta),,,,
"Excellent fruit sources (Conner Lee and Boushey vineyards) provide the highlights here. Dense, dark, toasty and flavorful, this is loaded with ripe blackberry, black cherry and fig flavors. Good concentration and power throughout.",88,Red Sky 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec (Washington),,,,
"This lovely, golden-colored wine comes from the Dutton family's Mill Station Vineyard in the heart of Green Valley, a cool, structured appellation within the larger confines of the Russian River Valley. Heady caramel and vanilla highlights wrap around a balance of acidity and bright spots of lemon and quince. The minerality of the wine balances its intensity in expert ways.",93,B Cellars 2013 Barrel Select Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This blend of Cabernet Franc and Gamay concentrates on fruit and soft acidity. It has some smokiness and rounded tannins, fresh and full of red fruits. It is ready to drink.",87,Domaine Joël Delaunay 2012 Domaine de la Brossette Red (Touraine),,,,
"Named after an ancestor of the present owners who became a Catholic saint, this wine comes from a vast aristocratic estate northeast of Lisbon. It's dense and fruity, full of tannins and dark plum flavor. Spicy and perfumed, it's drinkable now but will be better from 2018.",88,Casa Cadaval 2013 Padre Pedro Reserva Red (Tejo),,,,
"A gorgeous Cab, lush and soft and delicious. Shows a New World, cult winemaking sensibility, with superripe fruit and melted tannins framing blackberry and cherry pie, cassis, dark chocolate, anise and cedar flavors. Should age for the next ten years.",93,Frog's Leap 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),,,,
"The pale, pink-gray color indicates how light this wine is. It does have attractive red fruits, crisp acidity and a refreshing shot of green apples, all packaged in a dancing, buoyant body. Drink now.",88,Domaine de Caseneuve 2014 Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"This wine has concentration, but it also demonstrates great elegance in its crisp acidity, lemon-zest-like texture and bright fruitiness. It's a wine to age for several years, but it can also be consumed soon.",92,Bründlmayer 2011 Alte Reben Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),,,,
"Fondo Antico's entry-level Nero d'Avola offers a clean portrait of the Sicilian indigenous grape, with tones of red cherry, blackberry, red rose and lightly toasted almond. The tannins are soft and silky.",87,Fondo Antico 2009 Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),,,,
"A blend of Chardonnay and Arinto, this wood-aged wine is rich and packed with both toast and fruit flavors. Vanilla and apple and citrus acidity are generously pulled together by the mineral texture and ripe structure. The wine will be best from 2017.",90,Casal da Coelheira 2015 Reserva Branco White (Tejo),,,,
"Expressive aromas of smoke, embers and blue fruit are followed by a full-bodied flavorful palate that still shows elegance. The finish lingers.",88,Damsel 2013 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Yellow and chunky, and definitely on the way toward the grave. Mustardy aromas are severely short on freshness, and the palate is just as flat, dull and mealy as the nose. A weird, low-acid blend of Chardonnay, Viognier and Chenin Blanc.",80,Cristobal 1492 2009 1492 White White (Mendoza),,,,
"The nose is subdued at first but then opens up into ripe apple notes with the zesty spice of grapefruit rind. The palate is dry and concentrated and adds a riper notion of juicy yellow plum while a bright lemony citrus streak keeps everything taut and lively. This is joyful, subtle and fresh and finishes on a pure apple note.",92,Domaines Schlumberger 2013 Saering Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"Crisp red cherry and berry flavors are pristine and forward in this bright, vivacious wine. Yet it's also surprisingly nuanced with deft touches of bitter coffee bean, vanilla, bramble and herb that last through the finish.",89,Villa Wolf 2012 Pinot Noir (Pfalz),,,,
"The scents and flavors are dominated by chocolate, right from the start. The mouthfeel is tight, and herbal notes come up ahead of the light red fruit. Whole cluster fermentation was employed, perhaps accounting for the woody accents in the tannins.",87,Z'IVO 2014 Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
"Black currants, cranberry, pomegranate and stewed plum fruits meet with pencil shavings and sagebrush on the nose. Flavors are relatively light and straightforward, with dark red raspberry ripeness and tart plum skin tannins.",88,Ken Brown 2012 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"This wine takes a light approach to ripeness and oak, letting the freshness of the fruit speak with abandon. Bristling in acidity, it offers a layering of complementary dark cherry, huckleberry, pomegranate and cola, before a thick concentration of power peaks on the finish.",90,Via Giusti 2015 Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"91-93. Barrel sample. This wine has firm, solid tannins, but enough rich dark fruit to sustain all of the dryness.",92,Château Haut-Sarpe 2011 Barrel Sample  (Saint-Émilion),,,,
"This Riesling is an odd one. Aromas of yeast and peach blossom come with a note of cured ham, while the palate is sticky and low in acidity. Creamy, honeyed flavors alongside green melon, vanilla and yeast finish waxy and creamy.",84,Vistamar 2014 Reserva Sepia Riesling (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"Toasty mocha and coffee-bean aromas play around the nose before the dark plum fruit hits the palate, where the mocha theme continues. Luscious, rounded and soft, this is a winner on cool evenings, even without food—or perhaps just a little square of dark chocolate.",88,Hannes Reeh 2012 Heideboden Rot Red (Burgenland),,,,
"Oaky and full bodied, this features minty and savory highlights, with big scents and flavors of barrel. Tight cassis fruit, streaked with coffee and dark chocolate, finishes with a dusty coating of graphite. Give this at least a couple of hours in a decanter to loosen it up.",89,Burrowing Owl 2011 Merlot (Okanagan Valley),,,,
"A spicy aroma of ginger cookies meets dark, blackberry flavors on the palate of this medium-bodied, pure-tasting wine. The gushing fruit flavors are compelling and palate-cleansing, with light tannins and acidity keep it fresh and lively.",88,Matchbook 2013 Dunnigan Hills Cabernet Sauvignon (Lake County),,,,
"This bold offering shows jammy fruit aromas of blackberry pie and cherry marmalade, followed by a chewy spice tone. The mouthfeel is soft, savory and sweet all at once.",88,Le Ragose 2005  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,,,,
"Aged for a year on its lees, this wine is rich, tangy and refreshingly crisp. It is a Blanc de Blancs, with a strongly mineral character that adds a tight character to the texture. It will age a few more months in bottle, so drink from late 2016.",90,Château de Lavernette NV Brut Nature  (Crémant de Bourgogne),,,,
"Gentle and elegant red cherry and plum smooth out the structured body of this concentrated, medium-bodied wine. Initially closed, this invites further inspection and conversation with the promise of plush fruit and a subdued, velvety finish.",89,Stift Klosterneuburg 2011 Reserve St. Laurent (Thermenregion),,,,
"This Cab may be in a bit of a dip. It's awkward, with a sharp, edgy mouthfeel, and as the wine ages, raisin notes creep forward. Still, kudos to Ehret for holding the wine back for so long, as it does possess a certain complexity.",87,Ehret 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Knights Valley),,,,
"A powerful and concentrated wine, this has dark fruit aromas like black cherry along with black pepper and wood smoke, plus strong, ripe flavors from cherry to blackberry and black currant. It also has a lot of tannin and good acidity, and will mature into a softer feel over time.",89,Brutocao 2010 Reserve Merlot (Mendocino),,,,
"A bold ripe wine that is full of dark fruits and tannins. It is warm, rounded with spice as well as fine acidity and blackberry flavors. The wine is now fully developed, ready to drink.",87,Monte da Capela 2013 Private Selection Red (Alentejo),,,,
"Vanilla and cream, cocoa, and herbs really jazz up the medium-berry nose. Dark sweet fruit in the mouth, with some earth and cedar for substance. Bitter chocolate and espresso add backbone to the medium-length finish. Good and balanced, and not bad for current consumption.",91,Chimney Rock 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"A soft, mid-range, medium-bodied Pinot Noir from areas including the Russian River Valley and Sonoma Coast, it imparts aromas of rosemary and herbes de Provence before delving into a world of tart cherry and cranberry. The finish is smoky.",85,Simi 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),,,,
"White flowers, spun honey and graham cracker aromas introduce this wine that will be a hit with those who prefer a sweet touch to their bottles. The palate is very sweet, even treacly, with honeysuckle nectar, sugared apples and candied orange flavors. There's just enough acidity to somewhat balance the sugars.",84,Fetzer 2013 Riesling (Monterey County),,,,
"With a demi-sec, off-dry wine, balance is the key to success. This wine is balanced between the bright fruit and the softness from the high dosage. Pear and yellow-fruit flavors are smoothed out by the sweetness of the wine. Drink now.",86,Collet NV Demi-Sec  (Champagne),,,,
"Starts off with toasted almond, pear and citrus aromas, evolving into pear and orange in the mouth. This medium-weight Chard is a nice drink that finishes with some slightly aggressive wood and a trace of grapefruit.",86,Nga Waka 2000 Chardonnay (Martinborough),,,,
The sumptuousness of the nose belies the 2014 vintage: this is Zweigelt made plummy and elegant to render it like velvet. There are wonderful overtones of dried Morello which give this additional color and aromatic lift. The body remains slender but shows beautiful concentration. We are left with elegance that is distinct but not heavy.,90,Netzl 2014 Rubin Carnuntum Zweigelt (Carnuntum),,,,
"Gritty, oily, nutty aromas lead to a tight citric palate. Salty narrow flavors of passion fruit and grapefruit finish steady and briny. Overall, this is basic in every way.",84,Veramonte 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"This widely available, entry-level-priced wine shows black raspberry, clove, allspice and fennel pollen on the nose. Flavors of sour raspberry, cranberry and a touch of gravel arise on the palate, where the tartness extends into the finish.",85,Blackburn Wine Company 2012 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),,,,
"Noticeable oak-driven notes of toasted nuts take center stage and are embellished by delicate tones of stone fruit, chestnut honey and yellow flower. The oak notes are strong, though, and take away from the natural fruit. Make sure to drink very cool, otherwise the oak and high alcohol mask everything else.",85,Panizzi 2003 Riserva  (Vernaccia di San Gimignano),,,,
"Menthol, dark berry, violet and cake spice aromas lead the way on this striking wine. It's still young and nervous, with tight tannins, but it also shows black cherry, white pepper, clove and mocha. Firm, velvety tannins and bright acidity provide the backbone. Drink 2018–2027.",93,Bersano 2012 Mantico  (Barbaresco),,,,
"There's the slightest touch of oxidation on the nose of this wine, with aromas of roasted walnut and seared lemons. The palate is quite interesting, with lemon oil, hints of toasted nuts and a faint marshmallow element on the finish.",87,Dark Earth 2012 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Not only extremely drinkable, but shows real varietal elegance and class. Dry and fairly tannic, the wine brims with flavors of blackberries, blueberries, chocolate, sweet leather and Provençal herbs, with good acidity for balance. Best now.",89,Frei Brothers 2005 Reserve Syrah (Russian River Valley),,,,
"A flintiness mixes with lemon peel in this full-bodied, oak-driven white with aspects of freshness that balance the more concentrated flavor and texture.",88,Sbragia 2014 Home Ranch Chardonnay (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"One of Portugal's oldest plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, from 1974, produced at the beautiful renaissance estate of Bacalhôa. With its dark color, elegant richness, black currant and red berry fruits, this remains a great benchmark, a brilliant transformation of the French grapes into Portuguese tastes.",93,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal 2007 Quinta da Bacalhôa Red (Terras do Sado),,,,
"A plump, nicely concentrated Sauvignon Blanc, the 2009 Mount Beautiful doesn't have the most intense aromatics, but is holding on to its weighty melon and fig flavors and lingering citrus finish. Drink up.",87,Mt. Beautiful 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Canterbury),,,,
"This is a rather light wine in both density, flavor and impact. Some dilute citrus fruit flavors are framed with the lightest hint of cracker. Drink it chilled or use it as a mixer.",85,Maryhill 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Boysenberry and raspberry aromas are not simply dark, ripe and macho, but instead show herbal accents along with floral notes and cardamom. This is old vines Malbec with particular flavors of herbal, brushy berry and plum. On the finish, oaky spice, toast and coffee flavors keep the momentum going. Drink through 2021.",91,TintoNegro 2013 1955 Vineyard Estate Grown Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"This nonvintage blend is lightly herbal, with hints at pickle barrel and green olive under tart, lightly-ripened red fruit. Tannins are stiff but proportionate, and it's a good, every day steak wine.",87,Barnard Griffin NV Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Here's a gutsy, fruity Cabernet. It fills the mouth with juicy raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors and hints of chocolate. Nothing subtle, just a dry, rich red wine for drinking now.",86,Hess 2007 Allomi Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"From longtime Catena winemakers Mariano de Paola and Pepe Galante, this is a deep, black-fruited Malbec with a cushioned bouquet, violet notes and delightful blackberry character. The palate is deep, juicy, healthy and balanced, and the finish is smooth and offers a whiff of coconut. Solid, serious and good now through 2013.",92,Mapema 2007 pz Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"A typically soft wine, with attractive fruit, bright acidity and a touch of almond. The almond note, with a hint of bitterness, has the last word.",85,Joseph Cattin 2010 Tradition Pinot Blanc (Alsace),,,,
"This unusual Cabernet, which includes small percentages of four different Rhône red grapes, doesn't show much of anything in the way of Cabernet flavor. Stemmy and tannic, with green tea on the finish, it registers high in alcohol but is green on the palate.",82,Michael Florentino 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),,,,
Spice and saffron notes introduce this lavishly fruity sun-kissed wine. Pristine stone-fruit and pineapple flavors are delightfully plump but balanced in sweetness and jolted by shocks of lemon-lime acidity. This is gorgeously penetrating through a long lingering finish.,91,Weingut Stiftung St. Nikolaus-Hospital 2015 Cardinal Cusanus Stiftswein Wehlener Sonnenuhr Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"This informal red wine is the kind of bottle you'll want to stash away in the kitchen for easy pairings with weekday family dinners. The bouquet presents red berry, almond and cola nuances.",87,Cantine Rallo 2009 Nero d'Avola (Alcamo),,,,
"Notes of char, wild berry, dill and caramelized sugar fill the nose. While it's initially soft, bright acids and firm, medium-grained tannins bolster the midpalate. Pastry and dark berry flavors drive the medium finish.",86,Barrel Oak 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Virginia),,,,
"This is young, fresh, full and yeasty, with considerable richness. It shows the superlative quality of Charles Heidsieck as a Champagne producer. A dry Champagne, it is softened by richness, but the intensity and flavor and full green fruits promise great development.",93,Charles Heidsieck 2000  Champagne,,,,
"Protos is a venerable RDD label that doesn't try to do too much with its wines. This youngster is tight, polished and deep, with rich, oily aromas and creamy, saturated blackberry, plum and chocolate flavors. With spice and depth, it shows how good the 2005 vintage is, even for a big-production joven like this.",89,Protos 2005 Roble  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"This wood-aged wine shows dark berry fruits and a dusty structure. That goes with the juicy fruitiness that is perfumed, fresh and spicy. The wine has a stalky aftertaste with plenty of acidity. Drink now.",85,Casa Santos Lima 2013 Cabra Cega Red (Lisboa),,,,
"This is a stalky wine, full of black-currant fruits and with just enough weight to balance tannins and the dry structure. It has the potential to become an attractive, fruity wine, so drink from 2018.",86,Château Grivière 2013  Médoc,,,,
"A bit edgy in tannins and with some green flavors, but not a bad Cabernet for the price. Dry and robust, it shows blackberry and currant flavors, with a touch of smoky oak.",84,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),,,,
"This full-bodied, ripe wine  offers blackberry and spiced plum aromas on top of a minerally base. In the mouth, it's big but fresh and free-flowing. Flavors of black plum and black cherry are lively despite some creamy oak that rises on the finish. Drink through 2016.",92,Alto Moncayo 2011 Veraton Garnacha (Campo de Borja),,,,
"A simple, ripe and fruity wine that offers soft almond and toast flavors. The wine is balanced, with ripe acidity. Drink now.",84,Domaine Talmard 2009  Mâcon-Chardonnay,,,,

"A fat, soft wine that isn't fresh enough. There are some sweet strawberry flavors, a touch of caramel and a metallic edge.",81,Quinta Vale do Armo 2013 Vila Jardim Rosé (Tejo),,,,
"Light and fruity, with cherry notes and touches of clay-like earthiness. Simple and clean, and priced accordingly.",84,Clerget 2007 Pont du Rhône Red (Côtes du Rhône),,,,
"Alvarinho with a prickle is unusual, as is a Vinho Verde that has been aged an extra year before release. The wine doesn't quite work because it has lost its fruit and developed a strong pepper and spice character. The acidity at the end is the most characteristic part of the wine.",85,Conde Villar 2014 Alvarinho (Vinho Verde),,,,
"Spice, mint, herb, raspberry and currant aromas form a good nose. Things run a bit choppy and rough on the palate, but overall it works, bearing roasted berry and herb influences, with grabby tannins. This is a full, stocky, spicy and mildly green-leaning Cabernet.",87,Andeluna 2010 1300 Cabernet Sauvignon (Uco Valley),,,,
"Five different Dijon clones go into this barrel-fermented wine. It starts out tightly wound, well-defined with a mineral base under ripe flavors of caramel apple.

"The days of the 90-point Best Buy are growing short, so rejoice over this excellent blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère and Petit Verdot. The nose hits with solid mint, coconut, blackberry and fudge aromas, while the palate is ripe, snappy, alert and full of tasty blackberry, cherry and chocolate. It's clean as can be, with immaculate freshness given its price point. Drink up. Only 500 cases made.",90,La Playa 2005 Claret Block Selection Reserve Red (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"This is a delicate wine, sweet strawberry and elegant structure combining over a soft texture. There is a hint of smokiness as an addition to the finely rounded aftertaste.",90,Henri de Villamont 2007 Les Feusselottes Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny),,,,
"90-92 Barrel sample. Under new ownership after the sale by Alain Raynaud, this is now a lighter style of wine. But it does have great acidity, really fresh, with smoky tannins.",91,Château Quinault L'Enclos 2009 Barrel sample  (Saint-Émilion),,,,
"With 50% new oak aging, the wood stands out now, showing caramelized and buttered toast flavors. Under that is a dry, tannic wine, filled with raspberries, cherries and spicy pomegranates. Complex and pedigreed, it wants some time in the cellar. Better after 2014.",92,Foxen 2009 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Deep cherry, sagebrush and cola are laid across wet slate and purple flowers on a complex nose in this appellation-wide blend from Richard Sanford's team. Crushed wild herbs, like mint, sage, thyme and pine needle are prominent on the palate, backed up by a splash of red fruit.",91,Alma Rosa 2013 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"This wine become pretty pricey but that's because consumers recognize its quality; its sheer deliciousness can't be beat. It has all the elements of fine Russian River Pinot—it's dry and has lots o f ripe fruit, pretty oak, toast and spice—and it puts them all together in a super-elegant package. The vintage is light but the wine doesn't seem to mind. Its class shows. `",90,Iron Horse 1998 Thomas Road Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),,,,
"A crisp medium-bodied Cab with good varietal definition, Strathewen Hill's 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon boasts slightly minty cassis-inflected fruit, vanilla and chocolate notes and a smooth mouthfeel. Supple tannins on the finish suggest this will age well through 2012 or so.",89,Strathewen Hills 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yarra Valley),,,,
"Easy to like for its orange and pear soda, vanilla cream and buttered toast flavors that are heightened and brightened with acidity. Shows real richness and class for the price in a popularly appealing Chardonnay.",87,HandCraft 2010 Artisan Collection Chardonnay (California),,,,
"Produced entirely from Petite Sirah, this wine is dark in color, with notes of cherry, melon and strawberry. It's a bit ponderous but still offers enjoyment.",85,Koenig Vineyards 2011 Dry Rosé of Petite Sirah,,,,
"A steely wine, its acidity dominating the attractive toast, white fruits and grapefruit flavors. It is rich, full in the mouth, a wine that shows some opulence while also preserving a firm, strict structure.",90,Olivier Leflaive 2009  Chassagne-Montrachet,,,,
"Aromas of lavender and ripe dark fruit abound on the nose, while forest floor and pine tar add nuance. The flavors are full of deep plum and black cherry, wrapped around an elegant butter-herb sauce quality.",93,Austin Hope 2012 Hope Family Vineyard Syrah (Paso Robles),,,,
"A huge, ink-black wine with all the brooding majesty that gives Cornas its reputation. A blockbuster with enormous rich, sweet tannins. At the end it is the quality of the superripe fruit from old vines that dominates, but it is certainly a wine to keep for generations.",95,Éric & Jöel Durand 1999 Empreintes  (Cornas),,,,
"There are equal parts strawberry and earth in this Pinot, sourced from the who's who of vineyard sites in Russian River, including Toboni, Hallberg, Floodgate, Rochioli and Bacigalupi. The components come together in mesmerizing ways, making for a balanced and restrained Pinot that's fresh in strawberry and cherry as well as seasonings of herb and cinnamon spice, building power as it goes.",90,Gary Farrell 2012 Russian River Selection Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Dry, minty oak aromas mix well with snappy plum and vanilla to form a proper, pleasing bouquet. The palate is fresh, vibrant and houses sweet, slightly spicy plum and berry flavors. Same on the finish, which is correct, spicy and dry.",88,Protos 2009  Ribera del Duero,,,,
"Abundantly floral, this is a 100% varietal wine. Juicy acidity supports a medium-bodied lushness of honeyed pear and spicy nutmeg complemented by oak.",90,Pech Merle 2016 Salem Vineyard Viognier (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Soft, smooth and buttery, this is full of ripe tropical fruits and bright, citrusy acidity. Ready to drink.",86,Georges Duboeuf 2010 Domaine de la Batie  (Saint-Véran),,,,
"This is about as racy as Sauvignon Blanc from Chile gets. It's green and melon-like on the nose, with punchy asparagus and lime aromas. It is wide awake on the palate, where citrusy acids push lemon, lime, green herb and lemongrass flavors. It cuts like a razor; drink with shellfish.",90,Concha y Toro 2011 Terrunyo Costa Los Boldos Vineyard Block 5 Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"This is a smooth, light and fruity wine that is ready to drink. It has red berry fruit tones, with a sweet, lightly tannic character and a juicy, mature aftertaste. It's soft and fruity, with bright acidity at the end.",85,Roquevale 2009 Reserva Red (Alentejo),,,,
"This blend of 30% Syrah, 30% Grenache, 30% Carignan and 10% Mourvèdre is not showing its true age. Sure, it boasts some developed notes of charcuterie, balsamic herb and garrigue, but it's also still brimming with full, ripe black-fruit notes of plum and berry. With a crushed velvet texture, gripping tannins and a long, heady finish that's laced with hints of espresso and vanilla, this shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. Enjoy now, or try after 2016.",91,Château Avernus 2005 Tautavel Red (Côtes du Roussillon),,,,
"Grown on southwest-facing slopes, this is a ripe, full wine with a natural warmth as well as a mineral texture. It is still tight and needs to age with its gooseberry and herbal edge as well as more flinty, smoky background. Drink from 2017.",91,Domaine Fouassier 2014 Les Romains  (Sancerre),,,,
"Alluring scents of linden blossom, Spanish broom, orchard fruit and Mediterranean herb lead the nose. The young, racy palate delivers ripe Bartlett pear, juicy lime, lemon and steely mineral while a hint of acacia honey closes the vibrant finish. Give this one time. Drink 2018 through 2025.",91,Tornatore 2015 Pietrarizzo Bianco  (Etna),,,,
"Ripe Merlot gives this wine its richness and concentration. It is filled with black fruits, hints of the wood aging and with tannins cushioned by the fruit. Acidity shows strongly at the end, leaving a bright aftertaste. Drink from 2020.",91,Château Quintus 2014 Le Dragon de Quintus  (Saint-Émilion),,,,
"The Clos wine from Jean-Luc Baldès reveals juicy black fruits with plenty of young acidity. A firmly structured character powers through the fruits and gives density under the smoother surface. The wine is obviously still young, reveling in its youthful fruits. Drink from 2016.",90,Jean-Luc Baldès 2012 Clos Triguedina Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"Pale in color, this crisp, light wine has attractive red berry fruits well integrated into the lively texture and bright acidity. The wine is balanced, fruity and ready to drink.",87,J. M. Gobillard et Fils NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne),,,,
"The aromas pop, with notes of sliced green pepper and jalapeño pepper, leaning very hard into the green. The palate brings more of the same, drinking more like a Carmenere than a Cabernet.",85,Stemilt Creek 2014 Ascent One-half Mile Closer to the Moon Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Lean and crisp in style, this is citrusy through and through. Although a bit one-dimensional, it's clean and refreshing, with a pleasantly affordable price tag.",85,Peter Lehmann 2009 Chardonnay (Barossa),,,,
"This fluorescent pink rosé is fairly full on the nose, with a grape skins character. Lively, balanced and lightly oily in feel, this delivers plum and citrus flavors prior to a finish that's pithy and tastes like ripe pink grapefruit.",88,Rio Madre 2015 Graciano Rosé (Rioja),,,,
"This wine seems barely ripe, with thin, herbal, almost vegetal flavors and a sour streak. The barrel aging may have contributed some suggestions of vanilla and licorice.",83,Cave B 2010 Estate Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Crisp, bright and clean in lemony flavors, with notes of green grass, honey, vanilla and thyme. A zesty wine for goat cheese, figs and fresh fruit.",86,Rutherford Grove 2007 Pestoni Family Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford),,,,
"A bit green and ashy, with aromas of green bean, green tobacco and bell pepper. It's not over-the-top vegetal, but it does deal plenty of green bean and celery in addition to tangerine. As a whole it's wet and easy on the palate, but it doesn't have the clarity of flavor and pure fruit that we're seeking from Leyda and Chile as a whole.",85,Terra Andina 2008 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),,,,
"A to Z has almost doubled production of this wine, without a hitch in quality. Floral and citrus components gather strength and roll into ripe tropical flavors: juicy Fruit gum, papaya and melon. It's absolutely yummy and a can't miss value.",92,A to Z 2016 Riesling (Oregon),,,,
"Spicy red-berry aromas with an accent of musky, cheesy oak get this Malbec-Bonarda blend moving in an interesting way. A tight, pointy palate with lean acidity houses flavors of plum and berry along with creamy oak and vanilla. Lactic oak is a factor on an otherwise bright and spicy finish.",90,Tikal 2015 Patriota Malbec-Bonarda (Mendoza),,,,
"Full-bodied and firmly structured, this offers aromas of dark cherry, mocha, blue flower and a whiff of exotic spice. The concentrated palate doles out black cherry, raspberry jam, raisin, chocolate and baking spice alongside velvety tannins. Drink 2017–2023.",93,Allegrini 2011  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,,,,
"The extreme youth of this stylishly packaged wine is on full display, with exuberant notes of crushed cranberry, raspberry, Earl Grey tea and rosewater on the nose. Lively acidity on the sip carries flavors of dried red fruit and touches of leather and tobacco. It's almost soda pop-like, and would go great with a slight chill on a warm day near the water.",91,Last Summer 2015 Grenache (San Luis Obispo),,,,
"While this is aged in barrel, the wood influence doesn't quite work for Arinto, which is a lively, fruity varietal. The result is a wine that is laden with toast and textured with vanilla, and it comes with an edge of bitter lemon. The wood will soften, but it will always be present.",87,Campolargo 2010 Branco Barrica Arinto (Bairrada),,,,
This brooding blend of Syrah and Sangiovese has aromas of black berries and spice while the dense palate offers prune and black pepper along with oak and chocolate. The bracing tannins need time to tame while a lack of freshness leaves this flat.,86,Il Borro 2011 Pian di Nova Red (Toscana),,,,
"This stellar reserve remains one of the finest Chardonnays from Oregon. Meyer lemon, peanut oil, salted nuts, citrus and tangerine combine in a deep and intense palate. Whole-cluster pressed and barrel fermented (but in just 10% new French oak), this delicious, dense and penetrating wine should be consumed now through the early 2020s.",93,Ponzi 2014 Reserve Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This is a yeasty wine that has mature toast and almond flavors. This 100% Chenin Blanc is soft and creamy, flavored with pears and acidity that are now beginning to fade.",84,Albert Besombes NV Jardin en Fleurs Brut  (Vouvray),,,,
"The Seze family has owned this estate since the 18th century, producing in 2009 a finely textured wine, one that has juicy black fruits and an elegant structure. It is a more structured take on the vintage, firm with dry tannins and acidity.",89,Château d'Eyran 2009  Pessac-Léognan,,,,
"Aromas of mature black-skinned berry, wild mint, dill, coffee and tobacco emerge on this full-bodied red. The round palate offers juicy Marasca cherry, chopped herb and a hint of black pepper framed in velvety tannins while a licorice note closes the finish. Drink through 2023.",91,Tasca d'Almerita 2011 Rosso del Conte Red (Contea di Sclafani),,,,
"The merest hint of ripe stone fruit presents itself on the nose. The palate has the same clean stone-fruited charm, reminiscent of freshly harvested yellow plums. The unoaked palate is balanced and has a pleasant, plump weight, leavened by natural freshness and verve. A lighter style of Chardonnay with great charm and lingering freshness.",89,Netzl 2015 Chardonnay (Carnuntum),,,,
"Almost neutral in flavor, this light and smooth wine is innocuous, crisp and refreshing.",85,Francis Ford Coppola 2014 Rosso & Bianco Pinot Grigio (California),,,,
"Berry aromas are clean and forward, with just a spot of resin and vanilla. The palate is snappy and crisp, with cherry and plum acidity framing dry, tangy, lightly herbal flavors of raspberry and red plum. Light and zesty on the semisharp finish.",85,Gouguenheim Winery 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"The name makes this wine sound sweet, but it's bone dry, with crisp acidity. The flavors are of lemons, grapefruits and limes. It's a simple wine, but a versatile one, that will pair well with an enormous range of foods.",85,Posh 2012 Pinot Grigio (California),,,,
"Aeration is key to deciphering the layers of barnyard, leather, earth and tannin that dominate the attack of this brawny, bold wine. With time, a multitude of delicate red-fruit, flower and hay notes unfold, contributing a feminine flair that's elegantly appealing.",88,Frano Milos 2008 Plavac Mali (Peljesac),,,,
"This wine has considerable acidity and a crisp, raspberry flavor. A dry edge will need to soften to bring out its full, fruity potential. Drink from 2016.",86,Georges Duboeuf 2014 Clos des Garands  (Fleurie),,,,
"Ripe black cherry, rose petal, espresso, stewed fruit and a balsamic note lead the nose while the palate offers dried black cherry, ground pepper, anise and grilled sage alongside bracing tannins. A raisin note closes the finish.",90,Beni di Batasiolo 2012 Boscareto  (Barolo),,,,
"Dark color, concentration and supple aromas of milk chocolate and mature cherry open the nose of this pretty Barolo Riserva. The wine boasts a soft, plush feel with velvety intensity that would pair with most sophisticated meat dishes or porcini mushrooms on the grill.",93,Rivetto 2005 Leon Riserva  (Barolo),,,,
"This 50-50 Merlot-Cab Franc blend is priced irresistibly low. Aromas include red cherry fruit, chocolate and spice that give it a modern edge. It has plenty of dimension and some oak nuances in the mouth.",87,Villa Pillo 2005 Red (Toscana),,,,
"A smooth and silky Zinfandel with a great nose of subtle spice, its fruit hiding in the background, Oakland-based Mikami coaxes good things out of its Lodi grapes, from structure and jam to a vanilla-laced finish.",88,Mikami Vineyards 2010 Zinfandel (Lodi),,,,
"This basic, inexpensive Pinot has Syrah and Viognier blended, but overall the wine is fairly generic, with a streak of smokiness in the background.",82,Peltier 2012 Hybrid Pinot Noir (Lodi),,,,
"Gritty citrus aromas are dialed down. This feels racy and fairly well balanced. Mild but fresh flavors of lime, lychee and tropical fruits finish citrusy and collected. This is nothing special, but it's true and good for Torrontés.",86,Valentin Bianchi 2016 Elsa Bianchi Torrontés (Mendoza),,,,
"Brambly blackberry and leathery tar make for a full-bodied atmosphere around what is actually a fairly light, integrated and smooth wine. Clove and black currant give the finish a spicy edge.",87,Rutherford Ranch 2013 Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"This lightly aromatic wine offers notes of butterscotch, peach and toasty spices. It's lighter in style with a creamy feel to the stone and tropical fruit flavors.",88,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2013 Indian Wells Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Give this Zin extra points for sheer power. The vineyard consists of two parcels in St. Helena that date to the 1930s or earlier. It's a tremendous wine, dry, full-bodied and strong in alcohol, with blackberry, blueberry, red currant, licorice, black pepper and cedar flavors.",92,V. Sattui 2011 Quaglia Vineyard Old Vine Zinfandel (Napa Valley),,,,
"With a bit of air, ripe and mellow apple notes appear. These seem to be burgeoning and rich, ready to spill and splash along with notes of peach and dried pear. A phenolic, rich texture and fresh acidity keep them all in check. There is lots of interesting conflict in this glass. Let the drama play out on your tongue.",92,Maurice Schoech & Fils 2012 Harmonie R White (Alsace),,,,
"From a mix of southern Oregon vineyards, this vintage was harvested at pretty low sugar levels (22.7º brix). It is light, and elegantly designed—definitely a wine for every day drinking. Along with spare berry fruit is a hint of nougat from a tiny percentage of new oak.",86,Abacela 2009 Tempranillo (Southern Oregon),,,,
"Made with native grapes Carricante, Catarratto and Minnella, this has delicate enticing scents of yellow wild flower, citrus, orchard fruit and aromatic herb. The bright ethereal palate shows yellow peach and lemon drop alongside crisp acidity.",89,Patria 2016 Femina  (Etna),,,,
"Aromas recall meat juices, toasted oak, berries, espresso and cooking spices. The palate serves up wild cherry accented with cinnamon, sage, thyme, coffee and oak alongside just enough fresh acidity and assertive tannins. Drink 2015–2021.",89,Agostina Pieri 2009  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Tight, crisp and with herbal as well as citrus flavors, this wine comes from flinty soil. That creates all the intensity, the tautness, the mineral texture and the ability for the wine to age. True to style, this wine will need to be kept, so don't drink before 2017.",90,Domaine Gérard Fiou 2014  Sancerre,,,,
"A beautiful wine from a classic vintage, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon offers harmony, intensity and elegance. Berry and dark fruit aromas are enhanced by smooth texture, fine tannins and balanced acidity.",92,Capezzana 2004 Ghiaie della Furba Red (Toscana),,,,
"Black, ripe elderberries, with a tart but supple body make this an appetizing, lighter wine that holds an unusual aromatic intensity. There is an intriguing hint of wilderness and a streak of fresh acidity that makes this soft wine an ideal match for lighter foods. Drink this while it's young and vibrant.",89,Hannes Reeh 2012 Unplugged Zweigelt (Burgenland),,,,
"A generous, smooth texture and nicely bright flavors of lemon, lime and apple make this a satisfying wine. It is medium to full bodied, soft in acidity, but fresh in flavor. It should be a winner for large groups.",86,Rebusity 2012 Chardonnay (California),,,,
"Roasted, barnyard, leathery aromas of lemony oak and tomato are far from ideal. This has a scratchy, tartaric feel to it, while herbal raspberry flavors are backed by a mulchy aftertaste. It's stewed on the finish and weedy.",82,Finca La Luz 2013 Callejon del Crimen Barrel Selection Malbec (Uco Valley),,,,
"A firm, ripe wine, with great red fruit flavors, dark tannins and an edge of coffee. There is some toast element here in this still young wine. Hopefully the just overripe fruit edge will disappear as it develops.",88,Quinta de Ventozelo 2004 Tinta Roriz (Douro),,,,
"A simple, medium-bodied Chardonnay that emphasizes the variety's fruity characteristics. Apple, pineapple and citrus pick up a hint of peppery or clove-like spice on the finish.",84,Stratum 2010 Chardonnay (Marlborough),,,,
"Reserved in aromas at first, this shows charred wood, red cherries, pomegranate and graphite on the nose. Quite intriguing texturally, the palate is sticky with tannins but light in body, offering flavors of cola and tart cranberry.",87,Foley 2013 Rancho Santa Rosa Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Aromas of red plum, herbs, smoky leather and toast crust unveil this Cab Franc with 5% Malbec. An expansive palate is the opposite of restrained, while this tastes earthy and spicy, with herbal cherry, plum and cassis flavors. A dry, composed, lightly herbal finish is a fine conclusion. Drink through 2022.",91,Luigi Bosca 2013 Gala 4 Cabernet Franc-Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"This should have fairly widespread appeal for its bold cherry fruit aromas and balanced feel. Floral notes add interest on the nose, while the palate shows some savory mushroom and dusty earth character. The tannins are slightly astringent on the finish, so opt for red meat rather than a more delicate dish. Drink now.",86,De Bortoli 2014 Regional Reserve Pinot Noir (Yarra Valley),,,,
"Six grapes led by Cabernet Sauvignon have been blended into Lazuli, which starts out spicy and herbal. The palate is lively and juicy, with good overall feel. Peppery notes accent roasted berry flavors, while the finish delivers a strong spine and salty, herbal notes that are complex.",90,Chilensis 2010 Lazuli Red (Maule Valley),,,,
"Toasted oak, pressed flower, exotic spice and aromatic herb aromas emerge on this firmly structured wine. The mature palate doles out dried black cherry, iron, coffee, sage and anise accompanied by close grained tannins that give the finish grip. A hint of graphite announces the close.",90,Vivera 2011 Martinella  (Etna),,,,
"Rich, satisfying and full bodied, this wine is packed with delicious fruit and spice flavors while structured by good acidity and fine tannins that keep the texture lively. Layers of cherry, currant, cedar and cinnamon fill the flavor profile, and a long finish completes the package.",93,Panthea 2012 Estate Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),,,,
"While grassy, herbal aromas dominate the aromas, plenty of white grapefruit comes through on the palate to provide for a crisp, refreshing mouthful. It's medium in weight, with some leafy and citrusy notes on the moderate-length finish.",87,Oyster Bay 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
There is plenty of fruit to find in this generous wine. Its tannins and dense structure are just part of its ripe future. The berry fruits and acidity promise a delicious wine from 2018.,87,Château de Parenchère 2015 Cuvée Raphaël  (Bordeaux Supérieur),,,,
"This is a well-integrated and beautifully layered wine from a wild, high-elevation vineyard site that provides vibrant acidity and jolts of forested earth. Baked plum and Asian spice form a happy alliance of flavor and intensity along a carpet of velvety texture.",92,Siduri 2014 Van Der Kamp Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain),,,,
"Jumpy berry aromas are simple and grapy. A plump but jagged and tannic palate tastes foxy and a touch herbal, while foresty, minty-green-berry flavors carry a scratchy finish.",86,Godelia 2015 Viernes Mencía (Bierzo),,,,
"With the same winemaking team as Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande in Pauillac, Bernadotte has a good pedigree. The wine is full in the mouth, structured and balanced, with ripe berry fruits bursting out from the tannic shell. The wine will develop well over the next few years; drink from 2017.",90,Château Bernadotte 2012  Haut-Médoc,,,,
"A smooth, polished wine, with acidity, sweet fruit and a range of dusty tannins, with acidity. This is an accomplished, delicious wine that is developing fast, and seems only for medium-term aging.",90,Château Smith Haut Lafitte 2007  Pessac-Léognan,,,,
"Autolytic notes of nuts and earth lend complexity to this striking, citrus-scented sparkling. The blossomy palate is touched with sweetness extended by a rich, foamy mousse that blankets the mouth.",88,Sparkling Pointe 2009 Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"A subdued nose leads onto a very lively palate dominated by foaming, big and frothy bubbles. There is an edge of bitterness but the fruit flavors are fresh and reminiscent of red apple and forest berries. Drink soon.",87,Cave de Turckheim NV Mayerling Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Alsace),,,,
"This structured wine is firm, with still-young tannins. Perfumed black fruits—a blend of Castelão, Alicante Bouschet and Touriga Nacional—are crisp, with plenty of acidity. With its dry core, the wine will age further. Drink from 2018.",89,Quinta do Casal Branco 2014 Falcoaria Clássico Red (Tejo),,,,
"Aromas recalling Spanish broom and orchard fruit come together on this one. The bright palate offers nectarine, pineapple and yellow apple alongside vibrant acidity while a hazelnut note closes the finish.",87,Feudo Maccari 2015 Grillo (Sicilia),,,,
"This is a medium-bodied, fleshy and floral wine, happy in violet aromas and a light spiciness of nutmeg behind the soft layers of black plum and cherry. With a yeasty backbone reminiscent of baked bread, it is fulsome and balanced.",90,Havens 2013 Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"Moscatel in the blend of this wine gives it a perfumed character. The wine is soft, gently ripe and with pleasing acidity. It is ready to drink.",84,Wines & Winemakers 2016 Dona Helena Coheita White (Península de Setúbal),,,,
"Easy, fresh and simple, this crisp Pinot Grigio is informal and approachable with aromas of citrus, stone fruit and pear. Pair it with shrimp cocktail or spicy Thai dishes.",86,San Simone 2010 Prestige Pinot Grigio (Friuli Grave),,,,
"Lively strawberry-fruit flavors are at the heart of this gluggable wine. Bottled under screwcap to preserve freshness, it bears no indication of either vintage or grape. Enjoy it for what it is—a fruity forward near-dry summertime sipping wine.",87,Eola Hills NV Rosé (Oregon),,,,
"This simple wine offers subdued charred earth and dark-skinned berry aromas. On the palate, an unusual medicinal note and green hint of sage accent the faint sour cherry fruit. The tannins are astringent yet fleeting.",85,Castellani 2011 Tomaiolo Riserva  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"From winemaker John Kane, who worked for years with Kent Rosenblum, this wine is dense and decadently rich and concentrated, a jammy, thick flavor explosion of soy sauce, black olive and Dr. Pepper cola. Smooth on the palate, it threatens to overpower in ripeness before pulling back just enough to show complexity.",90,JCK Wine Company 2014 Jack Florence Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Dusty mineral notes mingle alongside pretty floral and apple aromas on this softly effervescent sparkling. A blend of 66% Pinot Noir and 34% Chardonnay, it's strikingly high in acidity but has pleasant lemon and apple flavors.",86,Atwater 2008 Cuvée Brut Sparkling (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Flavors of ripe plums and cherries dusted with graham cracker crumbs and purple flowers are pleasant on this delicately structured Cabernet. It's straightfoward on the palate, made in a lean, crisp style, with a fresh layer of green leaves and stems that linger.",86,Standing Stone 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Here's a delicious Amarone, with aromas of spirit-soaked black cherry and spice. The palate is rich but refined, with succulent black cherry, raspberry and plum flavors all layered with nutmeg and white pepper accents.",92,Monte del Frà 2009 Tenuta Lena di Mezzo  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),,,,
"Fresh and lively with apple, almond and orange flavors, this light-bodied wine is well balanced, crisp in mouthfeel yet rich enough to be satisfying.",89,Bella Grace 2015 Vermentino (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),,,,
"A blend of Shiraz from Eden Valley and the valley floor, this is both amply endowed and impressively complex. The creamy purée of raspberries is dusted with peppery spice and cocoa, leaving a savory impression on the lasting finish. Drink now—2015.",93,Torbreck 2006 The Struie Shiraz (Barossa),,,,
"The palest of rosés, this crisp, bright and fruity wine is full of tight acidity, freshly picked raspberries and steely acidity. It could age a few more years to bring out a toastier character. The specially designed bottle has a hummingbird etched on the inside and gold on the outside.",95,Perrier Jouët 2005 Belle Epoque Brut Rosé  (Champagne),,,,
"This wine is still very closed, and not yet showing its rich potential. That doesn't detract from its fine, botrytis texture, core of acidity and dried apricot flavors. It's a wine that needs to come out of its shell, so don't drink before 2018.",93,Château la Tour Blanche 2010  Sauternes,,,,
"Crisp, dry, packed with juicy red berries. This still needs some bottle age, because it is still easy to taste the red wine that was used to give color. But in 6–9 months, this will be a rich style of rosé, with sweet strawberry and toast flavors.",86,Pommery NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne),,,,
"Earthy on the nose and palate, with prominent mushroom and smoke notes, this is a massively tannic wine, with a hefty serving of pulpy black-fruit flavor. It is full-bodied, with a bit of heat on the finish.",84,Domaine Boyar 2007 Royal Reserve Mavrud (Thracian Valley),,,,
"An extraordinary Chardonnay whose complicated richness is balanced with tight acidity and a firm grounding of stony minerals. Brings to mind a great Chablis, with its zesty tang followed by elaborate layers of tropical fruits and pears. Utterly delicious, wildly appealing, a wine that will develop bottle interest over the next six years. Only 97 cases were produced.",95,Keller Estate 2007 Precioso Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Ripe, loamy aromas of raisin, baked blackberry and earth filter into a saturated palate with bracing natural acidity. Blackberry, cassis, herbal notes, oak and sauciness create a set of integrated flavors, while vanilla and woody notes drive the finish on this pago-designated Bobal from Utiel-Requena. Drink through 2020.",92,Mustiguillo 2011 Quincha Corral Bobal (Spain),,,,
"Mint, black cherries and mocha aromas and flavors swirl together easily in this full-bodied Shiraz. It's burly without being overdone, the tannins coming together in a silky vein on the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2030.",93,Kangarilla Road 2013 Alluvial Fans Shiraz (McLaren Vale),,,,
"Rubbery black-fruit aromas are heavily oaked, so much so that this Cabernet-Carmenère blend smells charred but also like plastic. A big grabby palate is jagged in feel, while this tastes like the nose suggests, meaning oaky, herbal and like berry fruits and plum. A woody finish is short on total integration.",87,Montes 2015 Limited Selection Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère (Colchagua Costa),,,,
"This lively wine is crisp, fresh and deliciously fruity. It is packed with juicy, fragrant acidity and wild strawberry fruit flavors.",86,Domaine Sérol 2014 Cabochard Rosé (Côte Roannaise),,,,
"This is technically dry, but rich in sweet flavor—like a gingerbread cookie. There's also a lot of tangerine and pear fruit. The acidity is just fine, giving the richness a bracing quality. Try pairing this with a lightly sugared fruit tart, although it should also go with a vast range of foods, especially Asian fare.",90,Dutton-Goldfield 2011 Dutton Ranch-Green Valley Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Green Valley),,,,
"Oak is front and center on the bouquet, and with that come accents of dried cheese and sawdust. Feels saturated, layered and tannic in the mouth, with roasted berry, black plum, herb and spice flavors. Feels and tastes a touch resiny on the finish, more evidence of the wine's barrel influence.",88,Altocedro 2010 Reserva Malbec (La Consulta),,,,
"A refreshing rosé sparkler that would pair with smoked salmon or fried calamari rings, this is tonic and bright, offering crisp acidity and tonic effervescence.",85,Lamberti NV Rosé Sparkling (Veneto),,,,
"The Vidal Gold Icewine starts with an enticing nose of tropical fruit, honey and spice. Mouthfilling, intense flavors of peach, mango and apricot follow, balanced by crisp acidity. Clean but complex, the wine unfolds extravagantly on the palate. The wine can age and will intensify as time passes.",89,Inniskillin 2006 Vidal Gold Icewine Vidal Blanc (Niagara Peninsula),,,,
"The faintest hint of pineapple signals ripe fruit on the nose. Soft but fresh, the palate delivers uncomplicated, unoaked and simple drinking pleasure with a seam of fresh acidity.",86,Kirnbauer 2013 Welschriesling (Austria),,,,
"Grapefruit and other citrus aromas are zesty but standard. That's also how the palate comes across: citric and juicy, but average. Flavors of orange and tangerine finish fresh but continue the one-note theme.",86,La Gitana 2014 Rosa Nautica White (Rioja),,,,
"A little lean and fiery from nose to tail, but amid all the heavyweights coming from Chile that might be a good thing. The palate is tight, acidic and fresh, with an Old World mouthfeel and flavors of dried berry, earth, tobacco and spice. Snappy and crisp on the finish, with a final wave of propelling acidity. Drink now through 2014.",90,Caliboro Estate 2006 Erasmo Red (Maule Valley),,,,
"Lis Neris is a quality-minded producer in northeast Italy with a thick portfolio of delicious white wines. Among them is this crisp Pinot Grigio with immediate aromas of exotic fruit, peach and nectarine. The wine's creamy density makes it an excellent companion to pasta or rice salad.",89,Lis Neris 2006 Gris Pinot Grigio (Venezia Giulia),,,,
"Nelson Neves has made a rich wine, recognizably Portuguese in its tannic structure while also having a jammy, juicy red-fruit character that comes from the Merlot. This ripe wine is ready to drink.",88,Nelson Neves 2013 Neves Merlot (Bairrada),,,,
"This wine sources from both Montecillo Vineyard in Sonoma County and Georges III in Napa, bringing together one barrel of each for an herbal, savory and edgy experience. Cedar, clove and a healthy dose of fresh herb make it compelling in a classical sense.",90,Keating 2013 Encomium Cabernet Sauvignon (North Coast),,,,
"Cortinie Bianco opens with impressive intensity and lasting aromas of peach cobbler, vanilla cream and preserved peaches. It follows with a smooth, dense texture in the mouth.",87,Peter Zemmer 2007 Cortinie Bianco White (Vigneti delle Dolomiti),,,,
"The 10% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend adds extra muscle to this toasty, sleek wine. It's light but polished, with pretty scents and flavors of rose water and raspberries. The generous acidity of the grape keeps it lively and fresh.",88,Novelty Hill 2011 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"At about four years of age, Talbott's '04 tastes overripe. It has the aromas and flavors of a botrytized, late-harvest Chardonnay, brimming with apricot jam and pineapples, except that it's bone dry. With the very high acidity, this makes it unbalanced and not entirely enjoyable. This is a bottling that seems to do better in cooler vintages.",85,Talbott 2004 Diamond T Estate Chardonnay (Monterey County),,,,
"The nose on this one isn't very expressive but eventually gives up whiffs of paraffin and chopped herb. The palate is more open, offering yellow apple skin, mineral and a subtle almond note. It's reserved but refined.",87,Ca'Ronesca 2014 Friulano (Collio),,,,
"Livio Felluga's Pinot Grigio is distinguished by a thick, creamy mouthfeel and abundant aromas of peach, wild flower and vanilla cream. The wine is clean and pristine, yet structured and smooth at the same time. Very nice.",88,Livio Felluga 2009 Pinot Grigio (Colli Orientali del Friuli),,,,
"This elegant wine appeals from the first sniff to the last lingering flavors. Vibrant in color, it tastes of rose petals, raspberries and cocoa powder. Supple and balanced, it shows impressive structure and length, with hints of citrus. Drink now through the mid-2020's.",91,Apolloni 2015 L Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Youthful and exuberant on the nose with notes of melon, guava and blossom, this is an easy-quaffing off-dry Riesling. Delicately framed, it's brisk and bright with subtle flavors of apple and lemon.",85,Baiting Hollow Farm Vineyard 2011 Riesling (New York),,,,
"The aromas on this wine are light and nuanced with notes of pear, butter and pineapple. It's full bodied in feel, clean in style showing good weight and viscosity while retaining a pleasing sense of lightness.",90,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2013 Mimi Chardonnay (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"This is a steely wine wrapped with white and green fruit flavors. It is clean, bright and full of pear and crisp apple notes. The tangy after taste is floral. Ready to drink in six months.",86,Boeckel 2010 Réserve Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"From the Cognac region, this fresh and fruity wine is light and bright with herbal flavors, crisp citrus and intense acidity. It's ready to drink.",84,Maison des 3 Ponts 2014 Lepontis Sauvignon Blanc (Charentais),,,,
"The wine is perfumed with a crisp edge of acidity that is brightly attractive. There is a good mix of green fruits, citrus and riper apricot flavors. It's a refreshing, tangy wine that is ready to drink.",86,Baron Philippe de Rothschild 2015 Mouton Cadet  (Bordeaux Blanc),,,,
"Half and half Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this elegant wine comes from Premier Cru vineyards. It's soft and creamy, indicating a high dosage. That is balanced by the crisp fruit and bright acidity that gives the wine a lift. It is a fresh wine, probably best drunk young and fruity.",88,Lombard et Cie NV Brut Premier Cru  (Champagne),,,,
"Like a trip through an orchard, this Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre blend bursts with flavors of cherries, raspberries, blackberries, tangerines, kumquats, dates, golden mangoes, yellow currants, the list goes on and on. It's a little on the sweet side, while grippy tannins give the palate handrails to negotiate this fruity ride.",85,Kaleidos 2004 Morpheus Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"Simple and clean, with fruit juice flavors of peaches, pineapples, apples and apricots. A tiny bit of oak adds the usual creamy vanilla notes.",84,Jekel 2009 Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),,,,
"This is definitely sweet, with 30 g/L residual sugar, but that is counterbalanced with enough natural acidity to keep it lively and just outside the dessert wine category. The aromatics show plenty of Muscat's lush orange blossom and fruit character, with a concentrated palate and penetrating finish.",90,Abacela 2015 Muscat (Umpqua Valley),,,,
"Blackberry, strong leather, black pepper and hints of purple flowers make this fruity wine quite approachable on the nose. There's a mix of fresh blackberries and blackberry jam on the palate with hints of thyme, juniper spice and black pepper adding intrigue to the otherwise fruit-forward sip.",89,Bridlewood 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"It would be a shame to drink this lightly sweet wine now, even though it is delicious. Rather wait to bring out a more honeyed character, attractive almond and sweet pear flavors and a fuller texture. Drink from 2016.",88,Château de la Roulerie 2013 Chenin Blanc (Coteaux du Layon),,,,
"Aromas of French oak, toast and oak-driven spice dominate the nose. The taut palate offers red cherry, licorice, clove, toasted hazelnut and coffee alongside firm tannins that leave a grippy finish.",88,San Biagio 2013 Montersino  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Wood and spice aromas lead to wood and rich yellow-fruit flavors, creating a warm character that's immediately attractive. With final acidity, this tangy wine is well balanced. Drink now.",88,Louis Max 2016  Mâcon-Milly Lamartine,,,,
"This wine has very intense vegetal, stemmy aromas and flavors. It was aged entirely in stainless steel.",82,Del Rio 2012 Estate Grown Cabernet Franc (Rogue Valley),,,,
"The nose of those wine is fruit driven, with red apple and a riper notions of melon and strawberry. The same appetizing fruit plays on the light dry palate where some yeasty, brioche-like autolytic notes provide a sonorous counterpoint. The finish is dry, fresh and lasting.",90,Domaine G. Metz NV Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),,,,
"This is a smooth, ripe wine with just enough tannin to give it structure. The main character is rich, full of black plums and blackberries—ripe and generous. It has a wonderful juicy aftertaste.",88,Casa Santos Lima 2014 Great Bustard Red (Alentejano),,,,
"Iron, pomegranate and dust aromas show on the nose of this entry-level bottling from the Los Gatos producer. Bright red fruits and solid brown spice show on the palate that proves light, airy and easy as it dances across the tongue with energy.",87,Testarossa 2013 Cuvee Los Gatos Pinot Noir (Monterey County),,,,
"Notes of savory meat, anise, crushed black pepper and balsamic on the nose are followed by elegant waves of ripe red fruit and smoke on the palate. A successful balance of rich fruit and a briny, spicy backbone, this is a red that's very good consumed on its own or paired with grilled meats.",89,Mercouri Estate 2007 Domaine Mercouri Vin de Pays des Letrinon Red (Letrinon),,,,
"This fresh, informal white opens with subdued aromas of yellow flower and white orchard fruit. The lean, simple palate offers unripe pear, apple skin and a mineral note alongside crisp acidity.",85,Ileana 2014 Low Carb Pinot Grigio (Vigneti delle Dolomiti),,,,
"Rustic, with some smoke and char up front that gives way to intense berry flavors. It’s a touch idiosyncratic—it’s very concentrated and a bit sauvage—as it shows a lot of vineyard individuality. Hard and rugged now; a few years in the bottle should tame its power.",88,Adelsheim 1998 Bryan Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Straightforward and fresh, this opens with aromas of jasmine and exotic fruit. The round, juicy palate is reminiscent of citrus, pineapple and pear while a note of bitter almond adds interest.",87,Taba 2015 F  (Falanghina del Sannio),,,,
"Plums, purple flowers and graphite characterize the nose on this wine from the producer that's now owned by the Foley family of wines. Spicy cherries and blackberries show on the palate long with pencil lead and hints of dried oregano.",87,EOS 2012 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"This rusty-colored Rioja shows funky aromas of leather mixed with hints of rose petal. A good mouthfeel with smooth tannins is suggestive of aged Burgundy or Merenzao (Trousseau), while rooty, earthy flavors of leaves and tea are interesting. Drink now.",88,Urbina 2001 Reserva Especial  (Rioja),,,,
"This is a soft, easygoing style from the Millets, now in their third generation in Sancerre. With attractive white stone fruits and a citrus streak, the wine has delicious refreshing acidity and a light bright aftertaste. Drink now.",87,François Millet 2016  Sancerre,,,,
"Fruity in flavor and nicely rounded in texture, this medium-bodied wine from Napa-based Mason Cellars incorporates grapes from around the state. It has a good balance between lively acidity and rather ripe apple and melon flavors.",87,Three Pears 2016 Pinot Grigio (California),,,,
"A plump, well-endowed white that tames Viognier's exuberance with Pinot Gris's restrained aromas. Peach, melon and spice flavors do show some exotic honeysuckle notes that fade quickly on the finish.",87,Heartland 2006 Viognier-Pinot Gris White (Langhorne Creek-Limestone Coast),,,,
"Viognier represents 60% of the blend, unusual for the Southern Rhône, and it imparts white pepper and ginger to the bouquet, a broad, oily texture, and bold apricot flavor. The balance is 30% Clairette and 10% Grenache, but those varieties play only supporting roles. The spice notes integrate nicely into the wine with airing, but the wine does finish a bit short.",87,Domaine Maby 2012 Casta Diva White (Lirac),,,,
"Mantonico is among the most cherished native grape varieties of southern Italy, and this luminous expression by celebrated Calabria producer Librandi offers an interesting mix of elegance and power. The wine boasts thick natural density and there's a bright note of zesty spice on the close.",87,Librandi 2009 Efeso Mantonico (Val di Neto),,,,
"With the same winemaking team as Bouchard Père et Fils in Burgundy, this wine is rich and generous. It has great red fruits and hints of the toast from the wood aging of part of the wine. It is a generous wine that will age well over the next year, so drink from late 2017.",92,Villa Ponciago 2015 La Réserve  (Fleurie),,,,
This wine is rather inexpressive and already evolved. The nose reveals red and black berries accented with notes of black pepper that carry over to the palate. It's one dimensional and tightly tannic.,87,Camigliano 2009  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"The Del Rio vineyard, in southern Oregon's Rogue Valley AVA, has pioneered the cultivation of Syrah in that part of the Northwest. As the vines acquire some age, they are coming into focus, and the rough tannins seem to be more in balance with the fruit. These wines are somewhat similar in style to the Syrahs from the Okanagan valley of Canada, and they offer an earthy mix of flavor that puts the fruit under earth, soy, coffee and smoke. Tannins in this Tyrus Evan are beautifully managed, with the edges sanded down, and the wine has a lovely, lingering presence on the palate.",88,Tyrus Evan 2005 Del Rio Vineyard Syrah (Rogue Valley),,,,
"Preserved red-cherry and strawberry notes penetrate throughout this ripe, full-bodied Pinot Noir. Bright acidity and hints of brambly wood, baking spice and florals on the palate add complexity and balance.",85,Damiani 2010 Sunrise Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Named after the road on which the winery sits, this wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah. Coffee, herb and cherry aromas are followed by black olive and cherry flavors with the Syrah expressing itself prominently.",89,Huston 2013 Chicken Dinner Red,,,,
"This quiet Albariño comes from the Vicente Gandia family of wines. It opens with short, peppery aromas backed by a medium-bodied palate. Peppery, slightly bitter flavors echo the nose, with a hint of stone fruit to help it along. Drink now.",87,Con un Par 2016 Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"Aromas of white flower and citrus follow through to the racy palate alongside juicy grapefruit, green pear and a mineral note. Zesty acidity gives it a tangy finish.",88,Montecappone 2014 Federico II A.D. 1194  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore),,,,
"This refreshing Millesimato expression of Prosecco offers a crisp, tonic mouthfeel capped by aromas of white flower, peach and citrus. There's very nice sharpness and definition here overall.",88,Astoria 2010 Millesimato Cuvée Tenuta Val de Brun Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
"With bright, zesty acidity, this Sauvignon Blanc is clean and vibrant in orange, pineapple, lime and gooseberry flavors. If only it finished drier, it would be superb.",87,Cakebread 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"This lower-priced Pinot from the Center of Effort team punches way above its weight in this vintage, showing light cherry-blossom and black-cherry aromas mixed with gamy meat and wet slate. Blackberry pie is cut with orange rind on the sip, with an earthy grip showing flavors of juniper, crushed clove and pipe tobacco.",90,Fossil Point 2014 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),,,,
"Well, who thought Chenin Blanc would end up in the Alentejo? Obviously not the guardian of the wine rules, which is why this classified as a mere table wine. However, the grape, perfumed and ripe in this warm climate, still weaves its magic to give a very fine wine with tropical fruit, a touch of honey and fine crisp acidity at the end. Drink this wine from late 2017.",90,Ribafreixo 2016 Connections Chenin Blanc (Portuguese Table Wine),,,,
"This is described as Brut dry, but the perfumed character of the Gelber Muskateller grape gives this fruity wine a feeling of sweetness. It's soft, aromatic and lightly flavored with lychee.",85,Hermann Moser NV Sparkling Mosi Brut Gelber Muskateller (Österreichischer Sekt),,,,
"This is a soft wine, its acidity melded into the ripe berry fruit flavors. The texture is soft with just a bite of tannin at the end. With its open fruitiness, the wine is ready to drink.",85,Fiuza 2015 Babu Red (Tejo),,,,
"No-frills berry and cassis aromas open this Cabernet. A wide, jammy palate is generous but a touch off-centered. An aggressive herbal plum flavor leads the charge, while a tannic, grabby finish brings it home.",89,J. Bouchon 2014 Block Series Reserva Especial Cabernet Sauvignon (Maule Valley),,,,
"This has a dry finish with modest alcohol, and its emphasis is on phenolic flavors rather than the usual floral-perfumed aromas that characterize most versions of the grape. Here you'll find lemon rind, pineapple and tart, mineral-soaked acids. It's a fine match for white fish, shellfish, scallops or oysters.",88,Abiqua Wind 2015 Gloria Anne Gewürztraminer (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Maturity gives a bruised apple aroma to the generous mellowness of ripe pear on the nose. The palate is more taut than the nose leads you to expect, but there is concentration and richness and more bruised apple skin texture. Fruit, evolved flavors and freshness make for an intriguing wine. Drink soon.",91,Domaine Mersiol 2011 Frankstein Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"Intense smoke and crushed-stone notes linger from start to finish on this distinctly mineral beerenauslese, adding a savory tone to luscious honey and lemon flavors. Zesty lime and lemon notes offset sweetness on the palate, finishing with a touch of puckering astringency.",86,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler 2011 Bernkasteler Badstube Beerenauslese Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Subtle hints of tart apples appear first, then there is the merest touch of quince, even a touch of lemon balm. The palate pans out aromatically, always in that apple and quince spectrum, and has a brightening crisp edge of freshness and absolute concentration and dryness. With more air, the aromatic lemon balm note adds its special perfume to this wine. This is invigorating and enlivening.",93,Boeckel 2014 Zotzenberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"A well structured Cab with plenty of cassis, blackberry and black cherry aromas and flavors. Subtly smoky vanilla, herbal and roasted coffee notes complement the fruit on the palate. The mouthfeel is soft and supple and the finish appropriately long.",84,Recanati 2004 Special Reserve Kosher Cabernet Sauvignon (Galilee),,,,
"A crisp, fresh wine that has an edge of raspberry and red berry flavors over a very citrus character. It is dry, tight and structured with cranberries and red currants, the red fruits giving some extra weight.",88,Ayala NV Rosé Majeur Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"Tons of ripe, jammy blueberry, cherry and blackberry fruit in this delicious wine, with the most scrumptious caramel sweetness. Easy to like with almost anything calling for a fruity red wine.",86,Kumbaya 2010 Red (California),,,,
"Freshness and refreshment are the strong points of this well-balanced, tangy, medium-bodied wine. It is light in fruit aroma and subtle in flavor, offering some crisp apple inspiration on the palate and finish.",86,Three Thieves 2013 Pinot Grigio (California),,,,
"A soft, moderately jammy old-vine Zinfandel—the vines at Mohr-Fry Ranch go back to 1901 and 1944—that's heady in spicy ripe blackberry with an impressive backbone of structure and mouthwatering texture.",88,St. Amant 2011 Mohr-Fry Ranch Zinfandel (Lodi),,,,
"Despite the grim reference to the hooded guy with the scythe, this is a lively Cabernet, that's rich and tasty in flavor. At nearly four years of age, it's ready to drink now, with soft tannins framing blackberry, mocha and oak flavors.",88,Reaper 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Chalk Hill),,,,
"Somewhere between medium-dry and medium-sweet, this lightly honeyed wine has acidity and baked-apple flavors. The aftertaste is crisp. Drink now.",84,Rémy-Pannier 2015  Vouvray,,,,
"There's lots of exotic Viognier character packed into this fruity, slightly sweet wine. It's powerful in peach and pineapple flavors that are so ripe, they taste like melted jelly, with a hit of alcohol.",84,Parkmon 2006 Marsha's Vineyard Viognier (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Heavy and waxy, with overdone varietal aromas that seem oily. Lots of pepper and cumin, but what about the fruit and acidity? Nowhere to be found.",80,Georges Duboeuf 2001 Vin de Pays de l'Ardeche Viognier (France),,,,
"From the producer's monumental Atlas Peak vineyard, this is a tightly wound, solidly constructed mountain Cab, blended with a handful of Petit Verdot. Tobacco, black tea and a sliver of coconut intermingle around a medium-bodied whole that will benefit from cellaring, through 2021.",91,Michael Mondavi Family Estate 2011 Animo Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"A crisp, refreshing Sauvignon Blanc, fermented and aged in stainless steel. Shows rich, savory citrus and green grass flavors, with hints of minerals and flowers. Very drinkable and bone-dry.",90,Margerum 2009 Sybarite Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),,,,
"Aromas of herb, freshly sliced green pepper, cherry and spice lead to plush and sweet plum flavors, speckled with dark-chocolate accents throughout. It brings an impeccable sense of balance along with an appealing texture. Might be a little green for some tastes.",90,J. Bookwalter 2015 Suspense Conner Lee Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Round, soft and approachable now in the California style, with ripe cherry, licorice, mocha and brown sugar flavors that last long, with a spicy finish. Defines the delicious, drink-me-now style of a young red wine.",88,Envy 2010 Bee Bee's Blend Estate Red (Calistoga),,,,
"Hard, stringy tannins give a tough astringency to this 100% Cabernet. Partly they're from grape skins and partly from 100% new oak barrels. There's a huge core of black currants, however, and the finish is dry and balanced. Will it age? Almost certainly. Give it at least eight years in a good cellar, and it could go well beyond that.",90,Meander 2009 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),,,,
"The wine, a blend of 90% Merlot with 10% Cabernet Franc, is structured, showing plenty of tannins. The fruit is bright with some attractive acidity coming from the black-currant flavors. The wine needs a little time, so drink from 2018.",87,Vignobles K 2014 Enclos de Viaud  (Lalande de Pomerol),,,,
"You'd be hard pressed to think of another Italian sparkling wine made from Ribolla Gialla grapes, a native variety of northeast Italy. This rare expression offers aromas of yellow flower and stone fruit followed by a smooth, fresh mouthfeel.",88,Eugenio Collavini 2007 Brut Ribolla Gialla (Friuli),,,,
"This is a softly appealing, fruity wine. It's made like Chardonnay, with partial barrel aging, lees influences, and partial malolactic fermentation. Not especially complex, but delicious in tangerine, nectarine and buttered toast flavors.",87,Truchard 2009 Estate Roussanne (Carneros),,,,
This wine is already in solid shape for near-term drinking. Black cherry fruit of medium weight is annotated with whiffs of smoke and coffee. It's fine for opening now through 2020.,88,Raptor Ridge 2013 Black Hole Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),,,,
"This is an immediately attractive, fruity wine. Crisp acidity cuts through the red currant and berry fruits to give a light and refreshing wine that has a tight, mineral aftertaste.",88,Château Castel des Maures 2014 Cuvée Jeanne Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"Classic Dry Creek Zin, tannic and filled with briary, brambly wild berry, currant, anise, leather, peppercorn and sandalwood flavors. Brings elegance to Zin's rustic personality. Great upscale barbecue wine, or try with a chicken or beef stew.",88,Quivira 2010 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Attractive floral aromas and bright cherry and raspberry flavors make a light, refreshing impression. This medium-bodied wine has light tannins and lively acidity in the texture.",87,Tortoise Creek 2015 Mission Grove Pinot Noir (California),,,,
"Aromas of spring wild flowers come together with a subtle hint of peach. The savory palate delivers citrus, grapefruit and a crisp pear along with a note of white almond.",87,Fattori 2012 Runcaris  (Soave Classico),,,,
"This is ready to drink, quite pleasant, though it leans a bit generic in flavor. Light berry fruit comes with hints of cola and a green streak. The finish turns tannic and lets those stemmy flavors abide.",87,Soléna 2015 Grande Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Named after local nobility in the city of Borba, this is a popular brand in Portugal. In its white manifestation, the wine is soft, very clean, with pear and cinnamon flavors, the texture just moving toward fat, but working well as a food wine.",87,J. Portugal Ramos 2006 Marquês de Borba White (Alentejo),,,,
"Gulfi regularly produces ripe, extracted wines that show a modern, intense side to Sicilian winemaking. This meaty Nero d'Avola offers thick aromas of exotic spice, black pepper and jammy blackberry. This big style will not appeal to everyone.",87,Gulfi 2006 Nerosanlorè Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),,,,
"Scents of lemongrass, white flower, bees wax and pear are perky and well etched. Between the wine's keen acids and lemony flavor, this remains a bright, uplifting effort, with a clean, tangy finish.",87,Shenandoah Vineyards 2011 Johannisberg Riesling (Shenandoah Valley),,,,
"This earthy Tuscan offers aromas that recall underbrush, berries, violet and spice. The juicy palate delivers ripened dark cherry, black raspberry, white pepper and cinnamon-spice alongside chewy tannins and fresh acidity.",88,Querciavalle 2010  Chianti Classico,,,,
"This offers a core of dense, rich fruit that's fairly intense, swirls of vanilla and baked apple tart come mostly to mind. The intensity builds up midpalate before lurking off the tongue on the finish.",87,Chasseur 2012 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (62%), Cabernet Franc (30%) and Petit Verdot. Aromas of coffee, dried herbs, green pepper and smoke are followed by creamy-feeling cherry and café au lait flavors. It brings a whole lot of appeal.",91,Bunchgrass 2012 Triolet Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"This is one of the most inky, concentrated, fiercely tannic vintages of Alion to date. Aromas of granite, boysenberry and grilled meat feed into a biting, full-bodied palate that can only benefit from more time. Blackberry, vanilla and chocolate flavors finish with mocha notes and stocky, rugged tannins. This is fierce and unrefined now; drink from 2018 through 2027.",90,Alion 2011  Ribera del Duero,,,,
"Citrus-kissed saltiness lies at the core of this incredibly delicious, deliriously crafted wine, from the great grape grower in the heart of the Russian River Valley. Beautifully crisp, it lingers in stony minerality and a freshness of apricot, memorable from first sip to last.",96,Rochioli 2014 South River Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Gritty, rubbery aromas seem underripe given how warm and generous 2011 was. In the mouth, this is gravelly and like sandpaper. Burnt gritty berry flavors are saucy, while this tastes of herbal berry fruits and oak on the finish.",89,Pradorey 2011 Elite  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"Oaky, slightly sweet and otherwise exhibiting rich tones of dirt and earth, this is soft in tannins and texture, the finish unveiling power.",86,Oakwild Ranch 2010 Toboni Vineyards Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Waxy floral and lemon skin notes are elegantly subdued on this concentrated semidry Riesling. Juicy on the palate with abundant peach preserve flavors, it finishes moderately long with on a slightly drying, tea inflected note.",85,Black Star Farms 2010 Arcturos Riesling (Michigan),,,,
"The wine comes from the grand showpiece estate of Madiran. A blend that is dominated by Tannat produces a wine that is still so young. Bold fruits and firm tannins are right to the fore, along with acidity and a strong mineral texture. It's a powerful and impressive wine that also manages elegance as well. The wine will take several more years to soften. Drink from 2020.",94,Vignobles Brumont 2012 Château Montus Tannat-Cabernet (Madiran),,,,
"Bursting fruit with layers of cherry, blueberry and forest berry, this wine is nicely framed by light tones of spice and roasted nut. This wine has all of its elements in place and offers food-friendly qualities such as refreshing acidity and a cleansing finish.",88,Spadaio e Piecorto 2006  Chianti Classico,,,,
"After spending 18 months in oak, this wine has emerged toasty and vanilla-laden. That said, there's some impressive fruit underneath, medium-bodied and crisp, with undertones of raspberries and red currants that linger on the concentrated finish. Drink 2020–2030.",92,Di Giorgio Family Wines 2013 Lucindale Cabernet Sauvignon (Limestone Coast),,,,
"Rubber and earth aromas lead to a mix of berry fruit scents and a pinch of vinegar. It's firm in the mouth, with cranberry and herbal raspberry flavors. Gives about as much as it can but at the same time it shows a tart, basic, mildly herbal DNA.",84,Santa Ema 2009 Selected Terroir Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),,,,
"This is a rich, complex wine that has great tannins as well as very fine, ripe black fruits. It comes from the showpiece estate for Casa Ferreirinha in the Alto Douro. The dense fruits and balanced tannins and acidity are just beginning to develop, hinting at the very fine wine it will become. With final acidity still very present, it needs time. Drink from 2019.",94,Casa Ferreirinha 2012 Quinta da Leda Red (Douro),,,,
"A really good Cabernet that shows elegance and class, and this is a good price for it. Dry and rich in tannins, it has waves of blackberries, black currants, herbs, violets and smoky cedar, and is reminiscent of a good Bordeaux.",89,Forth 2007 All Boys Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Young vines give this wine a bright, fruity character, while wood aging brings out complexity and ripe yellow and citrus fruits. It's juicy and lively, with just the right minerality and tight texture to allow it to age. Drink from 2021.",93,Domaine Christian Moreau Père et Fils 2014 Vaudésir Grand Cru  (Chablis),,,,
"The ripeness of Mercurey in this vintage is very apparent in this rich, smooth and soft wine. Juicy red fruits dominate, backed by a core of tannins and the spice from wood aging. It is a wine with a good medium-term future. Drink from 2019.",88,Vignerons de Buxy 2016 Buissonnier  (Mercurey),,,,
"A rich, viscous combination of 55% Roussanne, 35% Grenache Blanc and 10% Viognier, this offers a bite of creamy vanilla amidst layered, hearty and concentrated flavors of lemon chiffon. Fermented in oak and stainless steel, it aged for 11 months in French oak, only 28% of it new.",90,Anaba 2011 Turbine White (Sonoma Valley),,,,

"This richly colored, rich-tasting wine has a lively mousse and ripe strawberry flavors. The palate is all about fruitiness, smooth and with just a light tang of orange zest at the end.",87,Jean Laurent NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne),,,,
"Barrel aromas are out front on this 100% varietal wine, with notes of wood spice, vanilla, pencil lead and baking spice followed by dark plum. The flavors are dense, dark and palate coating. The wood shows quite prominently on the palate as well but if you can get beyond it, there are good things happening.",89,Fidelitas 2014 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Merlot (Red Mountain),,,,
"Plum, herb, blue fruit, vanilla and spice aromas lead to soft, plush fruit flavors in this wine. The texture and blue fruit flavors bring appeal.",88,Waterbrook 2015 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A blend of Friulano, Malvasia, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon and Ribolla Gialla, it has aromas of hawthorne, stone fruit, pear and almond. The palate offers green apple, yellow peach, bitter almond and a hint of menthol alongside bright acidity.",88,Mario Schiopetto 2012 Blanc des Rosis White (Venezia Giulia),,,,
"Mostly Syrah, with some Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a succulent rosé with a marvelous mouthfeel. Texture and length are its main charms, with nuanced notes of rose petal, hibiscus, watermelon and pie cherry. The vineyard sources are Klipsun, Boushey and Ciel du Cheval.",91,Efeste 2011 Babbitt Rosé (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Aromas of baked earth blend with sassy, almost prickly cherry and leather notes in front of what amounts to a dense, slightly gummy feeling palate. Flavors of plum and berry are medicinal, while the ripe finish shows power, a chewy texture and mild heat.",87,Bodegas Fariña 2009 Third Generation 70th Anniversary  (Toro),,,,
"Horsey, leathery aromas are earthy and funky, although with time blackberry notes rise up. The wine is lively, tough and offers bracing acidity. Flavors of herbs, licorice and lemony acidity support core blackberry fruit, while the finish is herbal and woodsy, with dark notes of espresso and black licorice.",88,Señorío de Caleruega 2009  Ribera del Duero,,,,
"Deep, dark espresso bean, loam and graphite aromas hide any sense of fruit on the nose of this bottling. The palate offers more ripeness, in the form of black cherry, with an added kick of graphite, but the overall impression is quite simple.",85,Las Palmeras 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Monterey County),,,,
"Underbrush, dried herb, raisin, saddle leather and balsamic aromas follow over to the ripe palate along with dried cherry, crushed herb and ground clove. Taut tightly wound tannins provide a grippy framework. Give the tannins a few years to unwind then drink to capture the remaining fruit.",90,Luigi Oddero & Figli 2011 Specola  (Barolo),,,,
"This is a firm wine although with superb fruit. It is structured and dense, dark with tarry tannins as well as juicy fruitiness. It is a powerful wine that certainly has the freshness of the year while also having dark, dense tannins. Drink from 2025.",95,Château Montrose 2013  Saint-Estèphe,,,,
"Compact aromas of red berries get a boost from oak-based coconut, cedar and graphite notes. This is a blend of three Malbec vineyards of varying elevations; it's bursting with acidity, while high-toned plum and currant flavors are a touch salty. A lively, fiery finish is fueled by latent acidity. Drink through 2020.",90,Nieto Senetiner 2011 Terroir Blend Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),,,,
"Cigar, coffee and mocha on the nose, followed by smoke and tobacco on the palate, give this ageable wine a masculine, restrained edge. The fruit is soft and integrated but the structure good. Imagine sipping this one by a roaring fire—it has that kind of character.",87,Kanonkop 2003 Paul Sauer Red (Stellenbosch),,,,
"Palette is a sensational value from one of Walla Walla's still-unrecognized superstar vineyards, Spofford Station. This Cab/Merlot blend is saturated with fruit and beautifully crafted. In a difficult year (2004 froze out most Walla Walla vineyards) it is a rare jewel. Hints of compost, earth, mushroom and other herbal elements add interest, and the wine is buoyed with lively acid.",89,JLC 2004 Palette Red Table Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"A light, subtle nose is followed by simple but elegant Chardonnay flavors and a successful play of oak and acid. The mouthfeel is equally appealing, round and supple. The wine could use more complexity but overall, is enjoyable and will be good with a variety of richer poultry and seafood dishes.",83,Buttonwood Grove 2005 Reserve Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Like most of Neil Collins' wines, this blend of 63% Grenache, 19% Zinfandel and 18% Petite Sirah draws from the region's intriguing, oldest, dry-farmed vineyards. It shows earthy wet clay, boysenberry and anise notes on the nose, while the palate delivers turned loam, wild thyme, pepper, soy and black plum flavors.",90,Lone Madrone 2013 The Will Red (Paso Robles Willow Creek District),,,,
"Subtle and somewhat sweet aromas of honey, candied pecan, fresh-sliced honeydew and lemon balm show on the nose of this bottling by Greg Brewer from a brand new vineyard. The palate is clean and fresh, and the sip offers a great tactile sensation on the tongue, with grippy tannins revealing citrus and melon flavors.",91,Diatom 2016 Spear Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Coffee, mocha, char and roasted black-fruit aromas control the bouquet on this modern Rioja. Lemony acidity provides lift to the palate, which has a raw, abrasive, tannic bite. Flavors of toast, chocolate, lemon rind and black fruits finish similarly, with a chewy texture. Drink through 2018.",89,Ramón Bilbao 2008 Mirto  (Rioja),,,,
"This blend of Roussanne, Viognier, Marsanne and Grenache Blanc has a serious line of minerality apparent on the nose as well as pear blossom, pineapple-guava skin and a dairy tang. The palate clings to Meyer lemon pith and Greek yogurt flavors.",90,Sarah's Vineyard 2013 Cote de Madonne Blanc White (Santa Clara Valley),,,,
"An eccentric blend of 62% Rkatsiteli, 19% Chardonnay and 19% Sauvignon Blanc, this has scents of currant bud and sage, white grapefruit and white apricot. It's a medium-bodied effort that offers mild flavors and refreshing acids.",85,Tarara 2012 Charval White (Virginia),,,,
"White fruit aromas are as expected and clean, with no faux oak, weight or interference. The palate is round but nicely acidic, with cutting texture and sweet, lightly creamy flavors of sweet peach, apple and butter. Turns slightly oaky late, with butterscotch and spice.",87,Salentein 2010 Reserve Chardonnay (Uco Valley),,,,
"A blend of 60% Pinot Bianco, 30% Chardonnay and 10% Sauvignon, it conveys aromas of oak, lemon drop and candied fruits. The round palate offers intense but fleeting sensations of Golden Delicous apples and butterscotch. This is already accessible so drink soon.",88,Cantina Terlano 2011 Nova Domus Riserva White (Alto Adige),,,,
"This wine gives plenty of sheer Zinny delight. The ripe, lush raspberry and blackberry flavors have a briary edge, with notes of wild nettles that give it a wildland personality. While the alcohol is high, it's in keeping with the wine's overall structure. Drink now with a great barbecued steak.",87,J. Lohr 2010 Gesture Zinfandel (Paso Robles),,,,
"This is a good Zin, with raspberry, red currant and licorice flavors. Minty green notes alongside bright fruit lend a slightly unripe or uneven feel. Drink up.",85,Frank Family 2011 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),,,,
"This is a Chardonnay-based wine with aromas of white mineral, stone fruit and passion fruit. It is an easy, no-fuss wine that would pair well with light salad lunches or sandwich snacks.",84,Valle dell'Asso 2007 Galatina Chardonnay (Galatina),,,,
"While this wine is unoaked, it still carries a strong whiff of sulfur and popcorn that doesn't really dissipate. The palate offers good feel and is balanced between weight and acidity. Flavors of melon and applesauce are round and end in a swirl of sweet pear.",85,Casa de Piedra 2012 Piedra del Sol Chardonnay (Valle de Guadalupe),,,,
"Dry earth, baked berry, tobacco and vanilla aromas are harmonious and true to Rioja. A forceful palate with rubbery tannins features savory oak, raspberry and plum flavors, while the finish tastes saucy and shows intensity.",90,Bodegas Palacio 2009 Glorioso Crianza  (Rioja),,,,
"This wine is rounded, rich and full of ripe fruit. Its wood flavors, giving spice and vanilla, are a backdrop to the generous apricot and pear flavors and good acidity. Drink this wine from 2022.",91,Domaine Faiveley 2015 Sous Blagny Premier Cru  (Meursault),,,,
This is a ripe and perfumed wine from Vignobles Marcel Petit. It has good aging potential—full of tannins and also of bold black fruits. Structure and fruitiness are a good sign. Drink from 2019.,87,Château Pillebois 2014  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,,,,
"With a dark enough color to be a red wine and ample cherry and plum flavors, this Grenache bottling is not simply an apéritif. It's full-bodied, rather rich in texture and will pair nicely with meats and cheeses.",87,Troika 2015 Rosé (Mendocino County),,,,
"This is a really fruity rosé that is full of red-berry fruits and bright acidity. Crisp on the palate with tart red-currant flavors, there's a tightness in acidity that could benefit with more integration. Let the bottle settle a few months before opening.",85,Henriet-Bazin NV Grand Cru Brut Rosé  (Champagne),,,,
"Clean, poised, rounded notes of ripe, red-cheeked apples play on every front. There is something joyous and bountiful here. The frothy mousse accentuates the light-hearted but generous aspect on the dry but rounded palate, which also brings ample refreshment.",90,Wolfberger NV Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),,,,
"This vineyard has been the source of a string of rich, complex, classic Zins from Bella, and the '05 is the best yet. It's a big, lusty wine whose volume is pumped up with a dose of Petite Sirah. The flavors run toward blackberries, boysenberries, plums, coffee, carob and Asian spices.",91,Bella 2005 Big River Ranch Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),,,,
"This is an intense wine, from the concentrated fig and plum aromas to almost-sweet flavors like honey and strawberry jam. It has a very full body and lingering, warm finish.",88,Ivory and Burt 2013 Zinfandel (Lodi),,,,
"Balsamic herb, toast, oak, exotic spice and berry aromas emerge in the glass. The palate is still rather closed and austere showing oak, licorice and tart cherry alongside bracing tannins that leave an astringent finish. Give the tannins a few years to soften than drink before to capture the remaining fruit.",87,Oddero 2012  Barolo,,,,
"Strong oak aromas and flavors wrap around this full-bodied, rather tannic and bold Merlot. It shows ripe fruit flavors and a gripping texture that makes it appropriate to match with red meat. Blended with 20% Cabernet Sauvignon.",87,Vino Vargas 2012 Matador Merlot (Mokelumne River),,,,
"This is still a closed, young wine, but the potential of the spicy, ripe, but still light and elegant fruit is going to be great. Intense concentration seems to be the hallmark of the wines made by Gianni Menotti at this great estate.",90,Villa Russiz 2002 Tocai (Collio),,,,
"This is sort of a second wine of the respected veteran winemaker, Nick Goldschmidt, who bottles his more expensive brand under his last name. But there's nothing second-rate about the wine. It's classic Alexander Valley, soft and a little herbal, and rich in cherry, red currant, licorice, sweet vanilla oak and peppery spice flavors. Lovely now, and with the integrity to evolve for a decade.",93,Forefathers 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Herbal and spicy, this wine has bitter vegetal flavors that don't accord with the acidity or texture.",82,Château Gandoy Perrinat 2015 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),,,,
"Dark and full-bodied for a rosé, with heavy-handed flavors of raspberry jam and toast that have a vegetal edge.",82,Peirano 2008 Rosé of Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),,,,
"This is a tough wine in two ways. It's rather hard and brittle in acids and tannins now, and it's also tough to predict its future. It's rich in currant, blackberry jam, coffee and cedar flavors, but there is an undertow of raisins that could compromise its longterm viability.",88,Swanson 2004 Alexis Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),,,,
"From an estate site, this wine offers power and concentration. Creamy in texture, the generosity of fruit is balanced by notes of stone, toasted oak and French butter, making for a wonderfully complete experience on the palate.",91,La Crema 2015 Kelli Ann Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Strawberry, cherry and generic red-fruit aromas lead a standard, healthy feeling palate. This wet, fresh but simple rosé offers peach, raspberry and slightly bitter finishing flavors.",86,Dinastía Vivanco 2012 Vivanco Tempranillo-Garnacha Rosé (Rioja),,,,
"Done entirely in stainless steel tanks, this includes a percentage of fruit from Girardet's original 1971 plantings. It went through full malolactic, resulting in a broad, somewhat dilute wine with lightly spiced flavors of green and yellow apples. Notes of lemongrass and metal come up in the finish.",85,Girardet 2012 Chardonnay (Umpqua Valley),,,,
"Aromas of red berry, rose petal, blue flower, crushed herb and a whiff of espresso lift out of the glass along with a menthol note. The taut vibrant palate offers crushed strawberry, tart cherry, white pepper and star anise alongside tightly knit fine-grained tannins. It's extremely elegant but still youthfully austere at this stage so give it several more years to unwind. Drink 2023–2038.",95,Paolo Scavino 2013 Monvigliero  (Barolo),,,,
"A 100% varietal wine, and the producer's first vintage thereof, this is a juicy and leathery Cab Franc, soft and straightforward in plum and raspberry, with a layering of baking spice on the finish. Restrained, it's a nice one for the table.",87,Meadowcroft 2013 Giles Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"The Art Series Cabernet seems to be increasing in quality nearly every vintage. The 2012 boasts plenty of sweet, cedary oak, but backs that up with layers of red currant fruit and hints of bay leaf. It's silky and harmonious on the finish, adding tea-like notes of complexity. Drink now–2025.",92,Leeuwin Estate 2012 Art Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River),,,,
"Made in collaboration with Beringer's Ed Sbragia, this super Tuscan blend of Merlot (75%), Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon is loaded with smoky tones of oak, leather, spice and chocolate fudge. The fruit is in there (behind the wood) and is redolent of blackberry and dried currant.",90,Castello di Gabbiano 2005 Alleanza Red (Toscana),,,,
"Made from ungrafted Nerello Mascalese vines planted in 1930, this compelling wine offers intense blackberry, black cherry, tilled soil, blue flower and Mediterranean spice sensations. It's big and powerful, with gripping tannins and layers of depth. Give this time to develop complexity. Drink 2017–2027.",93,Frank Cornelissen 2012 MunJebel Rosso 9 CS Nerello Mascalese (Vino da Tavola),,,,
"This blend of Grenache, Syrah and Carignane offers aromas of ripe wild berries and bit of hickory smoke. The ripe, approachable flavors are edged by vanilla, with boysenberry fruit at the core. It's not complicated, but very easy to drink, perfect for a hamburger barbecue.",86,Taken Wine Co. 2012 Complicated Red (Central Coast),,,,
"By now it's known that 2013 was a cold, tough, miserly vintage in most of Spain, RDD included. But this horsey, funky number goes beyond vintage conditions. It's unfocused, citric, leafy and green, with a hammering finish. Bottom line: this is not what you want from Ribera del Duero.",82,Campos Góticos 2013 Roble 12 Meses  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"This winery atop the mountains overlooking Silicon Valley makes amazingly earthy and age-worthy wines. This bottling's nose is soil-driven, with sun-baked loam laid across red cherry, condensed lilacs, cola and sandalwood aromas. The sip is structured firmly and strategically like the frame of a well-built home, where dark mulberry and savory spices reside. Drink now–2028.",94,Clos de la Tech 2012 Domaine Lois Louise Twisty Ridge Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"Seems pricy for what you get, which is a good but straightforward Pinot Noir to drink now. It's dry and elegant, with Pinot's silky texture, yet one-dimensional in cherry, cola and spice flavors, with a quick finish.",87,Sanford 2009 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"This spectacular brut-style sparkler that's made from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir still has plenty of tart acidity and yeastiness, providing the backdrop for rich, concentrated flavors of lime, raspberry, orange, brioche, mineral, vanilla and spice. It's enjoyable now, a tête de cuvée that is among the best California bubblies of the year, and it will continue to develop bottle complexity for many years.",96,Schramsberg 1997 J. Schram Late Disgorged 150th Anniversary Release Sparkling (Napa-Monterey-Mendocino),,,,
"This toasty bottling shows some evident maturity in terms of fruit richness. It offers toasted walnut, espresso, vanilla and yellow apple-skin flavors alongside large, brisk bubbles and crisp acidity.",86,Il Mosnel 2010 Brut Satèn Chardonnay (Franciacorta),,,,
"Forest floor, mature berry, wild herb, clove, smoke and pressed flower aromas come together on this bright red. The taut palate delivers ripe red cherry, crushed raspberry, star anise and white pepper set against firm, polished tannins.",91,Elvio Cogno 2012 Bordini  (Barbaresco),,,,
"The Matariki style of late harvest wine is to avoid overly sugary renditions in favor of balance. In this, the 2000 succeeds admirably, combining bergamot, pineapple and apricot flavors in a lightly sweet yet tart wine. Best with fresh fruit and cheeses, as it's not rich enough to match with anything sweeter.",87,Matariki 2000 Late Harvest Riesling (Hawke's Bay),,,,
"This well-made, well-priced wine over-delivers in terms of quality. Smoky cherry and plum accentuate the toasted oak, as a sturdy foundation of tannin gives it power and strength. The savory finish mixes forest and tea.",90,Starmont 2014 Pinot Noir (Carneros),,,,
"Forest floor, bramble, green spice and candied fruit characterize this hearty expression of Brunello di Montalcino. The wine tastes raw and edgy in the mouth due to the prickly nature of its tannins.",86,Poggio il Castellare 2003  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Co-fermented with 10% Petite Sirah, this red certainly impresses. With a fruity entry, it meets a leathery tightness on the midpalate, its mix of cherry and orange confounding expectations of darker expression from the varieties with its rose-tinged aromas. Spicy pepper rounds out the finish.",92,Bodkin 2014 The Hill and the Vale Zinfandel (Sonoma County),,,,
"Fresh blackberry fruits give a smooth wine, rich and with an immediately attractive fresh acidity. It does have the density of fruit along with relatively soft tannins. At the back there is a more chocolate character.",94,Château Beausejour-Duffau-Lagarrosse 2009  Saint-Émilion,,,,
"This is a well-put-together, affordable wine that's moderate in ripeness and tannin and easygoing on the palate, offering a plethora of red and black cherry fruit.",87,Frei Brothers 2013 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Aromas recall pine forest, balsam, black berries, sandalwood and menthol. The palate delivers rich red and black cherry layered with black pepper, toast and chocolate alongside bracing, teeth-coating tannins.",90,La Gerla 2009  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Already beautiful and rich, this has power, concentration and many layers of ripe berry fruits. Red plums also come through strongly, bringing in juicy acidity. This dense and muscular wine should age. Drink from 2017.",91,Manuel Olivier 2012  Gevrey-Chambertin,,,,
"Aromas of beef jerky, oak and black fruits are integrated and attractive. This feels both plush and tannic, while ripe blackberry, cassis, toast, chocolate and spice flavors end long and with good depth and complexity. Drink this ripe but balanced Toro through 2027.",91,Finca Sobreño 2010 Selección Especial  (Toro),,,,
"Aromas of milk chocolate, cotton candy, bacon and sweet fruits are a lead into standard fare cherry and raspberry flavors. The feel is acidic but fresh, while the finish is thin but clean. Average wine.",84,Viña Vilano 2008 Roble  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"Intense, spicy and richly fruity nose. Already meaty, bloody and gamy; this really hits the mark for this variety. Good acids, weight and balance. It's a very sexy wine, with a long, concentrated finish that shows extracted berry fruit and layers of mineral and earth, with just the barest hint of roasted barrel.",90,Abacela 1999 Syrah (Umpqua Valley),,,,
"A simple Barbera, this has lots of black cherry and toasty oak characteristics. Drink now.",84,Montevina 2010 Barbera (Amador County),,,,
"Earthy, tarry plum and berry aromas are herbal and gritty. This is a forward Syrah with juicy acidity. Flavors of plum, currant, raspberry, tomato and herbs finish fresh, with lingering acids and spicy flavors that include fennel and licorice root. Drink this spicy, elegant Syrah now through 2017.",90,Lapostolle 2011 Collection San Jose Apalta Syrah (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"The blend has changed a bit with this latest Walter Clore Private Reserve, now 53% Merlot, 36% Cabernet Sauvignon and 11% Cabernet Franc—no Malbec. It seems a bit chewy and chalky. The fruit has a slightly candied aspect, with suggestions of fruitcake.",89,Columbia Crest 2010 Walter Clore Private Reserve Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This juicy red has a nose of cedar spice and prunes on the nose, and flavors of toasted nuts, plum and cherry on the palate. Overall, the wine has a more fruit-forward character than many Greek reds and will pair well with pizza, grilled meat or ripe cheeses.",88,Gaia Wines 2014 Agiorgitiko by Gaia Agiorgitiko (Nemea),,,,
"Here's a beautifully gold-colored late harvest dessert wine born in the same territory that produces celebrated Brunello di Montalcino. Castello Banfi's expression is thick and luscious with a long fade flavored by apricot, honey and delicately toasted almond. Drink this wine alone after dinner in lieu of dessert.",91,Castello Banfi 2008 Florus 500ml  (Moscadello di Montalcino),,,,
"Here's a fun bubbly with delicate aromas of white flower and a suggestion of rosemary. Simple but well made, the refreshing palate offers creamy yellow apple and a candied hint of lemon drop.",86,Ménage à Trois NV Dry  (Prosecco),,,,
"A traditional style of Alentejo wine, which pushes dry tannins as much as fruit. It is solid, dark, intense, powered by its structure, the fruit coming way behind. It is always going to be a tannic wine, but it makes a great partner with rich winter stews.",89,Adega Cooperativa de Borba 2008 Reserva Red (Alentejo),,,,
"Peach and apple aromas are light. Peachy acidity carries the palate toward basic flavors of orange and nectarine, while the finish feels healthy but low on flavor and character.",84,Verum 2013 Chardonnay (Alto Valle del Río Negro),,,,
"Although known in the Douro as an increasingly essential component of Port and table wines, the Touriga Nacional is equally at home in the Dão. As here, it produces linear wines, very mineral, full of acidity with a perfumed elegance. This is a wine for aging over 4–5 years.",90,Borges 2009 Touriga Nacional (Dão),,,,
"The latest release of the legendary Comtes de Champagne comes from a great vintage. It has full, toasty bottle-age notes that give the wine depth of flavor, with a ripe, rounded mouthfeel and taut acidity. An almond note combines with the citrus-driven acidity on the finish.",94,Taittinger 2002 Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),,,,
"The black label Torii Mor Pinot is the entry-level wine, clean and fresh with clear varietal character. The fruit flavors are tart and lean, but combined with the bouquet offer elegant details with herb and earthy components. The alcohol is a sensible 13.8% and as the wine breathes open it suggests lightly smoked ham and hints of pepper.",88,Torii Mor 2006 Pinot Noir (Oregon),,,,
"This is beautifully structured, packed with black fruits, ripe tannins and balanced acidity. It's still young, showing the black fruit side of Malbec, but the tannins are already integrating well into the structure. Age for 4–5 years.",91,Jean-Luc Baldès 2009 Clos Triguedina Malbec-Merlot (Cahors),,,,
"Soft and heavy, tasting like the syrup of a cherry-cola drink. Ready for drinking now.",82,Sutcliffe 2011 Pinot Noir (Los Carneros),,,,
"Shows the crisp, silky elegance and spicy fruit that characterizes this red hot appellation. It's not the biggest Pinot around, nor is it ageworthy, but it's satisfying in cherry, cola, rhubarb and spice flavors, with an edge of tomato.",87,Siduri 2006 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Raspberry aromas lift from the glass with this attractive and fruity wine. It is on the dry side, giving a crisp edge that is immediately refreshing. The aftertaste is creamy and soft, bright and perfumed.",89,Boizel NV Rosé Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"Deep red-violet to the eye, this wine has a well-defined nose of blueberry pie and flint. There is a good mix of tart fruit and spice, with flavors of blueberry, cranberry, black pepper, anise and smoked meat cavorting amidst very soft tannins. The smooth finish is characterized by flavors of smoke and orange zest.",92,Recanati 2011 Special Reserve Red (Galilee),,,,
"This combines all five red Bordeaux varieties, with half of the wine made from Cabernet Sauvignon. Juicy black cherry, cedar and integrated oak make for a straightforward, light-bodied and high-toned experience in the glass.",87,Cambridge 2015 Meritage (Napa Valley),,,,
"In this cool vintage the Celilo vineyard was not able to supply enough fruit for a single vineyard Chardonnay, so the blend includes grapes from Del Rio in southern Oregon. It's a fine mix, spicy and sharp, loaded with citrus and semi-tropical fruit. Bright acidity, hints of toast, and a lick of lime all combine to make a delicious and lingering finish.",90,Ken Wright 2009 73% Washington/27% Oregon Chardonnay (Washington-Oregon),,,,
"Red-currant jelly aromas and a floral character are followed by a soft-textured, caramel-flavored wine. It has a ripe feel, that's gentle and rather too easy.",86,Quinta do Portal 2011 Vintage  (Port),,,,
"Dramatically rich in pie filling blackberries, currants and anise, this Syrah is given complexity by the firm tannins and crisp acidity that the Highlands appellation invariably brings to red wines. It has a complexity and depth that make it irresistable. Now through 2010 for youthful freshness.",92,Novy 2006 Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"This is aged for two years in French oak to shape a complex and layered bouquet that bears notes of red currant, smoked meat and exotic spice. The palate is firm, finely textured and long lasting.",89,Bosio 2007  Barbaresco,,,,
"Ripe, jammy aromas of cooked cherry, blackberry tart, cinnamon, mesquite smoke, chocolate fudge and ground clove emerge from the nose of this powerful Amarone Riserva in a very direct and immediate manner. The wine boasts a ripe, succulent style with loads of chewy, syrupy fruit on the long close.",88,Villa Canestrari 2004 Riserva 1888 Plenum  (Amarone della Valpolicella),,,,
"So ripe and sweet in raspberry jam, cherry pie and plum sauce flavor, it makes it hard to appreciate the other qualities of this Syrah. It also has lovely, soft tannins and a long, spicy finish. Doesn't leave much to the imagination, but it sure is a tasty wine.",87,Eponymous 2010 Syrah (Napa Valley),,,,
"Truffled compost and chocolate mocha combine for a density of flavor and texture in this approachable, decadent wine. Medium in terms of body and length, it's abundant in leather and burly black fruit.",88,Etude 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"This decent-quality wine is smoky in aroma, a bit earthy and cherrylike in flavor and medium in body. There's a touch of tannin to add some grip in the texture.",85,Parducci 2015 Small Lot Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino County),,,,
"This is a ripe, richly fruity wine. It has the full-bodied character associated with Pouilly Fumé, bringing out ripe green fruits, apricots and a tangy, zesty background that gives a lift. The wine is ready to drink, although it will be better from 2017.",91,Bertrand Jeannot et Fils 2014  Pouilly-Fumé,,,,
"In this crisp, fresh, very dry rosé Champagne, the red fruits are laced with acidity and apple. A touch of bitterness suggests the wine needs to age a few months in bottle, to soften and get a more generous feel.",87,Tendil & Lombardi NV Cuvée Rosé Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"A dark, oaky Bordeaux blend with loads of cassis, black berries, vanilla and spice. Chewy and a touch herbal on the palate, it will soften when paired with food, especially red meat.",85,Carmel 2004 Limited Edition Kosher Red (Israel),,,,
"This is a field blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc, and 6% Malbec, all co-fermented and estate-grown. It's nicely evolved, ripe and fruity—a flavor cavalcade of pastry fruits and spices, fig, twig, cacao and coffee. Yes you may cellar this wine, but why wait? It's drinking beautifully.",93,Tero Estates 2010 Windrow Vineyards Windrow Red (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),,,,
"Zestiness pervades nose and palate: this is so citric and fresh that grapefruit peel is the chief marker. This typical Thermenregion blend of its two indigenous white grapes, Zierfandler and Rotgipfler, shows briskness throughout and will deliver welcome, clean-cut refreshment on a hot day. Drink soon.",88,Gebeshuber 2014 Klassik White (Thermenregion),,,,
"Strong elements of black pepper and smoky oak beg for steak to be paired with this 100% varietal wine. It showcases sizable weight and a solid tannic structure, with supple expressions of black cherry and chocolate that linger long on the rich finish. This bold beauty should hold well through 2023.",93,Midsummer Cellars 2013 Cañon Creek Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Aromas of green and garden herbs, tobacco and cherry lead to generous plum and cocoa flavors. It brings a sense of softness that adds to its appeal.",88,Jones of Washington 2013 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Pristine red apple and raspberry flavors lend fresh, fruity exuberance to this classic blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier. Its fine, mouthfilling mousse and delicate pétillance are quite elegant, edged by touches of bramble and smoked nut that linger on the palate.",89,Sparkling Pointe 2013 Topaz Impérial Sparkling (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"This is a fairly big, creamy-textured Chardonnay to consume over the next couple of years. Grilled sweet corn features, but it's backed by ample citrus and peach fruit, and the finish remains crisp and refreshing.",91,Cape Barren 2012 Native Goose Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills),,,,
"Big and boisterous, as if you're sniffing a bed of coal, menthol and macerated black fruit. The palate is sun-drenched and juicy, but not what you'd call elevated. And the finish mixes savory flavors with tight tannins. A good red wine that bears little semblance to Old World Syrah.",86,Trapiche 2005 Oak Cask Syrah (Mendoza),,,,
"This is 100% varietal, coming from the esteemed Seven Hills Vineyard. The wine offers nuanced aromas of cherry meats and an herbal top note. The cranberry and cherry flavors are elegant, soft and sumptuous, showing a compelling styling and an impeccable sense of balance that carries all the way through the finish. Cabernet has seldom seemed so pretty.",92,18401 Cellars 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"On the nose, spice outweighs fruit, with notes of clove and cinnamon backed by a touch of cherry. On the palate, the tables are turned, with black plum and cherry flavors playing host to a soft touch of baking spice that is most evident on the soft finish.",88,Vino z Czech 2013 Znovín Znojmo St. Laurent (Moravia),,,,
"Green, herbal aromas are varietally common and share bouquet space with plum and berry notes. Plump and chunky in feel, this tastes of oregano, rosemary, olive and wood resin along with plum and berry. An oaky, lactic finish is herbal, true to Carmenère and ultimately a bit green.",87,Vistamar 2013 Reserva Sepia Carmenère (Cachapoal Valley),,,,
"This is a very Douro blend for this wine from Lisboa region. It brings structure and minerality to fill out the dark-black fruits. With ripe tannins and bright acidity balancing the fruit, it is ready to drink.",88,DFJ Vinhos 2014 DFJ Touriga Nacional-Touriga Franca Red (Lisboa),,,,
"Smells like crushed vitamins, iron and minerals, but no fruit. Weak, funky and sour tasting, and then angular on the finish. There's even some sauerkraut in the mix. Not what we're looking for.",80,Reyter 2009 Finca La Martina Chardonnay (Mendoza),,,,
"Shows the sweet richness of Napa Valley. It has candied flavors of blackberries and cherries, wrapped into firm, polished tannins. A pretty wine, it should show its best over the next four years.",89,The Magpie 2010 Lot Four Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),,,,
"Known more for Zinfandel and Rhône blends, Bill Easton has quietly been making Cabernet as well for many years. This vintage is earthy and leathery, reminiscent of his Syrah-based wines, yet rich in savory black cherry, cedar and black olive. Built to age, put it away until 2019–2024 and the savory, herbal elements are sure to develop further.",90,Easton 2011 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),,,,
"Ordinary and one-dimensional. The grapes got superripe under the California sun, offering big flavors of pineapples and peaches, liberally accented with oak. But there's not much going on below the surface.",84,Saddleback 2008 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),,,,
"Young, fiery and rugged on the nose, but with exotic notes that suggest Middle Eastern and Asian herbs and spices. Like all Cobos Malbecs, this is big, chewy, brawny and a touch medicinal, with powerful dark fruit flavors, particularly black cherry, and a good deal of licorice, chocolate and overall richness. Handles its 15% alcohol better than many heavyweights; drink now through 2013.",93,Viña Cobos 2007 Marchiori Vineyard Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
This barrel-fermented Viura shows toasty popcorn aromas that are derived directly from oak. The palate has a woody personality with tight acidity and flavors that suggest Burgundian Chardonnay. Baked apple and vanilla notes come in front of a long finish.,89,Baigorri 2010 Cask Fermented Viura (Rioja),,,,
"Aromas of berry fruits, barrel spice and desert herbs lead to a solid palate that's tight as a fist. This tastes dry, spicy and oaky, with peppery berry and plum notes. An oaky spicy finish offers just enough bold plum and berry fruit.",89,Caligiore 2014 Single Organic Vineyard Bonarda (Mendoza),,,,
"This is a blend of several vineyards, instead of the winery's usual single-vineyard Chards. It's been tastefully assembled, and displays good Central Coast acidity framing tropical fruit and oak flavors with a stony, minerally edge.",87,Testarossa 2006 Castello Chardonnay (Central Coast),,,,
"With the velvet texture typical of the appellation, this smooth wine offers a good balance between the red fruits and soft tannins. A smoky edge mingles with the berry-fruit acidity to give a wine ready to drink from 2018.",89,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2014 Vieilles Vignes  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),,,,
"There's a distant note of underbrush or bramble that gives this Brunello a focused, almost etched impression in the mouth. Cola, cherry liqueur, black licorice, ginger and cedar give the wine an austere personality that is matched by the dusty, elegant nature of the tannins.",90,Donatella Cinelli Colombini 2008  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"With plenty of acidity and tannins, this wine is almost trying to be a young red. Drink it like that with food and it will be worth it. The aftertaste has pepper and attractive spice.",84,Château de Marsan 2016  Bordeaux Clairet,,,,
"A floral notion of orange blossom and ripe mandarin haunts the nose of this clean-cut Riesling. The flavors draw you into their deep, secret core that seems to speak of the elements themselves. Rounded hints of apricot make everything pliable while notes of blossom, citrus and stone shimmer. This is a paradigm of what Riesling can do in the right hands.",94,Domaine Ostertag 2014 Heissenberg Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"Still very firm and closed, this is textured and rich, with intense mineral and wood flavors that balance the steeliness. It's full bodied, taut and nervy, with a concentrated core. Age for at least four years.",92,Château de Maligny 2010 Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis),,,,
"Baked plum, crushed violet, chewing tobacco and roasted coffee bean aromas lead the nose on this full-bodied red. The structured palate offers dried black cherry, raspberry jam, mocha and licorice alongside firm, polished tannins. Drink 2017–2024.",90,Zonin 2012  Amarone della Valpolicella,,,,
"Made in a modern, more accessible style, with a stunning nose of mocha, singed meat, roses and coffee. Earth and violets prevail in the mouth and carry over to the long finish. The refined tannin structure tempts early consumption but a few years cellaring will add to the complexity.",91,Vietti 2004 Castiglione  (Barolo),,,,
"With a delicate, silky mouthfeel and bright acidity, this wine fulfils Pinot's basic requirements. It has raspberry, persimmon and mushroom flavors, and also is quite tannic. Drink now, after decanting it for a while.",86,MacMurray Ranch 2012 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),,,,
"Shows the Morgan signature of full-bodied weight, concentrated raspberry and cherry fruit, brisk acidity, notable tannins and dryness that make their Pinots Noirs so enjoyable. Very nice to drink now and over the next 3–4 years.",88,Morgan 2011 Twelve Clones Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Smoky aromas reveal the essence of this wood-aged wine. The wood is well integrated, balanced with the fruitiness that is characteristic of a 10-Year-Old tawny. Ripe sultanas and great acidity at the end bring this wine to a balanced, delicious close.",91,Messias NV 10-Years-Old Tawny  (Port),,,,
"Acidity and hard tannins dominate this bone dry Bordeaux blend, locking it down into bitterness and astringency. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, it's also very oaky. This is not offering much pleasure now, but will it age? Judging from the overall balance, as well as the intensity of black currants, the answer is yes. Hang onto it until 2020.",90,On Q 2010 Appassionata Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"This fruity, one-dimensional wine has flavors of blackberries, brown sugar and caramelized oak. The tannins are nice and thick, suggesting grilled meats for pairings.",84,Truett Hurst 2012 California Square Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"Here's a crisp, mineral-driven Sauvignon from northern Italy with background aromas of peach, honeydew melon and white peach. The wine shows medium consistency and good staying power with a dry, crisp finish.",85,Orlando Abrigo 2009 D'Amblè Sauvignon (Langhe),,,,
The Dão's great white grape has produced a deliciously perfumed wine. It is fresh with pink grapefruit and crisp apples that are filled out with spice and toast from the wood aging. It is tight and mineral in texture and will benefit from a few more months before drinking. Wait until late 2016.,88,Caminhos Cruzados 2014 Titular Encruzado (Dão),,,,
"The winery's first vineyard-designated Chardonnay, this comes from a vineyard in the Oak Knoll District AVA near Yountville, a relatively cooler area of the Napa Valley. Light golden in color, it offers pear and fig and is light in weight with a substantial finish of creamy vanilla.",87,Groth 2012 Hillview Vineyard Chardonnay (Napa Valley),,,,
"Although this isn't one of Arista's single-vineyard bottlings, it's right up there with them, offering rich flavors and a lovely structure. It's dry and silky, with brisk acidity backing raspberry, cherry and sandalwood flavors, and an earthy hint of balsam-splashed beefsteak tomato. Drink now–2013.",90,Arista 2008 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Aromatically muted at first, the bouquet opens up with time to reveal steely, finessed notes of pear and fresh citrus that continue through to the palate. The oak is subtle and well-managed, and the minerality alive and fresh.",91,Anaba 2011 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Tomato and spiced plum aromas are lightly earthy and a touch rubbery. This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Tempranillo feels ripe and juicy, not rough or scratchy. Plum, berry and spice flavors finish with a shot of pomegranate and red currant.",88,Bodega Otto Bestué 2012 Finca Rableros Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon (Somontano),,,,
"This is full of fruit and weighty tannins. Coming from one of the finest vineyards in Burgundy, it is going to have great power and an opulent nature. This wine also has elegance, its black fruits controlled and with a mineral edge. That doesn't take away the power, it enhances the stylishness of this grand wine. Drink from 2020.",96,Domaine Rossignol-Trapet 2011  Chambertin,,,,
"This vintage's blend is 50% Syrah, 25% Cinsault and smaller percentages of other varieties. It's an oaky, cedar-tinged, gamy red that's big in the mouth, dense and tannic with Michael David's smoky signature.",87,Incognito 2009 Red (Lodi),,,,
"The 2012 vintage was a cool one in Marlborough, and it shows in this wine, especially when compared to the fine, elegant 2013 Te Koko. This is grassy and herbal, even hinting a bit at green peas, yet still offers a compelling texture and ample length. It may even outlive the 2013, even if it doesn't quite reach the same heights.",90,Cloudy Bay 2012 Te Koko Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"This is a top-of-the-range crémant that is crisp and textured while also fruity. It has richness, laced with acidity and citrus. Fresh and full of apple flavor, it's an impressive wine that could age a year or two in bottle.",90,JCB NV No 21 Brut  (Crémant de Bourgogne),,,,
"Dark and concentrated, this sends up complex aromas saturated with tar, asphalt, ink, steel, smoke and charred barbecue. It's a beautiful wine, tight and textural, in perfect balance, with superb depth, precision and elegance. The most contemplative of a superb 2011 Cayuse lineup, this wine above all needs your full attention.",99,Cayuse 2011 En Chamberlin Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),,,,
"Comprised of traditional Port varieties, this is a very dry, high-acid wine of a certain charm. With its silky texture and cherry and rose petal flavors, you might mistake it for a countrified Grenache. It finishes in a swirl of cloves, cinnamon and other dusty spices.",86,Bray 2005 Vino Tinto Red (Lodi),,,,
This soft blend seems made to appeal to the current taste for sweet reds. It has flavors of cola and hard cherry candy.,82,Posh NV Red (California),,,,
"This late-release GG is a stunning showcase of how just a few years of bottle age impact a dry, richly concentrated Riesling. Yellow peach and grapefruit tones shine brightly still, but are glazed by layers of slick, penetrating minerals. While moderate in alcohol, it feels dense and creamy on the palate. The finish meanders almost endlessly, punctuated playfully by strikes of lemon-lime acidity. It's singing now, but should improve till at least 2020.",95,S.A. Prüm 2011 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Old Vines GG Erste Lage Dry Riesling (Mosel),,,,
Creamy notes introduce an earthier dimension to this lemon-scented wine that has an equally lemon-focused core and a rather slender body. This is slight and cannot make up its mind whether it wants to be sharp or creamy—so it oscillates between these poles.,89,Hiedler 2014 Steinhaus Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),,,,
"The nose of this dry, textured wine is full of the scent of ripe pear flesh and peel, while the palate adds zesty citrus and a warm core. Full of fruit and freshness, it finishes clean and zesty.",89,Domaine Sipp-Mack 2014 Tradition Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"Strong minerality with crisp, clean almost mouth-puckering green fruits that show structure. It is full-bodied and rich, but also with an edge of austerity.",89,Jean-Marc Brocard 2005 Vau de Vey Premier Cru  (Chablis),,,,
This budget-minded white veers toward overripe fruit and a layering of vanilla sugar yet retains enough minerality on the back end to remain vibrant and juicy.,86,Ministry of the Vinterior 2012 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"For a Volnay, this is a very structured wine. It has huge richness laced with firm tannins and dark fruits. It is the firmness that dominates, suggesting some extra extraction, although the acidity does push right through to the finish.",93,Domaine de la Pousse d'Or 2009 En Caillerets Premier Cru  (Volnay),,,,
"The translucent color and light body warn against aging this wine, but why would you want to? It's delicious right out of the bottle. Rich in black currant, cherry, violet and cedar, it's a blend of all five of the classic Bordeaux varieties.",90,Waterstone 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Fresh whiffs of strawberry and blossom go hand-in-hand with more evolved complexities of mushroom and yeast in this invigorating rosé sparkling. While delicately moussed, it's Pinot-Noir heavy blend lends a satisfyingly voluminous feel to the palate.",90,Sparkling Pointe NV Topaz Impérial Rosé  (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"This vineyard-designated wine reflects its sense of place remarkably well, offering tight dark cherry and blueberry around a strong character of wild earth, tea and herb. High in acidity and minerality, and yet powerfully understated, it's gorgeously drinkable now but will gain further complexity through 2022.",95,Williams Selyem 2012 Hirsch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"A handsome vein of toasted oak flavor runs through this opulently ripe wine from the aroma to the lingering finish. Along the way firm tannins and bright acidity buoy up the lavishly concentrated blackberry and boysenberry elements to present a dry, nicely textured and appetizingly tannic wine.",93,Renwood 2013 Kirkland Ranch Zinfandel (Amador County),,,,
"Dominated by its dry tannins, this is a tight black currant and dark plum skin-flavored wine, surrounded by a firm core of tannins, a firm and dark-hued wine.",90,Georges Duboeuf 2009 Clos des Garands  (Fleurie),,,,
"Peach, rose and lychee unite into a very rich, seamless perfume on the nose. Those exact flavors expand on the fluid, almost oily palate, supported by residual fruit sweetness: at six years of age this is now toned down and has come into its own. If you're after a treat with washed-rind cheeses, choose this medium-sweet gem.",93,Louis Sipp 2010 Osterberg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"Heavy, rooty aromas of stewed black plum, raisin and prune set up a thick, tannic palate that's jammy like the nose. Prune, raisin and chocolate flavors are oaky and very ripe, thus the finish is earthy, baked in feel and raisiny in flavor.",88,Rento 2011  Ribera del Duero,,,,
"Zippy, with natural rubbery aromas. This is quite tart and has a personality defined by lemon. There's lemon torte up front, while at the end it's purely tangy and sharp. Not an astringent, scouring wine, but high acidity comes into play.",84,Viña Santa Monica 2001 Riesling (Rapel Valley),,,,
"Rich and finely balanced, this wine combines spice notes with rich tannins and blackberry tones. While it is dense and complex, it is still young and needs time to age. Drink after 2015.",90,Campolargo 2010 Diga? Tinto Red (Bairrada),,,,
"Frank Family is one of those wineries that Cab lovers should know more about. This, their basic Napa Cab, is a solid hit, tannic, dry and balanced. It shows classic flavors of black currants, with contributing notes of chocolate, anise and cedar.",91,Frank Family 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Taking advantage of the delicious fruit of 2006, this Branaire-Ducru shows a charming side. It brings out ripe, spicy black plums and black cherry spice to go with the lively, fresh tannins. That's not to say that there isn't structure, but today it is the fruit that dominates.",92,Château Branaire-Ducru 2006  Saint-Julien,,,,
"Ripe apple aromas make the nose nice, even though it's flattening with age. Likewise on the palate, which delivers pithy orange and dry melon flavors along with indications that it's just starting to fade. Notes of green herbs and scallion come up on the finish. Drink this mature white immediately.",88,Val do Sosego 2011 Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"Horsey aromas infringe upon basic cherry and tomato scents. This is lean on the palate, with scouring acidity. Tart, spicy plum and cherry flavors end on a crisp, dilute finish with that reverberates with sour plum and cherry notes.",85,Concha y Toro 2013 Casillero del Diablo Reserva Pinot Noir (Chile),,,,
"Deep ruby in the glass, this wine offers aromas of cherry cola, espresso and black cherry. Black plum flavors are enhanced by a medley of spice including cinnamon, clove and nutmeg. A strong network of tannins lingers on the palate into the persistent finish. Called Kekfrankos in Hungary, this grape is more commonly known as Blaufränkisch.",88,Sauska 2011 Kékfrankos (Villány),,,,
"This bottling has been getting steadily richer and better over the years and has now reached the point where it's an authentic Carneros beauty. The '06 is a Pinot Noir to drink now, to savor its rasp-berry and cherry freshness, crispness and silky texture.",91,Domaine Carneros 2006 Pinot Noir (Carneros),,,,
"Mint aromas and flavors lead to an intense wine that is powered at this young stage by firm, serious tannins. It has great richness from the black plum fruits, and a spicy, herbal character that adds complexity. From consultant Luis Duarte, this is a wine for long-term aging; hold for 6–7 years or more.",94,Luis Duarte 2010 Rubrica Red (Alentejano),,,,
"A rustic, common wine, marked by some unripe aromas and a sweet, candied raspberry taste. It's okay for big parties.",82,Jack Tone NV Red (California),,,,
"Reyna is a top-notch Barbaresco and this vintage delivers extra soft and supple smoothness followed by dark concentration and excellent intensity. There are so many aromatic descriptors here: espresso, black fruit, licorice, root beer, tar, tobacco and more. Drink from 2015–2020.",93,Michele Chiarlo 2007 Reyna  (Barbaresco),,,,
"The senses are immediately captured by the purity of the perfectly ripe apple notes that rise from the glass. The palate continues in that pure, joyous, juicy vein. This has incredible power and despite its muscle and undoubted weight there is no fat. The palate is dry and streamlined and bouncing with fruit and life. Lovely now, sure to age beautifully. Drink 2017–2030.",94,Domaine Saint-Rémy 2015 Ehrhart Hengst Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"This is light and crisp, with its acidity dominant. It's packed with lime and grapefruit flavors that lend a taut, nervy texture. Not for aging, this is refreshing now.",85,Domaine Gérard Duplessis 2010  Chablis,,,,

"Hestan only makes this one white wine. Though its beginnings might seem humble, the juice in the bottle surely will change anyone's mind. This is liquid gold in color, with deep petrol aromas and a note of toasted caramel oak.It's superbly balanced, with minerality winning the day—especially on the finish. This wine starts out like a California blockbuster but finishes very elegantly, with finesse.",91,Hestan 2009 Chardonnay (San Francisco Bay),,,,
"Estate-grown and fruit-driven, this lush, pear-flavored Pinot Gris is dotted with pretty cinnamon and allspice highlights. Forward and nicely balanced, it has the texture and weight to handle rich sauces, much like a big Chardonnay, but without all the new oak.",88,Melrose 2009 Pinot Gris (Umpqua Valley),,,,
"This blend of Fernão Pires and Arinto is soft, fresh and fruity. Juicy green plums, citrus and bright acidity all give a lively character. A tangy texture needs several months aging. It will be best at the end of the 2014.",86,Wines & Winemakers 2013 Casa Ermelinda Freitas Monte de Baía Branco White (Península de Setúbal),,,,
"Aromas of grapefruit and crushed tomato vine lead the nose. The ripe rounded palate offers honeydew melon, lemon drop and a note of crushed dill alongside fresh acidity.",88,Corte Giacobbe 2016  Soave,,,,
"The aromas are incredibly light—barely a whisper. The cherry and plum flavors, meanwhile, are more giving but it still doesn't seem to show enough expression, especially surprising considering the appellation and producer.",87,Guardian 2015 Newsprint Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),,,,
"The wine is hard, tough and dense. Its tannins are solid, dominant, extracted and cover any fruit. It is likely to remain dry.",84,Château Lieujean 2011  Haut-Médoc,,,,
"Good citrus fruit flavors, along the lines of grapefruits, limes and Meyer lemons, accompanied by zesty acidity mark this bone-dry Sauvignon Blanc. It really scours the mouth clean. Very nice with puff pastry mushroom appetizers, bruschetta with goat cheese and roasted red peppers, or crudités with a garlicky sour cream dip.",87,Darcie Kent Vineyards 2009 Rava Blackjack Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey),,,,
"Rubber and savory berry aromas lead it off. The palate shows good texture and overall smoothness, with round cassis and plum flavors. Very competent and solid on the finish, with toasty, warming afternotes and only a slight tannic grab. Textbook Malbec given the price range.",88,Andes Grapes 2006 Ambar 1907 Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Banana aromas don't intrude too strongly into the fruity palate of this wine that has a crisp character.

"This off-dry (11.5% alcohol) Riesling is a fruit-driven wine, with a tangy sweet/tart mouthfeel reminiscent of Vouvray. Meyer lemon, apricot, lime and candied pineapple flavors pile on. There's plenty of natural acid to cut through the sweetness.",88,Cor Cellars 2007 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Fat and full-bodied as befits a Meursault, but tempered with green acidity, the rich fruit of this wine is laced with wood, the fullness a shield for the crisp white fruits and steeliness.",91,Louis Latour 2006 Goutte d'Or Premier Cru  (Meursault),,,,
"Flinty lemon and caramel are flouted around rich layers of caramel and baked quince in this blend of two vineyard sites, both planted to Wente selection Chardonnay. The richness of the vineyards speaks loudly enough to call for only neutral oak to be used in aging. The finish brings a spark of pineapple and mango custard.",93,Lynmar 2013 La Sereinité Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Full in the mouth, this rich wine is dominated by yellow fruits and ripe apricots lifted by a touch of toast. Great acidity conveys a fresh and tangy character.

"Pride continues to struggle with this variety, as does everyone else in California who tries their hand at it. The '05 is semisweet and simple, with candied cherry-blackberry flavors that finish more like a dessert wine than a dry table wine.",82,Pride Mountain 2005 Sangiovese (Sonoma County),,,,

"Dark fruit and astringent tannins make for a bold and hearty first impression. This Sangiovese Riserva opens with a dark inky color and delivers aromas of prune, plum, cola, tar and old spice. Pair it with aged Pecorino cheese.",87,Poderi dal Nespoli 1929 2010 Il Nespoli Riserva  (Sangiovese di Romagna Superiore),,,,
"Made by Kirk Venge from a Dutton Ranch vineyard site, this wine immediately offers a lot to like, from its earthy sassafras and compelling layers of crisp raspberry and cherry, to its soft layers of oaky density accented in rose.

"Aromas of green apple, toasted almond and adhesive bandage carry over to the palate. It's vigorous, with brisk acidity and a bitter finish.",84,Le Vigne di Alice 2016 Doro Nature  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
"Very light in the glass and subtle on the nose, this bottling from the John Sebastiano Vineyard shows cranberry-raspberry fruit with a pleasing mace and nutmeg spice, proving refreshing and easily quaffable.

"Black plum and elderberry jam aromas mix with leather, tobacco, crushed sage and oregano on this blend of 50% Grenache, 38% Syrah and 12% Petite Sirah from the Warner Springs area.

The nose is shy but the palate is full of generous ripe pear fruit that's wonderfully countered by equally ample freshness. This interplay between opposite poles creates a friendly and appetizing wine. The finish is clean and just off dry.,90,Domaine Charles Baur 2015 Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"Generally regarded as one of the lighter vintages of the 21st century, the wine still has charm and attractive mature flavors like mushroom, as well as a leathery texture. The end still hints at freshness and attractive fruit.",86,Château le Raz 2002  Montravel,,,,
"Acacia flower, almond and yellow apple aromas carry through to the lean, simple palate along with a confectionery note. Pour this at informal get-togethers.",84,Cavazza NV  Prosecco,,,,

Although it is dry, its perfumed character brings out ripeness on the palate.",90,Château de Gaudou 2012 Blanc de Noir Malbec (Vin de France),,,,
"This complex Syrah has a surprisingly deep, dark red color, almost like a Port, but it's not nearly as heavy as it looks. It boasts intricate flavors, a firm but not fat structure, and signature cool-climate Syrah characteristics of black pepper, wood smoke, plum and grilled meat flavors. Medium-bodied and silky textured, it sips smoothly and leaves you wanting more.",94,Cattleya 2012 Soberanes Vineyard Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Packed with juicy fruit flavors that recall a tart lemon drop or limoncello cocktail, this low-alcohol beauty retains its powerful acidity even as a dollop of residual sugar softens it. It's full and round, with both power and precision.",92,Trisaetum 2011 Coast Range Estate Riesling,,,,

"This is a bit chunkier and less suave than De Bortoli's more expensive estate bottled Shiraz-Viognier, but it's still a very nice wine.

Drink now–2015.",88,De Bortoli 2008 Gulf Station Shiraz-Viognier (Yarra Valley),,,,

"Pair this food-friendly bright Rosso with meatloaf or pork roasted with chopped fennel and leeks. The wine opens with easy berry aromas backed by blue flower and spice, and there's a blast of cleansing acidity on the close.",87,Casato1 2010 Voliero  (Rosso di Montalcino),,,,
"This 100% stainless-steel-aged Sauvignon Blanc has a crisp, herbal mouthfeel, with a melon-like brightness. Just a touch of green pepper and jalapeño muddle the finish.",84,Peltier 2011 Hybrid Sauvignon Blanc (Lodi),,,,
Slight spritz and a very restrained nose of subdued fruit lead onto a fresh but rounded palate where lime zest encounters riper notes of passion fruit. There is a more serious midpalate texture that calls out for food. Drink soon.,89,Wohlmuth 2015 Klassik Sauvignon Blanc (Südsteiermark),,,,
"This 100% varietal wine is unabashedly appealing with pure, direct notes of coffee and plum. It's the feel that truly dazzles, with a supple velvety texture and a tart uptick on the lingering finish.",91,Flying Trout 2012 Mary's Block Windrow Vineyard Malbec (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"91-93. Barrel sample. Initially severe, this wine shows weight coupled with firm, dry tannins. Dense and complex black-currant flavors dominate.",92,Château Beaumont 2011 Barrel Sample  (Haut-Médoc),,,,
"This medium-bodied wine smells like herbs and flowers, tastes softly fruity, is easy to drink and plummy in flavor.",83,The Divining Rod 2013 Divine Rod Red (Lodi),,,,
"Aromas of savory herbs, mineral, exotic spice and red fruit are followed by fruit flavors that are surprisingly restrained considering the warmth of the vintage. Tart acidity livens it up. It's green for the variety but still brings enjoyment.",90,Efeste 2013 Upright Klipsun Vineyard Merlot (Red Mountain),,,,
"In the dry style characteristic of the Lelarge house, this is a finely delineated wine with fresh, crisp lines of acidity cutting through bright citrus and green-apple flavors. The wine is light on the palate without sacrificing depth of flavor. It is showing good signs of maturity so drink now—2018.",91,Lelarge-Pugeot NV Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"Apple, peach and melon aromas are fresh and easy to like. This has a pure palate, with citric and malic acidity offset by pulpy weight. Peach and apricot flavors finish long, and overall this should maintain its good shape over the next year.",88,Licia 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"This Prosecco Cartizze offers fun tones of minerals and dried herbs that add one more aromatic layer to the wine's natural fruit flavors of white peach, pear and honey. This luminous sparkler is loaded with fruity flavors that recall pear and peach.",89,Le Colture NV  Prosecco Superiore di Cartizze,,,,
"This is a rich style of Burgundy, broad and full of yellow fruits. These are cut by acidity, a lime-zest character that pushes the fruitiness right forward. Drink now.",87,Florent Descombe 2015  Bourgogne,,,,
"Juicy and oaky, this ripe, fleshy wine dances in black fruit and tea. Medium in weight and length, it finishes in a burst of toasted vanilla.",85,Kastania 2011 Jason and Aiden's Block Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),,,,
"A medium sweet wine, it is full of ripe tropical fruits. It has a rounded texture, generous and opulent in feel with an intense, concentrated structure. Spicy and warm, it needs several years to rdevelop. Drink from 2016.",91,Domaine Albert Mann 2010 Hengst Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"Exotic melon and pineapple flavors are accented by hints of chalk and powdered sugar on this brisk yet penetrating Riesling. Light on its feet with a textural, almost feathery, mouthfeel, it's an incredible steal at $12.",90,Red Newt Cellars 2011 Circle Riesling (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This juicy, minerally blend is composed of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon and 22% Merlot. The winery aims to source from cool vineyard sites and this bottling is true to that in style—elegant and balanced, subtle in tannins and aged in only 50% new oak. Bay leaf and mint come to the fore ahead of clove.",91,Starfield 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"Romagna, in central Italy, has the soothing climate and warm sunshine to make delicate, harmonious passito wines that don't exaggerate in terms of sweetness. This light gold wine is composed without being withdrawn and delivers creamy apricot, sharp herbal qualities and natural rubber. It glides down smooth in the mouth and has very balanced acidity.",90,Fattoria Zerbina 2004 Arrocco Passito  (Albana di Romagna),,,,
"Like so many of the 2010 Shirazes from South Australia, this is a terrific wine. It's full bodied and creamy in texture without going over the top, and the bold, oak-derived aromas of toast and vanilla ably frame flavors of black olive and plum. Already very drinkable, it should still be going strong in 2020.",91,Wirra Wirra 2010 Woodhenge Shiraz (McLaren Vale),,,,
"Gritty berry aromas come with notes of cheesy oak and road tar. This feels clunky and syrupy, but not unfriendly. Candied, reedy flavors of berry fruits and brown sugar finish jagged, with medicinal green notes.",86,Gratia 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"Ripe raspberry jam scents gain intrigue thanks to hints of eucalyptus oil, orange rinds and iron on this Jim Clendenen-made wine. The palate is driven by dried herbs, from oregano to thyme, with cooked pork rind meatiness in the middle and a vanilla-flecked finish.",93,Au Bon Climat 2011 Knox Alexander Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"This golden-colored wine conveys intense aromas of white rose petals and exotic spice. The rich palate offers dried apricot, candied ginger, nectarine zest and sage. An energizing shot of graphite marks the finish.",88,Tenuta Fernanda Cappello 2013 Traminer (Friuli Grave),,,,
"Delectable notes of pastry spice, blackberry and vanilla unfurl onto the medium-bodied palate, which is bolstered by sinewy tannins and finessed acids.",87,Chateau Morrisette 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Virginia),,,,
"This vintage of Il Musico presents united aromas of pine, almond, maple syrup, candied fruit and orange zest. It's a different, distinctive dessert wine that does not resemble most other Passitos because of the inherent spice and zestiness of its flavors.",90,Benanti 2009 Il Musico 500ml Moscato (Sicilia),,,,
"This is a big-boned wine, showy in spearmint and eucalyptus, burly blackberry and tar. With integrated oak and tannin, it presents a respectable showing of approachably lush texture and succulence, the finish persistent in juicy fruit.",90,JCB 2013 No. 1 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Ripe fruit and oak loom large in this wine, produced from relatively old vines in the heart of the appellation, long a source for the producer's Pinot Noir. Preserved lemon, fleshy melon and caramel dance around each other, steeped in Golden Delicious apple, honey and pear. A high wire of acidity marks the finish.",90,Merry Edwards 2012 Olivet Lane Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Zinfandel fans will celebrate this powerfully ripe, exuberant wine. It's classic Russian River Zin, dry, tannic, heady and enormously rich in black currants, raisins, prunes, beef jerky and exotic baking spices. The finish is so fruity, it's almost sweet, yet is actually quite dry, making it clean and zesty.",92,Hartford Court 2011 Old Vine Fanucchi-Wood Road Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This is ultraripe and a bit raisiny on the nose, but there are encouraging flashes of schisty minerality and freshness. It feels jammy, full bodied and thick, with a baked black-fruit flavor and notes of licorice and tobacco. Smooth and earthy on the finish, with power to spare. Drink now–2014.",90,Genium Celler 2007 Ecològic Red (Priorat),,,,
"Generic apple aromas are short on intensity and length. This tastes of melon but not much more. A light, dilute finish with bready flavor notes ensures that this is O.K. for easy quaffing.",84,Tololo 2014 Chardonnay (Maule Valley),,,,
"Aromas of lime leaf and citrus lead to sleek, dry fruit flavors, speckled with lime notes on the finish. Pair it with shrimp ceviche.",88,North by Northwest 2014 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Musky floral, spice and cherry-blossom notes meld in the exuberant bouquet of this aromatic auslese. It's blossomy on the palate as well, and luscious, with sweet peach and yellow cherry flavors. It's unabashedly lavish, but balanced by a streak of citrus acidity and a long, lingering finish.",90,Leonard Kreusch 2012 Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Auslese Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Made from 67% Syrah and 33% Grenache, this is a thick wine with a straightforward approach to its burly flavors of dark chocolate and compressed wild berry. Touches of garrigue and white pepper slither through the midpalate.",86,Ampelos 2014 Ampelos Vineyard Syrache Syrah-Grenache (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Made from a blend of Sangiovese (85%) and Merlot (15%), this Morellino discloses aromas of incense and exotic Asian spices together with toasted oak. The palate shows raspberry and plum layered with espresso and coffee alongside astringent tannins. It closes on a bitter, drying note.",86,La Selva 2011 Colli dell'Uccellina  (Morellino di Scansano),,,,
"Riserva Barolo Prapò delivers modern oak tones followed by nice integrity of fruit and well-integrated aromas of spice, prune, blackberry and cola. The mouthfeel is very velvety and smooth and the tannins show an extreme fine grain quality. Hold ten years or more.",94,Schiavenza 2004 Prapò Riserva  (Barolo),,,,
"This red has a fruity, jammy nose with a peppery kick. On the palate it's a mixture of spicebox, cherry, coffee and pepper. Approachable and well made—a good everyday drinking red.",86,Waters Crest 2006 Campania Rosso Red (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"Bright, fresh and vivacious, this bottling from the historic vineyard offers white flowers, sea salt, lemons and buttered white peaches on the nose. Apple flesh and lime rind sizzles into the citrus-driven palate, where a touch of lemon verbena adds complexity to this straightforward and delicious wine.",93,Fess Parker 2014 Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"An exceptionally priced Sauvignon Blanc from estate-grown fruit, Brutocao's Feliz Vineyard offers pronounced aromatics, all honeysuckle and apricot. Floral, savory, even slightly salty, the fruit that will stand out most here is honeydew melon. The wine's just-enough level of sweetness is reminiscent of nature's best.",89,Brutocao 2012 Feliz Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino),,,,
"This is not a true fortified wine but one made from late-harvest Tannat with some added alcohol before fermentation. It produces a delicious wine with superripe blackberry flavors and some tannins. Sweet and rich, it is ready to drink now.",90,Vignobles Brumont 2010 Montus Vintage Tannat (Vin de Liqueur),,,,
"Pineapple rind, steely lemon and white flowers carry the notes of this blend of Roussanne, Chardonnay and Viognier. The palate is broad and buttery in feel, with a string of acids that cut the finish short.",85,Llano Estacado 2014 1836 White (Texas),,,,
"Intensely fruity, forward tones of peach and strawberry are shaded by bramble and earth on this light-footed rosé. Approachable and fresh, yet just a touch savory, it finishes brisk and clean.",87,Domaine LeSeurre 2014 Cuvée Classique Rosé (Finger Lakes),,,,

"Flavors like wild berries blend with smoke and rosemary in this full-bodied, full-flavored and firmly tannic wine. It is big in texture and high in aromatic intensity. Made of 72% Grenache, 19% Syrah and 9% Mourvèdre.",88,Terre Rouge 2013 L'Autre Red (Sierra Foothills),,,,
"Wild aromas abound on the nose of this wine, but are balanced with expressive garrigue (primarily rosemary and thyme) and ripe red cherry, bramble and blueberry notes. The medium-weight mouth shows great richness and concentration of flavors, all framed by silky tannins and moderate acidity.",89,Château Prieuré Borde-Rouge 2008 Rubellis Red (Corbières),,,,
"Moderately hollow on the nose, this shows wet slate and damp clay aromas, a bit of a miss for a winery whose recent vintages have been extremely impressive. Pomegranate and raspberry fruit mark the palate, underscored by wet clay earthiness and tangy acidity.",87,Challen 2012 Jasper Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"A tartly acidic wine, with some sweet molasses aromas but also hints of decaying vegetation.",80,Willow Creek 2000 Pinot Noir (Canterbury),,,,
"This is waxy on the nose, with the aromatic spunk of nettle and sweaty citrus. It feels fresh, minerally and zesty, with citrus, apple and green herb flavors. It's solid, smooth and elegant on the finish, which turns slightly bitter as it concludes.",89,Blanco Nieva 2011 Verdejo (Rueda),,,,
"This is bursting with brown baking spice highlights, in aroma and flavor. Moderately plump fig and cherry fruit flavors thin out in the finish, but don't quit. An hour of decanting is a big help.",90,Saffron Fields Vineyard 2014 Dijon Clones Pinot Noir,,,,
"Made from Sangiovese with 5% Cabernet Sauvignon, this straightforward wine conveys aromas of stewed prunes, plum and black spices. The palate offers fleshy black cherry and black pepper alongside soft, round tannins. Enjoy soon.",87,Piccini 2008 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"Dark and dense, this wine has weight and richness, with layers of perfumed red fruits and plenty of concentration. With its solid tannins and structure, the wine is developing slowly and with power. The dry core is still prominent, showing how the wine will age over time. Drink from 2024.",94,Henri de Villamont 2014  Mazis-Chambertin,,,,
"An effusively fruity, unoaked style of Chardonnay, with bold flavors of pear, apple and citrus and maybe even a touch of mango. Its charms are upfront for all to see, as it loses a bit of intensity and lacks length on the finish.",85,Xanadu 2006 Dragon Chardonnay (Margaret River),,,,
"A blend of Mauzac and Loin de l'Oeil, commonly found in Gaillac, this bright, fruity and herbaceous wine is crisp and citrus-driven. A strong mineral edge to the texture adds bite to the aftertaste. Drink from 2015.",88,Château la Colombière 2014 Les Jacquaires White (Vin de France),,,,
"This feels a bit tough and gritty, with stringy tannins that give the palate a rustic texture. The flavors are ripe, with notes of cherries, licorice and mocha. Drink now.",86,Flocchini 2010 Saddle-Up Syrah (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"This wine has the kind of beefy, muscular character that one expects in a Cab, with its earthy berry and leathery spice nose, and a layering of tobacco smoke, black pepper and rich berry on the palate. Decent tannins and minerality add to the weight. A good wine with ageable appeal.",86,Damiani 2006 Barrel Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Romano Dal Forno applies the same stringent quality standards on his so-called base wine as he does his top-tier Amarone. But referring to this Valpolicella Superiore as a “base wine” couldn't be more incorrect. In fact, this singular expression occupies its very own category in which the utmost attention is paid to the smallest details. It opens with dark, inky concentration and amazing intensity, with black cherry, barbecue spice, leather and tobacco.",93,Dal Forno Romano 2007  Valpolicella Superiore,,,,
"This fresh, juicy wine is full of red fruits and has light tannins. A dry core supports the perfumed red-berry flavors. With acidity, the wine is likely to develop quickly. Drink from 2019.",88,Domaine Jean Fournier 2014 Les Echezots  (Marsannay),,,,
"From a blend of grapes sourced from three vineyard sites, including Keefer, one of the producer's vineyard designates, this wine displays a light red color. It has a noticeably supple texture, a soft expression of cranberry and red cherry accented by black tea.",90,Cellars 33 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"The bouquet on this blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir is stuck in neutral, while flavors of citrus and lemon bend towards sour. The finish is briny and tangy.",83,Bodega NQN 2011 Picada 15 White (Patagonia),,,,
"Scattered and unruly up front, this smells downright foxy. The palate is both narrow and sharp, while flavors of vanilla oak, soupy black fruits and tart acidity come around a bit on the finish.",84,Trus 2014 Roble  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"Fairly citrusy and lean for a reserve-level Malbec. The nose is short, high-toned and shows aromas of red fruits, citrus and even celery. The palate is fresh but tight and drying, with raspberry flavors and cherry skins and tomato on the finish. A red-dominant wine.",83,Dolce Stefania 2006 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Light but generic aromas of white fruits and white flowers give this wine a happy bouquet. The palate is starting to tip toward fading, but if you get at it soon you'll find perfectly nice peach, melon and citrus flavors setting up a soft, easygoing finish.",87,Pazo De Villarei 2006 Terra d'Ouro Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"A sleek texture and delicious, focused fruit flavors like cranberry and black cherry make this full-bodied wine mouthfilling and compelling. It offers density and richness, too, which helps extend the lightly sweet finish.",90,Bogle 2014 Essential Red (California),,,,
"This is a fruity, fresh wine full of black currant and berry flavor. Delicately structured, there's a vein of fresh green herbs and bell-pepper flavors that lend crispness to the finish.",87,Domaine de l'Idylle 2011 Mondeuse (Savoie),,,,
"A layered fragrance of blue flower, leather, tobacco, mature black fruit and incense lead the nose on this bold but refined wine. The palate doles out crushed blackberry, graphite and licorice alongside chewy tannins and surprisingly fresh acidity for an eight-year-old wine.",92,Corteforte 2006 Vigneti di Osan  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),,,,
"This is a pleasant, no-fuss sparkler with textbook aromas of peach, flowers and citrus fruit. Overall, it lacks intensity but its crisp, lean mouthfeel helps it end on a high, zesty note.",86,Zardetto NV Zeta Dry  (Prosecco di Conegliano),,,,
"Aromas of cocoa, spice, vanilla and dark fruit lead, with the oak (20% new French and American) playing a significant role. The blue-fruit flavors are plump in feel, narrowing toward the finish.",88,Waterbrook 2013 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Reduced, with a pronounced aroma of oak, this is a simple, moderately focused wine that presents as fleshy and thick, bursting in flavors of grass.",85,Flora Springs 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"This opens with delicate aromas of red-skinned berry and baking spice. Straightforward and tangy, the palate offers raspberry, citrus zest and clove alongside smooth tannins. Enjoy soon.",87,Villa Canestrari 2016 Terre di Lanoli  (Valpolicella),,,,
"Smooth and well balanced, this medium-bodied wine combines light cinnamon and cherry aromas with rich plum flavors. It has a good harmony between bright acidity and ripe fruitiness.",87,Steiner Family Vineyards 2012 Free Bird Zinfandel (El Dorado),,,,
"The nose on this rarely used grape is indeed voluptuous with caramel richness alongside seared pears and vanilla. It's bright at the tip of the sip, then the denser vanilla-bean notes settle in, evolving to smoked apples and a slight crème brûlée aftertaste.",86,Clavo Cellars 2012 Voluptuous Vermentino (Paso Robles),,,,
"A fine wine for dinner parties and important family reunions, this bright Barolo exudes elegance and finesse thanks to its delicate aromas of blue flower, dried lavender, cassis and forest berry. The wine is sheer and smooth with taut firmness on the close.",92,Guido Porro 2007 Vigna Lazzairasco  (Barolo),,,,
"This straightforward quaffer has aromas of plum, woodspice, tire rubber and herb. The fruit flavors are elegant in style with some sugar balancing it out.",85,Sagelands 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This Chenin Blanc, Chardonnay and Cabernet Franc blend is classic Loire. It is lightly honeyed with perfumed apricot and pear flavors. Bright acidity and a crisp, clean aftertaste create a fragrant, fresh wine to drink now.",87,Gratien et Meyer NV Brut Sparkling (Crémant de Loire),,,,
"Intense notes of slate and smoke lead straight to the Mosel on in this spry, mineral-laden spätlese. The palate is bracingly acidic, but honeyed sweetness and streaks of sunny grapefruit and lemon brighten the finish.",90,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch) 2014 Bernkasteler Badstube Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Mature mealy apricot aromas lead to a spent palate with unfocused cidery flavors that taste old and demanding. This finishes heavy, pulpy and without much point or pleasure. Albariño is meant to be fresh and friendly, but this is neither.",83,Fillaboa 2013 Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"There's a slightly smoky, fume character to this wine's otherwise ripe aromas of stone fruit, melon and fig, giving an extra layer of complexity. And despite the ripe aromas, this wine is crisp and grassy on the palate, delivering a long finish with finely delineated flavors.",89,Sherwood Estate 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"Structured but straightforward, it opens with a pretty fragrance of white flowers, yellow apples and a whiff of bread crust, all of which carry over to the ripe, round palate.",87,Colutta 2013 Chardonnay (Colli Orientali del Friuli),,,,
"Starts off with a minerally, slightly fumé-style note, then adds herbal and leafy notes and white grapefruit flavors. From New Zealand's first carbon-neutral winery, this medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc is appealingly long, crisp and clean on the finish.",90,Grove Mill 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"Light in color and bright in floral intensity, this delivers flavors of citrus, stone fruit and apple, with a subtle endnote of chopped mint or basil.",87,Borgoluce NV Brut  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene Superiore),,,,
"From the famous vineyard site along Westside Road, equally known for its Chardonnay, this big, bold red is not for the faint of heart. It delivers a powerful punch of voluptuously jammy blueberry around soft, earthy wisps of forest and black tea.",91,Venge 2014 Bacigalupi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Coming from Boushey Vineyard, this is a seldom-seen variety in the state. This offering seems a bit reduced out of the gate, showing aromas of garden hose along with lemon. The medium-bodied citrus rind and lemon flavors bring plenty of appeal along with a big blast of acidity. If the reduction blows off, it moves up a notch or two as the palate flat-out impresses.",89,Callan 2016 Picpoul (Yakima Valley),,,,
"A bit too sharp and acidic to earn a higher score, with green mint flavors of cherries, anise and pepper.",84,R & B Cellars 2007 Bingham Ranch Zydeco Zinfandel (Napa Valley),,,,
"The ripe combination of Chenin and Chardonnay gives this always-delicious wine its richness and creamy texture. It is ripe, full-bodied with melon and peach flavors as well as crisper acidity. This limited-production wine is smooth and rich at the end. Drink now.",91,Bouvet-Ladubay 2012 Saphir Brut Vintage  (Saumur),,,,
"Dusty and a bit odd on the nose, this has a strange whiff of perfume and resiny oak. The palate is round and layered, with some minerality. Flavors of apple, pear and quince come with a lot of vanilla and raw oak. The finish follows suit with toast and resiny flavors.",88,Maycas del Limari 2010 Reserva Especial Chardonnay (Limarí Valley),,,,
"This Petit Verdot grown on the hillsides of El Dorado County in California Gold Country is all dark berry and strawberry jam, still tight and grippy with room to develop added complexity over time.",86,Duarte Georgetown 2007 Georgetown Divide Petit Verdot (El Dorado),,,,
"Light, clean and citrusy aromas of lemon, lime and grapefruit skin meet with a dollop of white peach and dusting of crushed slate on the nose of this wine. A fine-pointed acidity carries nectarine, pluot and Asian pear flavors across the palate, which trends racy, bright and slightly sour, with a chalky structure.",93,Testarossa 2014 Rosella's Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Strawberry and raspberry flavors are fresh and clean, not thin, but less robust than previous vintages. It's a delicate, nicely crafted wine that could be cellared through 2025.",90,Trisaetum 2013 Coast Range Estate Pinot Noir,,,,
"A lot of this Cabernet-Merlot-Syrah-Cab Franc blend is produced, and for the money it gives you plenty of enjoyment. Soft raspberry fruit seems loaded with oak-derived flavors. Toast, vanilla, bare wood, even a streak of cola come through. The wine drinks far more mature than the recent vintage, so drink up.",86,Maryhill 2012 Winemaker's Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This solidly good block selection shows shy aromas of dark red and purple fruit with a touch of earth and asphalt. The palate is tart and tight, with a bit of sagebrush nuance.",88,Thomas Fogarty 2012 Henry Ayrton's Block Rapley Trail Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"An exuberant, perfumed wine that is full of lychee and candy flavors. It has spice, soft acidity and a light, bright feel. Drink now.",86,Domaine Charles Frey 2012 Collines de Granit Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"There's a slightly reductive barnyard funk on the nose of this blend of 53% Syrah, 34% Grenache and 13% Petite Sirah, as well as damp morel mushrooms and concentrated blackberries. It's tarry on the palate, with more blackberries in a slightly burned balsamic-reduction sauce.",89,Refugio Ranch 2012 Red (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"At first glance, this appears to be a well-made but fairly innocuous Marlborough Sauvignon. But give it a little more time in bottle, or air in the glass, and it fills out, gaining length and complexity. Pineapple and stone fruit aromas and flavors are appealing from the start, but the quality shines through on the long, vibrant finish that's filled with suggestions of nectarine and wet stone.",91,Villa Maria 2014 Taylor's Pass Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"Raspberry fruit shines through with ample backing acidity. The flavors are true and fresh, though the wine seems to thin out midpalate. It was fermented with wild yeast and aged for 15 months in the barrel.",88,Lundeen 2014 La Cantera Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),,,,
"This is a big, powerful young Pinot Noir, rich in ripe fruit. It's solidly Californian, but with its silky texture, racy acidity and overall balance, retains elegance. Delicious now for its cherry, raspberry, cola, pomegranate, vanilla and cinnamon flavors, but should develop through 2013.",93,Dutton Estate 2007 Dutton Ranch Manzana Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"A likeable, easy Pinot that straddles the line between simplicity and complexity. Darkly colored, with earthy, berry aromatics; in the mouth it has the soft, silky texture and crisp acids you want in a good Pinot. Flavors are of cherries and spices. Fruit-driven and a good accompaniment to a wide range of food.",86,Benziger 2000 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),,,,
"Tart in acidity and pure in jammy raspberries and cherries, this is a Pinot to drink now. It shows the variety's lightly tannic, silky texture. Hints of unripeness develop in the finish.",85,Baileyana 2010 Grand Firepeak Cuvee Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),,,,
"The wine has all the classic structure and mineral tension of Dão. It gives both richness and dark, dry tannins that need several years to soften. At the same time, juicy black currant fruits give a fresh side to this complex, concentrated wine. Drink from 2016.",90,Sogrape 2010 Callabriga Red (Dão),,,,
"This ripe, black-fruited wine is based mainly on Merlot and Abouriou. Full of juicy flavors with soft tannins, it's rich and ready to drink, and makes a great barbecue wine.",85,Cave du Marmandais 2012 Ferran Pradets Red (Côtes du Marmandais),,,,
"This is not a crisp, lean, clear fino. It has a yellowing color and rather uncommon minty, nutty aromas. Some light fruit flavors run the show, while blanched almond, green olive and saline offer support. The finish is long, but maybe a bit sour and hot for some palates. Still, it's quite interesting and well made, and probably a good match with the right food.",88,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L. NV Fino Sherry Sherry (Jerez),,,,
"This wine is muted and still youthful, a blend of mostly Cabernet with 13% Merlot, 7% Syrah, 3% Petite Sirah and 1% Cabernet Franc. Pencil lead and dust fight for attention around big, bittersweet tannin and tobacco, not sure whether or not to let the black currant and cassis shine through.",89,Terra Valentine 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),,,,
"Truffle, forest floor, new leather, purple flower and crushed herb aromas take center stage in this Barbaresco. The firmly structured, elegant palate delivers juicy red cherry, raspberry compote, cinnamon and clove flavors in a matrix of tightly wound, polished tannins and bright acidity. A hint of star anise signals the close.",94,Cascina Alberta 2014 Giacone  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Orange blossom and other common white fruit aromas make for a standard, generic type of bouquet. The palate is regular in feel and weight, with shy flavors of melon and apple. Entirely middle of the road in aromas, body, feel and flavors.",84,Cruz Alta 2010 Reserve Chardonnay (Mendoza),,,,
"Earthy game, scorched earth and black-skinned fruit aromas come together in this Brunello. The palate is dense and ripe, delivering raspberry jam, mochaand vanilla flavors, with mature tannins. Enjoy 2018–2022.",88,Fornacina 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Tasted alongside the 2013, this is bigger, bolder, fruitier and more powerful, yet a touch less refined. The strawberry and cherry fruit is underscored with a pleasing minerality. The tannins are substantial and in proportion. A hint of chicken stock runs through the finish.",92,Elizabeth Chambers 2014 Winemaker's Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This opens with aromas of hay, pressed yellow flower and orchard fruit. The direct palate offers yellow apple skin, toasted nut and a mineral note alongside invigorating acidity.",87,Poggiobello 2014 Pinot Grigio (Friuli Colli Orientali),,,,
"Full and fruity, this has the ripeness to feel fleshy and lush, with a pleasant mix of pear, apple and peach flavors. Light touches of brioche and cinnamon add interest to the finish.",88,Del Rio 2014 Estate Grown Viognier (Rogue Valley),,,,
"This soft, gentle Cabernet doesn't have much structure, but it's rich in blackberry, currant and dark chocolate flavors, and thoroughly dry. The finish is hot like a jalapeño pepper.",86,Bacio Divino 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Alluring aromas of tree bark, licorice root, rose petal and ripe black fruit show elegance. This is a touch grippy and young in feel, but overall it's showing balance. Deep flavors of plum, cherry, wild berry and vanilla finish finessed by a balance of weight and acidity. Drink from 2019–2032.",94,Remelluri 2011 Granja Gran Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"Earth, leather, black plum and wild-berry aromas are solid and appealing. This is wide and jammy in the mouth, with all the volume expected of Argentinean Malbec. Flavors of oak, mint and spiced plum finish with a touch of heat. Drink through 2018.",89,Fabre Montmayou 2013 Phebus Estate Bottled Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"There's a jammy, sun-ripened note of strawberry or blackberry jam, but also soft layers of chocolate fudge and savory spice at the back of this Sicilian red. The mouthfeel is smooth and velvety.",87,Fazio 2009 Torre dei Venti Nero d'Avola (Erice),,,,
"This blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Tannat works quite well, with rounded aromas of caramelized blackberry, vanilla and vibrant violets on the nose. Black currant, dried herbs and pepper show on the palate, which is nicely balanced and not as unctuous as the nose implies.",91,Dubost 2014 Vingence Red (Adelaida District),,,,
"A waft of Nilla Wafer opens the bouquet of this light, well-composed wine, followed by fruity notes of lemon and orange, a floral component at its core. Zingy, it remains balanced in the glass, lightweight with plenty of fruit.",89,Waterstone 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"Pronounced Kay-lee, this is sourced from Red Mountain, hence the graphite and grain in the tannins. Lush cherry, tobacco and earth flavors combine, with a whiff of smoke wafting through the wine from start to finish.",91,Efeste 2010 Ceidleigh Syrah (Red Mountain),,,,
"Candied cherry and raspberry aromas are dilute by Mendoza standards. The palate is regular at best, with juicy generic flavors of plum and raspberry. This finishes raw in feel, with little depth of flavor.",83,Simonassi 2010 1922 Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Pepper, herb and dark fruit aromas lead to silky-feeling fruit and savory flavors. It doesn't stand up on its own but should fit in nicely at the dinner table.",86,Hogue 2012 Genesis Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This supple and smooth Fiano delivers notes of pear, Golden Delicious apple and yellow melon. The wine is layered and complex thanks to the mineral nuances that accompany it to the end. It is also chewy, naturally robust and promises an excellent match to lobster, crab or baked clams.",90,Mastroberardino 2007 Radici  (Fiano di Avellino),,,,
"From a former Kosta Browne winemaker comes this very dark Syrah, which shows still-wound-up aromas of elderberry, black coffee, white pepper and a touch of game. There are rich soy and beef notes once sipped, packaged by dense tannins and zesty acidity, with more elderberry, beef char and crushed slate emerging with time. Still young.",90,Shane Wines 2012 The Villain Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Elegant and clean, this Brut Satèn sparkler boasts a feminine side thanks to its soft perlage and delicate aromas of peach blossom and honeysuckle. It's an attractive and fresh wine that remains compact and composed to the finish.",90,Bellavista NV Gran Cuvée Satèn Brut Chardonnay (Franciacorta),,,,
"This is a funky, pushy type of wine, with prickly aromas of green herb and berry. For a 2007, it is big and a bit rough, with an herbal, green-leaning berry flavor distinctive of this producer and its Los Lingues Vineyard. It finishes with additional herbal kick and heat.",87,Casa Silva 2007 Microterroir de Los Lingues Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"New leather, pressed blue flower, wild berry and a whiff of game are some of the aromas you'll find in this taut, structured red.

Drink 2018–2026.",90,Romeo 2011 Lipitiresco  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),,,,
"One of the finest wines to come from Cantenac Brown for many years, this is powerful and dense, dominated by Cabernet Franc tannins and fruits. The structure has a smooth, polished character that locates it firmly in Margaux, giving elegance and discreet fruitiness. Age this fine wine for many years.",95,Château Cantenac Brown 2010  Margaux,,,,
"This is full of ripe plum and black cherry flavors that are richly textured and spiced. It has an elegant side, which makes for a round, full-bodied finish, and it has the potential to age well.",88,Campolargo 2008 Diga? Tinto Red (Bairrada),,,,
"Here's an important new Cabernet that instantly takes its place in the increasingly crowded Napa pantheon. It's extraordinarily rich in black currants, chocolate, anise, pepper and cedar flavors that are wrapped into perfectly ripened tannins. Feels lush, plush and smooth in the mouth, and should age effortlessly for a decade or more.",96,David Arthur 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Roughly half Cab Franc, this includes Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Tempranillo as well. Here the fruit is accented, not overtaken, with the flavors of barrels. The best of the winery's red wines, it augments its pretty cherry core with a streak of coffee and dark chocolate.",88,Kriselle 2013 Di'tani Red (Rogue Valley),,,,
"Dry and crisp, this is dominated by apple flavor. It's light in texture, attractively fruity and has a youthful feel to it. It could age a few months in bottle.",88,Le Grix de la Salle NV Brut Extra  (Champagne),,,,
"This is a rich, succulent wine, more akin to an auslese than a true spätlese. Dried apricot and orange marmalade aromas and flavors surround a core of dried spices and crushed stone, finishing on a spicy, mineral note. Drink now–2025.",92,Langwerth Von Simmern 2005 Erbacher Marcobrunn Spätlese Riesling (Rheingau),,,,
"A little rough and oily on the nose, with citrus and green notes. The palate is soft and melony in feel, with banana, papaya and other tropical flavors. Sweet and melony on the finish; won't last for very long.",85,Santa Carolina 2010 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),,,,
"Tropical and creamy, the aromas thick in grapefruit and pineapple, this light, citrus-tinged, refreshing 100% Sauvignon Blanc is well-balanced and easy to enjoy, approachable with some depth.",88,J. Lohr 2013 Carol's Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (St. Helena),,,,
"The fruit that was used to make this Pinot Grigio was sourced from a High Valley vineyard situated at an elevation of 2,000 feet. The resulting wine is full of citrus and green apple aromas and flavors. The finish shows a touch of sweetness.",86,Ramspeck 2011 Sassolini Pinot Grigio (Lake County),,,,
"Here's a powerfully fruity Napa red wine to drink tonight with roasts, cheeses, or just a nice burger.

A blend of Bordeaux varieties and Syrah.",87,Crane Brothers 2005 Crane Ranch Vineyard Brodacious Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Fueled by loads of fresh fruit flavor, this is a full-bodied and generous-tasting wine. Tempting cedar and pine aromas lead to raspberry, cherry and blackberry notes that are almost sweet and last long on the finish.",90,ZinPhomaniac 2014 Old Vine Cuvée Zinfandel (Lodi),,,,
"Earthy, mulchy berry aromas lack freshness and clarity. This is a dense, meaty, thick Malbec with stewed black-plum and woodspice flavors. Used tea bag and baked berry flavors show on the finish.",84,Maal 2015 Biutiful Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"This compact Aglianico embraces a traditional style with a leaner appearance and elegant tones of bramble, forest berry and balsam notes that recall cola and dried mint. It tastes fresh and offers enduring notes of berry fruit on the finish. Made with grapes from 70-year-old vines.",90,Tecce 2004 Satyricon Aglianico (Irpinia),,,,
"The small village of Saint-Andelain is at the heart of Sauvignon Blanc in Pouilly Fumé. This wine is ripe with melon and peach flavors cut with intense acidity. It is well textured, full bodied and should be held until well into 2017.",91,Henri Bourgeois 2015 En Travertin  (Pouilly-Fumé),,,,
"Aromas of Dr Pepper, black-cherry cola syrup, chopped lavender candies and a touch of leather show on the intriguing, distinct nose from this historic property. The cola character plays heavily into the palate, where condensed purple flower, blackberry, black tea and licorice flavors also abound.",90,Bien Nacido 2012 Grenache (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"Here's a ruby-colored blend made with grapes that are native to Tuscany and central Italy that shows bright berry nuances followed by almond skin, herbs, pressed flowers and cherry cola. There is good balance here between the wine's bright acidity and its finely textured tannins.",88,Bocelli 2005 Poggioncino Red (Toscana),,,,
"Suolo is a beautiful accomplishment and one of the most pleasing and delicate expressions of Sangiovese to be found. What's so outstanding about this wine is its balanced elegance. Aromas include intense red cherry, light chocolate shavings and vanilla bean. This wine boasts a modern, international persona that translates into supple smoothness and a soft, velvety mouthfeel.",93,Argiano 2005 Suolo Sangiovese (Toscana),,,,
"Bright and silky, this opens with aromas of citrus and walnut. The luminous palate delivers ripe yellow apple, nectarine, a hint of brioche and a mineral note offset by a frothy mousse.",89,Barone Pizzini 2011 Satèn Chardonnay (Franciacorta),,,,
"Good price for a Sauvignon Blanc this nice to pair with food. It's basically dry, although you'll find a honeyed richness around the lemon, lime and green apple flavors, as well as plenty of savory acidity that gets those tastebuds watering.",87,Tudal 2010 Honker Blanc Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"The lifted nose seems like an amalgam of chalk and dried apples along with lemon zest. The aromas are reminiscent of evolving Riesling but this is not the only grape in this expressive and highly aromatic field blend. While there is distinct residual sweetness on the palate, this has a counterweight in the rich texture of the midpalate. There is something authentic and deeply comforting and satisfying at the core of this wine that says Alsace. It's impossible to put this wine into a box, it needs to be tasted and enjoyed on its very own terms. The finish is medium sweet, totally soil-driven and very, very long. This is an experience rather than a drink. Drink now through 2035.",95,Domaine Marcel Deiss 2011 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru White (Alsace),,,,
"The grapes were farmed biodynamically, fermented with wild yeasts, and just two barrels were aged in new oak. The stiff berry fruit is cloaked in details of stem and earth, tart acids and a whiff of compost.",87,Day 2014 Johan Vineyards Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Inviting, exotic coconut and vanilla scents give this vineyard designate a tropical flourish before more traditional cassis and cherry notes take the lead. Bright acidity counters velvety texture as the wine unfurls its underlying grip of tannin. Approachably rich, it rewards with full flavor and body.",93,Judge Palmer 2012 Beckstoffer Georges III Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),,,,
"Sourced entirely from the Bacchus vineyard, this was whole-cluster pressed and 20% was fermented in neutral oak. Just a hint of sweetness remains, but what comes across strongly is a mineral-driven, wet stone base, under snappy fruit flavors of citrus, apple and orange peel.",88,Sparkman 2012 Birdie Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This wine starts off well with an aromatic mix of red fruit, citrus and toasted grain. The palate shows thick tannins and a stemmy finish which cut the flavors short.",86,Day 2015 Johan Vineyards Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Earthy aromas suggesting grilled porcini, leather, tilled soil and balsam lead the nose. The dense, chewy palate offers mature black cherry, raspberry, licorice and dried sage flavors, set against a tannic backdrop that needs time to soften. A tobacco note signals the close. Drink 2022–2032.",90,SassodiSole 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"This Zinfandel's tannins are starting to resolve, which gives the palate a soft, melted quality. The primary flavors are transforming into rich, dried black-raspberry and cherry notes, with leather, mocha, dried mushroom and spice accents.",90,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2007 Mancini Ranch Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Ordinary, this is not. The medium-garnet color has a brownish rim. Aromas resemble black pepper and charred beef, while the flavors are mostly savory rather than fruity. The wine tastes like pomegranate juice, and feels firm and dry in the mouth.",86,Holly's Hill 2012 Classique Mourvèdre (El Dorado),,,,
"Concentrated dark berry aromas are powerful on the nose, showing a touch reduced but minerally. The palate on this young Ribera wine is pure and potent but not fierce. Ripe, loamy blackberry flavors finish muscular, with just enough elegance and grace to confirm the wine's overall quality.",91,Convento de Las Claras 2011 Heritage  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"White currant, green pear and peppery arugula rule this crisp white. It bursts with very ripe sweet, juicy pears on the palate, making for  savory sipping with lots of resonance, with or without food. Drink now.",91,Buchegger 2013 Gelbling Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),,,,
"Firm in texture and moderately tannic, this wine is poised for pairing with something rich like braised or roasted beef. Cranberry and black cherry aromas meet baking spice nuances on the palate.",88,Girasole 2015 Hybrid Red (Mendocino),,,,
"Spicy berry fruit aromas are straightforward and pretty good. This wine feels firm and centered, with plum, berry and cherry flavors. A reasonably deep finish offers residual berry notes and peppery spice.",86,Tarantas 2016 Organic Tempranillo (Utiel-Requena),,,,
"The nose is quite shy but eventually reveals whiffs of scorched soil, leather and a balsamic note. The lean straightforward palate offers dried wild cherry and a hint of dark spice alongside grainy, rather fleeting tannins that leave an astringent finish.",86,Vasco Sassetti 2010 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"This prestige cuvée from Collet, with its hand-blown bottle and blend mainly of Premier and Grand Cru vineyards, is elegant and stylish—just like the fashion industry it celebrates. It is balanced, soft and ripe, filled with pear and apricot fruits that are cut with steely acidity. The wine has touches of maturity and this bottling is ready to drink.",93,Collet NV Esprit Couture Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"Like most Pinot Gris, this is subdued aromatically, but does unfold on the palate to reveal sweet melon and pear flavors. A burst of citrusy acids on the finish give it a sweet-tart balance that would work well with various spicy Asian dishes.",86,Rockburn 2015 Devil's Staircase Pinot Gris (Central Otago),,,,
"A rich, creamy wine, toasty and with ripe apricots. There is a definite toasty vanilla element in this wine. The structure, with its grapefruit edge, gives some tension to the surrounding softness.",90,Vilmart & Co 2000 Coeur de Cuvée Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne),,,,
This wine is dry but rich enough with black-currant flavors to compensate. The juicy aftertaste suggests the wine will develop quickly. Drink from 2017. This wine is the latest result of renovations on the 15-generation and 400-year-old Trocard family estate.,88,Château Mancèdre 2013  Pessac-Léognan,,,,
"This is a big, satisfying wine, smelling like ripe black cherry and cranberry, tasting concentrated like espresso and cranberry, and feeling like it's wrapped in a thick blanket of insistent tannins. It needs time to mellow or pairing with a protein-heavy dish. Best to drink after 2020.",90,Peace Water 2014 Passion Cabernet Sauvignon (North Coast),,,,
"This fresh, simple white smells of white wild flower and yellow stone fruit. The zesty palate offers lime and Bosc pear alongside tangy acidity that leads to a clean finish.",86,Raphael 2015  Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico,,,,
"Briny apple and lime aromas set up a minerally, fresh, natural palate with stony lime, green apple and white-pineapple flavors. Par for the brut nature course is a stony, chiseled finish that frames the wine's crisp, lean character.",89,Alta Alella 2013 Privat Brut Nature Chardonnay (Cava),,,,

"This wine comes from a partnership between winemaker David Galzignato of Jada Winery in Paso Robles, and Mark McWilliams of Arista Winery in Healdsburg. A devotion to Sauvignon Blanc, it succeeds with this sophisticated expression of lemon chiffon and mandarin orange that's bright and complex.

"This wine gives a big bear hug with aromas like wild berries and black pepper. Then sweet oak and rich, savory plum flavors emerge on the palate as the ripeness comes through. The finish is long and reverberates with the nutmeg spiciness of perfectly seasoned barrels.",92,Skinner 2012 Eighteen Sixty-One Red (El Dorado),,,,
"This extreme-coastal vineyard bottling shows fresh, expressive yet diligently restrained aromas of Key-lime pith, scratched tangerine, wet chalk, Meyer lemons and a touch of dairy. Tongue-tingling acidity starts the sip, followed by sea salt, warm Marcona almonds, toasted sunflower seeds, a flinty minerality and citrus oil toward the finish.",92,Sinor-LaVallee 2013 White Label Bassi Ranch Chardonnay (San Luis Obispo County),,,,
"Shows bright, crisp Central Coast acidity brightening pure flavors of limes, kiwis, pineapples and tropical papaya fruits, in a creamy texture. Textbook cool-climate Chardonnay.",87,Deep Sea 2008 Chardonnay (Central Coast),,,,
"The winery held back releasing the wine until this spring, probably to give the tannins extra time to soften up. It's got herbal flavors and the fruit seems to be fading. Drink up. —P.G.",85,Kestrel 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Nutty and dry, this Chardonnay-only sparkler tastes of almond paste, dried apple, dried citrus peel and toasty oak. It's vibrantly balanced and fulfilling.",90,Mumm Napa 2012 Blanc de Blancs Reserve Chardonnay (Napa County),,,,

"A ripe, juicy and fruity wine, this is already softening. Plenty of rounded Merlot flavors are stiffened by the wood-aging spices and the stalky black currant character of Cabernet. Drink this structured wine from 2018.",88,Château Moulin de Canhaut 2012  Médoc,,,,
"Rich and ripe, this has liberally oaked flavors of blackberry jam, black currant, dark chocolate and anise. It shows Napa Valley pedigree, but it's tannic now, with mouth-numbing astringency. Try holding this until 2016, then give it a decanting.",90,Napa Angel by Montes 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Rose and turned earth notes mark the entry of this concentrated, tannic wine. Robust strawberry and black cherry flavors fill it out, wrapped in toasted oak.",87,Concannon 2015 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Underbrush, new leather, menthol, culinary spice, dark fruit and toast aromas take center stage in this wine.

Drink 2023–2033.",92,Batasiolo 2013 Boscareto  (Barolo),,,,

"This full-bodied Barbera's especially dark, opaque color is difficult to miss, and its aromas are equally intense.

Although dry, it's ripe to the extreme and structured with moderate tannins.",89,Las Positas 2013 Estate Barbera (Livermore Valley),,,,
"Made from old vines, this ripe and concentrated wine is smooth and creamy. Good acidity balances the rich fruits, giving flavors of apples, pears and apricots cut by a line of citrus.

"Bracing and fresh, this crisp, red-berried Pinot Noir boasts an invigorating mineral sheen. It's a spry, slightly lean wine but framed elegantly with fine, feathery tannins. Drink now through 2018.",89,Grafen Neipperg 2013 Trocken Spätburgunder (Württemberg),,,,

"Shows the briary, scoury mouthfeel that so often characterizes Dry Creek Valley red wines, as opposed to the smooth lushness of neighboring Napa Valley. The flavors are just fine, of wild blackberries, cherries and cola. Drink over the next six years.",87,Rued 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Structured, with years to go to take on added complexity and personality, this wine is also a study in immediate gratification, as it's presently so juicy and easy to enjoy.

The oak and tannin are fully in sync, while a salty, meaty finish provides additional decadence.",98,Wayfarer 2014 The Traveler Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),,,,
"The aromas explode with notes of potpourri, olive, smoked meat, fire pit, orange peel, mineral, mushroom, garrigue and white pepper.

It's shockingly good.",95,Horsepower 2014 Sur Echalas Vineyard Grenache (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),,,,

"Tulpen's 2009 Cabernet moves the fruit sources to a trio of Walla Walla vineyards, notably Tokar and Heather Hill, to good effect.

The tannins are firm and astringent, leaving just a bare suggestion of ripe raisins in the finish.",91,Tulpen 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"A terrific Syrah that's dry and as smooth as velvet. It's elegant on the palate with complex, tantalizing flavors of ripe black and blue berries and stone fruits, smoked meat, black pepper and cedar.

"Racy and deeply mineral, yet buoyantly fruity, this wine embodies the best from the Mosel's fantastic 2015 vintage. It's lavishly forward in ripe yellow peach, apricot and honeydew flavors, yet bracingly high in acidity. Satisfyingly rich in extract yet feather light, it finishes long, with shards of slate and crushed mineral. Stunning already, it should continue to improve through 2030, likely beyond.",95,Egon Müller 2015 Scharzhofberger Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Dry focused aromas of spiced apple are fairly classy. This has a bready smooth mouthfeel with substantial malic cut. Full dynamic flavors of nectarine, apple and citrus turn slight bitter before a layered long palate.",89,Ruca Malen NV Brut  (Uco Valley),,,,
"These 15-year-old vines deliver additional complexity, further enhanced by native yeast fermentation. This is a delicate wine, but not a wimpy one. Tart berry and cranberry fruit carries a taste of toasted grain as it does a graceful fade through the finish. Give it plenty of air and it really opens up! Drink now through 2022.",92,Vidon Vineyard 2014 Brigita Clone 777 Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),,,,

"You want decadence, opulence and fabulosity in your Chardonnay? This one's for you. It's tremendous in ripe pineapple, pear, peach, mango, lime, tangerine and papaya flavors. So much fruit, while the oak application is never heavy handed, applying just the right touch of buttered toast. Where does all that vanilla honey come from? A magnificent example of a first-growth California Chardonnay, at a great price.",96,Foxen 2010 Block UU Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"A young, plummy Zin that's lightly sweet, with blackberry jam, vanilla and caramel notes.",84,Salvatore Principe 2010 Blue Groove Zinfandel (Lodi),,,,
"Perfumed berry, iris, rose, sweet baking spice aromas and a whiff of balsam lead the nose. The ripe, full-bodied palate offers wild cherry, fleshy raspberry, tobacco, toast, mocha and cinnamon alongside a tannic backbone and nervous acidity. The heat of evident alcohol closes the finish but doesn't dominate. Drink 2018–2026.",92,Abbona Marziano 2011 Ravera  (Barolo),,,,
"Creamy wood aromas are prominent in this ripe, yellow-fruit-flavored wine. A rich, textured character hints at minerality while bringing out fresh fruit and acidity. It is ready to drink, although some of the bursting acidity will calm down by late 2016.",89,Château de Santenay 2013  Mercurey,,,,
"This is a spectacular expression of Barbera with soft layers of black cherry, chocolate, spice and crushed clove. It's long, soft, opulent and generous on the close.",91,Ca' Viola 2008 Bric du Luv  (Barbera d'Alba),,,,

"Barbera grapes from a Lake Chelan vineyard are blended with 25% Sangiovese from the Yakima Valley. It's an interesting wine, with pretty strawberry fruit, tart acidity and a wall of tannin that cuts it short. The components are starkly apparent, but with time may ultimately blend into a more seamless expression of what seems to be good fruit.",87,Patterson 2009 Barbera (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A creamy nose shows spikes of green freshness, reminiscent of fern or ivy. The palate holds peppery, citrusy spray with creamy generosity while white pepper and ripe pear appear at the seams.

"Casey McClellan blended 15% Merlot into this vintage—the most ever—and has crafted a bright, sappy wine with vivid flavors of spiced apples and raspberries.

Thoroughly delicious and surprisingly deep in this lighter vintage.",91,Seven Hills 2011 Malbec (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Cherry, spicebox, pepper and some vegetal aromas are followed by flavors of blueberry, toast and cherry. This is an approachable Greek red with bright fruit and good acidity.

"Plump plum, blackberry and a bit of Christmas spice show on the fairly reserved and simple nose of this twist-top table wine. Tangy acidity enlivens the palate's dark red fruit, with a touch of oregano to add some nuance.",87,Testarossa 2014 Cuvée Los Gatos Rob's Red (Central Coast),,,,
"Shy aromas of crisp yellow apple and brown sugar follow up on the palate, with compelling hints of orange blossom along the way. Quaffable and likable, it's made from 100% Chardonnay and finishes mellow and refined.",90,Gloria Ferrer NV Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (Carneros),,,,
"Generous black plum, dried purple flowers, sweet raisin and sarsaparilla spice show on the nose of this bottling. The flavors are rich and full with bright red plum and strawberry, but there is a rocky core and pinch of oregano as well.",87,Vintage Cowboy 2014 Estate Zinfandel (San Luis Obispo County),,,,
"This wine is made from a mix of 13 different grape varieties in a field blend. It's a totally terroir driven wine, full of mineral and gritty textures in its youth. Behind this structure is a wild range of flavors—spice, apples, pears and apricots—waiting to show through. It needs to age, so drink from 2016.",94,Domaine Marcel Deiss 2011 White (Alsace),,,,
"There's tremendous value in this well-made wine. It's savory in its mix of dried herb and plum notes, with smooth, softened tannins and judicious use of oak that lends richness to the palate. It'll appeal broadly.",90,Kendall-Jackson 2013 Vintner's Reserve Merlot (Sonoma County),,,,
"This lovely metodo classico sparkling wine is made entirely from Chardonnay grapes. It has a creamy texture that delivers sensations of peach and honey, with notes of cream-filled pastries and almond. It finishes crisp and clean.",91,Rotari 2005 Flavio Riserva Chardonnay (Trento),,,,
"Golden honey in color and tone, this white is nonetheless crisp, adorned in orange blossom and a taste of white peach, the minerality never in question. Half of the fruit is estate grown, with 8% Marsanne blended in.",88,Mounts 2013 Viognier (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"This powerful, savory bottling named for the two generations behind the family winery opens with toasted barrel and meat aromas before expanding on the nose and palate with additional black pepper and soy components. The fruit is distinctly spicy—a mix of blackberry, clove and cinnamon.",94,Shafer 2014 One Point Five Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),,,,
"Rubbery, gaseous initial aromas give way to piquant red-fruit notes. This feels lean, racy and very high in acidity. Limited flavors of currant, tomato and salty red plum finish with herbal notes and persistent saltiness as well as abrasive acidity.",87,Altos Las Hormigas 2013 Appellation Gualtallary Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"This is an opulent, rich wine that is full of black plums, powerful tannins and spice. Mourvèdre dominates the palate with its power and exotic aroma, but bright acidity guides a long finish. Still young, it needs several years to develop, so drink from 2016.",93,La Bastide Blanche 2010 Mourvèdre (Bandol),,,,
"This is a luxuriously layered and complex white. It's an expertly rendered combination of ripe, rich fruit—most notably spicy apple and pear—that's completely uplifted by bright acidity and a refreshing mouthfeel. Still youthful, it's both vibrant and nuanced.",92,Neyers 2014 Chardonnay (Carneros),,,,
"Blossoms and yellow cherries lend a sweet floral flair on the nose of this dry Riesling. It's straightforward in style, but quaffable and refreshing, with flavors of fresh apple and pear that finish crisp and clean.",86,Lamoreaux Landing 2013 Yellow Dog Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes),,,,
"From Draper clone vines planted in 1965, this bright gold-hued wine brings myriad details to its apple, jicama, white peach and nut oil flavors. A whiff of smoke carries throughout, and its sheer complexity strains the vocabulary. Stay with it as more subtle layers unfold. Though seductive now, it should mature well through 2030.",95,The Eyrie Vineyards 2015 Original Vines Chardonnay (Dundee Hills),,,,
"A selection of the best lots of wine from the 2011 vintage, this is a blend of Aragonez and Alicante Bouschet. Wood aging has given this rich wine a smooth and creamy texture, offering an opulent companion to the dense black fruits and acidity. It is a powerful wine, although not showing its high alcohol because of the fresh aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",94,Herdade de São Miguel 2011 Private Collection Red (Alentejano),,,,
"Tomero is a new line from the Carlos Pulenta group, and this one sings the tale of Salta with sincerity. You get telling acacia and lychee aromas, but none of the cheap perfume that can sometimes ruin the variety. The palate is lightly oily but linear, while the papaya, citrus and melon flavors just roll along.",89,Tomero 2007 Torrontés (Salta),,,,
"Earthy aromas suggest tilled soil, savory herb, leather, dried rose and a whiff of game. The bright palate offers crushed cherry, black raspberry, savory herb and white pepper alongside polished tannins. It's well balanced and fresh. A licorice note signals the close.",92,Col d'Orcia 2010  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Made off-dry, with a sugary edge to the citrus, apple and flower flavors. The acidity is tingly. Okay for an everyday sipper if you like your white wines sweet.",83,Loredona 2009 Riesling (Monterey),,,,
"This is an attractive light and fruity wine. It has fresh fruit flavors, with notes of crisp citrus and green apple. A touch of vanilla and a smooth texture surface as it opens up.",86,Pascal Bouchard 2011 Le Classique  (Chablis),,,,
"Hints of lemon shortbread, fresh apple and white flower unfold on the nose of this delicately honeyed wine. On the palate, sweet white-peach and yellow-cherry flavors run just a shade off dry. Easy going and fresh, it finishes long, with a streak of tangerine acidity.",89,Bischöfliche Weingüter Trier 2015 Dom Off-Dry Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Black-currant fruit and attractive acidity are layered with ripe, dark tannins and concentration. The potential is there, although it is likely be over the short term. Drink from 2018.",90,Château Gruaud Larose 2013  Saint-Julien,,,,
"The aromas are of dark honey—there's almost a roasted quality to them that verges on caramel. The flavors follow in a similar vein, suggesting roasted pineapple and caramelized peach, while the mouthfeel is pleasantly rich and filling.",88,Maximin Grünhäuser 2006 Abtsberg Auslese Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer),,,,
"Grassy, lightly weedy aromas set up a palate with sweet citrus and melony flavors. This is sticky and a touch mealy come finishing time, with a fleshy, unctuous feel and only modest structure and acidity.",85,Santa Julia 2013 Tardío Late Harvest Torrontés (Mendoza),,,,
"This is always a gigantic wine, and its success depends on technically balancing its various parts. The 2010 delivers the usual richness, with vast, deep fruit, mineral, oak and leesy flavors. It's as full bodied as a red wine, but a little heavy for a Chardonnay. Not an ager, it's best enjoyed now with the richest Chardonnay-friendly dishes.",90,Pride Mountain 2010 Vintner Select Chardonnay (Sonoma County),,,,
"This annually anticipated bottling offers a blend of Doug Margerum's top barrels from a variety of vineyards. In this vintage, aromas of baking spice and red fruit come with minty sagebrush lift. Herbs, from oregano to dried thyme, play a central role on the palate, with red cherry fruit and a tighter, tart plum skin finish, proving slightly lighter in style.",92,Margerum 2012 Über Syrah (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Beautifully shaped and full bodied, this offers opulent ripe fruit aromas and rich, luxurious texture. Substantial concentrated flavors suggest dark cherry, clove and blackberry. There are no sharp edges yet the wine has firm tannins and a sense of good balance despite its weight.",92,Black Kite 2012 Angel Hawk Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),,,,
"This nose features much more nuance than a typical Sauvignon Blanc, with chalky minerality, bright stone fruit and barely ripe tropicality. It's a bit tight at first on the palate, but poached pear and papaya flavors emerge, then open to candied guava in the midpalate.",88,Eight Sides 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Coast),,,,
"Biodynamically farmed, this young vineyard seems to improve with each new vintage. More and more you find an expression of soil details—delicate streaks of dried leaf, moist loam, a flavor of clay. The fruit is refined and perfectly ripe, without being fleshy. An elegant style, cellar-worthy but delicious already.",92,Sineann 2009 Schindler Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Nothing on the bottle says this is oaked, but this Albariño smells like burnt plywood and sawdust. It's chunky and fat on the palate, with woody melony flavors that finish salty and dried out.",83,Abadía de Tortoreos 2013 Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"This blend of Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Merlot has aromas of cherry, vanilla and a whiff of lifted eucalyptus. It conveys flavors of black cherry, red plum and dried herbs. Medium bodied, it has a persistent finish.",89,Budureasca 2013 Origini Reserve Red (Dealu Mare),,,,
"Dark, ripe, tarry aromas announce a macho Malbec. This is jammy and pulpy in texture, with more than enough extraction. Herbal, woodsy black-fruit flavors are supported by an oaky, resiny finish with black-pepper spice notes. Drink through 2018.",89,Matias Riccitelli 2014 Hey Malbec Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Herbal scents of briary berry and forest floor mingle with notes of mulled boysenberry, raspberry, sweet smoke and cured meat. The finish is dry and gripping, with a peppery note that stays through the close.",88,Backsberg 2008 Pumphouse Shiraz (Coastal Region),,,,
"94-96 Barrel sample. Lots of new wood here, maybe too dominant. But it is a stage, because the fruit weight is also there to give a wine of considerable complexity, dry and solid.",95,Château Langoa Barton 2009 Barrel sample  (Saint-Julien),,,,
"Lots of ripe, lush blackberry and cherry jam, mocha and cassis liqueur flavors in this full-bodied Cab. Tastes younger than it really is, with some brisk acids and firm tannins. Give it another 3–4 years in the cellar to let the parts continue to evolve.",89,Stryker Sonoma 2007 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"This is a surprisingly bright and enticing wine, with forward scents of red apple and orange that are laced with notes of wood and baking spice. The palate is rich and creamy, but not overly so, with good acidic cut to the lingering flavors of wood-grilled apple and peach. Drink now–2019.",91,Thelema 2014 Chardonnay (Stellenbosch),,,,
"Honeydew and lychee aromas abound on this very pretty wine. A bit of spice offsets delicate sweetness, and a strike of lemon-lime acidity shines through the finish.",87,Villa Wolf 2013 Gewürztraminer (Pfalz),,,,
"A terrifically flamboyant wine, filled with jazzy flavors that impress for their sheer hedonism. Peaches and pears veer way over to tropical fruits, and there's a lot of oak and lees to boot. The rich, creamy texture leads to a long, spicy finish in this young, delicious wine.",91,Kunde 2000 Reserve Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"Moderate in structure, full bodied and ripe, this wine is tightly wound in firm, strong tannin. Light flavors of cherry and orange integrate spiky accents of clove, tea and dried herb.",90,Roger Roessler 2015 Lennox Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"A barrel-fermented white Pinot Noir, this is bursting with broad, creamy flavors of ripe caramel-dipped apples and fresh pear. It might be mistaken for Chardonnay, except for the extra weight that carries through the lengthy finish. Though it's tempting to describe white Pinot Noirs as sparkling wines without the sparkle, this is much more interesting, and one of the rare examples that defines both a style and a standard for the rest.",94,Domaine Serene 2014 Coeur Blanc Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Made in a fruit-driven style with an undercurrent of stony minerality, this medium-bodied blend of Grenache Blanc and Roussanne hints at pear and citrus. Drink now.",87,Château de Nages 2008 Réserve White (Costières de Nîmes),,,,
"This is an open, soft, ripe and fruity wine. With a finely integrated tannic structure and plenty of red fruits and acidity, it is a generous full wine that is ready to drink.",87,Casa Santos Lima 2014 Lab Reserva Red (Lisboa),,,,
"Verve continues to rock with their new Syrah. Fire up the barbie with steak or pork chops to eat with this lusty, full-bodied red wine. It's dry and tannic, with rich, complex flavors of blackberries, black currants, pepper and a sweet, salty meaty note, like the char on a broiled steak.",92,Verve 2006 Syrah (Sonoma Mountain),,,,
"Pungent and snappy up front, with grapefruit and nettle aromas, this is classic Leyda Sauvignon Blanc on the bouquet. On the palate, this is fresh, juicy and upright. Well-cut flavors of green pea, lime and tangerine finish pithy and firm.",89,San Pedro 2013 1865 Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),,,,
"Feels sturdy and properly acidic, with melon, papaya and apple flavors running alongside almondy bitterness. Simple and quick on the finish; 60% Xarel-lo and 40% Chardonnay.",86,Albet I Noya 2010 Petit Albet Made with Organic Grapes Chardonnay-Xarel-lo White (Penedès),,,,
"A thick and chewy blend of Corvina, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is thickly extracted and bold in style, with a dark, inky color and loads of jammy black fruit. Aged for two years in oak, it shows a succulent sweetness on the long, velvety finish.",88,Fabiano 2007 Vajo Red (Rosso del Veronese),,,,
"This small-production Cava from Muga in Rioja is elegant, lemony and tight as a drum. Aromas of apple, lime and yeast set up an acidic palate with modest lemon and apple flavors and a linear, focused feel. Finishes with zest and kick.",87,Muga NV Conde de Haro Brut Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"From the cool-climate Beckstoffer Lake Carneros vineyard site, this wine opens in a thickness of blue and red berries, the tannins soft and integrated yet weighted by a puckering persistence to the palate. Dried herb and cedar round out the highly full-bodied, ripe finish.",89,World's End 2013 Little Sister Reserve Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"Round and fruity, this is a crisp and pure wine. It has a straight line of acidity that cuts through the green apple and citrus fruits. The zesty texture dances on the palate.",88,Damien et Romain Bouchard 2010 Broc de Biques  (Chablis),,,,
"This appellation blend is a great introduction to the winery's style. It offers hibiscus, shiitake mushroom, cinnamon stick and sagebrush on the nose and is bright yet smoky on the palate, recalling roasted pork, cranberry sauce and earthy, meaty flavors.",91,Kynsi 2013 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),,,,
"Blackberry and boysenberry flavors so ripe they seem sweet fill out this smooth, full-bodied wine. The texture is soft and not at all tannic, letting the potent fruit flavors flow easily through the finish.",87,Great American Wine Company 2013 Zinfandel (California),,,,
"This 100% Albariño from Ribeiro shows light orange blossom aromas. It's chunky and almost chewy, with lightly pithy citrus flavors and roundness to the palate. Finishes a touch pithy and bitter, with white pepper notes. May already be starting to fade; drink right away.",87,Coto de Gomariz 2010 X Albariño (Ribeiro),,,,
"Very citrusy aromas of fresh squeezed lemons grow rounder with pear and nectarine flesh, all cut by a white rock minerality, without many of the typical grassy notes. The palate is very tight with lime juice and green apples, and driven by chalky grip and vibrant acidity.",88,Baehner Fournier 2013 Vogelzang Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),,,,
"Boysenberries and olallieberries explode on the nose of this bottling by the ever-adventurous Riboli family, bolstered by dried tarragon and turned earth. It is wondrously smooth and silky on the sip, with rising blueberry fruit and tons of depth, offering dried sage and other roasting herbs as well as dark chocolate and espresso flavors.",93,Opaque 2011 Malbec (Paso Robles),,,,
"Vibrant and racy, this Chard's bright acidity boosts and brightens the lime, pineapple, Meyer lemon and vanilla flavors. Try with grilled salmon with a tropical fruit salsa topping.",85,Claiborne & Churchill 2006 Chardonnay (Edna Valley),,,,
"Creamy, almost powdery pear flavors dominate, but the palate is illuminated by bright, sprightly lemon acidity. There is an innate balance that can be summed up as creamy lemon on a dry, yeasty background. This is moreish, appetizing and has a lasting, fruity finish.",89,Lucien Albrecht NV Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),,,,
"Made from 100% Cab Franc, this is a soft, rather one-dimensional wine. It has complex flavors of cherries, red currants, cola, white pepper and herbs, but is short on structure and interest. Drink now.",86,Boëté 2009 Saunders Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Franc (Carmel Valley),,,,
"Compared to the Mazzoni, this baby has less fruity but pepperier, earthier aromas, and herbal ones, too: licorice and chocolate, although there’s some deeply scented blackberry. It seems crisper and more angular, and more tannic, with a great hidden depth of fruit that needs to be coaxed out through short-term aging.",88,Kenwood 1997 Nuns Canyon Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"Oaky bacon and barbecue smoke make for a burly wine-drinking experience in this full-bodied, expressive and somewhat heavy offering from the Dry Creek winery's estate.",85,Fritz 2013 Estate Grown Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Here's an excellent value from Central Italy. This plush and rich Montepulciano shows soft fruit and cherry surrounded by very spicy and savory notes of nutmeg, cardomam and turmeric. It would pair nicely with meat sauce, ground beef or meatloaf.",87,Talamonti 2011 Modà  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),,,,
"The purest Cabernet Sauvignon fruit, with dark chocolate and intense dark berry flavors. The tannins are so enveloped by the fruit and yet they promise great aging. At this stage, wood shows through the fruit, but the texture is so rich and opulent that it should easily become integrated.",96,Château Mouton Rothschild 2009  Pauillac,,,,
"Too soft for comfort, and too sweet, although the softness may exaggerate the true sugar content. Either way, this simple wine has cloying, candied blackberry and mocha flavors.",83,Herzog 2008 Special Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Rubbery, generic berry and red-fruit aromas are decent, nothing more. This Garnacha-Tempranillo blend feels fresh, lean and wiry, with raw flavors of plum and red-berry fruits. A high-toned racy finish is the opposite of plush.",86,Viña Herminia 2014 Excelsus  (Rioja),,,,
"A mix of raisin and tomato on the bouquet is touched up by spice notes. This has a medium-weight body and hard tannins in front of live-wire plum, raspberry and mild herbal flavors. A spicy, lengthy finish is just right for Rioja gran reserva, and this still has time left on the clock, so drink now or hold through 2020.",91,Finca del Marquesado 2004 Gran Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"Raspberry and cherry aromas are mild while not stirring much excitement. This feels a bit raw and tannic, but it's got enough body to hold up. Berry and plum flavors finish with hints of spice and chocolate.",87,Piattelli 2012 Premium Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Luján de Cuyo),,,,
"This shows the Diamond Creek signature of dryness, mountain tannins and voluptuously ripe, concentrated fruit. It's dense in blackberry jam and cassis flavors, with firm minerality and a lush toast note from the oak. Near perfection in all of its parts, it possesses those hard-to-define qualities of balance and elegance. Wonderful as it is now, the tannins suggest aging it for many years.",96,Diamond Creek 2009 Volcanic Hill Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),,,,
"Fragrant and floral, with a bright golden color, this expression of Insolia shows a rich, creamy mouthfeel, with orange blossom and candied lemon flavors.",87,Valle dell'Acate 2011 Insolia (Vittoria),,,,
"The veteran San Luis Obispo-based winemaker heads south to the historic vineyard to produce this wine. A wildly dynamic nose suggests unripe lemon skin, pencil lead, oak and smoky wisps of a beach campfire. The woody, cedar element—though not really oaky—provides an intriguing palate of pencil shavings, green pear skins and lime pith.",92,Stephen Ross 2013 Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"A Bordeaux-style blend of Cabernet, Malbec and Merlot, this bright and grapy effort pleasingly integrates slightly rougher notes of earth, leaf and stem. It all works here, adding texture and detail to the tart berry fruits. Drink in the next 3–5 years.",90,Adamant Cellars 2008 Nalin Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This wine hits the palate with authority, showing pretty black-cherry and cassis flavors, and soft, slightly leathery, drying tannins. The well-structured Red Mountain fruit has the potential to age well for a decade or more.",90,Obelisco Estate 2009 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),,,,
"A mix of 70% Sangiovese and other international red grapes, this would pair well with pizza or pasta with meat ragù. It shows flavors of cherry, forest berry, cola, almond and a touch of mild tobacco.",87,Carpineto 2011 Dogajolo Red (Toscana),,,,
"This '07 is a bit tired already, with a muted nose offering up subtle hints of strawberry hull and peach fuzz. The mouth offers a bit more by way of red currant, rhubarb and limey citrus notes. The finish, though a bit tart, is crisp and clean.",83,Petit Bistro 2007 Rosé (Vin de Pays d'Oc),,,,
"This mature Primitivo from the Salento area of Southern Italy offers plump notes of black cherry, raspberry jam and dried figs. The mouthfeel is chewy and soft with a velvety, chewy finish.",86,Cantele 2006 Primitivo (Salento),,,,
"This impressive wine is full bodied, round and dusty in texture, filled with deep cherry fruit and dark chocolate notes. It finishes long and softly tannic. Drink now–2025.",92,Clos Henri 2013 Pinot Noir (Marlborough),,,,
"Aromas suggest crushed blue flower, tilled soil, spice and perfumed berries. The savory palate delivers ripe black cherry and wild raspberry alongside notes of clove. Supple and smooth, it will offer easy drinking enjoyment now through 2016.",90,Brezza 2012 Vigna Santa Rosalia  (Nebbiolo d'Alba),,,,
This bold and fruity rosé carries scents and flavors of cherry candy. It's a fine bottle for chilling and sharing with summer picnic foods.,86,Del Rio 2014 Rosé (Rogue Valley),,,,
"A single-vineyard blend of Touriga Nacional and Merlot, this is a supremely dense wine. It is dark, almost black in color, concentrated both from rich tannins and wood aging. Its dark color is replicated in the dense dark character of the wine and its powerful fruits. Age this wine, don't drink before 2020.",92,J. Portugal Ramos 2015 Quinta da Viçosa TM Red (Alentejano),,,,
"Youthful tannins and ageability always characterize this Cab, which contains a splash of Syrah. Like its predecessors, it's very dry, with herb-infused cherry and currant flavors, and new oak plays only a supporting role. It's really an elegant wine and a great value at this price.",91,Geyser Peak 2005 Block Collection Walking Tree Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"There is a touch of earthiness typical of Menetou-Salon in this wine. It brings out gooseberry, catty flavors as well as swathes of citrus. Very crisp, this is a wine that could do with a year to round out.",87,Fournier Père et Fils 2012 Côtes des Morogues  (Menetou-Salon),,,,
"Earthy aromas lead to a wine that is at a stage of development that suppresses fruit. The wood aging and the extracted structure are still strong. Hints of juicy black fruits emerge, promising a good, if tannic future. Wait until 2017.",85,Château de Sours 2011 La Fleur d'Amélie  (Bordeaux),,,,
"Soft and fruity, this is a generous, ripe wine that's full of juicy red-cherry fruits and gentle tannins. It has some richness, giving a sweet character to this open, ready-to-drink wine.",86,Vignerons de Bel Air 2011 Eté Indien  (Brouilly),,,,
"Very fragrant and floral, this fun Prosecco (closed with a string instead of a capsule) offers aromas of sweet fruit and honeysuckle. The wine is simple, clean, crisp and ends with bright peach flavors.",84,Lisabella NV Gran Resèe Prosecco (Colli Trevigiani),,,,
"Zesty pepper and herb aromas accent this elegant but fruity Pinot Noir. Tart red cherry and berry flavors are crisply concentrated, fringed by fine tannins and a lingering murmur of briar wood. Drink now through 2019.",89,Villa Wolf 2014 Pinot Noir (Pfalz),,,,
"This wine seems fruity, sweet and pure, with wonderfully bracing acidity and gentle tannins. The mouthfeel is light and graceful. Its notes of raspberry and smoky oak make it amazingly drinkable.",93,Flowers 2010 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Bruna Grimaldi and her family present a delicious wine with bright spice and crisp fruit backed by a very distinct note of sweet marzipan. Balsam endnotes of rosemary, ginger and cola give the wine lift and buoyancy on the finish.",92,Grimaldi Bruna 2008 Bricco Ambrogio  (Barolo),,,,
"This offers aromas of red berry, leafy underbrush and a whiff of chopped mint. The juicy palate delivers succulent black cherry, orange zest and ground pepper alongside sleek tannins.",89,Mirafiore 2015  Barbera d'Alba Superiore,,,,
"Unusually complex for a rosé, this medium- to full-bodied wine offers a mix of red berries and melon, hints of cinnamon and clove, richness reminiscent of white chocolate and even a tinge of mocha on the lengthy finish. Drink now–2018.",92,Château la Genestière 2016  Tavel,,,,
"This estate wine, originating from the vineyards that has been in the Queyrens family for more than 50 years, offers plenty of fruit here. The taste laces acidity and attractive black-currant flavors. There are tannins and a structure that will allow the wine to develop. Drink from 2018.",87,Château Pilet 2015  Bordeaux,,,,
"A powerful spice rack of mace, allspice and cinnamon stick coat aromas of roasted tomatoes on this wine from the longtime Alsatian-focused producer. The flavors come and go quickly, but feature orange peel-driven acidity, squeezed plum fruit and cranberry juice.",89,Claiborne & Churchill 2012 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),,,,
"Vanilla, clove, baking spice and dark fruit aromas lead to a palate plush with full ripe generous fruit and barrel flavors. It's a hedonistic delight, with the barrel influence playing a prominent role.",90,Fielding Hills 2013 Estate Riverbend Vineyard Syrah (Wahluke Slope),,,,
Wiry red-berry aromas are lean and stalky smelling. This feels tight with little excess weight or body. Flavors of peppery red fruits come with a broadside shot of oak in front of a short finish.,85,Finca Flichman 2012 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"The aroma says wood, and that's what the taste confirms. To go with the wood, there is rounded apricot and peach-flavored fruit, open and rich. The wine has a youthful taut edge, finishing with the greatest acidity.",90,Domaine du Chalet Pouilly 2007  Pouilly-Fuissé,,,,
"Sipping this recalls biting into a ripe, sharp and crisp Cox Orange Pippin apple: juiciness, freshness and crunchy texture. With time, fresh orange peel joins the aromatic fray, while the palate stays exquisitely fresh and totally balanced. This is utterly appetizing and moreish with lots of verve and bouncy joy. A super-clean finish.",93,Hirsch 2013 Heiligenstein Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),,,,
"Winemaker Kim Crawford has turned out a solid effort, ably combining the brash fruit of Central Otago with some measure of finesse. Smoky, campfire-like notes, roasted beets and greens accent black cherry and plum flavors. It's still a bit crisp and edgy on the finish, but look for the texture to smooth out by the end of 2016.",90,Loveblock 2012 Pinot Noir (Central Otago),,,,
"This is a soft, easy Cabernet, with a gentle mouthfeel and forward blackberry, currant and chocolate flavors. It's not terribly complicated, but it is sweet and clean. Drink now.",86,J. Lohr 2008 Hilltop Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"This wine needs to be decanted. At first the scents and flavors of green produce abound, and the fruit is masked. After some hours, it begins to show more fruit and less of the vegetal flavors, but remains a bit sharp and short.",86,Helix by Reininger 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Crusty on the nose, this has an asphalt note that transitions into hard spice and sour berry notes. It has flavors of creamy, minty oak and medicinal berry fruit. A lasting flavor of oak-driven spice and a hint of green carry some heat.",83,oops 2011 Red (Central Valley),,,,
"Deeply flavored in raspberries, cherries, red licorice and exotic dusty spices, this Pinot Noir has a tannin-acid tightness that makes it aloof and hard. Although it's dry, it's so rich in fruit, it tastes sweet. A very fine wine, but needs some time to come around. Give it four or five years to mellow.",92,Matrix 2009 Reserve Nunes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"New leather, mature black-skinned fruit, tilled soil and a touch of dark spice are some of the aromas you'll find on this fantastic, full-bodied red. The big, velvety palate shows power and finesse, offering mouthfuls of juicy wild cherry, black raspberry, licorice, Mediterranean herb and a note of exotic spice framed in firm, ripe tannins. It's already balanced and delicious, but hold for more complexity. Drink 2020–2035.",98,Baricci 2010 Nello Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"Uniquely sea-salty aromas of kelp mesh with sharp Italian herbs and heavily spiced cherry on the nose of this wine from a vineyard at the western edge of the Sta. Rita Hills. Flavors range from raspberry and tart cranberry to clove, cardamom and espresso.",92,La Montagne 2012 Bouna Terra Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Plump melon and stone fruit aromas are a touch broken down and mealy. This Godello feels fleshy and round, with pulpy weight. Tangerine and tropical fruit flavors weigh in on the heavy side, while the finish is chunky and pithy in flavor.",85,Alvarez de Toledo 2013 Godello (Bierzo),,,,
"Initially earthy aromas give way to red fruits. The wine follows the same pattern, the barnyard flavors opening out with the ripe red plum and strawberry fruits. There is a delicious richness here, balanced with acidity and firm tannins.",92,Pierre Morey 2005 Santenots Premier Cru  (Volnay),,,,
"There's an earthy, leathery feel to this wine that recalls button mushroom, forest floor and dried rose petal. It shows an informal, compact disposition in the mouth.",83,Giuseppe Lonardi 2010  Valpolicella Classico,,,,
"Cherries and chocolate are the hallmark of the Zins at Maryhill. The fruit is pretty and the chocolate smooth, certainly a crowd-pleasing style. The finish is clean and supple.",87,Maryhill 2009 Proprietor's Reserve Zinfandel (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This dark, almost black-colored blend combines Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca and Syrah. They all come together in a rich, powerful palate full of explosive black fruit and fine, focused acidity. The structure shows that the wine needs to age further. Drink from 2020.",93,Casa Agricola Alexandre Relvas 2014 Herdade da Pimenta Grand Escolha Red (Alentejano),,,,
"Gold shows unexpected sophistication for the otherwise overtly bold and gregarious Sagrantino grape. Those prickly tannins you recognize from the variety are wrapped by layers of spice, cured meat and dried berry fruit.",91,Còlpetrone 2006 Gold  (Montefalco Sagrantino),,,,
"Fragrant and fresh, this opens with aromas of violets, perfumed berries and black spices. The juicy palate delivers dark cherry, crushed raspberry and cinnamon alongside supple tannins. Its easygoing nature makes it perfect for everyday enjoyment.",88,Banfi 2012  Rosso di Montalcino,,,,
"This pretty Chardonnay from Sicily (that sees six months in oak) delivers notes of apricot, banana, peach and a touch of playful exotic spice in the background. The wine is well-made and approachable and would pair beautifully with roasted eggplant and basil or fragrant Asian foods.",88,Cusumano 2007 Jalé Chardonnay (Sicilia),,,,
"Creamier and richer than you'd expect at such a low price, this easy-drinking Chardonnay offers aromas of peach, vanilla, pineapple and coconut butter. Indian or Vietnamese food would make a good match.",85,Di Lenardo 2010 Vigneto Vigne da Lis Maris Chardonnay (Venezia Giulia),,,,
"Aromas of peach pit, dried almond skins and white pineapple are on the raw side, while the palate on this Viognier-heavy blend is waxy yet citric. Flavors of white grapefruit and lemon are pithy, and finish with bitter almond flavors.",82,Estampa 2013 Estate Viognier-Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"Full and complex, this Syrah-dominated Rhône-style blend includes Grenache and Mourvèdre, and it's cofermented with a splash of Viognier. The luscious cranberry and raspberry flavors are annotated with citrus, red licorice and wet stone accents. Suggestions of tropical fruits, such as papaya and pineapple, add more interest.",91,Rasa 2009 QED Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This Primitivo opens with inviting peppery aromas, followed by bright fruit and spice overtones, along with a nice bead of acidity throughout. A good pizza and lasagna wine.",88,Brutocao 2010 Contento Vineyard Primitivo (Mendocino),,,,
"This wine is all fruit that has some age to give it richness, with a high dosage that adds soft texture. The result is a balanced, smooth and very drinkable wine. Floral aromas and a spicy character bring out the final acidity. The bottling is ready to drink.",89,Chassenay d'Arce NV Cuvée Première Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"Blended from several popular grape varieties, this wine tastes a tad tired and oxidized. The citrus and tropical fruit flavors are beginning to turn dried out and sherried. Drink up.",82,San Antonio 2011 Heritage Blanc Vintage White (Central Coast),,,,
"A bit too vegetal, balancing asparagus notes with just enough grapefruit flavors to keep a modicum of balance. Tart on the finish.",83,Barker's Marque 2007 ranga.ranga. Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
This is fashioned from a single clone and sourced from a single block of the estate vineyard. Peppery berry fruit is focused and concentrated. The length and overall precision and power suggest that further development in the bottle will continue to add complexity.,89,Cardwell Hill 2012 Pommard Block Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"A very dry, crisp white wine with a neutral color and equally neutral aromas and flavors. It's lean, green apple-driven and fresh, but not what you'd call loaded with personality. Cleanses the palate and washes things down, but does so quietly.",84,Elki 2009 Vinas Viejas Pedro Ximénez (Elqui Valley),,,,
"A rich and full-boded white blended from Sauvignon Blanc and Inzolia, the Nozze d'Oro begins with lightly buttery aromas of passionfruit, before developing melon and peach flavors in the mouth. Finishes long, with a refreshing note of bitter almond.",90,Tasca d'Almerita 2000 Nozze d'Oro White (Sicilia),,,,
"The flint soil of the Fiou domaine has given a magnificent rich wine. Yellow fruits, ripe citrus and beautifully perfumed acidity all contribute to a wine that is packed with flavor. The fruit is still crisply fresh and the mineral texture from the soil shows how well it will age. Drink from 2017.",93,Domaine Gérard Fiou 2012 Le Grand Roc  (Sancerre),,,,
"A compelling mix of cherry, plum and spicy aromas spell out Cabernet Sauvignon in block letters. This feels full, but also juicy, fresh and agile. Core berry flavors are lightly toasted and chocolaty, with coffee and lingering spice notes aiding a well-comported finish.",90,Bodegas Fabre 2014 Phebus Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Patagonia),,,,
"Rina Ianca (a blend of Grillo and Viognier) is a beautiful wine with good complexity and character. The emphasis here is on aromas of peach, almond blossom, white mineral and creamy vanilla and the mouthfeel offers both density and persistency.",87,Feudo di Santa Tresa 2007 Rina Ianca White (Sicilia),,,,
"The vineyard is in a cool area of this sprawling appellation southwest of Sebastopol, but the heat of the vintage shows in the wine's relative softness and ripeness of fruit. The cherries, raspberries and dates are almost, but not quite, cooked, bringing to mind a Fig Newton cookie. Scores high on the deliciousness scale, but it's not a wine for the cellar. Drink now.",88,Talisman 2004 Thorn Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"This is a soft, ripe and fruity wine. Smooth and lightly textured, its unusual blend of Pinot Noir, Shiraz and Castelão is generous and spicy with good final acidity. Drink now.",85,DFJ Vinhos 2014 Bigode Red (Lisboa),,,,
"This five-grape blend is ripe, smooth, loamy and rich on the nose, with aromas of pastry, syrupy berry and cassis. A flush, oaky palate has just enough acidity to maintain its poise, while creamy oak and vanilla flavors shadow mellow black plum and cassis. On the finish, oak hangs around and creates a coffee note. Drink this mouthfilling, friendly and generous wine through 2017.",91,Koyle 2010 Auma Los Lingues Red (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"Intensely perfumed wine, with spicy Syrah aromas dominating this blend with Grenache and Cabernet Sauvignon. There's also an earthiness to the wine, which is still young. The tannins comes through with black fruits, fresh acidity, and some firm ripeness. Age for 3–4 years.",88,Le Classique from the 3 Springs Vineyard 2005 Red (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence),,,,
"The underlying wine, before the winemaker put it into oak barrels, was delicious in tangerine and pineapple fruit, brightened with brilliantly crisp acidity and a fine, steely minerality. The oak, which is modest, adds a richer coating of buttered toast. A great price for a Chardonnay this drinkable.",89,Carmel Road 2010 Chardonnay (Monterey),,,,
"There's a fine texture to this simple, fruity wine. It has fresh acidity and a creamy character. A yeasty element doesn't quite fit with the rest of the wine and leaves a bitter taste.",84,Veuve Ambal NV Egalité  (Crémant de Bourgogne),,,,
"Grilled herb, dark spice, toast and leather aromas lead the nose. The palate is vigorous, marked by orange zest, dried cherry and thyme notes held together by tightly wound tannins.",87,Salcheto 2015  Rosso di Montepulciano,,,,
"Mellow white-fruit aromas are nonspecific and oaky, but not overly so. This barrel-fermented Verdejo feels plump and chunky, with balancing acidity. Salty melon, apricot and apple flavors end steady and long. For barrel-fermented Verdejo, this is at the top of the pile.",90,Matarromera 2015 Fermentado en Barrica Verdejo (Rueda),,,,
"This is a fruit-forward wine (aged only in stainless steel to maintain the freshness of the berry aromas) that would pair with cheesy pasta dishes. It's an easy, no-fuss Barbera with a refreshing note of acidity on the close.",86,Cantine San Silvestro 2009 Ottone I  (Barbera di Piemonte),,,,
"Fresh and fruity, the wine is attractive, citrus-driven and light. It has a zesty character that zings through the palate. Drink now.",85,Adega Mãe 2014 Pinta Negra Branco White (Lisboa),,,,
"Very oaky, with sweet caramel and butterscotch flavors overshadowing the underlying pineapples, pears and limes. But crisp acidity makes for balance, and a firm, stony minerality uplifts and provides structure.",87,Tandem 2006 Sangiacomo Vineyards Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Fairly oaky, dark and baked, but also well balanced and complete. The nose starts with vanilla and toast, and then asphalt, chocolate and black cherry come into play. In the mouth, it's round and comfortable, with raspberry, plum and herbal flavors. Smooth but short on the finish, with coffee and additional herb notes. Drink now.",90,Errazuriz 2006 Max Reserva Shiraz (Aconcagua Valley),,,,
"Lovely and generous notes of juicy ripe pear are most inviting on the nose. The concentrated punchy palate cuts in with welcome lemon zestiness and that wonderful Grüner spiciness of freshly milled white pepper. The lovely texture of the midpalate, combined with that lemony verve, is totally disarming.",93,Hiedler 2015 Ried Kittmannsberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),,,,
"This offers aromas and flavors of plum, savory spice and cigarbox, with an overall dry and focused character. A smoky spice note finishes the wine. Pair this with grilled lamb, pizza or steak.",87,Gerovassiliou 2007 Avaton Red (Epanomi),,,,
"Lots of dazzlingly ripe fruit in this rich, crisply acidic Pinot. It rocks with raspberries, cherries, pomegranates, cola and even hints of sweet, cinnamon-spiced mocha, as well as the toast and vanilla from oak. It's made for drinking now.",87,Damian Rae 2009 Doctor's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"From a high perch on Howell Mountain, this producer has blended 92% Cabernet Sauvignon with 8% Petit Verdot—making for a darkly colored, robust wine. Thick, chalky tannins envelop plum, cassis and dark chocolate. Drink now through 2020.",90,Burgess 2012 Estate Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"This refined, gorgeous and integrated Cabernet features ripe raspberry and cassis flavors, with a subtle swirl of cinnamon and a wall of supple tannins. This wine will age another 5–7 years. Pair it with a steak.",93,Steven Kent 2009 Smith Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),,,,
"Aromas recalling toasted walnut, underbrush and bread crust make themselves known. The vibrant, rather lean palate offers yellow apple, pear and lime alongside small, persistent bubbles and zest acidity. Bitter almond closes the finish.",88,Bisol 2013 Private Brut  (Valdobbiadene Superiore di Cartizze),,,,
"From estate-grown Merlot (78%), Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine is shy on the nose and full bodied in flavor, offering ripe, fleshy blackberry, tar and espresso.",88,Madrigal 2012 Nuestra Sangre Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"This two-acre site dates back to 1975; this is only the fourth time that Ponzi has offered it as a designate. Muscular and authoritative, it is still compact and somewhat unyielding. Dark cherry and cassis fruit is packed with iron filings, coffee grounds and black licorice. Winemaker Luisa Ponzi does her usual excellent job of putting the polish on outstanding fruit. Give it another decade and it will show its best.",93,Ponzi 2008 Abetina Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"The wine tastes sulphured, with suppressed fruit. There is some weight, with caramel and red berry fruit flavors, but it is all muted.",83,Les Vignerons de Grimaud 2010 Cuvée du Golfe de Saint-Tropez Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"A full, ripe and generous Tempranillo, with rich aromas of prune and blackberry offset by balsamic notes and tobacco. It feels lush and smooth, with concentrated flavors of roasted berry, coffee, chocolate and tobacco. Huge and lasting on the finish, has subtle tannins and complexity. Drink now through 2016.",92,Bodegas Leda 2008 Leda Viñas Viejas Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),,,,
"This bone dry wine has some good apricot and orange flavors, but also lots of dried herb notes that veer into bell peppers. It lacks richness.",84,Brick & Mortar 2012 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),,,,
"Lithe and slick, this has broad apple flavors and loose acids.",83,The Williamsburg Winery 2011 Acte 12 of Sixteen Nineteen Chardonnay (Virginia),,,,
"Restraint on the nose yields into biscuity, strawberry-tinged roundedness on the palate, with pleasant length. Fresh acidity lends focus while fine, persistent mousse and gentle autolytic hints speak of elegance. This is a light but classy apéritif that would make a wonderfully unburdened start to a special evening.",91,Erich & Walter Polz 2010 Brut Rosé Sparkling (Österreichischer Sekt),,,,
"This pink blend of 66% Merlot and 34% Cabernet Sauvignon simply stood heads above other roses in its flight. Light plum and strawberry juice aromas meet with yeastyness on the nose, while the palate combines a prominent acidity with an extremely chalky mouthfeel. Light raspberry, bubblegum and squeezed mandarin flavors complete the experience.",91,Brander 2016 Rosé,,,,
"Frothy and foamy, this delicately fragrant Prosecco delivers a bouquet of white flowers and orange blossom. The wine has direct, palate-cleaning effervescence and keeps your mouth polished and refreshed.",86,Cà Vittoria NV Riva dei Ciliegi Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene),,,,
"This is a well structured, rich wine. It has solid, ripe red-berry and black-currant fruits that dominate the firmer tannins, giving a juicy, generous feel. Well worth aging for 3–5 years.",90,Château Bellegrave du Poujeau 2009  Haut-Médoc,,,,
"With lemon-lime and lemongrass aromas, this Cava is slightly exotic on the bouquet. The palate feels good but not terribly interesting or complex, with flavors of dusty apple, peach and vanilla. With a short finish, this vintage sparkler is fine but not as good as in the past.",87,Juvé y Camps 2008 Brut Gran Reserva Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"Opening with aromas of ripe orchard fruit, this delightful, informal sparkler offers yellow apple, Bartlett pear and just a hint of beeswax. It's fun and fresh, with brisk acidity and a lively perlage.",86,Adami NV Garbèl Brut  (Prosecco Treviso),,,,
"This unusual rosé is all Pinot Gris, picked for thick skins, chewy tannins, high acidity, and given a 36-hour cold soak prior to fermentation. It's a pale salmon/copper shade, full-bodied and juicy, with fruit flavors of peach and citrus. Highlights of hibiscus tea and floral aromatics contribute further complexity.",91,Antiquum Farm 2015 Aurosa Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Even though this is a bit one dimensional, it's delicious, polished and appealing, offering flamboyant tropical fruit, butterscotch, buttered toast and spice flavors.",87,Blondie 2010 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),,,,
"From the beginning this '08 seems as though it has turned; the nose is mildly oxidized and corny, and there's a shortage of freshness. The palate is dull and narrow, with limited apple and sour lime flavors. Acceptable but not at its peak anymore.",82,Meli 2008 Riesling (Maule Valley),,,,
"From the sweet white appellation of the Bergerac region, this is a full, botrytis-dominated wine, opulent, layered with dryness to balance the citrus and honey flavors. Maybe without complexity, but certainly with all the right botrytis wine characters.",86,Clarendelle 2003 Amberwine  (Monbazillac),,,,
"Here's a bright young Chardonnay marked by the crisp, tingly acids that you so often find in Edna Valley wines. The fruit is vibrant, offering a burst of Meyer lemons, limes, kiwis and figs, and the finish is thoroughly dry. The alcohol level, by the way, is a relatively low 13.5%.",87,Kynsi 2006 Edna Ranch Vineyard Chardonnay (Edna Valley),,,,
"A ripe and fruity wine with rounded tannins and fragrant acidity. The wine is juicy with red berries while soft at the end. It's delicious now, and will be even better from 2015.",89,Domaine de Boischampt 2013  Beaujolais-Villages,,,,
"This has the excellent acidity to support the ripe, super-concentrated fruit. Dense raspberry, cherry compote, baking spices, cola and licorice all come into play, with a streak of dried tobacco adding further interest.",93,Sequel 2010 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"While a bit demure in character, this full-bodied, dry Pinot Gris boasts fresh apple, pear and lemon notes. Crisp citrus acidity shines on the finish. Drink now.",86,Hosmer 2014 Pinot Gris (Cayuga Lake),,,,
"There is a strong layer of new wood here, serving to give structure to the rich berry fruits. Plum juice and black coffee round out the dryness, but the texture is still young, needing four years aging.",91,Château le Prieuré 2006  Saint-Émilion,,,,
"Petit Verdot is the current darling of the Bordeaux crowd in California. It's not hard to see why. It produces darkly colored, dry wines, deeply flavored in currants, cassis, chocolate and, often, violets, wrapped into firm tannins. This 100% varietal bottling is a good example. While not an ager, it's a flashy, complex wine to drink over the next few years.",90,Tower 15 2011 Reserve Petit Verdot (Paso Robles),,,,
"Smoky wood aromas are repeated on the palate. Although prominent, they do not suppress the juicy blackberry flavors and crisp acidity. Already balanced, the wine is likely to mature quickly. Drink from 2017.",86,Château Charmail 2013  Haut-Médoc,,,,
"A blend of 69% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Cabernet Franc and 9% Merlot, this is a dense and brooding wine, with dark notes of cassis, licorice, black plum, date and cigar-box spice on the nose and in the mouth. The palate is firmly structured, with medium tannins and balanced alcohol that lend the wine a crushed-velvet texture. Glimmers of charred oak and toasted spice linger long on the finish. Delicious now, but should develop more layer and nuance with time; drink through 2018.",92,Kanonkop 2008 Paul Sauer Red (Simonsberg-Stellenbosch),,,,
"Lots of elegance and sophistication in this drily tannic, smooth Cabernet. It's textbook Napa, with complex blackberry and currant flavors, touched by smoky oak. A very nice restaurant wine to drink now, and easy to find, with more than 16,000 cases produced.",90,Louis M. Martini 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
Honey and quince aromas and apricot and spice flavors bring out the medium sweetness of this finely balanced wine. There's plenty of acidity to balance its great fruitiness and honeyed succulence. Drink now.,86,Famille Laplace 2016 Aramis Petit Manseng-Sauvignon White (Vin de France),,,,
Banana flavors spoil this otherwise attractive and fruity wine. A dry core of tannins is surrounded by creamed banana and red fruits. Drink now.,84,Georges Duboeuf 2014  Beaujolais-Villages,,,,
"Lively lemon and herb aromas and bright, vivid grapefruit flavors make this an eye-opening dry wine. It has plenty of good fruit acidity to whet the appetite for appetizers and seafood.",87,Geyser Peak 2016 Pinot Grigio (California),,,,
Smoky notes of mesquite and teriyaki are blended nicely with delicate berry notes and a drying mineral feel. This is a classic and subdued Nebbiolo that would pair with veal scallopini enhanced by a drop of truffle oil.,90,Gianfranco Bovio 2007 Arborina  (Barolo),,,,
"This Barbaresco offers quintessential Nebbiolo aromas of red rose, leather and berry along with succulent cherry and raspberry flavors layered with spice, sage and Alpine herbs. It's wonderfully balanced, with bracing but fine tannins and fresh acidity, and will develop additional complexity with more bottle age.",94,Adriano Marco & Vittorio 2010 Sanadaive  (Barbaresco),,,,
"This is a polished and savory Sauvignon Blanc whose very sightly sweet lemongrass and spearmint flavors are finely balanced with crisp acidity. It brings to mind a salad of butter lettuce with shrimp, pink grapefruit and tart radishes.",87,Forth 2007 Sanford Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino County),,,,
"Blackberry, dark plum, mineral, char and leather aromas are what you want from a quality wine from Ribera del Duero. A layered, fresh palate houses lightly brined plum, black cherry and leathery flavors. A toasty finish with licorice notes hums along in fine form. Drink through 2021.",91,Montebaco 2011 Semele  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"Green and yellow pear peel notes accent this wine's yeasty, savory nose. The palate has spritz and, rather than amplifying those pear notes, leads with lemony freshness. Lovely, light and dry, it almost bounces with freshness.",89,Winzer Krems 2016 13 Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),,,,
"Moving towards medium-sweet, this is a honeyed, spicy wine, ripe and full of fruits. An easy, entry-level wine, it's deliciously rich and ready to drink.",86,Lucien Albrecht 2012 Réserve Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"This offers aromas and flavors of roasted coffee bean, toasted oak, ground black pepper and prune steeped in spirits. The palate has raspy tannins and lacks fruit richness, giving it a hard edge.",86,Ressia 2012 Canova  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Batasiolo is a large estate that offers a long list of Piedmont wines. Elegant and bright, this pretty Barolo offers the best of the austere Nebbiolo grape at a reasonably low price. It seduces with attractive aromas and flavors of wild berry, ginger, cola and dried mint.",92,Beni di Batasiolo 2008  Barolo,,,,
"This is a beautifully fragrant Merlot from cool-climate northern Italy that shows pristine aromas of cherry, wild berry, red rose and Indian spice. The wine is structured and smooth on the finish with soft, plush tannins.",91,Josef Weger 2005 Maso delle Rose Merlot (Alto Adige),,,,
"Big, blocky black-fruit aromas are reduced and potent. This is quite chunky and extracted in feel, with jammy gritty blackberry and plum flavors that are mildly herbal and simmer with heat and heft on the finish.",87,Bodega Norton 2013 Barrel Select Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Nicely dry, silky and delicate in structure, this has pleasant cherry and cola flavors that are brightened by acidity. It finishes with the sweetness of toasted oak. While it's not particularly complex, it does offer plenty of varietal pleasure. Drink now.",88,Windstream 2010 Sarmento Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"This is a Negroamaro-based wine (with 10% Malvasia Nera) that boasts pretty layers of cinnamon spice and clove over a solid base of chewy, mature fruit. It has an easy, no-fuss personality and would pair well with pizza or pasta.",86,Agricole Vallone 2005 Riserva Vereto Red (Salice Salentino),,,,
"A fairly standard Syrah, softly sweet and direct in berry, mocha, spice and oak flavors. Tons of fruit, but lacks complexity for the price.",85,Collier Falls 2009 Syrah du Soleil Syrah (Sonoma County),,,,
"This 100% Cabernet tastes way too oaky. Vanilla cream and caramel dominate the blackberries and black currants, giving it a woody sweetness. The question is, will it age out? The classic answer is that a wine that tastes unbalanced when young most likely always will.",84,Quivet Cellars 2007 Kenefick Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Concentrated and full, this has serious structure, dense, dry spiciness as well as rich lychee and mango fruit flavors. The minerality brings out the chalk soil of the Zinnkoepflé vineyard, the highest in Alsace. It's a wine for aging, so don't drink before 2018.",93,Domaine Léon Boesch 2012 Zinnkoepflé Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"Briny and dark copper-orange in color, this is a weighty wine, though the alcohol level is low. The tannins and leathery texture of the Syrah shine through, checked by tangy citrus and a hit of white pepper.",88,Deerfield Ranch 2014 Checkerbloom Estate Rosé (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"Also known as Mourvèdre. This Spanish-inspired Monastrell from Bokisch, grown on a hillside, is brawny with plenty of earth and bacon bite to it, yet also floral, rich yet also bright, tasting of black cherry and pomegranate with a menthol tobacco chaser.",91,Bokisch 2008 Belle Colline Vineyard Monastrell (Clements Hills),,,,
"The Encruzado, grown almost exclusively in the Dão is one of Portugal's unsung great grapes. This wine—perfumed, steely and mineral—really brings out the granite soil of the region. It's tight, taut and packed with acidity as well as hints of yellow fruits. Drink from late 2016.",92,Casa da Passarella 2014 O Oenólogo Branco Encruzado (Dão),,,,
"With no oak influence, this Sauvignon Blanc was cool-fermented, preserving fresh fruit, and it did not undergo malolactic fermentation, so that the acidity is brisk. It was aged on the lees. That is a great formula for keeping prices low while crafting a wine of creamy interest. With citrus, lemongrass, melon, fig and vanilla flavors, it's a stunning buy for this price.",90,Vina Robles 2007 Jardine Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles),,,,
"Softened by 6% Merlot, this lovely concoction opens with a waft of smoky cigar box, becoming a bold, loud expression of the variety dotted in classic notes of cassis and cedar. A luxuriously velvety texture is the standout, though, supported by great structure and length.",93,World's End 2013 If Six Was Nine Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Dominated by Touriga Nacional, this is a powerfully structured, rich wine. The wood aging shows through the mint flavors that brings complexity to the wine. Toast and spice also feature strongly while masking the ripe black plum fruits. Drink this impressive wine from 2018.",93,Quinta da Rede 2013 Grande Reserva Red (Douro),,,,
Muddled citrus and a drizzle of artificial butter initially marks the nose and palate. Additional notes of bitter lemon peel and roasted pear carry the flavors to a slightly astringent finish.,84,Pearmund 2013 Old Vine Meriwether Vineyard Chardonnay (Virginia),,,,
"Grapy berry and plum aromas set up a fresh tannic wiry palate. Popping plum and berry flavors are lively and toasty, while this Tannat, with its black pepper notes, tastes good and spicy on the finish. Drink through 2020.",89,Bouza 2014 Reserva Tannat (Uruguay),,,,
"With 22 to 24 months in new French oak, there's a lot of richness to this wine in the form of raspberry sauce, milk chocolate and balsamic reduction. There's plenty of fruit to support those heavy flavors, though, with vibrant cherry and plum flavors in the medium weight mouth. Cola and spice add interest to the close.",87,KWV 2006 Cathedral Cellar Cabernet Sauvignon (Coastal Region),,,,
"Brawny but lovely, with monster black fruit, balsam wood, tobacco and cola nut aromas. The palate is ultra rich and modern in style, with deep, brandied flavors of cola, black cherry and spice. Driven, modern and properly tannic, with a fair amount of mocha and creaminess on the finish. Drink from late 2010 thru 2014.",95,Sierra Cantabria 2006 Amancio  (Rioja),,,,
The nose is restrained but has zesty lemon hints. The palate also presents ample lemon and orange zest. This counters the fruity richness of the peach. A bitter phenolic streak prevents this from becoming too rich and balances the ample fruit on the off-dry finish.,89,Willm 2016 Cuvée Emile Willm Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"Made in a softer, gentler style, almost with the body of a Pinot Noir. But the flavors are intensely concentrated, suggesting blackberries, black currants, cola, mocha and pepper. It's an easy Zin to drink now.",88,Eberle 2009 Wine Bush Vineyard 60% / Steinbeck Vineyard 40% Zinfandel (Paso Robles),,,,
"Green bell pepper and gooseberry notes dominate this Sauvignon Blanc, although it does have notes of honey and Meyer lemons. It's bright in acidity, and the finish is spicy and clean. For the price, it's a good value.",85,Robert Mondavi 2012 Private Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Central Coast),,,,
"A mixed bag of varieties went into this soft and fruity wine. It has gentle tannins that are lifted by acidity and black currant fruitiness. With its lifestyle label (a small Vespa motor scooter), it is obviously meant to be an easy-going ready-to-drink wine. And it succeeds.",87,Casa Santos Lima 2014 Bonavita Red (Lisboa),,,,
"A $20 Châteauneuf-du-Pape? Yup, and it's pretty darn good, too. Thyme and clove notes accent the black cherry fruit, and meaty, savory flavors emerge on the palate. It's  appropriately full bodied and perhaps a bit rustic, but satisfying. Drink now and over the next few years.",89,Kirkland Signature 2011 Cuvée de Nalys Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),,,,
"Maybe it's the name, but there does seem to be a hint of saffron in the lovely bouquet. Finesse and complexity are the stated goals of the winery, expressed beautifully here in an elegant mix of black cherry, mocha and coffee flavors. The mouthfeel, texture, and smooth finish make it a pleasure to drink.",89,Roots 2012 Saffron Fields Vineyard Pinot Noir,,,,
This fruity red wine is one of Portugal's best sellers. Along with its red fruit and attractive acidity it is soft with just an edge of tannins. Drink this young wine now.,86,Herdade do Esporão 2015 Monte Velho Red (Alentejano),,,,
"Aromas of pear, red apple and pineapple lead to sweet green and red apple flavors with a tart finish.",85,Bitner 2012 Reserve Late Harvest Riesling,,,,
"A wine that combines richness with a great structure. It is ripe, smoky, the red fruits rich and concentrated. A wine that is packed with juicy fruit and also with a good aging potential.",92,Château de la Terrière 2009  Moulin-à-Vent,,,,
"Very crisp, and loaded with tart green apples and lemons, this would be an ideal match for light fish or shellfish dishes. This is what unadulterated cool-climate Chardonnay tastes like.",84,Palmer 1998 Estate Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"This is a concentrated wine, packed with tannins and black plum fruits. It has some of the fruity crispness of the vintage although with its dark structure and concentration it is obviously a wine that needs to soften over time. Rich and juicy at the end, it will be ready to drink from 2024.",93,Château Prieuré-Lichine 2014  Margaux,,,,
"This very fairly priced wine from the fourth-generation winemaking family behind San Antonio Winery delivers aromas of black cherry-crusted charred meats with significant mint character. It's dense on the palate and quite tannic, but quite nice with blackberry paste, licorice and tanned leather flavors.",90,Maddalena 2010 Merlot (Paso Robles),,,,
"This fruity, light and fresh wine offers easy tannins and red berry fruits. It's rounded and juicy, smoothed by wood aging that gives it a ripe aftertaste. Drink now.",86,Cheval Quancard 2010 Prestige de Bordes  (Bordeaux),,,,
"This simple offering opens with aromas of stone fruit and toasted almond. The palate offers yellow peach, apricot and citrus, with a hint of flint on the close.",86,Cantina Fratelli Pardi 2012 Colle di Giove  (Montefalco),,,,
"A simple Merlot, it's easy to drink, and will be very nice with everyday fare like burgers or tacos. It's dry and tannic, yet rich in cherries and red currants, with a smooth coating of toasty oak.",86,Kunde 2011 Kinneybrook Merlot (Sonoma County),,,,
"This wine is 90% Syrah and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. Aromas of plum, smoke, orange peel and dried fruit are followed by a sweet full-bodied palate. It packs a big wallop but could use a bit more acid to balance out the abundance of fruit.",87,Underground Wine Project 2014 Idle Hands Red (Red Mountain),,,,
"Rich, melt-in-the-mouth fruit flavors and a smooth, supple texture make this wine hard to resist. Black cherry and blueberry in the aromas and flavors get a little grip from light tannins on the palate.",89,Boeger 2014 Migliore Red (El Dorado),,,,
This wine from the Côte Chalonnaise is a lighter style of Chardonnay than Leflaive's rich Côte de Beaune wines. It's a delicious lightly toasty wine that has crisp acidity and a strong and refreshing dose of lemon juice. The wine is creamy at the end. It will be ready to drink from 2017.,89,Olivier Leflaive 2014 Les Cloux Premier Cru  (Rully),,,,
"Creamy and fresh, this sparkling Lugana shows real class, starting with its floral aromas of lemon blossom and stone fruit. The crisp palate delivers green apple, peach and yeasty bread crust alongside a refined perlage and bright acidity.",91,Citari 2009 Brut 36  (Lugana),,,,
"Borderline exotic on the nose, with aromas of black cherry, violet and a touch of earthy leather. The palate has some prickle and snap to it, but it settles into lively black plum and boysenberry. Finishes smooth, ripe and big, with medium length. The coupage is 80% Syrah and 20% Monastrell.",87,Torres 2005 Nerola Syrah (Catalunya),,,,
"Tart in acidity, with simple cherry flavors that taste baked into a pie. But the finish is fully dry. Tannic, too, with the result that the mouthfeel is hard as nails.",83,Niner 2007 Bootjack Ranch Sangiovese (Paso Robles),,,,
"Herbal fynbos, sweet grass and lime leaf aromas are upfront on the nose of this wine, followed by supporting notes of Anjou pear, honeydew rind and honeysuckle. It's attractive and easy drinking, with refreshing citrus and green apple flavors that finish crisp and clean. Drink now.",88,Tussock Jumper 2014 Chenin Blanc (Western Cape),,,,
"This bland, overoaked Chardonnay is dilute, with aromas of clove but no fruit. A watery palate tastes woody and bitter, with another shot of unwanted clove on the finish.",80,Santa Alicia 2015 Gran Reserva Chardonnay (Maipo Valley),,,,
"Powerful oaky elements meet very ripe and concentrated fruit flavors in this deeply colored, bold and full-bodied wine. Charcoal, wood smoke and clove aromas are followed by blackberry jam and black-cherry flavors, while light, smoky and peppery nuances weave through them. While the first whiff is oaky, everything comes together well on the palate and finish.",91,Michael David 2015 7 Deadly Red (Lodi),,,,
"Leonetti's 2010 Reserve includes 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 9% Cabernet Franc and 9% Malbec—a more complex blend than the 2009. It opens with a lovely floral aroma—a bouquet of clover and white flowers—then heads for the dark side, with black cherry and cassis. It's a big, tannic wine, beautifully crafted, and clearly differentiated from the winery's regular Cabernet bottling.",95,Leonetti Cellar 2010 Reserve Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Dense and structured, this second wine from Château Margaux is magnificent. There are hints of bitter chocolate, along with tarry fruit. It is very textured, just hinting at extraction. The tannins are rounded and velvet-like in character. It's a wine for medium-term aging.",94,Château Margaux 2010 Pavillon Rouge de Château Margaux  (Margaux),,,,
"A savory whiff of nut accents fresh white grapefruit and apricot in this brisk, light-bodied wine. It's straightforward and quaffable, with a refreshing, citrusy finish.",87,Lieb 2014 Reserve Pinot Blanc (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"Good berry aromas form a nice opening, and there are solid spice and herbal notes to boot. Feels juicy, well-cut and tighter than in years past, with blackberry, tea, spice and cured meat flavors. Oaky on the back side, but complex and showing potential. Hold through 2013, then drink.",90,Emilio Moro 2008 Malleolus  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"Crushed earth notes juxtapose ripe lime, tangerine and melon in this refreshing easy-drinking Sauvignon Blanc. Medium bodied with a crisp tonic mouthfeel and brisk acidity, it's an appealing apéritif and summer quaffer.",87,Wölffer 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Long Island),,,,
"The aromas of this wine from a vineyard in the Corralitos area somehow reflect its orange color (perhaps due to three weeks of skin contact), with orange rose petals and iced rooibos tea, yet with a steely minerality more common in pale white wines. The palate shows pickled plums and stewed stone fruits against a gunmetal backdrop and citrus peel bite. It's unique and very tasty.",91,Beauregard 2012 Regan Vineyard Pinot Gris (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"A soft, unfocussed wine that certainly shows the black color of Malbec, from which comes the name of the wine. But it lacks definition, the wood element separate from the ripe berry fruits, with acidity trailing behind.",84,Georges Vigouroux 2006 Pigmentum Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"Cedar, red cherries and woodsy mineral notes make for a fairly complex opening. The palate is crisp, with lovely tar and leather notes framed by soft tannins that persist on the moderately long finish. An elegant choice to accompany steak.",85,Fortant 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de Pays d'Oc),,,,
"This blend of Chardonnay, Ribolla Gialla and Sauvignon offers delicate, alluring yellow flower, Bartlett pear and white peach aromas. The bright, polished palate offers pineapple, yellow apple and lemon drop flavors with substance and finesse. Fresh acidity balances the juicy fruit.",90,Gradis'ciutta 2015 Bràtinis White (Collio),,,,
"Lightly off dry, this graceful and beautifully balanced wine blends in about 7% Gewürztraminer, elevating the aromatics. Key lime, pink grapefruit and a touch of lemon zest are in play, with a finish that recalls a sip of English breakfast tea.",90,Hogue 2013 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This is a beautifully balanced, medium-bodied wine that's not too deep in color. It smells like ripe blackberries and has a whiff of wood smoke in the bright berry flavors. In the blend, Zinfandel is supplemented with Syrah, Petite Sirah and Carignane.",90,Clos du Bois 2012 Coro Mendocino Red (Mendocino),,,,
"Watermelon and light pomegranate fruit seem dusted in ash. Tannins are moderate but show some grip. It's a modest, quaffable effort without much varietal distinction.",86,Jovino 2012 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This Furmint from Tokaj has enticing aromas of lemon, grapefruit peel and vanilla bean. There are lively flavors of lemon curd, dried sage and caramelized apricot in the palate with balanced minerality in the finish.",91,Gróf Degenfeld 2014 Zomborka Furmint (Tokaj),,,,
"Harbes' standard-label Merlot offers a plusher, more voluptuous expression of sun-kissed berries and cherries. Rich in body and textures, it's warmed by hints of Graham cracker and cinnamon and soft feathery tannins. Sunny cranberry acidity brightens the finish. Drink now through 2021 to enjoy its fruity forward nature.",90,Harbes Family Vineyard 2014 Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"Good price for a Cab this succulent. Shows lots of rich, upfront blackberry jam and cassis flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. A touch of oak adds a pleasant jacket of smoky-sweet char.",87,Ballard Lane 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"Bougros produces rich wines, and this wine comes from the extra-ripe vineyard at the base of the slope. It is generous, giving a weighty character with the flavors plumbing the depths of richness. On top, a beautiful, almost sweet acidity leaves a fresh feeling in the mouth. Drink from 2019.",94,William Fèvre 2013 Bougros Côté de Bouguerots Grand Cru  (Chablis),,,,
"From a warm vintage, this Syrah is raisiny and jammy up front but more staunch and structured as it opens. Aromas of baked fruits arrive at a big, saturated palate full of blackberry, vanilla and coconut flavors. Cherry, chocolate and graphite work the finish on this ripe, warm wine. Drink through 2016.",90,Ventisquero 2009 Pangea Apalta Vineyard Syrah (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"This lovely brut offers a fragrance of white peach, almond and acacia flower. The palate delivers apple and citrus flavors, along with a note of bread crust. The wine is fresh and creamy with a dry finish of roasted walnut.",90,Le Marchesine NV Brut Sparkling (Franciacorta),,,,
"Crisp and slender, this offers drying tannins and aromas of fresh berry and white cherry. It shows a subdued and elegant personality overall.",88,Pietro Rinaldi 2008 Monvigliero  (Barolo),,,,
"All estate-grown Malbec, this pale salmon-colored wine shows high-toned notes of spice, herbs and cherry. It drinks dry with lightly styled fruit flavors, with the concentration a bit wanting.",87,Gordon Estate 2014 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This is an attractive, ripe and fruity wine made from Merlot and Cabernet Franc vines. With soft tannins, it is juicy and crisp. There is a tight edge that will soften to produce a generous wine. Yorick and Sophie Lavaud's 13 acres are Agrocert-certified organic. Drink from 2019.",88,Domaine Les Carmels 2014 Les Vendanges  (Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux),,,,
"An almost neutral nose nonetheless gives slight hints of crisp citrus. An ultralight body provides easy, clean-cut drinking with a superdry, citrussy finish. Drink soon.",88,Markus Huber 2015 Hugo Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),,,,
"This opens with black-skinned berry, clove and cooking spice aromas. The straightforward palate shows ripe black cherry, black plum and white pepper notes alongside smooth tannins. Drink soon.",87,Pico Maccario 2016 Lavignone  (Barbera d'Asti),,,,
"The bouquet here is confounding. It has some green vegetable and cat-pee qualities as well as white stone fruits, sulfur and popcorn. In a word, it's complicated. In the mouth, grapefruit and celery flavors mingle with green grapes, while on the back end it's chalky and rather tart. The overall acidity is high, and there's one important thing missing here: balance.",87,Wairau River 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"On the nose, this has aromas of stone fruit and melon that lend the wine depth and personality. The mouthfeel is bright, clean and refreshing.",87,Le Manzane NV Brut  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
This tight wine has acidity with a crisp texture and hints of the fruit to come. A potential for richness comes from the ripe yellow fruits that are developing. Drink from 2017.,87,Jean Curial 2014  Saint-Véran,,,,
"This is a fine, dry, crisp sipper with rewarding flavors of citrus fruits, figs, wildflowers, honey, thyme and pepper. With its crisp acidity and oak-tinged creamy texture, its spectrum falls between Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc.",87,Sunstone 2007 Pinot Grigio (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Intense aromas of inky, leathery black fruits announce a full, saturated palate that's bolstered by tartaric acidity. Plum, blackberry, raw oak and salty flavors are chocolaty on a finish. Drink through 2019.",90,Baica 2015 Barricado Organic Monastrell (Jumilla),,,,
"This proprietary blend combines 52% Cabernet Franc, 34% Merlot and 14% Cabernet Sauvignon, another in its line of Aaron Pott-made wines. It's lovable in its austerity and varietal suggestions of dried herb, cedar and green bean. Dusty, soft tannins support a full-bodied, straightforward structure.",89,Blackbird Vineyards 2013 Paramour Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"The variety is unmistakable, with aromas of coffee, earth and plummy fruit. Rich flavors display a mix of fruit and barrel (45% new French and American), making it a delicious find at this price.",91,Novelty Hill 2012 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A vibrant crimson in color, this offers more restrained aromas and flavors than expected. Cherries and citrus pith marry with notes of wet stone, finishing on a refreshing note despite the wine's ample weight.",85,Goose Bay 2015 Pinot Noir Rosé (South Island),,,,
"A blend of 50% Grenache, 30% Cinsault and 20% Syrah, this is a refreshing and well-balanced rosé. Though young and still somewhat tight right now, it offers bright notes of red cherry, strawberry hull and plum skin that are framed by hints of orange blossom, citrus peel and sweet spice. Silky in texture, with a mineral streak and ample acidity that results in a bright finish.",90,Gérard Bertrand 2015 Château La Sauvageonne Volcanic Rosé (Coteaux du Languedoc),,,,
"Sweet and light smelling, with sugar cookie and blueberry aromas. The palate is medium in weight, with snappy acids and dry, lightly herbal flavors of raspberry and red plum. Mostly fresh on the finish, but with little volume or follow through.",84,La Vuelta 2010 Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"A nice Chardonnay, with enough elegance to drink with fine food. Dry and crisp, it shows mineral-infused peach, lemon and pineapple flavors that are wrapped into quite a bit of smoky oak. Drink now.",87,Frostwatch 2006 Chardonnay (Bennett Valley),,,,
"This Furmint, grown in marl soils, has aromas of brioche, apple tart and caramelized pear and flavors of lemon-lime juice, green apple and lime blossom before a crisp clean finish.",88,St. Donat 2013 Márga White,,,,
"A delicate dusting mineral accents notes of pressed apples, wildflowers and peach on this dry but intensely fruity Riesling. Tart tangerine and pineapple flavors add a vivacious tartness that lingers long on the finish.",89,Prinz Salm 2012 Vom Binger Bergrücken Ortswein Trocken Riesling (Rheinhessen),,,,
"A stylish nonvintage brut, offering the right mix of character and functionality. Aromas are the standard green apple and bread dough. It’s maybe a little neutral, but the appley palate is clean, and it finishes with length and power.",86,De Saint Gall NV Bouzy Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"This rich, ripe wine hits all your Chardonnay sweet spots. It's honeyed in tropical fruits, with oaky notes of buttered toast and vanilla. The best thing is the clean, zesty acidity.",88,Firestone 2011 Chardonnay (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Leafy underbrush, moist soil, asphalt and sweet plum take center stage on this dense wine. The palate delivers espresso, toasted oak, vanilla and dried black cherry alongside drying wood tannins.",88,Trabucchi d'Illasi 2006 Cent'Anni Riserva  (Amarone della Valpolicella),,,,
"A lush, creamy, seductive style, this opens with forward aromas of caramel popcorn, berry preserves and raspberry sauce. The palate shows a bit more restraint, with berry-cherry flavors that flesh out the crushed satin texture. Oaky tones of sweet spice and vanilla bean resurface on the medium-length finish.",89,Fairview 2012 Primo Pinotage (Paarl),,,,
There are flavors of sweet wood along with spice and red-berry fruits in this attractive wine. It has enough freshness and acidity to give it a good lift. The wine is smooth and attractively perfumed.,87,Blackett NV Tawny Reserve  (Port),,,,
"Rather broad in the mouth without being particularly weighty or rich, with restrained aromatics of apricot and spice and flavors of melon, apricot and pepper. Drink now; the 2007 tasted out of tank looks significantly more interesting. Imported by Routas USA.",87,Château Routas 2006 Coquelicot Viognier (Vin de Pays Var),,,,
"A pure gold color, this gorgeous, rich wine also has a fresh lightness that allows it to dance out of the glass. Yellow fruits and honey dominate, while there is a good acidity at the end. Drink from 2017.",93,Château d'Aydie 2011  Pacherenc du Vic Bilh,,,,
"Very light in the glass, this wine shows cola, dried strawberries, dried rose petals, sagebrush and a rustic leather element on the nose. The palate offers lots of dried herbs, from oregano to sage to marjoram, as well as Earl Grey tea, all against a light raspberry-cranberry juice frame.",89,Rideau 2013 Estate Reserve Grenache (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"A bit less intense aromatically than other Adam Lee bottlings, this shows sour plum, smoked meat and a touch of garden herbs on the nose. Those elements come alive on the palate, where peppercorns, oregano, thyme and pencil lead decorate dark cranberry fruits.",90,Siduri 2013 Soberanes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Yalumba's flagship Viognier is a broad, powerful wine, with pineapple and apricot flavors marked by hints of floral perfume and spice. Not quite as aromatically expressive as the Eden Valley bottling, it may be a touch denser and more concentrated, with potential to evolve through 2014 or so.",89,Yalumba 2009 Virgilius Viognier (Eden Valley),,,,
"This wine is rather too jammy and ripe for its own good. It does have acidity, but it is also soft without the essential structure. It's not a wine for aging.",85,Domaine Michel et Joanna Ecard 2011 Vieilles Vignes  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),,,,
"While this wine is still young, it has great fruit and a good structure. Tense tannins lend form to ripe red fruits, with a touch of cigar-box aromas and a rich texture. This wine will show how well Chinon can age. Drink from 2018.",90,Domaine Grosbois 2015 Gabare  (Chinon),,,,
"Gold with copper hues, this opens with aromas of wildflower, tangerine zest and a whiff of crushed stone. The vibrant palate offers rennet apple, lime, ginger drop and a hint of mineral alongside mouthwatering acidity.",87,Primosic 2014 Santa Lucia Pinot Grigio (Collio),,,,
"There's a distinctive touch of dark cola and licorice here that frames a solid core of blackberry and cherry liqueur. The wine is darkly concentrated with firm tannins and a soft, sweet endnote of mature fruit and cinnamon spice.",88,Viviani 2007  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,,,,
"Smells like a dog badly in need of a bath, and alongside those funky aromas there's berry fruit and bubblegum. The palate is forceful and sort of heavy and tannic, with herbal, semitart plum flavors. Bright and lively, but unsophisticated, with poor aromas.",82,Pago de los Capellanes 2008 Joven Roble  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"Côte Bonneville releases this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend quite late, so it's well into the maturing process. Pretty aromas of smoke, tea and mint accompany secondary fruit flavors. The vintage produced well-balanced wines, but many have slipped into a bit of a dumb phase at the moment, so try in 2015.",92,Côte Bonneville 2007 Estate Bottled DuBrul Vineyard Red (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Now eight years old, this Pinot Noir shines. Its aromas range from concentrated plum, earthy beet and rhubarb to balsamic vinegar and mint chip ice cream. The palate offers candied raspberry fruit, still fresh, with juniper and black tea accents that keeps one coming back for more.",94,Silver Mountain 2009 Tondre's Grapefield Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Winemaker Brent Marris (formerly of Wither Hills) has turned out a medium-bodied, creamy_textured Chardonnay that combines peachy fruit and finely tuned nuttiness. Drink it over the next 6-12 months.",87,Marisco Vineyards 2009 The King's Bastard Wairau Chardonnay (Marlborough),,,,
"Ripe aromas of dark berries mingle with ample notes of black pepper, toasted vanilla and dusty tobacco. The palate is oak-driven in nature, but notes of tart red currant shine through, offering a bit of levity.",87,Quiévremont 2012 Vin de Maison Red (Virginia),,,,
"A delicate streak of honeycomb gilds layers of yellow peaches, apples and tangerines in this off-dry Riesling. Its concentrated fruitiness is lip smacking, but it's also quite elegant, reverberating long on a steely strike of acidity and minerality. Drink now through 2020.",90,Bischöfliche Weingüter Trier 2014 Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"This is bright in notes of apple blossom, lemon and lime, with additional hints of mineral and oak. Developing in the glass, it offers flavors of grapefruit and lemongrass from middle to end, while the finish is lightly marked by a honey accent.",90,Gary Farrell 2012 Bacigalupi Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"The 2001 vintage shows well in this expressive Barolo that does a great job of communicating territory and tradition. Mineral notes play against dried fruit, currants and exotic spice. In the mouth, the wine exhibits pulp and density with excellent power over a compact, lean feel. Drink it with important meat or pasta dishes.",90,Roagna 2001 La Rocca e la Pira  (Barolo),,,,
"While exuberantly fruity, almost tropical on the nose, there's a crystalline edge to this dry Riesling that renders it especially refreshing. It's vibrant and light footed, brightened by a lingering honey note on the finish.",90,Dr. Konstantin Frank 2014 Reserve Riesling (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This Riesling has a zingy but complex character, starting with the pear, lemon and vanilla on the nose and the honey, apricot and lemon on the palate. It's elegant but easy drinking, and a great accompaniment to richer ethnic cuisine.",84,Cascata 2008 The Professor's Classic Riesling (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Black as night in color, this has heavy aromas of bacon, rubber and char that settle squarely on notes of vanilla and creamy oak. The feel is fresh but shear and tight, with flavors of herbal berry and spice, plus a scratchiness on the chewy finish.",85,La Playa 2010 Block Selection Reserve Block N. 13 Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"This bottling is usually among the more opulent, successful white dessert wines in California, and the '07 certainly fits that bill. With 20.1% residual sugar, it's fantastically sweet, yet has enough fruity stuffing, balanced by high acidity, to satisfy. The pineapple, apricot and orange flavors could be somewhat more intense but it's certainly a very delicious dessert wine.",93,Navarro 2007 Cluster Select Late Harvest Riesling (Anderson Valley),,,,
"Brander's first Sauvignon Blanc of the cool 2011 vintage is delicious: It tastes dryish to slightly off-dry, with excellent acidity brightening the citrus and tropical fruit flavors.",88,Brander 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Violets, leather, vanilla, subtle oak and black berry sensations all meld together in the glass. The rich, concentrated palate delivers ripe black cherry and blueberry extract accented by mocha, cinnamon, clove, white pepper and mineral. It's soft and already extremely accessible, with velvety tannins, but will age well for the next five years or so. Drink now through 2019.",93,Mastroberardino 2007 Naturalis Historia  (Taurasi),,,,
"Orange blossoms and freshly cut apples and pears perfume this lavishly fruity, floral Riesling sparkling. It's sprightly and sheer on the palate with a fine, persistent effervescence.",90,Von Schleinitz 2012 VS Brut Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Soft, fruity and simple, with blackberry, cherry and mocha flavors. Basically dry, but tastes as sweet as jam. Syrah, Cabernet and Mourvèdre.",84,Phantom Rivers 2007 Paso del Sol Red (Central Coast),,,,
"This structured, mineral wine offers tight acidity and strikingly fresh fruits. It's full of wood, juicy apple skins and lime juice giving a fresh, taut character. Still young, it needs to age, so drink from 2017.",90,Olivier Leflaive 2012 Chatenière Premier Cru  (Saint-Aubin),,,,
"This super Tuscan blend of Syrah and Merlot opens with lush berry notes and clean aromas of cherry, blackberry and soft Christmas spice. The wine tastes rich, satisfying and would make a great match to lamb chops with roasted garlic potatoes.",88,Leopoldo I di Toscana 2006 D'Unico Red (Toscana),,,,
"Première Trie means a wine from the first selection of grapes during harvest. This wine, now firmly closed up, as is expected with Chenin Blanc, is headed towards an opulent future, even though the fruit is kept firmly in check by the long-term aging potential.",95,Domaine Huët 2006 Clos du Bourg Première Trie Moelleux  (Vouvray),,,,
"Fermented with 30% whole clusters and aged 20 months in neutral French oak, this is a distinctive wine with notes reminiscent of sage along with white pepper, violets and a tinge of copper. Designed for the dinner table, the palate is lighter in style with tart acidity.",87,W.T. Vintners 2010 Gorgeous Syrah Destiny Ridge Vineyard Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"This smooth wine is from a small parcel in the producer's domaine. It has wood and spice as well as acidity and a touch of minerality. It will need some time, so drink from 2019.",89,Henri de Villamont 2015 Le Village  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),,,,
"This 60-30-10 Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Aglianico blend from southern Italy delivers beautiful purity and intensity. Aromas here include blackberry, tobacco, leather, rum cake and polished black stone. It tastes firm and full on the palate and could use a few more years of cellar aging.",92,Montevetrano 2008 Red (Campania),,,,
"Sweet aromas of leather and caramel seem murky and tired. The palate comes without snap, and that's despite some plum and raspberry flavors. The finish is lean and basic, and overall it's a simple wine that doesn't really taste much like Syrah.",82,Val d'Orbieu 2001 Reserve St. Martin Syrah (Languedoc),,,,
"Vanilla and baking spices frame blueberry and plum fruit in this rich, velvety offering. It's slightly fuller and bolder than Colombo's 2014 La Louvée, but also less precise and perfumed. Drink now–2030.",92,Jean-Luc Colombo 2014 Les Ruchets  (Cornas),,,,
"The numbers refer to the clones of Pinot Noir used. The wine is dark, soft and ordinary, offering flavors of cherries, cola, anise, bacon and sandalwood, wrapped in a silky texture. Ready now.",86,Wrath 2007 115/667 Pinot Noir (Monterey),,,,
"Big tannins and impressive fruits are the hallmarks of this impressive wine. It is also subtle, not showing all its flavors at once, hiding beneath tannins and structure. For this fruity vintage, it shows a strong sense of direct, solid structure, only allowing the strong black plum and berry flavors to come through slowly. It is for the long haul, so don't drink before 2022, even better later.",97,Château Latour 2011  Pauillac,,,,
"Fleshy and briny, this wine hails from the producer's own marquee vineyard, situated in the heart of the Olivet Lane district. Ripe, with a buttery undertone, it's classic in its rendering of Gravenstein apple and pear flavors—balanced, yet with a robust frame.",90,Pellegrini 2014 Olivet Lane Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"A wine that reflects the relative lightness of the reds in this vintage. It has a layer of tannins, but they don't suggest aging; they are more a base for the attractive raspberry and red plum flavor, freshened by the acidity.",88,Bouchard Père & Fils 2007 Marconnets Premier Cru  (Beaune),,,,
"Lees aromas dominate on this wine along with almond butter, corn husk and spice. It's weighty in feel with abundant green apple, lees and cereal flavors leading to a lingering finish. The style gets a bit out in front of the variety but there's plenty of interest to be had.",88,French Creek 2011 Wente Clone Old Vine Chardonnay (Yakima Valley),,,,
"For the price, this is a great wine for a party or an everyday dinner. It's soft, easy to drink and rich enough in cherry, berry and oak flavors to satisfy Cabernet lovers. And it's easy to find, with 10,000 cases produced.",85,Dante 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (California),,,,
"Here is a spicy racy palate-ripping Chardonnay. The fruit rules here, a tasty mix of lime, pineapple, grapefruit and green apples. It was barrel fermented in French oak, though its flavors are more along the lines of a stainless steel style.",88,Irvine Family Vineyards 2015 Chardonnay (Oregon),,,,
"Tea, spice, tomato and dried-fruit aromas feed into a lightweight palate with slightly raw acidity. Snappy flavors of red currant and plum are clean, fresh and light. In a nutshell, that's what this Tupungato Pinot is about: freshness, femininity and dried red fruits. Drink through 2019.",88,Zorzal 2014 Gran Terroir Pinot Noir (Tupungato),,,,
"Given St. Clair's track record, this has to be viewed as a bit of a letdown. That said, it's still a well-made, light- to medium-bodied wine, offering a blend of modest tropical fruit and some grassy, tomato-leaf notes.",85,Saint Clair 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"A medium-sweet sparkling wine, this bursts with a ripe apple flavor on the palate. The wine is crisp, deliciously clean and refreshing. Think of it like Moscato.",85,Aveleda NV Casal Garcia Sparkling (Vinho Espumante),,,,
"This is a truly herbal Sauvignon that is sold under the label of one of the major wine retail chains in France. It's full of green fruit, intense acidity and crisp texture and is ready to drink.",85,Maison Nicolas 2016 Réserve Sauvignon Blanc (Côtes de Gascogne),,,,
"Bold and generous, this has deep aromatic layers and pulpy dark fruit. The bouquet is redolent of dark cherry, cinnamon, cola, ginger and teriyaki sauce.",90,Virna Borgogno 2008 Preda Sarmassa  (Barolo),,,,
"This rich, full-bodied wine is becoming smooth and ripe. The tannins are enveloped by the generous black fruits and drier raisins. A core of dryness show the wine is still developing. Drink from 2015.",88,Château Laborde 2009 Cuvée 1628  (Lalande de Pomerol),,,,
"This is the first vintage of this new purchase by Sylvie Cazes, a leading figure in the Bordeaux wine scene. A classed growth, it's richly fruity yet structured and firm, with dense tannins and layers of delicious black fruit. With its tannins still well at the fore, it will need to age further, so drink from 2022.",93,Château Chauvin 2014  Saint-Émilion,,,,
"This is a light wine with red fruits, a stalky texture and cool, refreshing acidity. It's the style of wine that could well be better as a summer red, lightly chilled. The final texture shows crisp fruitiness.",87,Domaine de l'Idylle 2013 Arbin Mondeuse (Vin de Savoie),,,,
"Guigal's long-term aging in new barrels has left a sheen of oak on this wine, but the underlying material is excellent, with mocha and plum notes supporting cedar and vanilla. The finish is long and savory, with a distinct granitic edge to the flavors. Drink now–2020.",91,E. Guigal 2007 Vignes de l'Hospice  (Saint-Joseph),,,,
"This late release is an unusual blend of Syrah, Baco Noir, Tempranillo and Dolcetto. All are strengths of the AVA, though rarely blended together. The extra bottle age has smoothed the rough edges, yielding a pleasant-drinking wine with flavors of strawberry preserves, citrus peel, and a touch of malt powder.",88,Melrose 2010 Equinox Red (Umpqua Valley),,,,
"Briny citrus and green-fruit aromas reflect cold-climate origins. This is zesty yet round, with acidic grit and bite. Green pepper, jalapeño and green melon flavors finish spicy and tangy, like bitter lettuce mixed with passion fruit and tangerine.",90,Matetic 2014 EQ Coastal Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"This wine brings out the structure inherent in this vineyard. Tensely textured with young fruits that have a touch of bitterness, the wine offers kiwi and green plum flavors given a more exotic character with some mango. It's a deeply structured wine that needs to age. Drink from 2018.",96,Domaine Pinson 2013 Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis),,,,
"This light take on the variety shares a focused fruitiness of strawberry and raspberry flavor amid a core of earthy cola, bark and black licorice. Thick on the palate, it finishes with a swirl of brightness and lasting acidity.",90,WesMar 2014 Salzgeber Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Enticing scents of pressed rose, wild berry, scorched soil, leather and menthol take shape in the glass. The juicy, savory palate doles out red cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, baking spice and grilled herb alongside ripe, velvety tannins. It's already approachable and will drink well for several more years. Drink through 2022.",94,Sandrone 2012 Cannubi Boschis  (Barolo),,,,
"Compact berry aromas veer toward herbal and minty on the nose. The palate is full, hard and rubbery in feel, with pounding tannins. Flavors of blueberry and mint finish with a hint of herbal berry.",84,Porta 2012 Estate Bottled Gran Reserva Malbec (Bío Bío Valley),,,,
"The famed winery comes a bit south to make this earthy, savory wine, with smoked sage, leather, forest floor, cherry and slate on the nose. The palate packs elegantly tart cranberry and pure flavors of sage-smoked wild cherry with the juicy elements of an herb-crusted pork tenderloin roast.",94,Williams Selyem 2013 Vista Verde Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Benito County),,,,
"Murellaia is a modern and sweet-smelling wine with firm structure and intense aromas of sweetbread, candied fruit, vanilla, spice, black peppers and prunes. Try it with pork stuffed with stewed apricots.",89,DeLucia Vineyards 2005 Murellaia Aglianico (Sannio),,,,
"This full-bodied red opens with aromas of sun-baked soil, iris, baking spice and plum. The warm palate offers black berry, dried black cherry, espresso and tobacco alongside raspy tannins that leave a drying finish.",87,San Fabiano Calcinaia 2011 Cellole Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"This is a decent Zin for drinking now. It's dry and tannic, with briary flavors of wild forest fruits and spices. Some unripe green notes compromise the score.",84,Rutherford Ranch 2010 Old Vine Zinfandel (Napa Valley),,,,
"Earth, apple, citrus and herb all mingle on nose. Green apple tinged with chamomile edge strikes against bright lemon on the dry palate. This is full of refreshing citrus and a beautifully understated vigor which will live in this wine for years to come. The finish culminates in a gorgeously tart but ripe apple notion. Very moreish now and approachable but with lots of future promise. Drink 2017–2030.",94,Domaine Fernand Engel 2014 Praelatenberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"A fine value, this tart young wine opens with cranberry, raspberry and cocoa flavors. It's graceful, flavorful and already drinking well but should continue to give pleasure over the next five years.",89,Brigadoon 2015 Lylee Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Dark, heavy and foresty on the nose, with astringent cherry and coffee flavors. Sharp in terms of feel, with plenty of leftover acidity on the finish. Tartaric acid is all over this wine.",82,Santos Beck 2003 Cavas de Santos Gran Vino Red (Mendoza),,,,
"Deep in color and light to medium in body, this bold red tastes juicy, fresh and inviting. Substantial tannins give it a good astringency to help it pair well with rich foods. An appetizing blend of red and black fruit flavors make it compelling to drink. It shows good balance between richness, firm texture and good acidity.",90,Yorkville Cellars 2012 Rennie Vineyard Organic Grapes Carmenère (Yorkville Highlands),,,,
"Sometimes seen as the junior estate in the Mouton-Rothschild stable, this property is now showing its own fine character. The wine is juicy with crisp fruit and soft tannins. It is in a rounded generous style that will allow it to be drinkable relatively soon. Drink starting from 2020.",92,Château d'Armailhac 2014  Pauillac,,,,
"A uniquely floral nose from this historic producer shows damp herbs, red licorice, rose petals and rose hips. It's relatively light in body, with sleek raspberry and red cherry fruit clinging to a pencil lead and graphite core. Marjoram and more herbs emerge on the midpalate.",92,Chalone Vineyard 2012 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Chalone),,,,
"This steely, tangy wine has a strongly mineral character—tight, taut and crisp. Green fruits, citrus and a grassy character dominate. It is ready to drink. This is an unusual 75% Sémillion and 25% Sauvignon Blanc blend that tends to round out the taste.",86,Château Anniche 2014  Bordeaux Blanc,,,,
"Floral and fruity, this opens with aromas of yellow wild flower and ripe orchard fruit. The bright rounded palate offers mature yellow apple, yellow pear and a hint of candied lemon drop alongside fresh acidity.",93,Tenuta Le Calcinaie 2013 Vigna ai Sassi Riserva  (Vernaccia di San Gimignano),,,,
"Vento Forte (“strong wind”) sees a year of oak aging to render a smooth, rich feel in the mouth. A pure expression of Vermentino, the wine is redolent of peach, candied lemon and almond blossom.",88,Terre di Talamo 2009 Vento Forte Vermentino (Maremma),,,,
"This new winery located just outside of Prosser hits the ground running with a luscious, viscous, creamy Pinot Gris that tastes like a pear-flavored creamsicle. The fruit is almost tropical, right at the edge of mango/banana, but not fat or flabby. This is a perfect sipping wine. Screwcap.",89,Airfield Estates 2006 Pinot Gris (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Juicy and well balanced, this is an admirable effort at the price. Boxwood, grapefruit, lemon and quince notes make for a sophisticated first impression. The palate is straightforward citrus while gooseberry notes pop up on the dry finish. Drink now.",85,Long Flat 2006 Destinations Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills),,,,
"A blend of Cabernet Franc and Pinot Noir, this pale pink rosé has really fresh acidity and crisp apple fruits. There are just hints of red-berry fruits and a touch of tannin that gives the wine an edge of dryness. The aftertaste, with the creamy mousse, is fresh and lively.",87,Monmousseau NV Rosé Brut Sparkling (Crémant de Loire),,,,
"Twisted Oak has a pretty serious track record with this wine. The '05, a blend of Tempranillo, Graciano and Garnacha (Grenache), is very dry and complex. It's soft but firmly tannic, with juicy flavors of cherries, raspberries, pomengranates, licorice, chocolate, cloves and pepper. Has the body of a fine Pinot Noir, with different flavors.",92,Twisted Oak 2005 The Spaniard Red (Calaveras County),,,,
"Dark in color, this is a big, juicy, tantalizing wine from a beautifully farmed vineyard on the edge of the Sonoma Coast, a cool region where grapes ripen slowly. The wine, too, takes its time to come around, gradually revealing layers of golden apple tart and honey, with a lurking floral element and gentle ginger spice.",92,Von Holt 2013 Heintz Family Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"A simple, dull wine, from a producer that has struggled with Chardonnay for years. Tastes soft and sweet, with some vegetal notes.",82,Oakville Ranch 2009 Chardonnay (Oakville),,,,
"This brand new, crisp and fresh wine is so young. Even a rosé can benefit from a few months aging, and this wine with its tight red fruits and lightly tannic texture will be better being drunk after the summer when its fruitiness will explode in the mouth. It is ripe, light and packed with acidity at the end.",87,Henri Bourgeois 2015 La Porte du Caillou Rosé (Sancerre),,,,
"With a strong undercurrent of bell pepper, this soft Petite Sirah has tense shadings of peppery spice and leather. Ready to drink now.",86,Concannon 2010 Nina's Cuvée Petite Sirah (Livermore Valley),,,,
"This wine shows that top Chablis should be aged. This is like tasting the barebones of the wine without the flesh that is still very hidden. There is suppressed power, as well as green acidity and potential richness. Wait 5 years.",93,Jean-Marc Brocard 2005 Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis),,,,
"Tart red cherries and plum skins are spiced by nutmeg, pepper and turned earth on this widely available bottling that packs decent Pinot punch for the price. The mix of ripe and tart plays hard on the palate, where red cherry pie toys with cranberry skins, and a dollop of vanilla carries the midpalate.",89,La Crema 2014 Pinot Noir (Monterey),,,,
"This is an attractive wine that is crisp while also having a soft background texture. It is fruity, perfumed and balanced. Drink now.",85,Campelo 2014 Tres Castas White (Vinho Verde),,,,
"This is a good but decidedly herbal-leaning Cab. The nose gives off tomato, spice and light berry aromas. It's fresh and medium in heft, with more herb and spice flavors than black fruit. Things turn woody, spicy, dry and slightly hot on the finish.",86,Pulenta Estate 2011 Bodega La Flor Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"This plump, dry-style Pinot Gris features plenty of fruit, which ranges from apple to pear and through to pineapple. The finish comes with a cool, refreshing note and ample length.",88,Yealands 2016 Pinot Gris (Marlborough),,,,
"This wine shows the continuing evolution of this property even in a difficult year. Structured, balanced tannins are already integrated with the fresh black-currant fruits. With a balance between Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, the wine is fruity and still young. Drink from 2019.",92,Château Picque Caillou 2013  Pessac-Léognan,,,,
"Dry, dull papaya and apricot aromas surely don't overwhelm, but they don't foretell the complete lack of fruit on the palate. A faded, insipid white wine. It has no pulse and tastes mealy.",80,Eleusis 2006 Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"Toasted oak and cardamom aromas give way to powerful oaky flavors on the palate, where maple, stewed plum and toasted bread flavors accompany a soft, easy texture.",87,McManis 2015 Syrah (California),,,,
"Elegant, dryish to off-dry and crisp in acidity, this Sauvignon Blanc has forward flavors of gooseberries, limes, white  sugar and vanilla. It's clean and fine to drink now.",86,Star Lane Vineyard 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),,,,
"Much of the improvements made to the celebrated Pajé cru are thanks to the Roagna family that owns a large part of it. Here is a cellared Riserva with darker concentration and heft followed by broad aromas of tobacco, leather, spice and plummy fruit. Mineral notes and cassis play a part and the wine needs some time in the glass to fully open.",90,Roagna 1998 Pajé Riserva  (Barbaresco),,,,
"There's a lot to praise and also lots to criticize in this Cab. It's richly tannic and nicely oaked, with lush black currant and smoky oak flavors. But it also has a harshness that interferes with enjoyment. Doesn't seem likely to age out.",84,Bell 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"This is a raisiny Cabernet, tannic and slightly coarse. Drink it now with barbecue or beef stews.",83,Field Stone 2008 Wally's Block Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Yeasty aromas of bread crust, yellow apple, candied lemon and nectarine peel carry over to the palate alongside an elegant perlage. Made with no added dosage, it finishes crisp and bone-dry with a quenching close.",91,Enrico Gatti NV Nature Sparkling (Franciacorta),,,,
"Purists might be inclined to say this wine is too oaky, but this reviewer believes there's ample substance to support the flash. Cedar and vanilla are apparent, but the dominating characteristics of this wine are its ripe fruit and plush texture. Drink now–2020.",91,Jules Taylor 2013 OTQ Pinot Noir (Marlborough),,,,
"Dark, dense and nice on the nose, with aromas of dried cheese, blackberry and plum. Fresh, juicy and healthy in the mouth, with blackberry and plum flavors that run long and clean. Freshness and juicy clarity are this wine's chief attributes.",88,Ochoa 2009 Tempranillo-Garnacha (Navarra),,,,
"A pale pink color, this pretty rosé offers ripe notes of strawberry, watermelon and banana on the nose and mouth. Easy-drinking and approachable, the fruit-forward palate is balanced by bright acidity, finishing clean and mouthwatering. Drink now.",85,Douglas Green 2015 The Beachhouse Rosé (Western Cape),,,,
Ronco dei Ciliegi offers nicely-aged aromas of cassis and dried raspberry with savory endnotes of leather and spice. There's some grittiness to the texture and the close shows dried fruit flavors of prune and plum. Drink now.,87,Castelluccio 2007 Ronco dei Ciliegi Sangiovese (Forlì),,,,
"Full-bodied and ripe, this is a rich, generous wine that shows complexity as well as subtle fruitiness. A blend of Viosinho and Verdelho, it's full of tropical fruit flavors, with ample weight and concentration. Spicy accents, a dense texture and a fine, long-lasting finish are all part of this stylish wine.",90,Wines & Winemakers 2012 Andreza Branco White (Douro),,,,
"Ripe and soft, here is a Chanson white that hasn't been overwhelmed by wood. Instead, the delicious yellow and white stone fruits come through, with a creamy edge reminiscent of buttered English muffins, finishing on a high note of juicy, thirst-quenching acidity.",92,Chanson Père et Fils 2005 Clos Saint-Jean Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet),,,,
"From a vineyard in Northern Tokaj this dry Furmint has aromas of citrus pith and freshly cut pineapple. In the mouth, there are delightful flavors of grapefruit juice and white peach before the pleasantly acidic finish.",90,Samuel Tinon 2015 Megyer Dry Furmint (Tokaj),,,,
"Smooth and creamy, with mineral-infused pineapple crème brûlée, green apple butter and smoky oak flavors. Rich, if a little direct. Drink now.",86,Clos La Chance 2007 Liebeler Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"This is smooth and open, a mix of fresh cranberry and raspberry fruit, underscored by minerality and acidity. Still young and primary, it offers light highlights of milk chocolate from aging 15 months in 62% new French oak. It's a wine of impeccable balance, with a seamless finish and silky smooth tannins. Drink now and through 2022.",92,Domaine Serene 2013 Fleur de Lis Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),,,,
"This clipped, sharp wine leads with berry and plum scents. In the mouth, it's all acid and no fruit, tasting extremely sour.",81,Pagos de Valcerracin 2014 Roble  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"This well-made, ripe and fruity wine has soft tannins that are already well integrated with the red-berry fruits. Acidity keeps it all fresh and suggests the wine could age over the medium-term. Drink from 2018.",89,Château Lestage 2013  Listrac-Médoc,,,,
"Honeysuckle, exotic fruit and herbaceous notes carry over to the racy palate, where they're joined by grapefruit, pineapple and green melon flavors. An almond note closes the crisp finish.",89,Ottella 2014 Molceo Riserva  (Lugana),,,,
"Toast aromas accent ripe pears and golden-delicious apples in this soft, easy-to-like Chard that only lacks a bit of depth. A slightly bitter note on the finish should become less noticeable over the next few months.",83,Martha Clara 1999 Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"Oak, roasted coffee bean and coconut aromas lead the nose. The palate offers dried black cherry, exotic spice, oak extract and espresso alongside astringent wood tannins that dry out the mouth. There's not quite enough fruit richness to stand up to the oak.",88,Conterno Fantino 2009 Vigna del Gris  (Barolo),,,,
"Warm toast, vanilla and spice notes are inviting on this deeply penetrating Merlot. Despite its rich black-fruit profile, the palate is surprisingly delicate displaying tart cranberry notes that linger long and lean.",87,Fox Run 2010 Merlot (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Oily and frankly a bit skunky on the nose. The palate is spritzed yet soft, with chunky, blowsy, generic white fruit flavors. Doesn't inspire; this winery's red wines are better.",82,Masies d'Avinyo 2008 Abadal Picapoll (Pla de Bages),,,,
"This is an outrageously appealing wine with aromas of smoke, dried herbs and abundant peppery spices. It's sensuous and layered in feel, with generous dark fruit and black pepper flavors. It shows a profound sense of elegance, purity and detail with a finish that seems unending—a complete knee buckler.",93,Gramercy 2012 L'Idiot du Village Mourvèdre (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This is a small estate of 12 acres dominated by its 95% Merlot. It is ripe and juicy with spice, dried fruits and crisp black currants. The tannins are already well integrated with the fruitiness. Drink from late 2017.",88,Château Lamour 2014  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,,,,
"Earthy aromas of rust, loam and dark red plum meet with scents of charred oak on the nose of this bottling. There is a bright acidity to the sip, but it surrounds a darker core of cran-raspberry fruit, with peppery spice and well-integrated rosewater flavors showing toward the finish.",91,Testarossa 2015 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"A tight nose of boysenberry and pepper shows on this wine from a boutique, artistically labeled SoCal wine project by Ian Sergy and Zach Jarosz. The palate is light and texturally intriguing, with flavors of squeezed berries and crushed oregano, showing bright energy on the sip.",88,Archium 2013 Faction Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Tight, compact and rubbery on the nose, with a mineral, medicinal edge to the black-fruit aromas. Snappy and hard on the cheeks, with midland berry fruit and a scouring, juicy, woody finish. Lots of red fruit but scratchy and a little medicinal.",84,Bodegas Imperiales 2005 Finca Helena  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"A workhorse for the winery, this bright and focused Pinot Gris offers pinpoint flavors of melon and pear, with a strong streak of wintergreen. It's refreshing and ultraclean, with fruit flavors front and center through a medium-long finish.",90,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2015 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Very stylish, but substantial too, with engaging lemon, vanilla, earth and toast aromas. It’s taut and crisp on the palate, where lovely green-apple, lemon and spice flavors shine. A persistent bead, and familiar flavors with an interesting mineral streak play out on the bright finish. Delicious now and will keep well.",91,Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 1995 Reserve Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"Intense floral scents of freshly cut roses and wild violets jump out of the glass. On the palate, dark cherry and crushed cherry twine with allspice, cinnamon, clove, leather and alpine herbs. All are partnered by assertive but supple tannins and fresh acidity. Best 2015–2030.",94,G D Vajra 2010 Albe  (Barolo),,,,
"This is a delicious, crisp wine full of minerality, acidity and a zesty texture. Tight and lively, it offers citrus and green-plum fruitiness with a hint of spice. Drink this attractive wine now.",89,Maison Stéphane Brocard 2015 Closerie des Alisiers  (Mâcon-Milly Lamartine),,,,
"This is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, sourced mostly from Pepper Bridge and Spofford Station. It has steely aromatics, showing rock and tight, tart red currant flavors. In the Waters style this is another elegant wine, that conceals its discreet pleasures in its layered aromas and mixed fruit and rock flavors.",89,Waters 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Silky and dry, but a bit harsh and raw around the edges, with some green, unripe flavors of mint accompanying the cherries and oak. Not likely to improve, so drink now, after a good decanting.",85,Churchill Cellars 2007 Leepin Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Sweet, jammy aromas of blueberry and cassis suggest ripeness to the max. For confirmation, the palate is rich, plump, soft and a bit heavy, with prune, baked berry and cassis flavors that end in a chewy, warm, fully ripe finish. Drink this beefy, ripe Malbec now through 2015.",90,Marchiori & Barraud 2009 Cuartel 2 Malbec (Perdriel),,,,
"Not a good result from MontGras. This is a pulpy, sweet, flat-lining Chardonnay that may not even make it as far as your table. So soft it barely registers.",81,MontGras 2007 Reserva Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"A fresh, apples-and-cream style of Blanc de Blancs. It has a forward fruit character, led by ripe acidity. There is some sweetness in the aftertaste, but it seems well integrated.",86,J. Dumangin Fils NV Premier Cru Blanc de Blancs Premium Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),,,,
"It was inevitable that a producer would play on the name of the appellation Saint-Amour when naming his wine. Luckily, the wine itself is delicious and charming. With just the right tannic structure to sustain the berry fruits, it's rounded, ripe and fruity. That structure will allow it to age, but it is ready to drink now.",88,Pascal Berthier 2013 Esprit de Séduction  (Saint-Amour),,,,
"Bring on the barbecue for this explosive, high-octane Zin. Ripe to the point of overripe, it shows flavors of blackberries, currants, cassis and raisins, liberally dusted with crushed black pepper and unsweetened cocoa. The bigtime tannins will cut through rich meats slathered in BBQ sauce.",87,Edmeades 2007 Zinfandel (Mendocino County),,,,
"The first sniff is yeasty and beery, a nod to the wine's youth. With ample air it brings in light hints of citrus blossom, lemon verbena and mint. Flavors of lemon and pineapple come next, and the small percentage that was barrel fermented helps to round off the acids.",87,Township 7 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Okanagan Valley),,,,
"Everything about this Syrah works. It's dry, crisp in acidity, elegantly tannic and, above all, superbly drinkable, with subtle but powerful cherry, currant, cola, bacon and sandalwood flavors. Feels delicious and important, with a bit more weight than a Pinot Noir.",92,Zotovich Cellars 2010 Estate Grown Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
Cherry and cassis aromas are both a touch raisiny and candied. This has a high-acid mouthfeel to go with generic red-fruit flavors that turn a bit weedy the longer this is exposed to air. A quick finish is low on depth.,84,Gran Verano 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),,,,
"This widely appealing wine has bright acidity and ripe tropical fruit and citrus flavors. It's a bit sweet in fruity essence, suggesting pairing with southeast Asian fare, arroz con pollo, or even scrambled eggs and bacon.",86,Bernardus 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey County),,,,
"This is a reserved and elegant example, fashioned along European lines. There's mixed vegetable and tomato notes upfront and a juicy palate of red fruit rounded out by a vanilla top note. The medium finish shows soft tannins. Serve with firm cheese. Drink now to 2011.",87,Raphael 2007 La Tavola Red (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"A drop-dead gorgeous red blend that continues Flora Springs' fine streak of Bordeaux-style wines. Full-bodied and dry, it's balanced and rich, with complex flavors of currants, minerals, cedar and spice. The tannins are strong, but ultra-refined. Drink this high-quality wine now and through 2015.",95,Flora Springs 2005 Trilogy Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"This big, ripe wine is soft and round, with integrated tannins. It evokes licorice, blackberry jam and toast on the palate, with mountain sage and molasses notes that linger on the finish.",87,William Hill Estate 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Clean and varietal, with cool-site flavors of lemon and lime. Bracing acidity, and cool, green fruit throughout.",86,Mount Baker Vineyards 2008 Viognier (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Here's a lush young Petite Sirah brimming with blackberry jam, cherry liqueur, dark chocolate and licorice flavors that taste a little sweet. It's tannic and immature now, but should age well for up to a decade.",87,Venteux 2006 Estate Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),,,,
"Smoky and structured, this is a wine that has both firm tannins and balanced, juicy fruits. It's a fine wine to drink now, especially with rich meats, and it can age for a year or two.",87,Cheval Quancard 2010 Réserve  (Bordeaux),,,,
"Made from 80-year old Nerello Mascalese vines, this powerfully structured wine features aromas of ripe berry, allspice, anise and Mediterranean herb. The concentrated, warm palate offers ripe black cherry, raspberry, licorice, mineral and white pepper alongside the warmth of alcohol and firm, velvety tannins.",93,Passopisciaro 2012 Contrada S Nerello Mascalese (Terre Siciliane),,,,
"Nectarine, peach pit and a dusty, oily scent define the nose on this mid-level, quaffable white. The body is on the plump side, with ample acidity. Flavors of stone fruits and papaya finish briny.",85,Bodega Carmine Granata 2013 Estate Bottled Semillon (Mendoza),,,,
"Here's an opulent Chardonnay from the far north of Italy that opens with a thick, creamy bouquet of caramel, apricot and honey. Dry mineral notes and crisp acidity balance out those ripe fruit flavors.",88,Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano 2010 Sanct Valentin Chardonnay (Alto Adige),,,,
"This wine is pretty and floral in violet and lavender, soft, smooth and simply rendered. High-toned in bright red fruit, it's out and out yummy and a tribute to a great old vineyard still planted to the rare variety.",90,August Briggs 2012 Frediani Vineyard Charbono (Calistoga),,,,
"Although this Cabernet bears a Napa Valley designation, it could be from anywhere. It's rich in tannins and has good blackberry and herb flavors that finish a little pruny.",84,RouteStock 2009 Route 29 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Intensely aromatic, this is Oregon Pinot at its most lush. Seductive scents lead into lengthy, balanced flavors of cherry and red plum, highlighted with green tea and tobacco notes. Tannins are smooth and proportionate, and the overall structure suggests aging this wine through 2025–2030.",93,Penner-Ash 2012 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir,,,,
"This is a smooth and rich wine, soft and fruity and typical of the warm, gentle side of Pinot Blanc. It does have some concentration with apple and crisp pear flavors. It is ready to drink although it could age well, easily for another year. Screwcap.",88,Glatzer 2012 Weissburgunder (Carnuntum),,,,
"This very appealing wine smells like a Danish pastry but then turns nicely dry on the palate, gushing with crisp apple, ripe Bosc pear and toasted-baguette flavors. Made from Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc grapes, it's medium bodied, complex and well balanced.",90,Concannon 2015 Reserve Assemblage Blanc White (Livermore Valley),,,,
"A rich, vital, complex Pinot Noir. Completely dry, with a savory scour of acidity, it treads a fine line between ripe cherries and pomegranates and earthier notes of mushrooms and dried herbs. Lots of terroir in this fine wine, which will take a few years of bottle age.",92,La Crema 2009 Pinot Noir (Monterey),,,,
"A tasty, juicy wine with ripe red cherry fruit and lively acidity. Soft, beautifully ripe, ready to drink.",88,Judith Beck 2009 Zweigelt (Burgenland),,,,
"This is a light, fruity wine that is likely to be drinkable very soon. It does have a rustic edge although that is likely to blow away in the coming months. For the rest, the red fruits, spice and acidity give the wine a soft, rounded aftertaste. Drink from the end of 2016.",85,Château les Verriers 2014  Bordeaux,,,,
"Several varieties figure into this blend, from 26% Zinfandel and 21% Syrah to smaller amounts of Merlot, Petite Sirah, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon. Big and powerful in smoky leather and black currant, it offers a rich softness on the palate, with a tightly wound savory, peppery aspect to the finish.",90,Roth 2012 Heritage Red (Sonoma County),,,,
"Exquisite scents of ripe red strawberries and raspberries accented by fresh herbs and bramble make Hermann J. Wiemer's Reserve another top pick for Finger Lakes Cabernet Franc. There's an intensity to the bright, red plums that flavor the palate, complemented by a pleasant astringency and vibrant acidity that keeps this wine impeccably fresh.",88,Hermann J. Wiemer 2008 Reserve Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Powerful, ripe fruit, now beginning to open up, is the dominant character of this wine. It's full in the mouth, packed with black plums and ripe damsons and finished with soft tannins and a slight warmth.",88,Château Carignan 2009  Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux,,,,
"With its pale sunset color and light raspberry flavors, this is a fresh, crisp wine. The tang of lemon zest and acidity is part of the fruitiness without dominating. Drink now.",85,Gassier 2014 Sables d'Azur Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"Winemaker Doug Boeschen has but one acre of this variety, and he puts it to tremendous use here, in this tamed, food-friendly expression of a robust grape. This vintage is his first single-bottling of PV. Soft, integrated tannin supports juicy black currant and a svelte layering of dark chocolate, punctured by an arsenal of beautiful violet aromas.",94,Boeschen Vineyards 2013 Estate Petit Verdot (Napa Valley),,,,
"Aromas of cedar, cinnamon and earth make a fascinating welcome, and the flavors are equally vivid, adding tart raspberry and pomegranate. This is medium bodied, lively with acidity and firm tannins, and nicely lean in profile.",88,Morse 2011 Reserve Estate Mourvèdre (Amador County),,,,
"Noticeably impacted with scents of leather and chicken-yard soils, this also shows some muted, brambly berry fruit. It's tart and juicy, with a flavor of pomegranate or acai berry, and best to be drunk sooner rather than later.",86,Evening Land 2012 Seven Springs Vineyard Gamay Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
"Surprisingly subtle, yet maddeningly complex, this is a rare treat to unravel slowly, sip by sip. Sweet and honeyed on the nose with scents of freesia, orange peel and stone fruit, but accented with just a hint of sun-dried hay. The palate is deeply concentrated with undulating waves of honey, beeswax and fruit, but balanced with striking tangerine acidity. Remarkably long on the finish.",94,Royal Tokaji 2003 Essencia  (Tokaji),,,,
"The Chenin Blanc shines here, with its smooth, creamy texture, hints of almonds, pears and an edge of firm texture. Acidity is balanced, a fine touch to finish a delicious wine.",90,Manoir de la Tête Rouge 2007 Chapitre 9  (Saumur),,,,
"Full bodied, rugged and intense, this is an earthy Shiraz that could use 2–3 years of cellaring. Coffee grounds, black olives and savory plums are framed by hints of vanilla and firm tannins that turn a bit drying on the finish.",88,D'Arenberg 2011 The Amaranthine Single Vineyard Shiraz (McLaren Vale),,,,
"Easy in approach and execution, this is a fragrant and floral Sicilian white that offers tones of white flower, stone fruit and citrus. It has a sweet but tangy feel in the mouth but is not particularly acidic.",85,Principe di Corleone 2007 Giada White (Sicilia),,,,
"The charms of this full-bodied wine are mainly in the substantial and viscous texture, while mild mineral and apricot flavors provide subtle backup. Far from being simply fruity, the style emphaizes the soothing, mouth-coating feel of the wine.",87,Vinum 2014 Chenin Blanc (Clarksburg),,,,
"There's extra richness across the palate of perfectly ripened apple, pear and melon fruit. The weight of the wine in the mouth is substantial but maintains a sense of lightness and proportion, and the finish extends out gracefully as long as you can wait for that next sip.",91,King Estate 2013 Signature Collection Pinot Gris (Oregon),,,,
"This wine from the Fess Parker-owned Rodney's Vineyard shows inky purple color, offering slightly reductive aromas of tar and charred meat but also violets and black pepper. It's full on the palate, hitting first with purple fruit and dried purple flowers before delivering plum-skin acidity and peppery spice. It's an attention-grabber.",91,Standing Sun 2011 Syrah (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"With its richness and complex wood and spice character, this is an ageworthy wine. It has weight and concentration, with a series of flavors that go deep into the powerful interior. Tropical fruit notes balance with the wine's herbal edge.",93,Manfred Tement 2009 Zieregg Grosse Lage Sauvignon Blanc (Südsteiermark),,,,
"Planted in 1965, these are the oldest examples of this variety in the country. Jason Lett showcases this special fruit in this natural wine with no sulfites added and no cold stabilization. Light gold in color, the crisp apple flavors are forward, the balance is spot on and the finish polished. Drink now through 2020.",92,The Eyrie Vineyards 2015 Original Vines Pinot Gris (Dundee Hills),,,,
"Oakville specialist Far Niente turns to Rutherford for this single-vineyard, 100% Cab. The wine is soft and exceptionally ripe in blackberry and cherry fruit flavors, while lots of toasty oak adds vanilla accents that make the wine jammy. Doesn't have the structural complexity of the Oakville bottlings, but sure is tasty.",90,Nickel & Nickel 2005 C.C. Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),,,,
"The aromas are unusual, with notes of mandarin orange, apricot, tin and herb. The palate is sweet and fleshy, showing a brightness of fruit flavor.",87,Coyote Canyon 2015 Coyote Canyon Vineyard Roussanne (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"This big, ripe wine is opulent and smooth. With layers of rich lychee and mango fruit flavors, along with spiced pears, this is a delicious, ready-to-drink wine. It's generous to a fault, a great wine to drink with pâtés and spiced food.",87,Domaine Schoffit 2012 Tradition Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"What a great wine for the price. This doesn't have too much tannin, but instead features plenty of tempting black cherry and olive flavors. It's a delicious, dry wine in a classic style.",87,Loft 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),,,,
"The full-on blueberry fruit of Zweigelt is very evident on this peppery, vibrant and fresh-faced blend. There is structure from Cabernet that gives a firm backbone, but the plummy fleshiness of Merlot and the juiciness of crushed blueberry, tinged with cinnamon and white pepper brings oodles of joy. This is concentrated but totally approachable and chock–full of fruit.",93,Netzl 2014 Anna-Christina Red (Carnuntum),,,,
"An awkward Chardonnay that's too strong and exaggerated for balance. Shows New World flavors of superripe pineapple jam and vanilla custard, with a honey-sweet finish.",83,Kokomo 2007 Peters Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"An almost forgotten variety from Greece, Kidonitsa is represented well in this stylish white. A nose of lemon, creamy oak and spicy anise leads, and on the tongue, a mouthcoating, round fruit profile is balanced with citric freshness. Deeper in flavor than many of the popular Greek whites, the wine would hold up well against richer dishes.",85,Vatistas NV Kidonitsa White (Peloponnese),,,,
"Some unripe vegetal flavors mar this blend of Zinfandel, Syrah and Petite Sirah. It's softly tannic, and what fruit there is suggests sweetened cherry pie.",85,JR Wine 2011 The Devious Woman Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"At 20 years, aged tawnies bear fruit and concentrated wood flavors, plus dry acidity. This is rich and poised, and it has a fine, full finish.",92,Ramos-Pinto NV RP20 Quinta do Bom Retiro Tawny 20 Years  (Port),,,,
"A straightforward but pleasant wine, with a yellow-fruit core that wears a chalky cloak. The nose offers zippy citrus aromas, and the first strains of the yellow fruit-and-mineral duo.",86,Annie's Lane 2002 Riesling (Clare Valley),,,,
"Production is lower for this cuvée in 2010, and the sources now incude Nysa and Ribbon Ridge along with Maresh. Aged in one-fifth new French oak for just under a year, it remains tightly wound, with tart, primary raspberry fruit wrapped in moderate acids. There are delicate herbal notes sprinkled throughout. Overall this is elegant, balanced and strongest on the midpalate.",90,Scott Paul 2010 La Paulée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"From Antinori's Castello della Sala estate, this landmark white helped to shine the spotlight on Umbria's untapped enological potential. A blend of Chardonnay and Grechetto, this is smooth, creamy, complex and long lasting. It offers a beautiful bouquet of vanilla, apricot, exotic fruit and honey, with a subtle touch of exotic spice.",93,Marchesi Antinori 2010 Cervaro della Sala White (Umbria),,,,
"Cherry, rubber and leather aromas are tight and announce a punchy, bright, raw palate with raspberry and plum flavors. Snappy and rubbery feeling on the finish, this is a fresh Monastrell with red-fruit tendencies.",86,Finca Hispana 2012 Joven Monastrell (Jumilla),,,,
"This is a delightfully straightforward wine, supple and smooth in floral honeysuckle and orange blossom behind ripe apple flavors and crispness.",86,Acacia 2013 Chardonnay (Carneros),,,,
"Heavy and soft, this Petite Sirah has sweet and sour flavors of cherries and mint.",82,Bogle 2008 Petite Sirah (California),,,,
"This Maule Malbec opens with pinched, herbal aromas of cherry and berry mixed with leather. The palate is fresh and zesty, almost to the point of being lean and scouring, with red plum, raspberry, cherry and a touch of vanilla. A quick finish that's tangy is the final act.",86,Botalcura 2010 La Porfia Gran Reserve Malbec (Maule Valley),,,,
"The blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah mixes notes of black cherries with hints of red raspberries to create a delicious tension. Dried spices and mocha add nuance, while the tannins are firm at first, fading to the texture of cocoa powder on the long finish. Drink now–2022.",90,Domaine le Renard 2015 Plan De Dieu Red (Côtes du Rhône Villages),,,,
"This is the first Riesling from Whitman, and it's a beauty. Lovely, inviting aromas mix roses and rocks, leading into fresh, layered, complex fruit flavors of pear, apple, white peach and orange. It's got plenty of acid so the residual sugar is almost undetectable, but the alcohol stays at a Germanic 12.5%. This is so good it makes you wish that winemaker Steve Lessard had been doing Riesling all along.",92,Whitman Cellars 2008 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Made solely from old-vine Grenache, this stands out as a horse of a different color in a flight of traditional Châteauneuf-du-Papes. It does boast a lovely suppleness and silky texture, but the aromas and flavors are strange—a sort of medicinal cherry meets boiled vegetables.",84,Tardieu-Laurent 2008 Cuvée Spéciale Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),,,,
"This bold effort opens with notes of jammy blackberry and prune. It is soft and slightly sweet, with flavors of of plush fruit and cinnamon.",87,Castello Monaci 2010 Pilùna Primitivo (Puglia),,,,
The rich fruit of this wine is supported by the ripe tannins. So blackberry flavors and acidity are given spice and a smoky character. The balance is already there. Drink from 2018.,88,Maison Hebrard 2015 Château Saint Seurin  (Bordeaux),,,,
"A big, burly wine with attractive tannins and rich plum and dark chocolate flavors. The wine is very accessible, ready to drink, a good value.",86,Domaine Brunet 2009 Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"This good varietal rosé has a little more body and a little more breadth in the mouthfeel than many others, along with mild strawberry and cherry flavors that give it substance.",87,Cline 2016 Ancient Vines Mourvèdre Rosé (Contra Costa County),,,,
"A big, dark, heavily oaked wine with caramel, resin and baked berry aromas. The palate has a thick, meaty feel, slightly abrasive tannins, and then sweet, sticky, woody black fruit flavors. Finishes with brown sugar and more wood flavor; strives for a higher level but gets bogged down with barrel influence.",87,Juan Gil 2008 Monastrell (Jumilla),,,,
"A pretty bouquet of wild strawberry invites one into this wine that's faint pink in color and pleasantly awash in citrus flavor and aroma. Mellow and long-lasting on the finish, it's refreshingly crisp in acidity and light in alcohol.",90,Martin Ray 2014 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Light to medium in body and rather tart, with leather and dried cherry notes that are submerged under an excessively medicinal character.",82,Tamburlaine 2008 Wine Lovers Malbec (Orange),,,,
"This is a soft, creamy wine with a texture that is dry while also rounded. White fruits, lemony acidity and a mineral edge are all consistent. The finish is full of acidity and a touch of bitterness.",88,Szigeti 2009 Edition Gustav Klimt Blanc de Blancs Brut White (Österreichischer Sekt),,,,
"A stalwart, sturdy rendering, this smells like ripe plums and dark spices. It tastes full of fruit but is shaded nicely by slightly smoky, peppery notes. The body is full and the texture firm with tannins and acidity. Best drink this after 2018.",89,City Winery of New York 2012 Reserve Alder Springs Vineyard Syrah (Mendocino),,,,
"Reticent aromas of herbs, cherry, barrel spice and green pepper lead to elegant, soft-feeling cherry and dark chocolate flavors backed by grainy tannins. It's a very pretty expression of the variety.",90,Five Star Cellars 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"A generous and lush blend of Sangiovese, Sagrantino and Merlot, this ruby red wine shows a soft, approachable side to Montefalco wines, which are usually known for hard tannins. You could pair this expression with pasta or grilled beef, thanks to its forthcoming aromas of black fruit, spice and dark chocolate.",90,Arnaldo Caprai 2006 Riserva  (Montefalco Rosso),,,,
"Dried lemon, chamomile, dried pineapple and seared orange rinds meet with a farmhouse-cider funk on the nose of this intriguing bottling. There's a tang of pink grapefruit on the palate, along with papaya and lemongrass notes and a touch of tonic water.",89,Solminer 2015 Riesling (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"This graceful wine, from a cool vintage, nicely expresses the more elegant side of Pinot Noir. There are ample fruit flavors of plum, cherry and blueberry, and a pleasantly musky note overlays the maturing fruit. It's rolling along smoothly into a fully integrated finish. Drink now through 2020.",90,Carlton Hill 2011 Estate Pinot Noir,,,,
"Crisp and tangy, this is a tightly knit wine. Apples and crisp citrus flavors are part of a package that also includes spice, a strong minerality and a perfumed aftertaste. The wine should age a few more months, so drink from 2017. This is a “village” wine in the northern Maçon area.",90,Pierre Merguey 2014  Mâcon-Uchizy,,,,
"This radiates fragrance and spice: ferns and pepper, yeast and juicy, yellow pear, mirabelle plums and aloe vera. All of this is on both the nose and the palate and is combined in a harmonious, balanced parcel of rounded goodness. It treads a fine line between opulence and freshness but does not stray from its perfect high wire act.",93,Bernhard Ott 2015 Rosenberg Grüner Veltliner (Wagram),,,,
"A perfumed wine with notes of lychee, orange peel and honeysuckle. It's sweet (100g/L residual sugar) with mandarin orange flavors that linger on the finish.",87,Latah Creek 2012 Hyatt Vineyards Moscato (Rattlesnake Hills),,,,
"This 100% Cabernet deserves its reserve status. Compared to the regular 2011, it's richer, with a smoothly tannic mouthfeel framing blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors. It will hold in the bottle until 2018, but there's no reason not to pop the cork now.",90,Triumph Cellars 2011 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"The subdued nose eventually reveals black cherry, anise and a whiff of chopped herb that carry over to the straightforward, informal palate. Dusty, drying tannins and a note of bitter sage leave an astringent finish.",85,Cantine Ermes 2014 Marchese Montefusco Nero d'Avola (Terre Siciliane),,,,
"This organically farmed field blend includes some Petite Sirah and Alicante Bouschet. It has soft acidity and a simple structure, the flavors a mix of red and black cherry and berry.",84,Barber 2014 Mr Beast Topolos Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Mountain),,,,
"Impressive, but so young, this is a Pinot Noir-dominated vintage, the richness as yet a mere hint in the welter of acidity and fruit. Already, though, this is   shaping up to be a structured, tight wine, with great final balance.",90,Mailly Grand Cru 2004 Millésime Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"Subtle and minerally on the nose, this has bashful white-fruit aromas that are at the peak of freshness. It feels good, lively and complete, while flavors of apple, citrus and mineral are well balanced. Drink immediately.",88,Pazo da Bouciña 2011 Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"In 2007, this was produced as a late-harvest wine. In 2010, by contrast, it is a crisp, apple- and pear-flavored wine. It has bright fruit, lively acidity and just an edge of sweetness.",90,Emile Beyer 2010 Lieu dit Hohrain Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"This soft, easy-drinking red opens with aromas of French oak, plum, vanilla and a sprinkling of clove. The juicy, straightforward palate offers black cherry, coffee and a hint of anise alongside round tannins and bright acidity. Enjoy through 2017.",87,Fonte alla Selva 2014  Chianti Classico,,,,
"Sparkling Shiraz is an acquired taste, but this is a good introduction to the genre. Simply put, it's a big, oaky Shiraz with bubbles, bursting with vanilla, blackberry, chocolate and cedar aromas and flavors. Enjoy it over the next few years for its youthful exuberance.",88,Chocolate Box 2008 Strawberry Chocolate Sparkling Shiraz (Barossa Valley),,,,
"This is a beefy and potent bottling, with beef char, ripe cranberry, graphite and iron showing right away on the nose. The savory cooked-meat quality carries strongly to the palate, where complexity comes thanks to pencil lead, red-cherry fruit and baking spice.",92,Coomber Family Ranch 2013 Private Reserve Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"If more Syrah tasted like this, more people would drink it. Beautifully ripe and soft, pure and rich in cherry and raspberry liqueur, smoke and pepper flavors. Ready now.",90,Margerum 2007 Colson Canyon Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"With a rusty color and leafy aromas of earthy berries and tar, this wine is fading. Hailing from a subpar vintage, it is acidic, with oaky resin on the mouthfeel. Flavors of herbal plum, tomato, vanilla and tobacco break up, while the finish brings stalky notes.",85,Marqués de Riscal 2007 Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"Fragrant and enjoyable, this offers aromas of ripe berry, Mediterranean herb, pressed violet and a whiff of pine forest. On the round easygoing palate, savory notes of brown cooking spice accent a core of red cherry and black raspberry. Enjoy through 2017.",88,Poggio Argentiera 2015 Bellamarsilia  (Morellino di Scansano),,,,
"Dark, tannic and full-bodied, this Malbec has deep flavors of blackberries, mulberries and dark chocolate. Feels a bit rustic, but will be nice with grilled meats smothered in barbecue sauce.",86,Rancho Sisquoc 2006 Flood Family Vineyards Malbec (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"The 2009 Abtsberg Superior is inferior to its Herrenberg counterpart, but remains a very good wine. Hints of sweat and wet stones mark the nose, while the fruit is more expressive on the palate, coming across as greengage plum and bright citrus. Medium bodied; crisp on the finish.",87,Maximin Grünhäuser 2009 Abtsberg Superior Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Block 8 is pure Wädenswil clone, displaying peppery brambly berry flavors and plenty of underbrush. The acids are sharp and bring suggestions of oranges and other citrus. The “Single Block Series” wines may be enjoyed as single components, or mixed as pieces of a home-made blend.",88,Winter's Hill 2014 Block 8 Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),,,,
"Two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Merlot, 7% Cabernet Franc and 7% Petit Verdot, this reserve is aromatically distinctive. A suggestion of grapefruit in the underlying acidity outlines pretty boysenberry, mulberry and sweet spices. It's beautifully balanced.",93,Leonetti Cellar 2011 Reserve Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"This wine comes from the furthest west of the Chablis Premier Cru vineyards, and furthest from the Serein river. The coolness of its chalk soil reflects in its crisp, appley and tight mineral character. The fruit is bright, in accordance with the 2014 vintage. Drink now, or, better yet, from 2018.",92,Nicolas Potel 2014 Vau Ligneau Premier Cru  (Chablis),,,,
"Smoky, charred, roasted blueberry and green-herb aromas set up a rubbery palate with modest form and structure. Blue-fruit flavors feature notes of bacon and bitterness, while this comes across green, herbal and stewed on the finish.",85,Avancia 2013 Cuvee Mosteiro Mencía (Valdeorras),,,,
"Amarone La Coeta opens with huge oak tones of spice and campfire that will definitely need a few more years of cellar aging before they soften. But this wood-heavy formula does work, given the hearty, thick nature of the wine itself.",88,Corte Lenguin 2007 La Coeta  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),,,,
"Here is a luminous single-vineyard bubbly with steady and persistent perlage and pristine aromas of acacia flower, orange zest and peach. Thanks to small percentages of Verdiso and Perera, it is a very fruit-forward wine with great balance and drying mineral tones.",87,Andreola Orsola NV Dirupo Brut  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene),,,,
"This is a very nicely rendered Wahluke Slope AVA Syrah, with spicy currant and raspberry fruit underscored with the characteristic lightly citrusy acids. There's a hint of pineapple which resonates just beneath the surface. The wine gathers some strength in the back, adding weight and flavors of plum, cherry and chocolate.",87,Camaraderie 2004 Clifton Vineyard Syrah (Wahluke Slope),,,,
"Pale salmon in color, but quite robust in flavor and alcohol, this brings concentrated flavors of watermelon and raspberries, with all the freshness of the newest vintage. It's bright and focused, the very picture of what is most exciting about these seasonal Northwest rosés.",90,Spindrift Cellars 2016 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Smelling of fig, sweet plum, raspberry syrup and vanilla, this is a meaty, thick Syrah.",87,Simaine Cellars 2009 Larry Venturi Vineyards Syrah (Mendocino),,,,
"My, how pricy wines from this vineyard have become. This release is rather herbal and earthy, with mushroomy, beet and black cherry flavors with an edge of sweet dried tomato. It's very dry and well-balanced, with considerable oak. Brims with young, firm acids and is a hopeful cellar candidate.",88,Coyote Canyon 1999 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Here's a round and fruity, ready-right-now Pinot Noir, anchored in strawberry fruit and lightly dusted with coffee grounds. The finish turns a bit stiff and stemmy.",87,Walnut City WineWorks 2012 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Simple, bright white and citrus fruits give this wine a great lift from the start. There is a smooth, vanilla texture as well as a touch of minerality giving texture. The wine finishes with bright acidity.",85,Vincent 2011 JJ Bourgogne Blanc  (Bourgogne),,,,
"A little too soft and sweet, especially at this price, when you want something with more structure. But there's no denying the richness. Offers masses of ripe blackberries, currants, dark chocolate and baking spices. Drink now–2014.",88,Bon Coeur 2008 Cuvée Marilyn Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Vividly pink in color, this is a light and sweet wine. There is a sugary aftertaste followed by fresh, crisp acidity.",83,Adega Cooperativa Ponte de Barca 2013 Ela Rosé (Vinho Verde),,,,
"From two estate vineyards, this wine is sleepy and subdued at first. Gradually warming in the glass, it becomes velvety and concentrated in black and red fruit, with dashes of clove and oak filling in the full-bodied palate. Structured and approachable, it also has a lengthy finish.",90,Foley Johnson 2012 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),,,,
"This full-bodied red opens with aromas of smoke, flint and dark spice. On the structured palate, clove and black pepper add depth to ripe morello cherry while firm close-grained tannins provide the framework. Drink 2018–2028.",90,Amarano 2010 Principe Lagonessa  (Taurasi),,,,
"It begins with an impressive bouquet of ripe cherries and sun-warmed stones, then adds some spicy complexity on the palate. It's round and lush in the mouth without seeming overly ripe or heavy, and boasts a lingering finish.",89,Château d'Aqueria 2007  Tavel,,,,
"The wine shows the power typical of a Lafite but within the context of the fruity 2011 vintage. The immensely dense tannic structure gives the wine a solid feel that is lifted by so much ripe black currant and berry fruits. At the back, the wine has a more brooding, dark character that suggests great aging potential. Drink this wine from 2019.",96,Château Lafite Rothschild 2011  Pauillac,,,,
"This electric-pink rosé of Syrah opens with aromas of yeast, chewing gum and pie cherry. The palate is on the full side, but it's not flabby or awkward. Citric flavors are more generic than specific, while this finishes with a burst of preserving acidity and then a lasting note of spent yeast.",88,Montes 2016 Cherub Rosé (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (72%), Merlot (25%), Cabernet Franc (2%) and Malbec offers generous notes of chocolate, vanilla, pencil lead and dark fruit. It shows a nice interplay of elegant fruit and barrel flavors with vanilla taking the lead on the finish.",91,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2011 Artist Series Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Tempranillo opens with spicy berry and plum aromas. It's tight and minerally on the palate, with lightly medicinal cherry and plum flavors that are darkened by a blast of peppercorn. Spice notes and soft oak make the finish friendly. Drink through 2019.",90,Bodega Otto Bestué 2012 Finca Santa Sabina Red (Somontano),,,,
"A dark color along with blackberry and prune aromas give this fortitude. The palate is young, rubbery and acidic, with big tannins holding up dark fruit flavors that bring a hint of chocolate. Olive and herbal notes on the finish are true to the grape type.",85,Calina 2008 Reserva Carmenère (Maule Valley),,,,
"Bramble and dried herbs, pressed apple and peach notes blend elements of savory and sweet in this complex Spätlese. Shimmering lemon-lime acidity refreshes the midpalate, leaving lingering tones of finely crushed mineral.",90,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler 2014 Bernkasteler alte Badstube am Doctorberg Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Lots of delicious, complex blackberry, crème de cassis, mineral and cedar flavors in this dry, tannic wine. One quibble is the acidity, which is overly sharp and feels odd, given how ripe the wine is.",87,Jean Edwards 2008 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Made entirely with Chardonnay, this is lightly scented with whiffs of citrus and a yeasty hint of bread dough. The bright, soft palate offers yellow apple, lemon zest and bitter almond alongside firm acidity.",88,Peri Bigogno 2013 Talento Brut Chardonnay (Vino Spumante),,,,
"An unusually light California Pinot, this wine has lively grape and herb aromas and fresh but lean flavors that make it appetizing while being restrained in personality. It offers a good balance of fruit, acidity and mild tannins.",89,Hirsch 2013 Reserve Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Already brick around the rim, this wine seems to be prematurely fading. Flavors are of dried fruits with a healthy streak of vanilla.",85,Sonnet Cellars 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This is a soft, ripe wine, smoothly textured. It has a good balance between the crisp apple and pear flavors and a more mineral texture that gives a bite. It's young, and great to drink now, although it will be even better from late 2016.",88,Domaine Roger Champault 2014 Le Clos de la Cure  (Menetou-Salon),,,,
"A broad and expansive wine eager in youthful tannin, there's red fruit at the core of its flavor profile, that travels from plum to darker berry. Soft, integrated tannin give way to a light body and restrained weight.",90,Grgich Hills 2011 Miljenko's Selection Petite Sirah (Calistoga),,,,
"A delicate bouquet of white flower and talc powder gives this vineyard-designate Prosecco Superiore a very clean, sharp and fresh first impression. That enormous focus continues to the palate where the wine's fresh acidity and tight perlage does a great job of refreshing the mouth.",89,Mionetto 2011 Rive di San Pietro di Barbozza Millesimato Brut  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
This is a new wine designed to be a “grown-up rosé” from the Cronk family who moved from London to Provence in 2009. It is a ripe fruity and rich blend of Grenache and Syrah. Weight as well as contrasting acidity give a structured character that balances well with the intense fruitiness. Drink the wine from late 2017.,92,Mirabeau 2016 Etoile Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"Already entering maturity, the 2008 Silhouette is a blended red (Merlot, Zinfandel, Sangiovese and more) with spicy, toasty flavors. The fruit is drying out, and the wine turning generic, but still fine for near-term drinking.",86,Merry Cellars 2008 Winemaker's Select Silhouette Red (Washington),,,,
"As in 2009, the 2010 Bully includes 10% Petit Verdot, and was aged in 100% new French oak. Muscular tannins and hints of caraway speak to the substantial addition of PV, and the wine is at first chewy and closed. Give it aerating and it shows plenty of depth, with dense raspberry fruit, notes of white pepper and crushed rock, and a lively streak of lemony acid.",93,Gorman 2010 The Bully Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),,,,
"Making wine since 1936, Marsuret's San Boldo Brut opens with sharp notes of white pepper and dried hay followed by citrus, peach and white flower. The wine shows thin lines with a watery consistency.",86,Marsuret 2012 San Boldo Brut  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
"Aromas of peach and lime are followed by a sleek, crisp, off-dry palate with a long, lemony finish. A light spritz perks it up nicely.",89,Milbrandt 2014 Traditions Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This light, ethereal wine combines 53% Pinot Noir with 47% Chardonnay, the color dark as a light-bodied red. A thick, dense mouthfeel and gritty texture complements the brightness of cherry and raspberry.",88,Brick & Mortar 2016 Vin Rubis Pinot-Chardonnay (Napa Valley),,,,
"This combines 85% Pinot Blanc with 15% Viognier. Together, they offer a full, fleshy and fruit-forward expression of peach and pineapple that's fresh in uplifting acidity.",87,Valley of the Moon 2015 White (Sonoma County),,,,
"Earthy aromas of underbrush, sunbaked soil, pressed violet and dried rosemary meld together with whiffs of espresso. The firm palate offers dried Marasca cherry, cranberry, star anise and a gamy note alongside close-grained tannins.",89,Suberli 2012 Riserva  (Morellino di Scansano),,,,
"This Tempranillo from little-known Cigales opens with potent crushed brick, spice, toasty oak and berry aromas. The palate has a juicy, fresh outlook and no excess weight or overextraction. Its plum, berry, spice and vanilla flavors finish with a note of mature, sweet tobacco. Drink through 2020.",91,Museum 2011 Reserva Tempranillo (Cigales),,,,
"Pretty aromas convey rose, wild red berry, savory herb and a hint of baking spice. The palate opens with wild cherry, black raspberry, clove and sage but drops off quickly on the midpalate. It's already accessible, with fine-grained tannins and bright acidity.",88,Camigliano 2010  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"From the eastern side of the Napa Valley, this combines 84% Grenache with 16% Mourvèdre, harvesting the best clusters of the grapes specifically for this light, dry wine. The juice is left to ferment and rest in concrete egg and neutral French oak. Light-copper in color, it's perfumed in jasmine, with accents of white peach, lime and strawberry, light and ethereal with a backbone of focused acidity.",92,Kale 2016 McGah Vineyard Rosé (Rutherford),,,,
"A good, useful Cabernet, made for balance in large quantities from vineyards up and down the valley. It's dry, tannic and complex in blackberry, black currant, herb and new oak flavors. Drinking well now. Production was 17,843 cases.",87,Sequoia Grove 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Raboso is a soft, fruit-driven grape that is native of northern Italy. This expression presents a light and informal side of the variety with cherry, blackberry and a smooth texture.",87,Cescon Italo Storia e Vini 2009 Il Tralcetto Raboso (Piave),,,,
"This wine starts with aromas of toasted oak, coffee, mature blackberries and hints of bell pepper. The palate offers overripe plum, black currants, toasted oak, chocolate, and espresso alongside astringent and drying wood tannins that give this an abrupt finish.",86,Tenute Niccolai 2009 Bellarina  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"Moderately aromatic, this offers notes of red apple, jasmine, and peach. It drinks off dry leaning toward medium sweet, with abundant peach flavors with a creamy feel. It needs a bit more acidity to hold it all together.",84,Black Box 2013 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
This is a delightfully fresh and informal Sangiovese with pretty tones of cherry and blueberry backed by a tight mouthfeel and fresh acidity. Lingering tones of ginger and cola appear on the streamlined finish.,86,Castelluccio 2011 Le More Sangiovese (Romagna),,,,
"Good acidity gives this Sauvignon Blanc a nice crispness. The flavors are of limes and green apples, with a stony minerality. It's an elegant wine, with a touch of wood. A little tough at first, it grows in charm in the glass.",87,Mayacamas 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Mount Veeder),,,,
"Rich in baked apple pie and ripe pear, this late-harvest Chenin Blanc, sourced from the Norgard Vineyard and named for Graziano's daughter, has pleasant acidity and isn't cloying or heavy. Smooth from start to finish, pair it with apple desserts or roasted nuts.",88,Graziano 2006 Sweet Alexandra Chenin Blanc (Mendocino),,,,
"Overly sweet and lacking in vibrant acidity, this Cab has candied flavors of cherries and raspberries. It's a clean, simple wine for drinking now.",84,Cosentino 2005 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),,,,
"Pian delle Vigne's 2004 Brunello is worlds apart from the scorching hot 2003 vintage—so different, in fact, the wine seems utterly reborn. You can smell those hallmark Sangiovese aromas: cherry, blue flower and wet earth, and taste the variety's elegant acidity.",90,Marchesi Antinori 2004 Pian delle Vigne  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"Shows the cooked, stewed fruit of a Paso Zin grown in a very hot vintage plagued by heat waves. The blackberries and cherries have a baked pie filling taste, although the wine is dry, and there's a rich chocolate and spice finish.",84,Adelaida 2004 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),,,,
"This blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Syrah offers varietally blended aromas of black currant, charred hardwood and black pepper. It's very jammy and hedonistic on the palate, with hot blueberry pie and toasted vanilla-bean elements, yet the tannins and acidity hold the powerful flavors in check.",88,Ringer 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Baked, leathery aromas of animal hide and sun-drenched berries set up a ripe, slightly out of shape palate with flavors of raspberry, plum and apple skins. A sweet tasting, tutti-frutti finish is short and basic. This reads like a wine from a hot year, which 2012 was.",86,Leyda 2012 Single Vineyard Cahuil Vineyard Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley),,,,
"Scratchy aromas of red fruits register as raw, with a note of animal hide. This feels racy and wild, but lively. Briny, rugged flavors of raspberry and plum finish tart, with a pickled note that won't let go.",85,La Purísima 2013 Alphabet Wines Monastrell (Yecla),,,,
All five Bordeaux red varieties are represented in this wine that puckers in sizable tannin and oak. Tobacco and pencil shavings add savory character to its full-bodied concentration.,85,William Harrison 2012 Rutherford Red (Rutherford),,,,
"The '04 is close to the '03 in quality, but falls off in structure, no doubt due to the hot vintage. It's a little too soft to balance the cola and cherry-pie filling flavors. Still, it's elegant.",87,Clos du Val 2004 Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros),,,,
"The estate-grown, Dijon clone fruit is bursting with flavors of grapefruit, pineapple and Meyer lemon. Barrel fermentation rounds it out a bit and adds suggestions of nut oil to the finish. The relatively low alcohol keeps the acids up and suggests that this is one that could age well up to 2025.",91,Amalie Robert 2011 Heirloom Cameo Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Moscato Rosa is a crimson-colored sweet wine with dark ruby highlights that offers simple but fresh aromas of wild raspberries and blueberries. The wine's bouquet is fragrant, sweet-smelling and intense. Drink it as an apéritif or with fruit-based desserts.",87,Franz Haas 2009 Moscato Rosa Moscato (Alto Adige),,,,
"This is a cool-climate Zweigelt, with a spicy, juicy fruit character and light tannins. The red fruit and green herb flavors are layered with acidity.",85,Winzer Krems 2011 Kellermeister Privat Zweigelt (Niederösterreich),,,,
"This smells familiar and solid, with blackberry, licorice and dark cherry aromas. It feels medium bodied for a high-end Argentine Cabernet, with healthy acidity and probing tannins. The flavors of blackberry and raspberry finish crisp and slightly citric.",88,Pascual Toso 2009 Alta Reserve Barrancas Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
Vanilla and cookie dough flavors dominate. The fruit is light and simple cherry candy; the tannins are equally light. Quaffable and refreshing.,86,Columbia Crest 2009 H3 Merlot (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"Lush and balanced, this 80-20 blend of Nero d'Avola and Syrah offers attractive notes of chocolate fudge, espresso and spice in the foreground of berry fruit. The wine has dense structure and bitter cherry flavors that ride long on the finish.",91,Valle dell'Acate 2004 Tané Red (Sicilia),,,,
"Opaque in its deep purple color, this microchip-toting bottle fills the nose with the wet clay and menthol aromas. On the palate, graphite and black volcanic rock come with a touch of caramelized fruit and dark spices, such as black pepper, that take hold. Still rich with tannins, this will continue to emerge until 2024 if not longer.",93,Clos de la Tech 2009 Domaine Lois Louise Twisty Ridge Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"Light and floral, this is a complex, well-integrated Chardonnay that's bursting in just-sliced pineapple, with a layering of butterscotch and caramel. It's richly textured yet nicely balanced between savory and sweet. The acidity upholds the wine from entering into dense territory, a celebration of one heck of a sunny vintage in a glass.",93,Gary Farrell 2012 Westside Farms Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Ben Ryé is a glowing example of Sicilian pride, and you can understand why. Beautifully integrated with deep aromas of orange zest, honey, chestnut, molasses and dried apricot, the wine is a true incarnation of lavish decadence. The mouthfeel delivers impressive intensity and concentration of flavors.",94,Donnafugata 2007 Ben Ryé  (Passito di Pantelleria),,,,
"This is straightforward and easy, with sweet Meyer lemon, grass, honey and vanilla flavors. Oak-free, it tastes like it might have a little residual sugar.",85,Lola Kay 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"This is a smooth, ripe take on the often-wild Baga grape. It has some tannins and layers of acidity over the red-berry fruits. Bright and textured with minerality, this impressive wine is balanced and ready to drink.",90,Campolargo 2013 Baga (Bairrada),,,,
"Getting past the heavy bottle, you find a structured and firm wine that has aging potential. Dark and firm, with rich black-plum flavor and a concentrated texture, the wine is developing into a ripe, impressive wine. The mineral edge will integrate well over the next year. Drink from 2018.",92,Wines & Winemakers 2014 Lua Cheia em Vinhas Velhas Reserva Especial Red (Douro),,,,
Peach and rose-focused potpourri scent the nose. The palate has great direction and freshness and a rich textured core that almost comes across as oily. The result is a perfect contrast between tangy freshness and rich fruit. Bursting fruit and perfume are countered by zesty citrus. The flavors last and last and the finish is dry.,92,Clément Klur 2015 Gentil de Katz White (Alsace),,,,
"A serious and dense wine, this is rich and full of dark juicy fruit. It has plenty of structure of course, with its rich tannins and wood aging flavors right up front. The acidity is perfumed, underlining the ripe fruit. Drink this concentrated wine from 2018.",93,Wines & Winemakers 2012 Pegos Claros Vinhas Velhas Reserva Castelão (Palmela),,,,
"Dry spicy aromas of tree bark accent basic red-fruit scents. In the mouth, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot is tight as a drum and racy. Narrow tangy flavors of plum finish peppery, lean and scrubbing.",86,Enate 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Somontano),,,,
"Apple and lemon rise above the fray in this crisp and tartly fresh sparkler. Nicely integrated acidity keeps it vibrant on the palate, and lengthy on the finish, all within a lightly ripe context of deliciousness.",90,Fritz 2014 Blanc de Noirs Sparkling (Russian River Valley),,,,
"The aroma of this sleek, dry wine made from organic grapes is subtly herbal. Flavors suggest crisp green apple and kiwi, and it has a crisp balance, smooth texture and very clean finish. It shows a sophisticated restraint that will pair well with any number of appetizers and seafood courses.",89,Alta 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"Brûléed banana and peach lead the aromatics and flavors of this French oak-aged Chardonnay blended with 15% Petit Manseng. A rich, creamy palate is balanced by a tart pineapple and lemon-curd vein, moving to a toasted vanilla finish.",88,Early Mountain 2013 Reserve Chardonnay (Virginia),,,,
"This Zin is a little too soft and simple for true classicism, but you have to consider the price. With its pleasant berry and spice flavors and rich, smooth tannins, it's a nice value.",84,Castle Rock 2006 Zinfandel (Mendocino County),,,,
"This is a bigger, more forceful wine than its Lindemans stablemate, but not quite as charming. The flavors are earthy and dark, featuring hints of cola and root beer. Finishes with drying tannins. —J.C.",83,Rosemount 2001 Diamond Label Pinot Noir (South Eastern Australia),,,,
"It shows the variety's dryness, acidity and light, silky texture, with lemon, lime and gooseberry flavors that finish tart and spice.",86,Red Cap 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford),,,,
"Good blackberry, currant and cedar flavors, and properly dry, with a good background of smoky oak. But it's way too soft, causing structural collapse.",83,Malibu 2007 Meritage (California),,,,
"We are big fans of Mauro Sebaste but found this vintage of his base Barolo to be slightly less charged and intense than previous years. You'll get characteristic aromas of wild fruit, cola and spice and the mouthfeel is drying, polished and long-lasting. Give this wine another five to 10 years of cellar aging.",89,Mauro Sebaste 2005 Prapò  (Barolo),,,,
"This wood-aged blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon has ripe fruits and plenty of the crisp acidity typical of the vintage. Its wood touches are subtle, just enough to give a creamy texture. The wine has a rich texture and will certainly age for another few months. Drink from 2018.",90,Château Bélingard 2014 Réserve White (Bergerac Sec),,,,
"This is one of the largest volume production Chablis, and it sings. Minerality and acidity go well with the ripe fruits and fresh acidity, bright and packed with grapefruit edginess.",88,La Chablisienne 2008 La Sereine  (Chablis),,,,
"This wine offers aromas of underbrush, meat juices and farmyard together with notes of overripe red berries. The palate delivers wild cherry accented with almost-sugary sweet vanilla extract sensations, mocha and cinnamon-spice alongside assertive tannins that carry through to the drying finish. Drink 2015–2019.",89,Fattoria La Lecciaia 2009 Vigna Manapetra  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"This wine is ripe and fruity, with a soft texture. Made in the northern Burgundy region of Saint-Bris, it conveys an attractive cool feel, emphasizing apples, lemon and a fresh, crisp aftertaste. Drink now.",88,Bailly-Lapierre NV Paul Delane Brut Réserve  (Crémant de Bourgogne),,,,
"Solid and powerful, with a very firm character, this shows the structured, concentrated side of the vineyard, with complex acidity cutting through the dark tannins. The wine is condensed and solidly based around a firm, dry core.",92,Louis Latour 2010  Clos de Vougeot,,,,
"Sangiovese is unusual in the Finger Lakes, but this one is quite intense. Rich cassis and black cherry flavors are accented by a minerally wet-granite tone and brisk cranberry acidity. It's deeply concentrated on the nose and palate, with soft, fine tannins on the finish.",87,Glenora 2011 Sangiovese (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Candied cherry and plum aromas come with a floral note and a hint of citrus peel. The body is a bit sticky and resiny, while a flavor of herbal cherry comes with a lactic, resiny angle. The finish is dry, peppery and resiny.",85,Echeverria 2011 Reserva Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"This well-defined Cabernet offers blackberry, black cherry and a hint of sweet grape jam. It's set in a frame of rock and tannin, that seems to catch and hold as it enters the back of the throat. Perhaps an indication that more bottle age, or some hours of decanting, are in order? In any event, it stops a bit short.",88,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2007 Canoe Ridge Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"After an aromatic opening that includes wet leather, rubber and brine, this wine finds its stride, and while it's firmly tannic, the flavors of dark fruits, tomato, herbs, tobacco and cured meats do the trick. It gets better the longer it sits; drink now but give it as much air as possible.",87,Convento San Francisco 2006  Ribera del Duero,,,,
"Dark in color, this powerful and concentrated wine is still very young. There is possibly too much extraction here that shows in bitterness, but the wine also has the potential for aging with its rich underlying fruitiness. Don't drink before 2015.",91,Château la Varière 2011 La Chevalerie Cabernet Sauvignon (Anjou Villages Brissac),,,,
"This stylishly labeled wine by Adam Lazarre and Christian Tietje shows salted apples, lime blossoms and white flowers on the nose. The energetic palate offers just-cut green pears at first, then opens into a touch of vanilla. It tightens back down on green apple peels before ending with vanilla cream. The wine delivers a full experience.",91,Sea Monster 2013 Los Alamos Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Thistle consistently produces one of Oregon's best Pinot Blancs. This is creamy and fresh, bursting with ripe pear and melon, and streaked with a gentle hint of coconut and vanilla. The lush finish seems to carry on for a full minute or longer.",91,Thistle 2012 Pinot Blanc (Dundee Hills),,,,
"95–97. Barrel sample. Promoted to Saint-Emilion's elite Premier Grand Cru Classé category, Valandraud's 2012 shows both a mineral character and intense acidity to go with the smooth and beautiful black currant fruits. Power and elegance.",96,Château Valandraud 2012 Barrel Sample  (Saint-Émilion),,,,
"This is a fine gran reserva from a great vintage. Aromas of vanilla, cedar, earth and spiced black fruits lead to a fresh pure palate with tomato-like snap. Cherry, cassis, tobacco and chocolate flavors finish smooth and clean, with just enough tannic grip. Drink through 2022.",92,Baron De Ley 2010 Gran Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"Very ripe and forward Cabernet, with jammy blackberry and cherry, spice and earthy flavors, as well as lots of sweet, toasty oak. It's satisfying to drink now.",87,Ministry of the Vinterior 2012 The Messenger Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"A substantial and imminently structured wine from a coolish vintage, this blends 92% Cabernet Sauvignon with 5% Petit Verdot and 3% Malbec to impressive effect. Leathery and intense it will benefit with time, its black pepper, red cassis fruit and flowery anise layers commingling in complex ways.",91,Shafer 2011 One Point Five Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),,,,
"Aromas of toasted oak, crushed blue flower, underbrush, espresso, licorice and toasted notes take center stage. There's not much fruit richness here so drink now before it fades.",86,Valdicava 2012  Rosso di Montalcino,,,,
"A fascinatingly flavorful wine by South African Ernst Storm, this shows very perfumed apple peels, pungent green pears and telltale grass shavings on the nose, all lifted by white pepper, wet thyme and hints of dried peaches. The incredibly vibrant palate, with lots of energy and acidity yet not in a biting way, offers flavors of rainy cement, limestone, Granny Smith apple skins and more grass.",92,Storm 2013 Presqu'ile Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"94–96. Barrel sample. Big and ripe, this is a powerful wine with 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, giving the wine a solid, dusty structure but also delicious fruit. Finishes with a touch of chocolate at the end.",95,Château Calon Ségur 2012 Barrel Sample  (Saint-Estèphe),,,,
"This rich, mouth-filling wine starts with almost-sweet floral, plummy, oaky aromas, building toward ripe cherry, strawberry and black plum flavors and a smooth texture. Everything, from its deep color to its lingering finish, suggests a bold personality.",92,Jackson Estate 2014 Outland Ridge Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),,,,
"92–94. Barrel sample. Big and densely ripe, this is an impressive wine. It has balanced weight, fine acidity and a sense of richness. Offering all the right elements, this is going to be a great wine.",93,Château Grand-Puy Ducasse 2012 Barrel Sample  (Pauillac),,,,
"This easy-drinking wine has a bouquet of honeydew melon and lime juice. Flavors of lemon, tangerine, guava and white peach with a soft hint of baking spice continue into the finish, which is marked by flavors of stone fruits and nutmeg.",88,1848 Winery 2012 Fifth Generation Chardonnay (Judean Hills),,,,
"This single-vineyard Pinot Noir shows fine coastal acidity and dryness, and a transparency of taste that comes from the terroir. It's very delicious, with jammy raspberry and cherry fruit flavors enriched with oaky vanillins and smoky, buttery caramel. Gorgeous and compelling, combining power and nuance, it's a wine to drink now and through 2015, at least.",95,Lynmar 2009 Terra de Promissio Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Bigger, richer, oaken and more structured than T-L's regular Châteauneuf-du-Pape, this cuvée flirts with being just too much. Vanilla, cedar and plum cake aromas, licorice, plum, and cocoa on the palate have a lot to recommend them, while the muscular midpalate and firmness of the tannins on the finish suggest agreeability but not much charm. Try after 2020?",92,Tardieu-Laurent 2013 Vieilles Vignes Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),,,,
"When T-L gets the mix of fruit and oak right, the wines can be deliciously hedonistic. This is a beautiful mix of cedar, vanilla and chocolate with bright boysenberry fruit, wrapped in a richly velvety texture and lingering elegantly on the finish. Drink 2012–2020.",91,Tardieu-Laurent 2008 Vieilles Vignes  (Crozes-Hermitage),,,,
"Silky succulent raspberry and cherry flavors are a luscious counterpoint to the razor's edge of acidity that frames this impeccably balanced wine. It's ripe, fruity and forward, yet offers surprising elegance and length. Drink now through 2017.",90,Dr. Nägler 2014 Estate Bottled Trocken Pinot Noir (Rheingau),,,,
"A blend of two local grapes, Niellucciu and Sciaccerellu, this wine is pale—almost white in color. It has delicious crisp acidity, a light texture and a fine, perfumed aftertaste. Drink now.",87,Les Vins Bréban 2016 Alivetto Rosé (Ile de Beauté),,,,
"The winery is in eastern Oregon, near the Idaho border, but the grapes were sourced from an unnamed Willamette Valley vineyard. It's a toasty wine, pleasing and easy-drinking, with pretty red cherry fruit. A dash of iron and some roasted coffee flavors add interest.",88,Copper Belt 2012 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Brown pear, banana and gooey cherimoya aromas show in this blend of 36% Marsanne, 33% Roussanne, 25% Chardonnay and 6% Viognier. A beeswax element comes through on the palate, but the treacly, tropical flavors predominate. A decent acidity keeps it all in check.",86,Ascension Cellars 2015 Silver White (Paso Robles),,,,
"From a warm site in the heart of St. Helena's valley floor, this is a restrained, elegant version of a powerfully built wine, thick in tannin and yet nonetheless able to speak its mind. Mushroom aromas give it a Pinot Noir-esque personality at first, before layers of red and black berry provide sultry, juicy texture and flavor. The finish is chewy, asking for more time. Cellar through 2023.",92,Robert Biale 2013 Varozza Vineyard Zinfandel (St. Helena),,,,
"Bright and perky with acidity, along with a delicate, silky mouthfeel, this is a pretty Pinot for drinking now with steak or char-broiled salmon. It has delicious flavors of cherries and pomegranates, along with earthier notes of ripe heirloom tomatoes and sautéed wild mushrooms splashed with Balsamic.",87,Artesa 2012 Pinot Noir (Carneros),,,,
"There's a ripe, almost jammy quality to the bouquet of this Riserva Barbaresco that appears as raspberry or strawberry candy with subtle cola, leather and tar aromas at the back. The wine is tight and compact with the kind of firmness in the mouth that suggests it needs another five years of bottle aging.",90,Piazzo Armando 2006 Nervo Vigna Giaia Riserva  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Exuberant in perfume, it conveys heady notes of honey, tangerine and mimosa that linger gorgeously through the palate. It's delicate in mouthfeel, yet almost shockingly penetrating with sweet peach and citrus flavors accented with punchy lemon acidity. Finishes long with an elegant swathe of green florals.",94,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt 2012 Scharzhofberger GL Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"The impressive I Filari Dolcetto opens with plush, rich concentration and a dark, purplish color. The aromas are intense and immediate and the wine exhibits a velvety, dense texture in the mouth with sweet cherry and cola flavors followed by mild tannic structure.",90,Poderi Luigi Einaudi 2008 I Filari  (Dolcetto di Dogliani),,,,
"This blend of four vineyards, which spent 34 months in older French oak, shows cranberry, pomegranate, cherry pie and exotic Turkish spices on the nose. It's light and easy on the palate, with hints of plum, violet, rosewater and white pepper—much like drinking a bouquet of flowers.",92,Tercero 2013 Mourvèdre (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Even at four years of age, this shows great purity of fruit. Black cherries laced with garrigue mark the nose, while the cherries expand to coat the palate, adding hints of leather and baking spices. Ready to drink now, but it should easily last through 2020.",91,E. Guigal 2009  Gigondas,,,,
"Spanish cedar, cola and bright cherry notes open the nose of this beautiful Rosso di Montalcino. Added complexity is evident in the many spice and leather notes you'll encounter here and the mouthfeel is tonic, tight and rich enough to stand up to game and red meats.",90,Mastrojanni 2008  Rosso di Montalcino,,,,
"Jaw-dropping on all fronts, this wine by the pioneering Franscioni family approaches regional perfection. Black plum fruit meets with dried violet and lavender on the extremely well-integrated nose, while a mineral tension frames the palate. Flavors of black plum and blackberry jam are cut by rocky earth and wild mint, and the acidity is vibrant but not overpowering.",97,Roar 2014 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"This wine offers fruit-forward aromas of raspberries, plum and cranberry. It drinks off dry (10g/L residual sugar) with abundant red fruit flavors and a light squeeze of tannins leading to herb flavors on the finish.",85,Original House Wine 2013 Mountain Merlot (America),,,,
"For a Provence rosé, this is dark in color, with a rich salmon-pink appearance. It is full, with a caramel flavor that gives a sweet edge to the crisp red fruits. The Castel family of Bordeaux owns this property.",87,Château Cavalier 2015 Cuvée Prestige Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"Floral and fruity up front with sweet lychee, stonefruit and jasmine flower notes, this is a refreshing wine with zesty acidity and a clean, grassy midpalate that's just a bit short on concentration.",84,Enjingi 2009 Graševina Welschriesling (Kutjevo),,,,
"Ripe banana, coconut, mango and guava aromas make for a showy entry in this bottling, but citrusy freshness keeps it in check. The palate show a clean line of lemony acidity that sears into the finish, cutting through hints of more tropical fruit.",88,Fess Parker 2016 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"This is dry and spicy, with a full character. Perfumed and rich, it's concentrated and packed with wild strawberry fruit. It finishes with intense acidity.",89,Château Beaulieu 2011 Château Beaulieu Rosé (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence),,,,
"Truffled earth and cranberry-strawberry envelop sizable oak and bittersweet tannin in this warm-vintage wine. On the more light-bodied side, it features savory tinges of black tea.",87,Bouchaine 2012 Pinot Noir (Carneros-Napa Valley),,,,
"Mirabelle is the darkest, chewiest, most tannic of the three clonal selection Pinots offered by Vidon. It's a Pinot in Cab clothing. Chewy, dense, ripe fruit keeps it all in proportion, a thick black cherry core with rings of chocolate. Think Saturn in a glass.",92,Vidon Vineyard 2009 Mirabelle Clone 115 Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),,,,
"This offers aromas of white spring flower, orchard fruit and almond. On the straightforward palate, a hint of mineral underscores pear and citrus.",87,Le Albare 2015 Monte Majore  (Soave Classico),,,,
"A fine Chardonnay, worthy of its reserve designation, at a fair price. It's dry, full-bodied and oaky, with concentrated pineapple, apricot and guava fruit flavors. You can drink it now—not too cold—but it will be better after two to three years in the bottle.",91,Rusack 2011 Reserve Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"This 100% Sangiovese opens with red-skinned berry and underbrush aromas. The easygoing palate evokes raspberry jam with a touch of cinnamon, framed by round tannins. Enjoy soon.",87,Nobilissima 2015  Chianti,,,,
"This cool-vintage wine offers aromas of vanilla, coconut, barrel spice, clove and red fruit. The palate is full of restrained cranberry flavors that show persistence.",88,Bunnell 2010 Discovery Vineyard Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"Here's a lovely red wine, soft and appealing, and perfect for drinking now. It's dry and silky in tannins, with intricately layered cherry, smoked meat, pepper and sandalwood flavors.",89,Peju 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"The Heintz Vineyard is on the outskirts of the AVA, really pushing toward the coast, with the expected cool-climate characteristics of fresh acidity and complex, savory tones. This wine wows in every way, from its notes of exotic coconut meat and apple pie to its tang of Meyer lemon, all accented by bergamot and anise. The spice rides a wave of body and length toward the finish, alongside an unmistakable streak of minerality. Hold through 2024.",96,Williams Selyem 2014 Heintz Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"From a vineyard that once belonged to the charitable Hospices de Chablis, this is a superrich wine for a Chablis, powered both by acidity and by beautiful ripe fruits. It is bright and tight in character, although it is the richness and the density of the wine that shows most strongly. Drink this powerful wine from 2020.",96,Domaine Christian Moreau Père et Fils 2013 Les Clos Grand Cru Cuvée Clos des Hospices  (Chablis),,,,
"With sweet berry, cherry and spice flavors, this is a fine wine for drinking now with everyday fare. It's soft and a little sweet, with bracing tannins.",85,Bogle 2009 Petite Sirah (California),,,,
"This soft wine is minimally oaky and combines quite ripe, figgy, almost honey-like fruit flavors with a vein of butter and almond. Fermented 90% in steel vats and 10% in oak barrels, it has a creamy texture and full body.",88,Hoopla 2013 Yountville Chardonnay (Yountville),,,,
"Very dry, tart and silky, this is a great Williams Selyem Pinot to drink now. It shows the classic elegance of the appellation, with nuanced flavors of raspberries, cherries, red currants, cloves, anise and pepper.",88,Williams Selyem 2006 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This successful Pinot Noir from a difficult vintage treads an exciting line: It contains subtle notes of tomato and beetroot, but that vegetativeness only adds an earthy complexity to the ripe flavors of black cherry and plum. It's a fancy, elegant wine to drink now, and should gain traction over the next 5–6 years.",93,Dutton-Goldfield 2010 McDougall Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"90-92 Firm and tannic, while there are also sweet berry fruits and black currant flavors. The acidity is important.",91,Château La Mission Haut-Brion 2010 Barrel sample La Chapelle de la Mission Haut-Brion  (Pessac-Léognan),,,,
"Aromas of ripe black-skinned berry and a whiff of cooking spice lift out of the glass. The solid straightforward palate offers black currant, dried cherry and clove framed in seasoned tannins.",87,Cantina Valle Tritana 2013 Tritano  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),,,,
"Dark and charred, with black cherry, black licorice and a burnt-oak element on the nose. The palate is thick and firm, with dark berry, herbal notes and some additional burnt char. Finishes with herbal flavors, olive notes and carob. An obvious Chilean Merlot; comes straight from central casting.",86,Arboleda 2008 Merlot (Aconcagua Valley),,,,
"A structured wine, this is full of firm tannins and has juicy fruit underneath. It has attractive acidity, some smoky flavors and a firm aftertaste. All this means the wine needs to develop, and it will be better to drink from 2017.",90,Château Thieuley 2014 Réserve Francis Courselle  (Bordeaux),,,,
"A barrel selection, the Suzanne's Reserve is more concentrated than its less expensive sibling (the Cali's Cuvée) but does not have as interesting a flavor set. Here you'll find the tangy cherry fruit is accompanied by sharp acids and chewy tannins. Although it is a 2004 the wine still seems wrapped up and refuses to let go. Give it plenty of air before drinking.",87,Left Coast Cellars 2004 Suzanne's Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Comprised of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot, this wine shows aromas of herbs, pencil lead, flowers and cherry, with light meaty notes. There's a elegance to the plum and cherry flavors along with a supple feel.",88,Bunchgrass 2011 Triolet Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Rich and soft, this has a creamy smooth texture, with notes of toast, ripe apple and quince. There is a good touch of acidity to this attractive, ready to drink wine.",86,Herdade Grande 2011 Colheita Seleccionada White (Alentejano),,,,
"A beautifully balanced wine, expressing a certain sweetness, this has a great line of acidity. It's full bodied, ripe and packed with spice and fruit, while remaining elegant and impressive.",91,Domaine Weinbach 2010 Cuvée Théo Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"There's no denying the wine's core strengths, which start with the bouquet's campfire and prune qualities and extend onto the palate, where peppy raspberry and plum flavors take over. This is a complete, stylish Rioja that's about halfway through the aging process. It's still juicy and agile, with licorice and raisin notes adding some sweetness. Drink now–2016.",90,Ramón Bilbao 1999 Gran Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"This non vintage white blend is composed of 50% Auxerrois, 40% Pinot Blanc, and 10% Pinot Gris. It has green apple and lemon pith aromas, lemon curd, apple juice and pastry flavors and a creamy finish.",89,Domaines Vinsmoselle NV Pinot Luxembourg White (Moselle Luxembourgeoise),,,,
"Aromas of mature dark berry, leather, black spice and a whiff of tar come together on this full-bodied red. The juicy, robust palate offers mature black cherry, fleshy raspberry, dark spice and licorice alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. The ripe fruit easily supports the warmth of alcohol that fills in the finish. Drink through 2023.",92,Cantina del Pino 2011 Ovello  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Made with a blend of Corvina, Oseleta and Cabernet Franc, this offers concentrated black fruit flavors layered with spicy pepper notes and a hint of tobacco that are backed up smooth, round tannins. Pair it with hearty risottos or semi-seasoned cheeses.",89,Tommasi 2011 Crearo della Conca d'Oro Red (Veronese),,,,
"On the fresh side, with crisp bright, lively acidity. Green fruits run well alongside apricot juice and lively vivacity. Good and attractive.",89,Thibert Père et Fils 2008 Vignes Blanches  (Pouilly-Fuissé),,,,
"This Nero d'Avola opens with mature black cherry, cinnamon and toasted almond aromas while the fresh, structured palate delivers juicy blackberry, raspberry jam and white pepper notes.

"Roughly three-fifths Merlot and two-fifths Cabernet, this well-made red has thick, supple, generous fruit. It seems to have been aged in a hefty amount of new oak, but it balances the fruit and and spice well. Look for plum, black cherry, smoke and toast notes on the full, round palate.",90,Golden Ridge 2009 Estate Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Though 28 g/L of residual sugar is indicated, this lushly fruity and thoroughly delicious wine does not seem at all sweet, and just barely off dry. Peaches and pears combine in a lightly spicy but intensely flavorful wine with a myriad of food pairing possibilities, notably Thai noodle dishes, or poultry with a fruit sauce.",90,David Hill 2014 Estate Gewürztraminer (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This is a mature, single-vineyard wine. Beautifully perfumed, it includes, unusually, a small percentage of white grapes (historically a field blend) that soften the tannins of the 90% Baga. The wine is spicy, concentrated, dense with black fruits and tannins. It is ready to drink.",94,Casca Wines 2012 Monte Cascas Vinha das Cardosas Red (Bairrada),,,,
"This is fairly mulchy on the nose, with an earthy prune aroma. It feels grabby and lean, with cranberry fruit flavor, bitterness and an herb accents. The finish stays murky, tart and mildly green.",82,Bodegas Escudero 2008 Becquer  (Rioja),,,,
"Round, chunky aromas of grapefruit and passion fruit settle on friendly and varietally correct. This is snappy and solid in feel, with lime, orange and nectarine flavors. An acid-driven finish holds the line and doesn't taste bitter or green.",87,Emina 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Rueda),,,,
"This is the winery's first bottling of this Bordeaux blending grape It is a curiosity that will be of interest to those in search of the unique and rare, but this does not convince me that the grape should be the centerpiece of a varietal wine. There's tangy, plummy fruit, searing acids and very astringent tannins. But the wine is incomplete—there's no middle.",85,Abacela 2005 Petit Verdot (Southern Oregon),,,,
"Light coffee and tea-like aromas emerge from the nose of this sharp and crisp Barbera d'Asti Superiore. The wine is compact, firm and the mouthfeel is characterized by fresh berry notes and crisp fruit on the close.",87,F.lli Trinchero 2007 Rico  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore),,,,
"For the first time these excellent grapes are being shown in a single-vineyard cuvée. It's a big, tannic, high-octane wine, with smooth, ripe and generous purple fruits. There is plenty of supporting acid, along with rather astringent tannins that carry a leafy note through the finish. Drink now–2019.",91,:Nota Bene 2010 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
This is an easy-drinking Faugères with lively accents of thyme and crushed purple florals to the ripe red fruit core. The mouth is vibrant and mouthwatering with strong acidity and a clean but somewhat tart finish. Drink now.,85,Domaine St Martin d'Agel 2009 Red (Faugères),,,,
"This fine wine has firm tannins and a solid feel from serious wood aging. The toast and spice flavors merge with the black fruits, the dark plums and the rich texture of this ripe wine. It is still young, needing further aging to soften those tannins. Drink from 2019.",91,Caves Aliança 2014 Aliança Reserva Red (Dão),,,,
"This wine displays assorted aromas of berry, plum, licorice, raspberry and smoked meat, searching for a bit more clarity but still providing plenty of intrigue. It's soft and sumptuous in feel with a pleasing texture and a tart finish.",90,Cinder 2013 Syrah,,,,
"From Clare Ranch Vineyard in the Templeton Gap, this bottling by Ryan Render shows rounded notes of boysenberry and cooked blackberry on the nose alongside strong licorice and mocha aromas. Blackberry and boysenberry also arise on the sip, with olive, pepper and pretty violet floral flavors, all framed by a solidly dry structure.",92,Rendarrio Vineyards 2013 The Rocker Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"Scented mellow notes of ripe yellow apple stream from the glass. On the palate they are displayed against an autolytic background that recalls both rye bread and short-crust pastry. The mouse is very fine and adds creamy allure to the dry light palate. This is dry, classy and rather sophisticated with a refreshing finish that leaves a lasting impression.",92,Boeckel 2014 Extra Brut Chardonnay Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),,,,
"Luscious notes of ripe stone fruit have tropical overtones of pineapple, with some musky notes on both the nose and palate. The ripeness of the pineapple is even more accented in the mouth where it contrasts with totally crisp lime acidity. This is exciting now but has the backbone to age beautifully through 2025 at least.",95,F X Pichler 2013 Dürnsteiner Kellerberg Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),,,,
"Fruity and balanced up front, this is juicy and fresh on the palate, and just the slightest bit rich and chewy. Loamy dark-berry fruit flavors are matched by chocolate and bitter coffee notes, while the finish is mellow, toasty and dark.",89,Manuel Manzaneque Suárez 2012 Ea Tempranillo (La Mancha),,,,
"A lovely, lush wine with bold, direct aromas of ripe cherry, cured meat, blackberry preserves and exotic spice. It presents a clean and fresh mouthfeel, with solid structure on the long finish.",93,Bonacchi 2007 Casalino  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"Hints of tropical fruit and white peach give this wine a warm, rounded character. It's smooth, with just a shot of acidity and a creamy, spicy texture. Drink now.",86,Maison Charles Père et Fils 2015  Mâcon-Villages,,,,
"Petit Chablis comes from the plateau above the main Chablis vineyards. As here, it offers a light fruity style with only the lightest minerality and much more in the way of apple and citrus flavors. Drink the wine from early 2017.",85,Pascal Bouchard 2015 Blancs Cailloux  (Petit Chablis),,,,
"This is a full-bodied, plushly textured wine that doesn't quite go over the top. Vanilla and dill notes accent blackberry and plum fruit before finishing firm, crisp and long. This has all the ingredients, it just needs time to come together. Drink 2020–2030.",92,Fox Creek 2013 Short Row Shiraz (McLaren Vale),,,,
"Pure but restrained violet, plum and berry aromas are on the money. This feels racy but also saturated, with kick as well as commendable overall balance. Flavors of plum, ripe tomato, schist and spice finish smooth, peppery, herbal and slightly warm, with a note of coffee. Drink through 2022.",93,Mas d'en Gil 2010 Clos Fontà Grenache-Carignan (Priorat),,,,
"Round, creamy apple aromas open things up. This is melony and soft in feel, with flavors of cider, lemon and lychee. A tropical-leaning finish is solid but suggestive of a wine in decline. Drink immediately.",86,Bodegas Núñez 2014 Andión Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"Perfumed in rose and violet, this full-bodied wine is leathery and somewhat dull on the palate, opting for savory elements over fruit.",85,J. Moss Wines 2012 Steffensen Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville),,,,
"Light and fruity, this is a crisply citrus wine, soft and fresh. Grapefruit and apricots are both there, showing the crisp and the rich side to this immediately attractive wine.",87,Quintas de Melgaço 2013 Lagar Alvarinho (Vinho Verde),,,,
This wine has very little going on aromatically and tastes slightly burnt.,80,3 Steves Winery 2008 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),,,,
"A hugely dense wine, with immense ripe black fruit and dusty tannins. The wine is balanced, rich and structured at the same time. Powered by a dark core, the wine has weight, intensity and a solid long-term future.",96,Barão de Vilar 2011 Vintage  (Port),,,,
"Inviting aromas of buttercream, vanilla bean and lemon custard-laced pastries draw the nose into this wine, made by three families. Two members of the group, Rich Aurilia and Dave Roberts, are former pro baseball players. It's very balanced on the palate, with white peach, honey and citrus, and a judicious amount of butter on the edges.",92,Red Stitch 2013 Sierra Mar Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
Aromas of licorice and barrel spice are light and elusive. The plum and dark-fruit flavors are tart and tangy with a velvety feel.,88,Market Vineyards 2011 Merval Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This easygoing wine opens with a cherry aroma, followed by leather and wet earth touches. Easy tannins and bright acids make it pair well with pasta or pizza.",85,Cielo 2011 Primi Soli Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),,,,
"Foresty, earthy aromas of leather and black fruits are rugged and a touch rustic. In the mouth, this is voluminous and chewy, with fresh acidity. Flavors of licorice, herbs, pepper, plum and blackberry finish with light herbal notes and bright acidity that will ensure a fairly long lifespan. Drink through 2024.",92,Bodega Catena Zapata 2012 Catena Alta Historic Rows Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"Harvested late but not sweet, this decadently rich and fruity wine pairs well with cheese or an equally opulent dish such as osso bucco or red wine risotto. It has grapey, jammy aromas and late-picked flavors like fig, plum and black raisin that glide along the palate. The alcohol is high, tempered by a velvety texture and moderate tannins.",92,Three 2014 Mazzoni-Live Oak Zinfandel (Contra Costa County),,,,
"This blend is 44% Cab Franc, 31% Cabernet Sauvignon, with the rest Merlot. It's stubbornly closed, with aromas of tar, earth and rubber ball rather than fruit. Some brambly berry flavors can be found, but the finish seems hard and slightly bitter.",86,O•S Winery 2012 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Made in a drier, earthier style than most Oakville Cabs, this one emphasizes structure over fruity power. It's a sleek, elegant wine, brimming with tannins and acids that frame blackberry, currant, mineral and dried herb flavors, with a touch of raisins in the finish.",90,Emilio's Terrace 2006 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),,,,
"Apple mash and salty oak are on offer in this light-styled estate wine sourced from several of the producer's single vineyards. Mellow in texture, it's intense on the finish, with a snap of anise and nutmeg.",87,Thomas George 2014 Estate Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"The flavors of ripe yellow pear combine with a yeasty edge of herbal spice: there is a pleasantly bitter undertone and lots of freshness on a slender, yet expressive body.",89,Hager Matthias 2014 Urgestein Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),,,,
"Aromas of wood shop, espresso, toast, clove and a hint of dried black cherry all carry over to the palate. Bracing, astringent tannins give it an abrupt, drying finish.",85,Petrelli 2012 Centopietre Red (Salice Salentino),,,,
"Situated in the valley on the other side of the hill from Bandol and the sea, this estate has produced a ripe, full-bodied wine. The high proportion of Mourvèdre in the blend contributes a perfumed character and some structure. It is a complete, ripe and concentrated wine that will age, and will be better from late 2016.",90,Domaines Bunan 2015 Moulin des Costes Rosé (Bandol),,,,
"Lilacs and wisteria combine for a floral and approachable nose in this clonal study, which is also loaded with clove, peppercorn, rosemary and elderberry aromas. It's soft and lush on the palate, with rich plum and black cherry flavors leveled by notes of anise, potpourri, fresh mint and Earl Grey tea.",93,Fess Parker 2015 Pommard Clone Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Aratás puts more bottle age on their Petite Sirah than most, and the extra maturity shows. Wonderful oak spices fill the aroma and extend into the fully ripe and richly fruity flavors of this big but beautifully sculpted wine. It has a lot of new oak influence and that is perfect to match the big body and monumental tannins that give the wine such impact.",93,Aratás 2012 Shake Ridge Ranch Petite Sirah (Amador County),,,,
"This gorgeous super Tuscan opens with inky dark concentration and bright aromas of dark cherry and prune. It feels soft, lush and creamy in the mouth. Pair it with stewed game meat.",90,Tenuta di Biserno 2011 Insoglio del Cinghiale Red (Toscana),,,,
"Corinne Guisez scored a great success with her 2000. The wine is finely polished, shining, with its generous, deeply concentrated fruits and fine perfumes. The tannins show through the fruit, while the wood flavors hide much more discreetly in the background.",90,Château Faugères 2000  Saint-Émilion,,,,
"The freshness of green citrus, pale yellow fruit and dewy summer meadows plays on the nose. The earthier palate focuses on textured savoriness reminiscent of miso and soy, counterpointed by lemon freshness. Savor slowly so you do not miss anything going on in the concentrated, slender body. It finishes on a savory lemon note.",92,F X Pichler 2016 Loibner Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),,,,
"Aged four years in oak, this stately wine is adorned with layers of maple sugar, toast and smoked nuts, but its racy sour-cherry flavors shine through brightly. The backbone of this wine is taut with acidity, but bold, richly textured mouthfeel puts the palate at ease. It's sumptuous and revitalizing.",90,Shaw 2008 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Very pale in color, this '07 Gewurz, tasted just 6 months after harvest, was a bit muted. Airing brings out rich, spicy aromas and flavors ranging from green apples and peaches to dates, vanilla, wildflowers and dusty spices. The wine was barrel-fermented.",87,Toulouse 2007 Gewürztraminer (Anderson Valley),,,,
"Made in a cooler, lighter-bodied style, this wine appeals with cedar and wild strawberry, integrating the oak and letting the tannins mellow in the background.",86,Greenwood Ridge 2014 Scherrer Vineyards Zinfandel (Sonoma County),,,,
"The abundant minerality of this Mendocino Chenin Blanc hits first, followed by clean flavors and a subtle layer of honey on the finish.",87,Graziano 2011 Chenin Blanc (Mendocino County),,,,
"A supple, easygoing Pinot Noir, with modest weight in the mouth but assertive notes of cola, earth and cherries. The aromas are slightly perfumed and confected, but the flavors are sturdier and more savory in nature. Drink now.",87,Giant Steps 2010 Sexton Vineyard Pinot Noir (Yarra Valley),,,,
"Winemaker Kim Engle's wines always stand out in a flight, and this curiously spicy, sepia-toned Gewürztraminer is no exception. Aromatic, with notes of orange rind, rose petal and potpourri, it's also intensely flavored with black tea and spice that are pleasantly astringent. Not a classic Gewürztraminer by any means, but uniquely delicious.",89,Bloomer Creek 2011 Tanzen Dame Dry Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Cooked cherries, hard cinnamon candies, rhubarb pie and smoked meats arise on the nose of this bottling from the Malibu winery. Ripe cherries, anise and pepper also combine for a pleasant, easy-drinking palate.",88,Dolin 2012 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Neutral, fresh and regular on the nose, with mild white fruit aromas. The palate is sound but fleshy, with somewhat bland apple and pear flavors. Clear and solid on the finish, and overall you won't find anything glaringly wrong with this basic Chardonnay.",85,Gracia de Chile 2008 Reserva Chardonnay (Bío Bío Valley),,,,
"Horsey blackberry and cherry aromas come with a note of latex. In the mouth, this is choppy and abrupt. Raw berry flavors finish with a mild sensation of heat.",85,Borsao 2015 Tocado Garnacha (Campo de Borja),,,,
"Rich and fruity, this wine shows warm white fruit and a touch of spice. The wine is soft, its currant and pink grapefruit flavors lifted by acidity but with a rounded finish.",87,Château de Fontenille 2012  Entre-Deux-Mers,,,,
"Considering how pale this Pinot pours, it's surprising how rich it tastes. Wrapped into the delicate, silky texture are peppery, spicy flavors of cherry and raspberry toffee, root beer, mocha and caramelized brown sugar flavors. Exotic now, it's probably at its best early on.",88,La Fenêtre 2006 Cargasacchi Jalama Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"A finely textured wine, with its acidity and apple fruits laced with wood and spice. It is rich, full in the mouth, a wine that has great pure flavors, very clear right to the end. Screwcap.",90,Domaine Laroche 2009 Les Vaillons Vieilles Vignes  (Chablis),,,,
"This leads with vibrant and fresh aromas, recalling cut grass, herbs, lime zest and citrus, with whiffs of tropical fruit. The palate brings tart, zingy, mouthwatering citrus flavors, with a lightly creamy feel on the finish.",90,Novelty Hill 2015 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Fruity and simple, this Merlot tastes like the wine equivalent of a candied dessert pastry. It may not be technically sweet, but it's so extracted in raspberries, cherries and caramelized oak that it seems sweet.",85,Houdini 2008 Merlot (Oakville),,,,
"Unusual but enticing, it opens with aromas of smoke, mineral and stone fruit. The savory palate offers yellow peach, golden apple and Bartlett pear accented with notes of clove, nut and nutmeg. It's linear and well-balanced. George Wines, Zancanella.",90,Petrucco 2012 Friulano (Colli Orientali del Friuli),,,,
"This wine smells baked and rasiny, and the bouquet brings charcoal and toast notes into play. It feels mature and ready, with raisin, molasses, chocolate and rooty berry flavors. Ripe and ready on the finish. The blend is Garnacha, Carignan and Cabernet Sauvignon. Drink now.",87,Celler Arché Pagès 2007 Bonfill Red (Empordà),,,,
"Made with Pinot Noir, this opens with aromas of toast and roasted walnut. The palate offers ripe apple skin, dried berry, vanilla and pastry accompanied by a creamy perlage.",88,Cà di Frara 2007 Oltre Rosé Riserva Sparkling (Vino Spumante),,,,
"There is both wonderful bite and density to this great wine. It has a weighty texture full of ripe, rich fruit. At the same time, the wine is bone dry and crisp with acidity. It' s just beginning to mature, and while enjoyable now, it's better to wait until 2016.",95,Domaines Schlumberger 2009 Kessler Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"This wine is tight, textured and still young. With crisp, mineral acidity and bright citrus and white stone fruits, it needs to age to show its full, rich potential. Drink from 2018.",89,Vignerons des Terres Secrètes 2015  Mâcon La Roche Vineuse,,,,
"Musky pear aromas start things off, but the flavors are in sharper focus—a blend of pears and green herbs, finishing with a touch of anise. A bit sweet-tasting, so serve well-chilled as an apéritif. Best Buy.",84,La Francesca 2001 Pinot Grigio (Veneto),,,,
"This rich and full-bodied wine is a great candidate for aging. Stash it away in a cool place until at least 2018 when its slightly rough and drying tannins should begin to mellow and let all the ripe fruit and complex spice flavors come out. It's blended with a touch of Mourvèdre for a spicy, earthy accent.",91,Morse 2012 Estate Reserve Syrah (Amador County),,,,
"Over-the-top spice, with a nod to lychee fruits, gives the feeling of drinking liquid candy. This medium-sweet wine needs no aging.",85,Cave de Beblenheim 2012 Baron de Hoen Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"Despite being under the ownership of Cava house Freixenet, Henri Abelé remains little known. This Brut nonvintage is a finely made wine, on the sweeter side of Brut, but certainly well-balanced and crisp. For a Champagne, it is also a good value.",86,Henri Abele NV Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"Rusty in color, gritty, earthy aromas of mushroom open the aromas of this solid feeling Pinot. The modest acidity makes the palate seem a bit flat, while baked—slightly burnt—flavors of peppered berry fruits finish modest and dry in feel.",86,Indomita 2014 Duette Premium Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"Fresh blackberry fruit is lifted by thyme, fennel and tobacco on the nose of this fruity, herbal bottling, further accented by cedar, black olive and peppercorn notes. Its blackberry-rich palate is balanced by dry tannins and coffee and gamy flavors.",88,EOS 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast),,,,
"Aromas of briary berries mixed with tomato leaf set up a compact bumpy palate. Saucy herbal tomatoey berry flavors are commonplace, while overall this is energetic and likable.",87,Domaine Bousquet 2015 Finca Lalande Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"A round, solidly made wine, with Bing cherry flavors. However, the middle seems to disappear and, as a result, the following tannins feel a bit harsh. —P.G.",86,Sagelands 2000 Four Corners Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Shows the ripe voluptuousness that this vineyard always brings to Pinot Noir, as well as near-perfect balance. So rich, so delicious, it's hard not to drink the whole bottle. Waves of raspberry and cherry preserves, date-nut bread, white pepper, brown sugar, vanilla and toast are wrapped in a silky texture, with gorgeous acidity and smooth tannins. Drink over the next six years.",95,Bonaccorsi 2010 Fiddlestix Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"This light, fruity and refreshing wine is made from organic grapes and pairs nicely with linguine and clams or pizza bianca. Although matured in French oak barrels, it's more delicate than usual, tasting of apples, baking spice and fresh lemon.",87,Bonterra 2015 Viognier (California),,,,
"From the estate that saved the Pecorino grape from extinction, this focused and refined wine intrigues from the start, with its floral aromas of jasmine and acacia, layered with whiffs of balsamic herbs. The palate demonstrates lovely energy and elegance, with peach and tropical fruit flavors accented by mineral and almond.",90,Tenuta Cocci Grifoni 2012 Colle Vecchio  (Offida Pecorino),,,,
A short wood-aging has given this rich wine a creamy smooth character. That balances with the ripe yellow and tropical fruits that are cut with acidity. It is still a young wine and will certainly be better from 2018.,88,Boas Quintas 2016 Fonte do Ouro Encruzado (Dão),,,,
"A hearty addition of 16% Semillon is in this white, which is floral with peach and apricot. Fleshy plushness dominates alongside a simple layering of acidity that keeps it balanced, taking on further fruit components of tropical pineapple and mango.",86,Duckhorn 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"With only 12.5% alcohol by volume, this young-vine Chardonnay is one of the lightest, most delicate Chardonnays the winery has ever produced. But it's not shy on flavor, delivering waves of tropical fruits, peaches, vanilla and buttered toast. Long and sweet in honey, it finishes dry and racy. Defines the new elegant style of Chardonnay.",92,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2011 Kent the Younger Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Soundly made, straightforward Washington Chardonnay, with chunky, forward, green-apple fruit married to some butterscotchy oak. Full malolactic fermentation brings the fruit forward and keeps the acids low.",86,Bridgman 2000 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Zesty, full-bodied and expansive on the palate, this is a wine that comes around in time, in the glass and in the bottle or decanter. Briny and dancing a fine line between brawn and beauty, it paints a picture of classic green and yellow apple and subtle vanilla spice, with a tropical flirtation happening in the background. Structured, it should cellar well, through 2020.",90,Patz & Hall 2012 Zio Tony Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Made from Cinsault grapes, this is a reductive, salty and somewhat intense wine at first, that settles nicely into developed flavors of ripe strawberry, peach and vanilla. With substantive weight and breadth, it offers a pleasing texture and body without ever getting bogged down. This is a fine wine for the table.",88,VGS Chateau Potelle 2016 Riviera Rosé (Sonoma County),,,,
There's a lot of barrel influence in this acidic Viognier that finishes with a metallic taste.,81,LangeTwins 2010 Viognier (Clarksburg),,,,
"There is no mistaking the grape variety of this rich, medium-sweet wine. It has rosewater and lychee fruit flavors, along with a touch of vanilla and acidity. It is also a powerful, concentrated wine that will age, so drink now and until 2020.",91,Domaine Albert Mann 2010 Steingrubler Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"This is a nicely balanced, tightly constructed effort, a Merlot that will surprise anyone who has not tasted Washington Merlot in this price range. It is miles apart from the herbal, stemmy Merlots of other New World regions, or the vapid, watery $15 junk that comes from our neighbor to the south. This is ripe, full, meaty, structured, laden with plum and cherry, spice and just a hint of herb.",89,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2005 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"The entry-level wine from Esclans is more like what you might expect from a Provençal rosé, offering crisp berry and peach fruit and a mouthwatering finish.",89,Château d'Esclans 2007 Whispering Angel Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"Founded in 1986, Tenuta Rocca is a hilltop property in Monforte d'Alba that overlooks some of the most beautiful landscapes in the Langhe. This wonderful Barolo opens with sweet smells of candle wax, nutmeg, ginger, chocolate and bright red fruit. The wine imparts a squeaky clean, polished feel in the mouth.",92,Tenuta Rocca 2006  Barolo,,,,
"This structured wine is firm with tannins and stalky black currant fruit. It's dry, with a bitter edge from high extraction. A smoky character indicates aggressive wood aging and the need to soften further. Drink from 2020.",88,Château Les Gatines 2015  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,,,,
"Tasty and easy to drink, this has blackberry, black currant and cola flavors that finish seemingly sweet and oaky. It's an intense wine that doesn't seem likely to make gains with age, so drink up after an hour or two in the decanter.",87,Kunde 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"This is finely structured, a tense wine with great fruits and an intense texture. It's tight while bursting with fruit. The structure is complex, dense and very mineral in character. It is a wine that will need many years, so drink from 2022. The production is tiny, and what is not fit for this wine goes into the Dillon Clarté wine.",96,Château La Mission Haut-Brion 2013  Pessac-Léognan,,,,
"This delicious blend is 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Syrah, sourced from the Old Stones vineyard. Young, tight and peppery, it gains briary boysenberry flavors as it opens up, along with hints of soy and umami. A streak of maple syrup richness fills out the finish.",96,K Vintners 2010 The Creator Old Stones Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"An herbaceous wine, smoothed out by spicy wood. The wine is balanced, the wood a delicious extra to pear and green plum-skin fruit flavors. Very perfumed, it demands fish with a sauce or scallops.",88,Château Haut Bertinerie 2006  Premieres Côtes de Blaye,,,,
"Gritty and raw with jammy fruit flavors, this Nergoamaro is very representative of the overripe, sweet style of Southern Italy. Aromas include hickory smoke, root beer, tobacco, leather and black pepper.",85,Mocavero 2005 Negroamaro (Salento),,,,
"From this family-owned estate in the heart of great Port country, this wine is both richly structured and packed with fruit. It has solid black fruits that are laced with intense acidity to keep the wine bright and crisp. At the same time, the tannins and the firm texture will allow it to age. Drink from 2019.",91,Quinta de la Rosa 2015 Red (Douro),,,,
"At first quite tart, almost sour, with a strong yeasty aroma, this unusual wine can seem simple and dilute. Give it several hours to open up and it rewards you with delicate yet persistent flavors of citrus and stone, with refreshing acidity. Such low-alcohol white wines can be a delight with shellfish and other appetizers.",88,Roots 2012 Deux Vert Vineyard Melon,,,,
"A blend of Syrah and Grenache from organic vineyards gives a herbal, very southern taste to this ripe wine. It is still young and showing both acidity and a firm structure. As it develops further, it will get a rich, full and plummy character. Drink from 2017.",89,Domaine des Aspras 2013 Les Trois Frères Red (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"With its massively concentrated blackberry fruit framed in ample new oak, this bears a bit of resemblance to some Australian Shirazes. It's mouthfilling but supple, with nuances of Christmas spices like cinnamon, clove and anise that linger on the long finish. Drink 2014–2023.",93,Cave de Tain 2009 Gambert de Loche  (Hermitage),,,,
"This is powerful stuff, packed tightly with tannins, juicy black fruits and a solid, concentrated structure. The wine is ripe and spicy, with a touch of pepper from the alcohol. It is also dense, still firm and needs further time to develop. Drink from 2016.",90,Herdade das Servas 2012 Colheita Seleccionada Red (Alentejano),,,,
"A gorgeous effort, awash in high-toned floral aromatics, sharply penetrating, and leading to a densely-packed palate of waxy fruit, honeyed spice, Meyer lemon, citrus and stone fruit. Rich, lush, concentrated and long—what more can you ask from a Viognier?",92,RoxyAnn 2009 Viognier (Rogue Valley),,,,
"Generously ripe and creamy, it has layers of wood giving way to a beautiful, smooth texture. It's dense and complex, although a crisper citrus element gives a fresher side to this broad, rich wine. Drink from 2016.",91,Château Haut-Bergey 2012  Pessac-Léognan,,,,
"Alluring white-pepper spice, with nuances of dried thyme and seductive cherry fruit, make this a compelling choice with more depth than force. This is subtle and velvety, quietly convincing and very long. Firm yet ripe tannins provide structure and ageability. This will be even more elegant with a few years of cellaring; drink 2016–2020.",93,Krutzler 2011 Reserve Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),,,,
The headiness of rose petal irrepressible and dominates the nose and palate. This has the full varietal force of Traminer and is ideal for those who love medium acidity and the floral style of this fragrant wine.,89,Proidl 2012 Senftenberg Traminer (Niederösterreich),,,,
"Toasty, charred, fiery aromas of black fruits are anything but shy. This feels tannic in general, with softness around the edges of the palate. Flavors of prune, spice cake and coffee finish toasty and warm, with lasting, hard tannins. Drink through 2023.",89,Vatan 2013  Toro,,,,
This gold-colored stale-smelling Torrontés smells like old apple juice. A chunky flat palate offers bland oxidized bitter flavors. Remnants of apple barely help a bitter finish.,81,Cuatro Vacas Gordas 2015 Torrontés (Mendoza),,,,
"This wine is textured and fruity. Crisp citrus and red-currant fruits are layered with bright acidity and a refreshing aftertaste. The wine could do with a few more months before drinking, so wait until late 2016.",85,Château Cazeau 2015 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),,,,
"I sense some sappy black cherry fruit in here, but it's buried in heavily-toasted barrels and a reductive, plastic flavor that takes over and won't let go. If you give it plenty of extra air time it smoothes out slightly.",85,Silvan Ridge 2005 Reserve Syrah (Rogue Valley),,,,
"This rosé sparker opens with a pale pink color and pretty aromas of stone fruit, pink grapefruit and toasted bread. It feels soft and creamy with tightly spaced and elegant perlage.",88,Ronco Calino NV Brut Rosé Radijan Sparkling (Franciacorta),,,,
"This wine makes reference to certain vineyards in France's cult Côte-Rôtie. The flavors are immaculate, suggesting fully ripened blackberries and currants, grilled wild mushrooms, black pepper and sweet oak. The tannins are thick and tough, but beautiful enough to warrant aging. One troubling aspect is acidity. It's very strong, and may take some time to smoothen out.",88,Westerly 2011 Côte Blonde Syrah (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),,,,
"The showy nose on this wine, which is bolstered by 5% Malbec, is both fruit-forward and extremely floral, with plum blossoms, cola and blueberry juice. The palate is densely layered and firmly structured, with flavors of caramel, vanilla, anise-laced blueberry pie and minty herbs. Drink 2017–2025.",92,Brecon Estate 2013 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast),,,,
"This Zin has candied, fruit punch flavors of cherries, licorice, raisins, brown sugar and cinnamon. It's a robust wine, mouthfilling and heady, that's best paired with barbecue.",85,Felten Cellars 2012 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),,,,
"Apple and peach flavors are mixed with a tangy character, leavened with notes of almond and toast. With its attractive maturity, it is ready to drink.",87,Henri Schoenheitz 2009 Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"Surprisingly silky on the palate, this approachable but elegant Pinot Grigio is a great value. Its punchy tangerine and lemon flavors are crisp and widely appealing, but there's also a nuanced slick of minerality on the midpalate. Drink now through 2019.",89,Starling Castle 2015 Pinot Grigio (Pfalz),,,,
"A fairly new player on the Napa Valley scene, this uses the talents of winemakers Cary Gott and Philippe Melka. The wine opens in luxurious aromas of baked blackberry cobbler and spicy cinnamon-clove. Mouthfillingly generous in fruit and texture, it's soft and approachable, serving as a nice representative of the vintage.",90,Davis Estates 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Dolcetto San Rocco is a clean and elegant wine with a less obvious aromatic offering of forest berry, blueberry and spice. The wine is bright and tonic in the mouth with a touch of firmness on the close that helps keep the mouth refreshed.",87,Giacosa Fratelli 2008 San Rocco  (Dolcetto d'Alba),,,,
"A blend of Grenache (65%), Mourvèdre (25%) and Syrah, this suggests peppery spices, stewed raspberries, game and high-toned spices. The palate is the star, full bodied, textured and richly flavored. An orange peel accent leads to a warm finish.",92,Rôtie Cellars 2012 Southern Blend Red (Washington),,,,
"Just lightly spicy, this is a simple, gentle wine. It is on the dry side, and hints at apple and pear flavors. There's a light acidity on the finish. Screwcap.",84,Gustave Lorentz 2012 Réserve Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"Cheerful, light white aromas of citrus—lemon and orange mainly—lead on this white blend from Patras. On the palate, it's refreshing but offers some depth in its lemon and orange muscat flavors. Simple but appealing, and at an excellent price.",85,Achaia Clauss 2006 Demestica White (Patras),,,,
"Olsen vineyard Syrah and Upland vineyards Grenache combine in equal proportions, making a compelling blend that nicely counterpoints the winery's La Fraternité red. Here it's all about blue fruits, especially plums, along with some earthy, barnyard flavors. The structure and aromatics are outstanding, and the acidity of the vintage suggests this wine is the one to cellar, while the other wine is the one to gulp.",93,Kevin White 2011 En Hommage Syrah-Grenache (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Though not labeled as such, this could be a varietal Cabernet Franc (80%). Dried herb, tobacco and wood spice aromas lead to well balanced, expressive dried black cherry flavors that stretch out on the finish. The aromas and flavors don't quite sync up but it still brings a lot of appeal.",90,DiStefano 2012 Sogno Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"From 100% estate-grown Calistoga fruit, this tiny-production wine is well-composed in compost, grilled mushroom and meaty undertones, the sturdy structure and ripe body robust and integrated. Cinnamon and clove dot the lengthy finish. This wine will benefit from more time in bottle; drink best 2019–2024.",91,Poggi Wines 2014 Twin Palms Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Very firm, this is a structured, relatively austere wine, with lots of minerality and tightness. The green fruits are  pierced with acidity, but also very fresh. A wine that needs time, give this at least 5–6 years. Screwcap.",93,Domaine Laroche 2005 Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis),,,,
"A bit rough at first, with aromas of burnt field, corn and haystack. It gets fruitier with time, and the palate is smooth despite offering a lot of citrus and pineapple flavors. Finishes both lively and a touch creamy, with tang and vitality.",86,Leyda 2009 Falaris Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Leyda Valley),,,,
"86–88. Barrel sample. This is a very ripe wine, that's perhaps overripe in its soft, fruity character. It is very full in the mouth with gentle tannins.",87,Château Mongravey 2012 Barrel Sample  (Margaux),,,,
"The Colli Euganei is an up-and-coming wine region located in a volcanic chain of hills outside the city of Padua. This expression of Moscato is sweet and enduring, with aromas of yellow rose and jasmine.",88,La Montecchia 2009 Donna Daria Moscato Giallo (Colli Euganei),,,,
"Simple and watery, it has oaky flavors of citrus fruits and peaches. There's not much going on, but it is dry and crisp in acidity.",82,Dillon 2011 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Yountville),,,,
"Zippy lemon and grapefruit flavors are limned with honey and lanolin in this delicately off-dry Riesling. Vivacious and light-footed, it's a uniquely nuanced wine with a lingering slate-edged finish.",89,Kirsten 2014 Wolkentanz Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"The aromas of orange and mineral are uncomplicated and friendly. It feels pure and offers good flow, with apple, lime, mineral, white pepper and anise flavors. Fruity, dry and composed on the finish, this is great wine for patio sipping or pairing with seafood.",88,Viña Costeira 2011 White (Ribeiro),,,,
"Shades of smoke, dried herbs and nut skins add savory tones to this dry Riesling. The palate builds intensity on the midpalate with layers of fresh apple, lime skin and underripe stone fruit, bolstered by sprightly tangerine-laced acidity.",87,Dr. Konstantin Frank 2011 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Minty new wood aromas on a wine that shows both great tannins and sweet wood. The fruit is still to show, but promises fresh plum flavors that will be delicious and juicy. This is a ripe, concentrated wine.",96,Château Beau-Séjour Bécot 2009  Saint-Émilion,,,,
"Light red in color and smelling like raspberries, this wine adds earthy, spicy flavors while rounding out with red cherry notes and firm tannins that tend to bolster an otherwise relaxed texture. It has good balance and will be versatile with food.",86,Rivino 2012 Estate Sangiovese (Mendocino),,,,
"A very pale peach color, this wine brings bright aromas of strawberry Jolly Rancher, cherry and kiwi. It drinks just a hair off dry, with tart fruit flavors, providing plenty of easy-drinking pleasure.",88,Airfield Estates 2016 Sangiovese Rosé (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Delicately scented, this opens with subtle aromas of yellow spring flower and a whiff of citrus. The vibrant palate offers crisp Golden Delicious apple, grapefruit and mineral alongside zesty acidity. A delicate note of white almond signals the finish.",88,Pievalta 2014  Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore,,,,
"This barrel fermented Viognier delivers an intense nose mixing scents of flowers (lily of the valley), lime skin, green pineapple and a dash of papaya. Cool, crisp and utterly delicious, it is a perfect sipping wine, elegantly structured and under 14% alcohol.",88,Viento 2006 Lonesome Spring Ranch Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"The wine is rich, bringing together two great white grapes. Both give the ripe smooth texture, while the Alvarinho also brings in its crisper charms. Pear and green-plum flavors dominate this intense and concentrated wine. Drink from late 2017.",89,DFJ Vinhos 2016 DFJ Alvarinho-Chardonnay White (Lisboa),,,,
"Piccini's top wine is this super Tuscan that puts 60% Sangiovese with Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot in a successful blend of tobacco, earth and dark fruit flavors. The '99 is firmer in structure than the '97, a reflection of the vintage.",90,Valiano 1999 Vino in Musica Sangiovese (Toscana),,,,
"This rich wine is approaching maturity. Secondary animal aromas, dried fruit and richness are showing well, allowing this ripe wine to shine. The warm 2009 vintage comes out in the density and the dusty tannins. This is ready to drink.",90,Château Malescasse 2009  Haut-Médoc,,,,
"Named after the mighty Republic of Venice, Serenissima opens with sharp effervescence and bright aromas of citrus and white flower. This easy effort is crisp and clean on the finish.",85,Serenissima NV Extra Dry  (Prosecco),,,,
"Quite light in color, this bargain bottling shows Anjou pear, apple blossoms and fragrant Pink Lady apple flesh on the nose. It's dainty on the palate, with touches of lime juice, chalk and citrus pith.",87,The Divining Rod 2014 Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Shows cherry, raspberry and spice flavors that finish off-dry and rich in citrusy acids. Good with ham, sausage or pork in a fruit sauce.",84,Pope Valley Winery 2006 Bella Rosa Sangiovese (Napa Valley),,,,
"Give this lusty young Cabernet a few years to let the parts mellow. Right now, it's tannic and sharp, with black currant and blackberry jam flavors, and the oak hasn't been integrated with the fruit. 2011–2014.",87,Hanna 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Food friendly and simple, this possesses a uniquely firm structure, with tonic perlage and spicy notes of white pepper and field flower. It's bright, fresh and very dry on the close.",87,Masottina NV Brut  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
"A whiff of cellar floor, camphor and grilled herb aromas lead the nose while the tightly wound, no-frills palate offers red cherry, pomegranate and white pepper. Assertive, close-grained tannins provide the framework while a hint of grilled sage closes the finish.",88,Beni di Batasiolo 2013  Barbaresco,,,,
"Notes of sweet vanilla and biscuit crumbs add a warm, sweet touch to the nose and palate of this elegant Bordeaux-style blend. Bright acidity accentuates the flavors of tart red plums and raspberries along with a flurry of fine-grained yet penetrating tannins that linger.",88,Imagine Moore 2007 TRUTH Red Table Wine Red (Finger Lakes),,,,
"For the first time this reserve-level Gamache Cabernet includes grapes from the Ciel du Cheval vineyard as well as both the Champoux and estate vineyards. It's 100% varietal, drawing upon equal portions of fruit from all three, and it's a magnificent combination. Powerful, sleek, dense and textural, the wine explodes from the glass, muscular and thick with black fruits and ripe tannins. Highlights of black tea, espresso and smoke add layers of interest to a lengthy finish.",93,Gamache 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Licorice and char on the nose hint at size and ripeness, but the palate does not deliver. Tart raspberry and red-plum flavors are sweet for a fleeting moment and then decidedly sour, while the finish is bland. Shows a few positives but overall it's too snappy and sharp for Malbec.",83,Tupun 2005 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"This smooth, ripe wine comes from organic grapes grown in clay and stone soil that adds a mineral edge. Spice balances with citrus and red-plum fruits to give a lively wine with a perfumed aftertaste.",90,Château la Mascaronne 2015 Quat'Saisons Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"A blend of Nero di Troia and Cabernet Sauvignon, this conveys aromas of scorched earth, cedar, black currant, leather and game. The palate is showing some age, offering dried plum, mature blackberry, graphite, roasted coffee bean and licorice but not much fruit richness. It finishes on an astringent note.",86,Torrevento 2009 Kebir Red (Puglia),,,,
"The best red Fusion in memory, this wine combines 60% Syrah, 20% Petite Sirah, 17% Zinfandel and 3% Alicante Bouschet into a leathery, brambly package of big-boned intensity rich in blue and black fruit. Cherry and chocolate intermingle in pleasing ways, a hearty wine for the table, especially alongside Liberty duck.",89,Borra 2011 Fusion Red (Lodi),,,,
"A sniff of truffle introduces this light but interesting wine. It's still youthful and tight, with tart fruit conjuring up sour cherry pie. Another couple of years in the bottle would put the optimal drinking between 2018 and 2020.",87,Tinhorn Creek 2012 Oldfield Series Pinot Noir (Okanagan Valley),,,,
"Light notes of pomegranate and hibiscus intertwine with Earl Grey tea and lavender on the nose of this wine from one of the region's most famous producers. There's lots of California chaparral spice on the nose, with aniseed, wild fennel and a cinnamon character decorating the cranberry, pomegranate and light strawberry flavors.",92,Talley 2013 Stone Corral Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),,,,
"As the top tier wine from this producer, this Pinot sees 10 months in new French oak which gives an inital char to the nose. With time in the glass this opens with notes of coffee-dusted red and black cherries. The medium-bodied palate is round and creamy in feel, with fuzzy, crushed-velvet tannins giving texture to the ripe cherry and racy currant flavors. A dusting of cocoa closes the finish.",89,Brys 2012 Artisan Series Pinot Noir (Old Mission Peninsula),,,,
"This is a very concentrated, firm and tannic wine but also so ripe and almost sweet in flavor that it achieves good balance. Lush ripe berries and black cherries coat the palate, while a velvety texture adds great structure for an appetizing and gripping mouthfeel. Barbera, Petit Verdot, Zinfandel and Petite Sirah grapes form the blend.",92,Rubino Estates Winery 2014 Ferrario Famiglia Collection Red (Livermore Valley),,,,
"Herbal and excessive in wood tannins, this has strong elements of jalapeño and pepper amidst a full-bodied expression of black plum and chocolate.",85,Troll Bridge 2010 Password Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Starts off with wet stone and lime aromas, then folds in Granny Smith flavors on the palate, giving it just the right mix of mineral, citrus and apple. It's lightweight but potent, with a lean but wiry frame. Drink now–2018.",88,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch) 2010 Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"This Bordeaux-style blend is three fifths Cabernet Sauvignon, and one fifth each Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Winemaker Charlie Hoppes goes for a big-boned, oaky, deeply fruited style. The structure (tannins, acids, barrel flavors) is in place to support the dark, cassis fruit flavors. Highlights of violets, licorice and clean earth add welcome details.",92,Market Vineyards 2010 Basis Points Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A proprietary red blend, nonvintage and nonappellation-specific beyond California, this is a soft, thin rendition of Tempranillo and friends, boasting notes of game and pepper that might do well alongside a roast chicken (or duck) coated in buttery herbs.",85,Riaza NV Vina Selecta Red (California),,,,
"This proprietary blend combines 52% Cabernet Franc, 34% Merlot and 14% Cabernet Sauvignon, another in its line of Aaron Pott-made wines. It's lovable in its austerity and varietal suggestions of dried herb, cedar and green bean. Dusty, soft tannins support a full-bodied, straightforward structure.",89,Blackbird Vineyards 2013 Paramour Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Almost in the Douro Superior, this structured wine speaks strongly of the tough growing conditions in its powerful tannins and dry core. At the same time, it has rich blackberry fruit, and a layer of intense acidity. It will be ready to drink from 2018.",90,Messias 2011 Vinha de Santa Barbara Red (Douro),,,,
"The small Beaujolais cru of Chénas is next door to Moulin à Vent. As this wine shows, it has the same firm structure and ripe fruit. The wine from the cru's chateau is dense, smoky and has plenty of firm tannins. It is a wine to age, so drink from 2019.",89,Château de Chénas 2015  Chénas,,,,
"The Rizzi family of Barbaresco does amazing work with its specific vineyard crus. One of its best sites is the Fondetta vineyard, although this vintage seems more nervous and raw than in past years. Clover, spice and green capers are some of the more interesting aromatic characteristics of this wine. You'll also get bright fruit and lemon zest on the close.",89,Rizzi 2007 Nervo Fondetta  (Barbaresco),,,,
"A little sweet on the nose, with powdered sugar, vanilla and white fruit aromas. Feels foamy but just fresh enough, with apple, melon and controlled stalky flavors. Finishes with dry apple notes. Good for Argentine sparkling; 70% Chardonnay and 30% Chenin Blanc.",85,Hom NV Extra Brut Sparkling (Mendoza),,,,
"White currants and fresh apricots dominate this fruity, fragrant wine. Bright acidity is enveloped by the generous texture and touch of toast. This rich wine is ready to drink.",88,Clos Marsalette 2012  Pessac-Léognan,,,,
"While the wine is clean and refreshing, its texture lacks definition. It has a soft, bright finish.",82,Domaine Bernard Moreau et Fils 2010  Bourgogne,,,,
"This is a stylish Blanc de Blancs in all but name: a crisp Chardonnay from the north of Burgundy. It has deliciously refreshing acidity and sliced apple fruitiness that is light, bright and mineral at the end.",90,Bailly-Lapierre NV Brut  (Crémant de Bourgogne),,,,
"Made claret style, the fruit and alcohol are restrained, and the wine drinks dry and balanced. Dark cherry and wild berry flavors are mouth-filling and the tannins are complex but approachable. This is a fine example of its appellation and terroir.",90,Clos du Bois 1999 Reserve Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Proof that that a pink wine can be as serious as it is delicious, this copper-tinged wine from James MacPhail offers almond, cured meat, raspberry, melon and lemon peel flavors. No shrinking violet here; it's at once crisp, fleshy and fully expressive.",90,Tongue Dancer 2016 Putnam Vineyard Rosé of Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"This is powerful in tropical fruit, apricot and oak flavors, but balanced with acidity and a tangy, minerally taste of stones. Rich and evocative, it appeals to the senses while retaining a complex intellectual charm. Drink now with lobster or crab dishes, especially a rich, buttery risotto.",93,Baldacci 2010 Sorelle Chardonnay (Carneros),,,,
"Tasted just after bottling, the wine was a little bottle-shocked, but should be fine by Summer 2010. Rich and creamy, with complex tropical fruit, buttered toast, lemondrop candy and honeysuckle flavors. An amazing 111,000 cases were produced.",90,Kendall-Jackson 2008 Grand Reserve Chardonnay (Monterey-Santa Barbara),,,,
"This substantive Pinot shows definite toasted oak character along with ripe fruit, full body and firm tannins. Hints of oak smoke and caramel waft over the ripe plum aromas. The flavors go to dark cherries and coffee, the texture is attractively astringent from tannins, and the finish carries a little bite. Well done but not overdone.",91,Kendall-Jackson 2012 Outland Ridge Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),,,,
"Jaboulet's basic Crozes is a good value in '07, offering complex aromas of smoke, plum, black olive, horse sweat and cracked pepper framed by slightly coarse tannins. Turns firm on the finish, yet remains mouthwatering. Drink now–2017.",90,Paul Jaboulet Aîné 2007 Les Jalets  (Crozes-Hermitage),,,,
"Pretty good price for a Cabernet this elegant and rich. Starmont is a kind of second label to the excellent producer, Merryvale, and this '07 shows a fine pedigree, as well as the general quality of the vintage. It's dry and balanced, with complex blackberry, currant and oak flavors. Drink now–2013.",90,Starmont 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Sophisticated and full of fruit, this wine combines the freshness of the year with great tension and structure. The juicy underlay will develop well over the next few years. It's complex and worth aging. Drink from 2024.",94,Vieux Château Mazerat 2013  Saint-Émilion,,,,
"This is the first vintage of this wine that will be available in the United States and it makes a positive first impression. It's a delicious blend of spice, floral notes and strawberries that finishes with soft, caressing tannins.",87,Marchesi de' Frescobaldi 2000 Campo ai Sasso  (Rosso di Montalcino),,,,
"The tang of orange rinds and fresh lemon cake meet with hints of toasted coconut and white flowers on the nose of this solid bottling by Bill Foley's eponymous winery. The texture is crisp but grippy and tense on the sip, with seared orange slices and oak smoke flavors.",92,Foley 2015 JA Ranch Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"A classic style of barrel-fermented wine, this shows lots of buttery, oaky and vanillin aromas and flavors, with a rich texture and an almost-sweet balance. Delicious ripe pear, marzipan, butter and baking spice notes keep the taste buds busy.",89,Perry Creek 2013 Altitude 2401 Chardonnay (El Dorado),,,,
"Ripe bramble and smoked nuts cast a savory edge to concentrated blackberry and cherry flavors in this robust wine. It's velvety and rich, but crisp, cranberry acidity and a granite edge lend elegance. Drink now through 2022.",90,Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards 2012 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Very ripe and oaky. Bursts with pineapple pie filling, tapioca, butterscotch and caramel flavors. Could use some complexity and restraint.",84,Hanna 2007 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"The silky texture is delightful, giving it the lightness desirable in Pinot Noir. Santa Lucia acidity gives a bright edge to the cherry, cola, pomegranate and heirloom tomato flavors. Drink now–2014 for maximum freshness.",89,Hahn 2011 SLH Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Full of red fruit, light and bright at first, then denser in flavor with savory notes amidst Zin's cherry-berry deliciousness. Grown on the Talmage Bench east of Hopland in Mendocino County, where a number of great Zins are born.",89,Martella 2010 Mattern Ranch Zinfandel (Mendocino County),,,,
"This is a lightly wood-aged wine, full of fruit with just a touch of spice. Smoothly textured, the wine is all the better for an extra year of aging before release. That broadens the fruit while leaving plenty of crispness and fine acidity. Drink now.",87,Quinta do Noval 2015 Cedro do Noval Branco White (Douro),,,,
This light-bodied wine has a pale pink Provençal color but quite a bit of fruit flavor. It feels soft on the palate and tastes lightly sweet.,85,Black Ink 2015 Rosé (California),,,,
"The French oak (35% new) brings notes of cocoa and vanilla that meld with the grape's currant and herbs. It's on the lighter side of medium bodied, fresh with a tart bite on the finish providing distraction.",87,Apex 2010 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Produced from organically grown grapes, this is the top of Troteligotte range. It is made from 25-year-old vines, and aged in amphorae. That gives a wine that is rich with soft rounded tannins and juicy blackberry fruits. It has a dense texture from aging on the lees in the amphorae. Rich and concentrated it will age and should not be drunk until 2020.",94,Clos Troteligotte 2014 K-2 Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"Massively ripe in pineapples, limes, green apples and lemons, this Sauvignon Blanc is clean and brisk in acidity. It's an upscale, fancy white wine that finishes just a little sweet in jam.",87,Vogelzang 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),,,,
"This is a pretty nice Merlot, soft, smooth and rich in oak-accented cherry pie flavor. It finishes a little sweet; try pairing it with teriyaki chicken or pork.",86,Francis Ford Coppola 2010 Director's Cut Merlot (Sonoma County),,,,
"Winemaker: Pierre Wahl. This is a ripe and decadent expression of Pinotage, which is not uncommon from Rijk's. It leads with seductive notes of black forest cake, baked brown sugar and brambly berries, all of which continue on to the smooth, silky palate. The medium-length finish boasts notes of raspberry sauce and spied chocolate-berry compote, with just enough acidity to keep it from feeling overly done or heavy. Drink now–2020.",90,Rijk's 2014 Cape Winemakers Guild CWG Pinotage (Tulbagh),,,,
"This wine is predominantly Merlot (83%) along with Cabernet Sauvignon (9%) and Syrah (2%) all from Anna Marie Vineyard, with Cabernet Franc from Minnick Hills and Petit Verdot from StoneTree Vineyard. Pleasing aromas suggest blueberry, milk chocolate and high-toned herbs. It's elegantly styled with light blue-fruit flavors, at times seeming a bit faint.",87,Northstar 2011 Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Blended with a little Syrah, Petite Sirah and Sangiovese, this Merlot in a big box is clearly a terrific value. It's so lush and delicious in berries and spices, it's crazy that the price works out to $6.25 for a regular bottle. With production over 200,000 cases, it's a testament to the art of blending.",90,Black Box 2009 Merlot (California),,,,
"Earthy, smoky aromas with a hint of bacon turn gluey and artifically sweet in the mouth, with the taste of cherry cough syrup. An acceptable wine.",81,Zenaida Cellars 2001 Sangiovese (Paso Robles),,,,
"A new wine from superstar winemaker Heidi Barrett, and the label is one of the coolest ever. It's extraordinarily rich and opulent, with a tapestry-like silky complexity. The blackberry, cherry and olive flavors are very ripe, yet it finishes wonderfully dry.",92,La Sirena 2008 Art Bus Red (Calistoga),,,,
"This wine is velvety-smooth and full bodied in cedar, black licorice and blackberry jam, and is an approachable wine given its mountain beginnings. Compact and concentrated, it ends with length and plenty of toasted oak.",90,Sterling 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),,,,
"This young, fruity wine is crisp with acidity and light in texture. The wine is bright and lively, ready to drink for its fruitiness.",84,Quinta do Casal Branco 2016 Terra de Lobos Branco White (Tejo),,,,
This is a popular and reliable wine to pair with desserts or to drink alone. It offers foamy mousse with peach and honey on the finish.,87,Beni di Batasiolo 2011 Bosc Dla Rei  (Moscato d'Asti),,,,
"Following a Bordeaux model, this is the second wine of Romaneira. Named after the bell that hangs at the entrance to the quinta, it is a ripe, lightly structured wine that is ready to mature quickly. Berry fruits and acidity give the wine its main character. Drink from 2017.",88,Quinta da Romaneira 2012 Sino da Romaneira Red (Douro),,,,
"This cuvée offers a mix of blue and purple fruits, with a forward grape-candy-character dominant. It's fruity and drinking nicely, but lacks the stuffing to improve much further with age.",89,Dobbes Family Estate 2014 Eola Amity Cuvée Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
"Comes off as a slightly skinny Pinot Noir, with herbal overtones to the cherry and strawberry flavors. Still, it's varietally true, and light enough in body to pair effectively with chicken or salmon. Drink now.",85,Sticks 2005 Pinot Noir (Yarra Valley),,,,
"This is a pretty wine in terms of floral aromatics, resplendent shocks of orange blossom and orange peel inviting in their exotic freshness. Lime and orange follow on the palate, which is bristling in acidity, the finish light and bright.",89,Pine Ridge 2013 Dijon Clones Chardonnay (Carneros-Napa Valley),,,,
"This wine is dark, with a strong sense of structure. Dense black fruits are cut with strawberry acidity and a dark tension between fruit and firm tannins. The coiled power will allow this beautiful wine age for many years. Drink from 2020.",94,Louis Jadot 2013 Theurons Premier Cru  (Beaune),,,,
"Aromas of toasted oak, mature orchard fruit, and baking spice open. The medium-bodied palate offers yellow apple skin, grapefruit, butterscotch and toasted nut alongside bright acidity. A graphite note signals the close.",88,Zenato 2013 Sergio Zenato Riserva  (Lugana),,,,
"Open, generous and relatively opulent, showing all the richness of 2005, along with peaches, apricots and tropical fruits. It's round from start to finish, a luscious Chardonnay. Just some crispness at the end.",93,William Fèvre 2005 Bougros Grand Cru  (Chablis),,,,
"This wood-aged Guru is a rich (while lemon- and lime-flavored) spicy wine. It has a strong mineral element with a crisp, tangy, steely character. Its fruitiness is tempered by the complex texture that promises aging for a few years. Drink from 2017.",89,Wine & Soul 2013 Guru White (Douro),,,,
"Right on the heels of the excellent 2008, this estate-grown Bordeaux-style blend is equally compelling. Bright and tasty fruit flavors of blueberry and black cherry introduce a lively, polished wine with a firm, complex and layered structure. Seventeen months in French oak, roughly half new, has wrapped the fruit in a nicely-layered, textural finish with highlights of mineral, licorice, black olive and spice.",93,Pepper Bridge 2009 Seven Hills Vineyard Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"This is a full-bodied, fruity selection that's packed with a red berry flavor, soft tannins and a delicious, forward and bright character. It is already ready to drink.",85,Companhia das Quintas 2010 Portas da Herdade Reserva Red (Alentejano),,,,
"Aromas of leather, tilled soil, game and an earthy whiff of barnyard follow through to the evolved palate along with raisin, baked plum, anise and a touch of mint. A bitter almond note closes the finish.",86,Marilena Barbera 2010 Coda della Foce Red (Sicilia),,,,
"This well-balanced blend of 48% Grenache, 32% Syrah and 20% Mourvèdre showcases many of the strengths of southern Oregon.

The refreshing minerality and acid base keep it lively through the finish.",90,South Stage 2011 G-S-M (Rogue Valley),,,,
"Here's a very good deal for a Brunello “annate” representing the 2008 vintage. The wine offers dark concentration and steady aromas of red fruit, vanilla oak, lead pencil and drying brimstone. Touches of white pepper and cola appear on the silky finish.",90,Il Poggiolo E. Cosimi 2008 Bramante  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"A full-on, ripe, generous wine, all red plums and bright berry fruits. The tannins are sweet, generous, supported by vivid acidity. This is an exciting wine, one that could do with two years aging.",89,Pfneisl United Vineyards 2005 Reserve Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),,,,
"After several years spent in Chile's land of the lost, Santa Carolina is now refocusing its winemaking efforts with noticeable results. This SB shows mineral, melon and piquant zap. It's got grapefruit, passion fruit and citrus, and the finish is both crisp and generous. A good quaffer that's on the spot. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA.",86,Santa Carolina 2008 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Rapel Valley),,,,
"There's a grassiness to this Sauvignon Blanc that suggests the cool vintage that yielded it. At the same time, the lemon and lime flavors make it rich. With no oak, the fruit stars, brightened with crisp, clean acidity. The finish is a little too sweet, which detracts from the score.",87,Corvalle 2010 Rutherford Runway Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford),,,,
"Aromatically reminiscent of creme brûlée, this delightful Mendocino-grown wine, made from organically grown grapes, is crisp, clean and bright with grapefruit flavor. Textured, and with some flesh to its bones, it should pair especially well with wintertime shellfish.",89,McFadden 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Potter Valley),,,,
"Cherry and sautéed morels provide an intriguing introduction to this deeply hued wine, but there are also hints of something funkier, like wet newspaper. On the palate, the pleasing black cherry returns, as does anise, some bitter elements and chewy tannins.",83,Fazeli Cellars 2010 Petite Sirah (Temecula Valley),,,,
Cleansing minerality defines this brilliant and luminous Gavi from Northern Italy. It's food-friendly to the core with fresh floral aromas and crisp acidity. Try this beautiful wine with sushi or Mediterranean fish.,87,Araldica 2008 La Luciana  (Gavi),,,,
"Fermented in both tank and new acacia barrels, there's definitely a depth of woodiness on the opening aromas. This is followed by a creaminess of texture on the palate, the taste leaning toward pear, vanilla and fresh melon. The finish is first creamy, then crisp, veering on spritzy.",87,Kokomo 2013 Timber Crest Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Lighter aromas of turned earth, dried blueberries and beef jerky show on the nose of this blend of 34% Merlot, 26% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Petite Sirah and 15% Petit Verdot. The palate packs bright black raspberries and blackberries together with graphite and light cedar notes.",88,Quadrant 2012 BDX Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"With all the signature acidity of the 1996 vintage, this shows plenty of aging potential. The wine is thirst-quenchingly fresh, with the flavor of just-squeezed lime juice, but also has a depth of complex tannins and texture. Drink now but age for five years or more.",94,Bruno Paillard 1996 Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),,,,
"This is Morrison Lane's first Dolcetto—previously these grapes were blended into the winery's Nebbiolo. The color is dark and saturated, the plummy fruit flavors laced with spice and leaf. There is a high acid sharpness on the tongue, with a little green character in the tannins, but it is a very promising first effort.",88,Morrison Lane 2005 Dolcetto (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Lightweight, with more dryness than richness, this wine is lightly sweet, hinting at botrytis, with apple and cream flavors touched by honey.",84,Chais de Méribel 2003  Sauternes,,,,
"Leather, spice, red fruit and smoke notes characterize this red blend. Dry and fresh, it will pair nicely with dried meats or tomato-based dishes.",83,A. Parparoussis 2005 Taos Dry Red Wine Red (Achaia),,,,
"This refreshing white opens with aromas that recall honeysuckle, citrus and ripe orchard fruit. On the palate, rich flavors of white peach, yellow apple and pear are balanced with fresh acidity. A note of bitter almond closes the finish.",89,Piero Mancini 2014 Cucaione Superiore  (Vermentino di Gallura),,,,
"Fresh, layered aromas of black fruits and licorice are appealing. The palate is full and offers kick, while flavors of berry and plum are fairly rich, spicy and honest for $9 Cabernet. A bit sticky and it falls off on the finish, but overall it's a nice value red.",87,Valentin Bianchi 2010 Elsa Bianchi Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"One of the more expensive Niagara icewines, Konzelman lives up to its price tag with this stylish blend of marzipan and almond notes on the nose and an intense palate laced with macaroon and honey flavors. The long finish shows a nice acidic lift.",92,Konzelmann 2006 Icewine Vidal Blanc (Niagara Peninsula),,,,
"This is a fine effort from first-year fruit that was cropped way down for extra concentration. It's a vibrant wine with a bright raspberry flavor that has a pretty, lightly candied quality.",89,Carabella 2010 Dijon 667 Clone Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),,,,
"Thin to the verge of being empty of fruit and flavor, this shows no varietal character whatsoever. Green, leafy, herbal and earthy flavors abound.",83,Maryhill 2010 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This is the first round of wines from this project by John Wagner, who owns parts of Sierra Madre and John Sebastiano vineyards, and winemaker Paul Lato. Black-plum skins, roasted game, anise and sandalwood aromas show on the nose. Earthy and zesty, the palate delivers cranberry-beet juice along with roasted fennel, eucalyptus oil and bitter Earl Grey tea touches.",93,Peake Ranch 2014 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Another terrific Signature Cabernet from Chappellet. This has primary blackberry and cherry-jam flavors, with an additional note of toasty oak. The tannins and acids are excellent, lending structure to the richness. The result is a wonderfully-complex Napa Cabernet that should develop over the next six years.",93,Chappellet 2009 Signature Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Sweet juicy fruit flavors dominate this concentrated wine. It is rich, soft in texture, showing heat even though well-balanced. It could age for several months given its firm texture.",88,Domaine Sorin 2009 Rosé (Bandol),,,,
"With the release of this hugely tannic wine, this serious chateau—under the direction of the Tesseron family, which also owns Château Pontet-Canet—continues its recent upward progress. The structure currently hides opulent fruit that holds great promise for the future. With both power and richness, there's a long life ahead.",93,Château Lafon-Rochet 2010  Saint-Estèphe,,,,
"This is a rather light-bodied wine for its genre, but one that boasts remarkable freshness and purity of fruit. Passion fruit and cut-grass aromas lead into flavors that include white grapefruit, gentle herbal notes and stone fruit. Versatile as an apéritif or alongside any fish or shellfish.",90,Savor 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"This blend of Merseguera and Sauvignon Blanc is modest as a church mouse, with clean but dilute green-apple aromas. An easygoing, round palate offers orange and lime flavors in front of a pithy, citrusy finish.",85,Castillo de Liria 2014 Winemaker's Selection White (Valencia),,,,
"A beautiful Sauvignon Blanc that does everything you want with this variety. It's basically dry and crisp in acidity, with polished flavors of lemongrass, pineapple tart, vanilla, buttered toast and steely minerals. Really nice wine at a great price.",89,Ledgewood Creek 2007 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Suisun Valley),,,,
"Saffron and dusty mineral tones seep into notes of marmalade and candied orange peel in this intensely ripe honeyed Riesling. The palate bursts with yellow peach and mango, but savory tinges of earth and petrol peek through enticingly. It's dazzling now, a veritable explosion of sweetness, acidity and minerality, but should meld beautifully from 2020-2025.",95,Thörle 2011 Saulheimer Hölle Beerenauslese Riesling (Rheinhessen),,,,
"White peach and a bit of sweat accent the expiring bouquet, while the flavors are of dull, heavy apples dotted with sauerkraut and pickle accents. Imported by Kysela Pere et Fils, Ltd.",82,Andeluna 2006 Winemaker's Selection Torrontés (Mendoza),,,,
"This is a young, fruity wine with black currant aromas and delicious, perfumed juicy blackberry fruit. It has all the ripeness of the vintage and the potential to age well. Drink from 2020.",87,Château Haut Millet 2016 Vieilles Vignes  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),,,,
"An affordable appellation wine, there's an introductory whiff of meaty bacon that signals full-bodied goodness, followed by soft, integrated layers of cherry and vanilla. Thick and densely concentrated, it's drinking well now and should please many palates.",90,Black Stallion 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Tight and hard in tannins now, with a dusty astringency, especially on the finish. But there's a considerable heart of blackberries, currants and dark chocolate, accented with complex notes of violets, leather, dried herbs and peppery spices. Not ready now, but should easily negotiate the next 4–6 years.",93,Palmeri 2005 Stagecoach Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley),,,,
"Thick in extraction, Nearco is a ripe and meaty red with thick layers of blueberry, blackberry, coffee, tobacco, ink, vanilla, spice and cigar box that peel off one solid layer after the other. Nothing is understated here and the wine hits the palate with determined tannins.",92,Col d'Orcia 2003 Nearco Red (Sant'Antimo),,,,
"92-94 Powerful tannins here, spiced with a considerable amount of new wood. The wine has richness, black chocolate burnt toast flavors along with intense sweet plum fruits.",93,Château Cos d'Estournel 2010 Barrel sample Les Pagodes de Cos  (Saint-Estèphe),,,,
"This spicy blend includes 60% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Syrah and Sangiovese. Intense aromas of grilled bell peppers, black pepper and mature black fruit continue on to the soft, round palate. It's not an ager so enjoy soon.",88,Serni Fulvio Luigi 2011 Tegoleto  (Bolgheri),,,,
"This wine is rich to the edge of voluptuousness. Delicious nutty, toasty and buttery flavors are wrapped around ripe apricot and papaya fruit. A full-bodied, complex wine, it was aged for a year in 55% concrete eggs, 25% stainless and 20% French oak barrels.",94,Lachini 2015 Les Sols Arénacés Chardonnay (Chehalem Mountains),,,,
"A lifted ethereal note of dried hay flowers hits you first. This is followed by generously ripe but very purely drawn fruit: Conference pear, star fruit and white currant. There is concentration on the palate, coupled with a pervasive citric freshness that almost lends this an exotic aspect. You simply want to savor and take another sip. An edge of pleasant bitterness corrals the fruit admirably. The finish is dry, lasting and intriguing.",94,Domaine Ostertag 2015 Zellberg Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"Intoxicating aromas of plum jelly, violets, blueberry, chocolate and cinnamon are cut with a pencil-lead focus on this bottling by a family in the Paso wine game since 1908. Flavors of blackberry jelly are lifted by lavender and anise spice.",92,Rotta 2013 Osso Balenda Vineyard Zinfandel (Paso Robles),,,,
"Those cherry fruit flavors so characteristic of St. Laurent just fill the mouth with their lightly spicy edge. Around them, wood polishes the tannins and the acidity and gives the wine an ageworthy character. This is a sophisticated wine, its juicy fruit character in fine harmony with the tannins and wood.",91,Juris 2005 Reserve St. Laurent (Burgenland),,,,
"Textured yet full bodied, this is a rich wine from a small 17-acre estate. The toast note shows strongly, but it's still in balance, resulting in yeast and croissant flavors as well as tropical fruits. For aging over the next 2–3 years.",90,Château Tour de Mirambeau 2010 Cuvée Passion  (Bordeaux Blanc),,,,
"The fragrances of lemon blossoms and honeysuckle hit your nose as soon as you pop the cork on this seductive white wine. It's so flavorful, so long in fruit and exotic in spices, and finishes mercifully dry. Twenty percent of barrel fermentation adds the perfect touch of creaminess.",90,Terlato 2006 Pinot Grigio (Russian River Valley),,,,
"There's a honeyed accent to this sparkler, with tangerine, lime, buttered toast and yeasty flavors that are savory and complex. The mouthfeel is wonderfully soft and creamy. A great success for Laetitia, at a good price.",92,Laetitia 2008 Cuvée M Sparkling (Arroyo Grande Valley),,,,
"Pretty astringent in young tannins now, this Syrah has a tough, lockdown quality that suggests aging. You could have it with beef and barbecue, but it really wants three or four years of cellaring to start to mellow and show off the black currants and cherries.",90,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2005 Great Oak Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Produced from Niellucciu, this wine is ripe, perfumed and packed with crisp acidity. Fresh raspberry, citrus and a touch of caramel are brought together by the acidity and zesty aftertaste. Drink now.",87,Clos Alivu 2015 White (Patrimonio),,,,
"This extracted, dense and one-dimensional Taurasi delivers mature black fruit, fennel, black pepper, licorice, toasted oak and coffee bean sensations alongside drying wood tannins. It finishes abruptly.",86,Tenuta Cavalier Pepe 2008 La Loggia del Cavaliere Riserva  (Taurasi),,,,
"Fruity and forward, with a spritzy mouthfeel, this is like a bowl of cherries, with a cherry candy finish. Highlights of orange and grapefruit come through also. Drink now through 2016.",88,Vidon Vineyard 2013 3 Clones Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),,,,
"Stalky white-fruit, lees and vanilla aromas are less than inviting. This feels tired, obtuse and out of shape, meaning it's past its prime and won't improve. Bitter, leesy peach and melon flavors finish similarly.",83,Valdesil 2011 Pezas da Portela Godello (Valdeorras),,,,
"Earthy, murky, raw aromas of generic berry fruits topped with vanilla and marshmallow set up a chunky but lazy palate with herbal plum flavors that border on green.",84,Salentein 2014 Portillo Malbec (Valle de Uco),,,,
"A juicy, tropical Sauvignon Blanc ripe for warm weather sipping, textured in mango, pineapple and a hit of fresh pear. Intense with a savory taste on the finish, this white is perfect on its own or ideal with seafood or crackers smothered in goat cheese.",88,Newsome-Harlow 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Calaveras County),,,,
"This is jammy and bulky from the get-go, with heavy fruit aromas leading to a saturated, dense palate that feels thick. Baked, blackened flavors of sweet blackberry, chocolate and mocha mark the palate.",87,Fabre Montmayou 2010 Phebus Malbec (Patagonia),,,,
"A good choice for fans of older wines, the Raphael 2002 Merlot shows mature forest floor and earth scents but is still hanging on to some raspberry and blackberry fruit. The crisp palate has a mouthwatering character and a touch of singed plum flavor. Woody tannins chime in on the medium finish. Drink before 2011.",87,Raphael 2002 Estate Bottled Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"A blend of Tintore and Per'e Palummo (a grape native to the Island of Ischia), there is a thorny, raw quality to this wine that is backed by Asian spice, incense, spice, tobacco and mature black fruit. The wine has a thin, almost metallic taste, with spicy fruit tones on the close.",84,Giuseppe Apicella 2006 Costa d'Amalfi Tramonti Red (Campania),,,,
"This comes across as quite sweet and tannic at the same time, with plummy fruit and drying tannins warring on the palate.",82,Ogier 2015 Héritages Élevéen Foundres de Chéne Red (Côtes du Rhône),,,,
"Sugary and astringent, the unusual mix of flavors includes bark, brown sugar and grain. Nothing jells.",83,Holmes Harbor Cellars 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"All three of Plantagenet's Shirazes were successful in 2008. This, the flagship bottling, offers aromas of coffee grounds, cherry and cracked black pepper, adding vanilla, spice and charred beef flavors on the palate. It's harmonious, savory and complex. Drink now–2020 and possibly beyond.",91,Plantagenet 2008 Shiraz (Mount Barker),,,,
"A rubbery funk shows on the nose of this bottling, with beef char, brunt black cherries, red and purple flower aromas. Sour black fruits arise on the palate, where elderberry is spiced with familiar smoked cedar elements.",85,La Merika 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast),,,,
"Deep and rich in this landmark Oregon vintage, this Pinot Blanc abounds with flavors of buttered pears, toast and vanilla custard. The texture and balance are spot-on, and the wine is flat-out delicious.",92,The Eyrie Vineyards 2014 Pinot Blanc (Dundee Hills),,,,
"Here's a simple, easygoing wine that offers fleshy black cherry, clove, cinnamon and accents of white pepper. It's extremely accessible, with soft acidity and fleeting tannins. Enjoy through 2015.",86,Orlando Abrigo 2010 Valmaggiore  (Nebbiolo d'Alba),,,,
"Good, but a bit tough and gritty, with a hard edge of tannins. On the other hand there also is dryness and extremely ripe, jammy blackberry and cherry flavors, as well as sweet oak. Not showing well now, but could benefit from some years in the cellar.",85,Titus 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Intense acidity, with the sweetness held in check by a bright, crisp character. Rich honey is balanced by an exquisite freshness, lightly perfumed, so clean and clear in final taste.",92,Zull 2008 Eiswein 375ml Riesling (Niederösterreich),,,,
"Underbrush, dark-skinned berry, chopped mint and cooking spice aromas lead the way on this fabulous, structured wine. The full-bodied palate delivers a juicy core of ripe black cherry while white pepper, cinnamon, dried herb and a balsamic note provide the backdrop. Firm but refined tannins and fresh acidity provide balance and support. Drink 2018–2030.",97,Gianni Brunelli 2010 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"Aged 19 months in American and French oak (68% new), it's lush and appealing with notes of vanilla and other barrel spices accenting herbs and red fruit. The palate is creamy in feel with tart, mouthwatering acids that draw out the flavors for a long finish.",91,Fielding Hills 2010 RiverBend Vineyard Merlot (Wahluke Slope),,,,
"Aging has brought out a toffee character as well as the red fruits. It is ripe, smoothly textured and recognizably a Port with the hints of spirit at the end.",85,Rozes NV Terras do Grifo Pink  (Port),,,,
"Jammy and thick, this is a simple but lusty Zin, powerful in fruity cherry, blackberry and cola flavors that finish dry and spicy. Great with barbecued steak.",86,Alexander Valley Vineyards 2006 Sin Zin Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),,,,
"This opens with a classic Nebbiolo nose of blue flower, rose, perfumed berry, new leather, cake spice and a balsamic note. The ripe, juicy palate delivers crushed black cherry, black raspberry, cinnamon, white pepper and clove framed in youthfully assertive tannins. Drink 2018–2027.",94,Castello di Verduno 2012 Massara  (Barolo),,,,
"This shows its age a bit, as the citrus, lemongrass and tropical flavors pick up a dried fruit edge. But it's clean and vibrant, offering plenty of Napa complexity. Drink now.",87,Worthy 2009 Five Clones Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"A Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated wine, which reveals great structure to go with its black berry fruits. American Daren Miller, married to a Bordeaux native, has been involved in the restoration of this property in the Médoc, producing a classic wine, that pays great respect to its origins.",89,Château Haut Beyzac 2005  Haut-Médoc,,,,
"A rich wine from a ripe year. The flavors are full and open, edged with a mushroom character that suggests maturity. The fruits are going towards almonds, while the structure has softened.",88,Fournier Père et Fils 2005 Grand Cuvée Fournier Vieilles Vignes  (Sancerre),,,,
"Full of delicious dark-fruit flavors, this is smooth and deep, comforting but sophisticated. The fruit flavors are ripe and satisfying, the texture is velvety and broad, the body is full but not heavy.",91,Charles B. Mitchell 2012 Hawk Creek Zinfandel (Fair Play),,,,
"Mellow yeasty apple aromas suggest good things to come. This feels full, easygoing and good. Toasty apple and spice notes control the flavor profile, while this finishes with an overall sense of completeness.",89,Parxet 2014 Cuvée 21 Made With Organic Grapes Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"This producer makes small amounts of minimal-intervention wines from a handful of California appellations and this one does a good job of capturing Russian River. Peppery and steeped in dried herb and lavender, it goes light on the oak to show tightly woven tannin and structure, but the floral aromatics, especially of rose, really shine.",89,Tessier Winery 2014 Morelli Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Ripe, fruity and delicious. Flatters with deep, long flavors of blackberries, black currants, cassis and cedar, with a lush, tannic mouthfeel and long finish. Nice now, and should develop beyond 2012.",90,Trinchero 2005 Chicken Ranch Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),,,,
"This is a big, broad-shouldered Riesling, with plenty of body and a slightly oily mouthfeel. Powerful mineral notes dominate, giving the impression of liquid stone and spice, finishing almost totally dry.",92,Schloss Johannisberger 2006 Silberlack Erstes Gewächs Riesling (Rheingau),,,,
"This is the top wine from Fabien Jouves's estate. There is some new wood aging here and it shows in the polished edges of the very firm tannins. Burnt coffee and plum skin flavors add to the considerable power, the fruit just beginning to push through the tannins. Age for several more years.",93,Mas del Périé 2008 La Pièce Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"This is a strongly herbal wine. Its acidity and crisp texture give it great lift, bringing out lively fruitiness and a green fruit aftertaste. Drink now.",86,Les Vignerons de Tutiac 2016 Château les Jouberts Prestige  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),,,,
"Brambly berry fruit, with a hint of herb around the edges, marks this wine. Along with the Cabernet, there are smaller amounts of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, showing well-integrated barrel notes of coffee and roasted walnuts, and smooth tannins.",90,Cadaretta 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This is a big, spicy wine, with very ripe flavors of red berries. It''ss concentrated, with layers of pepper a tight lemon-zest acidity.",87,Domaine du Grand Cros 2011 L'Esprit de Provence Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"Here's a reserve that really does merit its special designation. Made from 90-year-old vines that likely contain varieties other than Zinfandel, the wine is rich and complex. Delivers all the wild, brambly Zin quality you want, with tiers of blackberries, cherries, cassis, cherry liqueur, tobacco, vanilla and peppery spice flavors that go on and on in the finish. This is an exceptionally well-balanced Zin that's best in its flashy youth.",91,Sausal 2005 Private Reserve Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Incredibly rich blackberry-jam aromas meet with licorice, smoked beef and black rocks on the continually evolving and dynamic nose of this bottling from Paso Robles' west side. It's rich, juicy and expertly structured on the palate, where blackberry fruit meets with pencil-lead minerality and light espresso flavors. The tannic grip is solid and the acidity is strong, ensuring long ageability.",93,Dunning Vineyards 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles Willow Creek District),,,,
"This 100% varietal provides a pretty example of Petite Sirah, with appealing accents of dark coffee and plum. The soft, supple feel to the fruit flavors belies the firm tannins at this wine's core. Amaro-like bitters on the finish are the only thing that holds this wine back from reaching further heights.",88,Sawtooth 2011 Trout Trilogy Petite Sirah,,,,
"Stalky, medicinal, rubbery aromas announce an acidic Tempranillo-led blend that's downright astringent on the palate. Flavors of stalky fruit, buttery oak and sheer raspberry and plum end crisp and tight, with a salty flavor.",83,Finca la Rinconada 2009 Barcolobo 12 Meses en Barrica Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),,,,
"Oxidized aromas of vanilla, stale tropical fruits and canned pear syrup lead to a flabby palate with a heavy consistency. Oxidized melon flavors lean in the direction of tropical, while this is dull and chunky on the finish.",82,Bodegas Carrau 2016 Reserva Las Violatas Chardonnay (Uruguay),,,,
"This is a plump, succulent Chardonnay for drinking by the end of 2016. The apple, citrus and pear notes are pretty simple, but clean, with a long, refreshing finish.",88,Wakefield 2015 Promised Land Unwooded Chardonnay (South Australia),,,,
"A majority of Cabernet Sauvignon is blended with 22% Merlot in this woody, somewhat herbal and robustly intense red, impacted in subtle ways by oak. The finish is meager.",85,Kelly Family Vineyards 2013 Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"A lovely touch of smoke and earth plays around the honeysuckle and peach notes. The palate adds even more stone fruit: apricot and juicy mirabelle. They are boosted by some residual sweetness that makes for an easy, friendly and fluid palate. The finish is off dry, peachy and floral.",89,Robert Karcher et Fils 2015 Harth Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"A solid value in German Riesling that just misses out being a Best Buy, this wine features aromas of honey-drizzled baked apples with cinnamon and lemon juice, a refreshingly light feel on the palate and an ultraclean, persistent finish with undertones of ripe melon. Drink now–2015.",89,Weingut Georg Albrecht Schneider 2006 Niersteiner Paterberg Kabinett Riesling (Rheinhessen),,,,
"The nose is limited and narrow, not fruity or tropical as it should be. A plump, soft palate is low on pulse, while lychee and honeydew flavors end bland and slightly bitter.",83,Tupun 2013 Torrontés (Tupungato),,,,
"Not quite dry, this is packed with red fruits. An attractive crisp acidity balances the ripe, creamed strawberry flavor. Drink now.",84,Gustave Lorentz 2013 Le Rosé (Alsace),,,,
"A perfumed note of citrus peel and soft pine create a bracing nose that nonetheless suggests ripeness. The body is lithe and light, with a backdrop of stone and subtle nuttiness. With a little more air, the characteristic notes of mature Riesling appear: some lifted chamomile and candied orange peel, but only in their early stages. This is a wine of immense depth and deceptive lightness that has years of life ahead. Drink through 2030.",95,Trimbach 2008 Cuvée Frédéric Emile Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"Shot through with minerality, almost flinty, this wine shows its vintage well. The red fruit element is now only a small part of what is now a fully mature wine. But the steely edge and tannic structure show that it will age, probably 10 years or more.",92,Ruinart 1996 Dom Ruinart Brut Rosé  (Champagne),,,,
"This Viura smells waxy and oxidized for a 2011. The palate feels chunky and awkward, while the flavor profile deals maderized pear and apple.",81,Bodegas Valdemar 2011 Conde de Valdemar Viura (Rioja),,,,
"Gentle perfume of citrus with just a hint of yeast sets the scene. The palate is concentrated, a lot more yeasty and very citric. There is ample depth and a core of white pepper and fruit that yet has to open up properly. This is one for the long run—but with ample refreshment and elegant poise. The finish just lasts and lasts.",94,F X Pichler 2014 Loibner Loibenberg Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),,,,
"The beautiful orange pink sunrise color sets the scene for a dry style of wine, very much in the Laurent-Perrier tradition. Flavors of crisp red apples, red berry fruits and white currants come together with an edge of toast. A great wine, and a real food Champagne.",93,Laurent-Perrier 1998 Grand Siècle Cuvée Alexandra Rosé Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"Tight and crisp initially, this wine opens up with spice, ripe flavors and a touch of minerality. Taut and textured, it needs to age; drink from 2017.",87,Bouchard Père & Fils 2013  Pouilly-Fuissé,,,,
"An attractive, pale-colored rosé, this offers crisp acidity and bright red currant and raspberry fruitiness. The wine is balanced with delicate fruits, a touch of minerality and a fresh aftertaste. It is ready to drink.",88,Marion-Bosser NV Premier Cru Brut Rosé  (Champagne),,,,
"This wine combines the best of Chenin Blanc, with its nutty, terroir-driven character, and the round ripeness of Chardonnay. It is fruity and fresh with a smooth texture that is lifted by final acidity.",87,Domaine du Tariquet 2014 Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay (Côtes de Gascogne),,,,
"This is a finely perfumed wine that has plenty of juicy black currant flavors. Fresh initially, it then develops ripe tannins and a character that emphasizes fruit and a dense aftertaste. It is ready to drink, although because it is unfiltered it will also age well and can be drunk until 2020.",92,Fonseca 2009 Late Bottled Vintage Unfiltered  (Port),,,,
"Aromas of blackberry, spicy plum, grilled herb, Mediterranean scrub and a whiff of pencil shavings lead the nose on this polished wine. The savory palate offers juicy plum, black cherry, clove and white pepper alongside supple, buffed tannins that generate a smooth mouth texture. Drink through 2017.",90,Podere San Cristoforo 2012 Petit Verdot (Toscana),,,,
"A light, refreshing, amazingly clean and delicious wine. With only 8% alcohol but 9.7% residual sugar, it’s a tasty sweet-toother that delivers plenty of wonderful ripe fruit and spice. It’s almost delicate, the wine equivalent of a well-made crème brûlée—which it would pair with beautifully.",90,La Famiglia di Robert Mondavi 1999 Moscato Bianco Moscato (California),,,,
"Produced from Touriga Nacional, this fresh wine keeps the acidity of the grape while losing any tough tannins. The result is an attractive, crisp wine, with final strawberry flavors.",85,DFJ Vinhos 2014 Brigando Rosé (Lisboa),,,,
"This expression of Nero d'Avola offers some vegetal overtones that come forward in the form of bramble, forest fruit and green spice. In the mouth, you'll taste soft espresso coffee and chewy cherry.",90,Feudo Montoni 2004 Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),,,,
"Candied cherry, cola, brown sugar and toasty oak flavors give this Pinot an immediate deliciousness. Savory acidity and fine tannins add to the sense of balanced importance. While it isn't an ager, it is a dramatic Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir to drink now.",91,Guarachi Family 2011 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Rich and thick in leathery blueberry, this Syrah from the great Carneros-based Hyde Vineyard is a study in full-bodied black licorice and dark chocolate caramel. Though bigger in style, it retains acidity and balance.",91,Mira 2010 Hyde Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley),,,,
"A dull Rhône-style blend, this is soft and hot with alcohol. You'll find some green vegetable and mushroom notes that mar the ripe flavors of red cherry jam.",81,Ascension Cellars 2010 Dalliance G-S-M (Paso Robles),,,,
"A bright, fluffy white, this moderately bodied, oaked wine is intertwined in apple, pear and a bite of nutmeg, with supportive acidity and a soft, smooth texture.",90,Kenwood 2015 Six Ridges Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This fresh, appealing wine is lightly spritzy, with flavors of pear and melon that show persistence.",87,Anew 2014 Pinot Grigio (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This wine is initially marked by scents of charred oak and espresso beans. With aeration, the cherry fruit become more apparent. It's medium to full in body, with silky yet firm tannins that reflect the vineyard's clay soils.",90,Nautilus 2014 Clay Hills Vineyard Pinot Noir (Marlborough),,,,
"Lake County remains a serious place for Cabernet Sauvignon and Six Sigma is one of its better Cab practitioners. This 2007 version all rich and yeasty baked bread until it delves into black olive, dark plum and black tea flavors, finished by caramel and vanilla, all in all a refreshingly light touch.",88,Six Sigma Ranch 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lake County),,,,
"The perfect picnic wine? Bold, floral and berry aromas, black cherry fruit, and some light tannins will make this the most versatile wine in your hamper this summer. This blend of Nero d'Avola and Nerello Mascalese is grown specifically for rose production--it is not a saignee used to increase the concentration of the estate's reds.",90,Tasca d'Almerita 2001 Rose di Regaleali Rosé (Sicilia),,,,
"This shows light lime, green apple and herb aromas. It drinks dry, with abundant apple flavors supported by tart acidity.",88,Milbrandt 2015 Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Smooth and full bodied, this is packed with robust peach, pear, apple, lime and candied pineapple. There's a streak of vanilla custard from time in new oak, and length-extending minerality. This just keeps on going in the most delightful fashion.",94,Roco 2014 Knudsen Vineyards Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This medium-bodied white delivers mature pear, yellow apple and white peach aromas and flavors. It's riper and rounder than usual but also boasts terrific freshness and elegance for the hot vintage.",90,Russiz Superiore 2015 Pinot Bianco (Collio),,,,
"Vanilla, lees notes and wafer cookie aromas are not terribly fruity or upright. This is chunky on the palate, with an odd spritzy feel. Briny orange is the key flavor, along with an oily nuttiness.The finish is pithy and breaks up.",85,Bodegas Carballal 2013 Cepas Vellas Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"This smells of subdued strawberry and raspberry, with a twist of violet. It is tightly structured, tasting of brick and tar, and its finish is ripe, brambly and bittersweet.",87,Claudia Springs 2009 Valenti Ranch Zinfandel (Mendocino Ridge),,,,
"A very nice Cab Franc that shows how well this variety can do in the Sierra Foothills. It's quite soft and light in body, making it a wine for early drinking. But it offers waves of cherries, anisettte liqueur, cocoa, pepper and mint flavors that are delicious.",87,R & B Cellars 2006 Counterpoint Cabernet Franc (El Dorado),,,,
"Eccentric for a Howell Mountain Cabernet. A funky wine, with excessively ripe blackberry fruit that's sweet and jammy, and the tannins are soft and creamy. A good but imperfect Cab for drinking now.",86,Rockroom Winemaking Cooperative 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),,,,
"Vintner Guglielmo Bortolomiol (not to be confused with the Prosecco estate of the same name) delivers a dry, tonic sparkler with steely effervescence and soft tones of yellow fruit and spring flower.",87,Gemin NV Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
"This is not nearly as rich and plush as La Nerthe's luxury-level Cuvée des Cadettes, but remains a very good wine. Red plum and red currant fruit is medium-bodied, supported by bright acids, while some slightly ashy notes and a hint of cocoa emerge on the crisp finish.",88,Château La Nerthe 2013 Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),,,,
"This explodes aromatically with honey and apricot and is balanced and silky on the palate, with 13.9% residual sugar. Somewhere midway through and on the finish, a hint of jalapeño provides a stark segue, before an appearance of pear and honey saves the day.",87,Merry Edwards 2012 Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley),,,,
"For full-bodied, true Cabernet at a reasonable price, Santa Alicia's 2003 Gran Reserva is a winner. The plum and berry flavors are clean and supported by proper creamy oak, and the tannins are pliable and add backbone. Drink now.",88,Santa Alicia 2003 Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),,,,
"A dry Vinho Verde with a light sparkle that give it a fine lift. With intense citrus and a sliced apple freshness, the wine is refreshing and ready to drink.",87,Obrigado 2015 Vera White (Vinho Verde),,,,
"Highly intriguing aromas of forest floor, damp pine trees and blackberry reduction sauce power the nose on this blend of 59% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Cabernet Franc, 10% Merlot, 6% Petit Verdot and 6% Malbec. The flavors are quite broad and welcoming, with purple and blue fruits, but also herbs of oregano and thyme. It's tasty but not showy, a wine that's happy in its own skin.",91,Black Ridge 2010 San Andreas Red Red (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"A raw, dry Pinot, marked by thin cherry and tobacco flavors, and a scour of acidity and alcohol. The texture is nice and silky, and the finish is clean. Drink up.",84,Byron 2009 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Plum, cinnamon, Chinese five spice, egg nog, strawberry compote and sour cherry team up for a memorable nose. The palate proves more straight-ahead and savory, with sandalwood up front and fleshy plum, cooked rhubarb and some strawberry in the background.",92,Clos La Chance 2012 Murphy's Choice Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"Underbrush, scorched earth, dried berry, violet and spice aromas slowly emerge on this generous, polished wine. On the palate, fine-grained tannins frame dried black cherry, grilled herb and anise. It's almost accessible and is going to offer terrific drinking in the near and mid-term. Enjoy 2017–2026.",94,Sandrone 2011 Le Vigne  (Barolo),,,,
"A healthy dose of potpourri and lavender kick off the nose of this bottling, with sweet pine, plum and raspberry waves inviting one in for repeat sniffs. Cedar, sandalwood and incense touches show on the palate, where tangy plum fruit and roasting herbs start to delve toward the olive and Mediterranean spice rack as well.",91,Rideau 2014 Garey Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"This likable wine has juicy and bright core, a mix of spicy cola-cherry and forest floor nested in firm, integrated tannins that works seamlessly on the palate. A full-bodied wine, it has power and grace.",91,Row Eleven 2013 Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),,,,
"Aromas of cassis, underbrush and toast lead the nose on this simple but well-made red. The easy-drinking palate delivers black currant, raspberry, coffee and a toasted note alongside polished tannins. It's made to be enjoyed young so drink soon.",87,Mezzacorona 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Vigneti delle Dolomiti),,,,
"Structured and elegant, it opens with a fruit fragrance of black plum, wild berries and prune accentuated with hints of leather, tilled soil and spice. The juicy palate delivers wild cherry layered with cinnamon, white pepper and carob alongside big, velvety tannins. Delicious now, it will also develop complexity. Drink now–2022.",93,Tenute Silvio Nardi 2007 Poggio Doria  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"This 100% Sauvignon Blanc dessert bottling is fermented in new French oak, and is aged one year on lees. Rich honey, peach and nectarine fruit could have rendered this wine too sweet and sloppy; instead, its light, gravelly texture keeps it from being too cloying. Honey, mustard grains and light talc on the nose, and a nutty, crème brulee-like finish add elegance where, again, candy could otherwise have reigned.",90,Morandé 2000 Edicion Limitada Golden Harvest Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"Soft and watery, with just traces of cherries and watermelons.",81,Chime NV Red (California),,,,
"This opens with aromas of red berry and aromatic herb. On the palate, black pepper and dried sage backup raw red cherry while bracing tannins provide the framework.",87,Prinsi 2010 Fausoni Riserva  (Barbaresco),,,,
"From one of the few producers to have estate-grown Syrah in the appellation, this wine comes from vines planted in Goldridge soils. It offers robust notions of tangy red fruit, leathery pepper and wild game, a worthy representative of the variety that could stand more time in bottle. Drink now through 2020.",91,Dehlinger 2013 Goldridge Syrah (Russian River Valley),,,,
"A smooth and velvet-textured wine, where the tannins are a cushion for the ripe plum juice fruit. Herbs and wood spice contribute to this rich and full-bodied wine.",90,Château Fonguillon 2005  Montagne-Saint-Émilion,,,,
"From a great vineyard under the precise care of grower extraordinaire Ulises Valdez, this wine offers layers of spicy red cherry and berry fruit around lovely waves of soft, supple tannins. The finish continues the theme, balanced in acidity, a freshness of fruit and lingering cola spice.",92,Friedeman 2013 UV Lancel Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
This wine shows plum and toasted oak sensations with hints of animal and barnyard. The palate offers overripe black fruit flavors along with astringent tannins that cut the finish short.,83,Poggio Bonelli 2010  Chianti Classico,,,,
"A mixed bag of varieties went into this soft and fruity wine. It has gentle tannins that are lifted by acidity and black currant fruitiness. With its lifestyle label (a small Vespa motor scooter), it is obviously meant to be an easy-going ready-to-drink wine. And it succeeds.",87,Casa Santos Lima 2014 Bonavita Red (Lisboa),,,,
"Impressively flashy, an opulent wine that immediately offers a blast of blackberries, cherries, currants, red licorice and cedar. But it's quite astringent in tannins. Age this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend for 5–7 years.",92,Coho 2007 Headwaters Red (Napa Valley),,,,
There's just a trace of color on this wine. Light aromas of citrus and herb are followed by dry-fruit flavors. The concentration seems quite dilute.,85,Vital 2016 Rosé Wine Sangiovese (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Initially this smells burnt and gritty, with leafy aromas and a whiff of tar. The mouthfeel is grabby, while flavors of roasted berry, burnt leaves and leather finish rustic and hard.",85,Old Winery 2011 Red (Mendoza),,,,
"Spicy, green aromas suggest juniper bush more than clean berry fruits. This is firm and condensed on the palate, with herbal, minty flavors of leathery, savory blackberry and eucalyptus. The finish is saucy and herbal, with staunch acidity and hard tannins.",86,Valle Secreto 2011 First Edition Cabernet Sauvignon (Cachapoal Valley),,,,
"For anybody looking for classic Bordeaux, this is the bottle to seek. “Classic” here means a wine with a tannic structure that also relies on a black currant flavor, with acidity providing freshness but not losing any concentration or aging potential. Keep for many years.",95,Château Gruaud Larose 2010  Saint-Julien,,,,
"There's an explosion of rich, intense fruit here: dried prunes, black plums and even some licorice. The wine is attractively edged with wood, giving a fine, ripe finish.",92,Domaine Chignard 2006 Cuvée Spéciale  (Fleurie),,,,
"This is a distinctive Chardonnay, with pea vine and peach, anise and apple mixing it up. It has a lovely, lifted elegance that keeps the flavors intertwined but allows you to experience them separately as well, and it carves a flavor trail through the finish that lingers sensuously. Could be the best CV Chardonnay ever from L'Ecole.",91,L'Ecole No. 41 2006 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This vigorous wine shows the strong flavors that Laetitia Pinot Noirs most always display. It's powerfully ripe, with flavors of cherry, rhubarb pie, pomegranate and spicy persimmon. Full bodied, with pronounced acids and tannins, this offers plenty of generosity.",87,Laetitia 2010 Estate Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),,,,
"A blend of Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier, this is a rich Champagne. It has layers of red currant fruits and intense acidity. There is some toast coming through as this wine has aged.",89,Beaumont des Crayères 2003 Fleur Noir Blanc de Noirs Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"With its ripe acidity, this is a wine that is ready to drink. It shows strong Cabernet Sauvignon ripeness, with a structure that is now soft and generous, along with cushioned tannins and an opulent feel. This is a wine to savor.",93,Château Vignelaure 2007 Cabernet-Syrah (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence),,,,
"This gorgeous dessert wine shows a coffee-colored tint that's backed by lush, deep aromas of fig, caramel, toffee and prune. The palate shows weight but a refined mouthfeel that's not sticky or heavy. Flavors of coffee, mocha, chocolate, caramel, peanut brittle and prune finish warm and long. Only 43 cases made.",93,"Bodegas Toro Albala, SL 1947 Don PX Reserva Especial Pedro Ximénez (Montilla-Moriles)",,,,
"Winemaker Bill Brosseau tapped into his family's vineyard to produce this light and delicate wine. Its aromas suggest white flowers, key lime and chalk, while its flavors are high-toned and tight, recalling chilled pear, lime and pomelo pith. A graphite-like minerality adds complexity.",92,Testarossa 2015 Brosseau Vineyard Chardonnay (Chalone),,,,
"With vineyards on the south bank of the Vienne river, facing Chinon, the Charles Joguet style is firm and tannic, with a need for aging. This wine is proof, big, structured, very firm and concentrated. Tannins dominate now, but the fruit is all there, a panoply of ripe blackberries, impressively rich and succulent. Age this wine for five years and more.",93,Charles Joguet 2010 Clos de la Dioterie  (Chinon),,,,
"Aromas of ripe, dark berry, mocha, toast and a whiff of clove lead the nose. The forward palate offers ripe black cherry, fleshy raspberry, vanilla, light oak, coconut and coffee alongside close-grained tannins. A mint note closes the finish. This is straightforward and already accessible so enjoy 2016–2020.",89,Ceretto 2011  Barolo,,,,
"A clean, lively wine with lemon-and-lime flavors and a hint of cocoa and vanilla, it’s rich and dry, with a nice scour of acidity. Turns rich and toasty on the pretty finish. It’s rough, but very well made.",86,Thornton NV Brut  (California),,,,
"Waxy on the nose, with buttercup, creamy yellow-fruit scents and white flowers. The palate is wet, racy and a touch like soda, with sweet, candied flavors of peach and melon. Plods along with good enough acidity to support the wine's core sweetness and candied qualities.",86,Viñas del Vero 2009 Chardonnay (Somontano),,,,
"Delicate tones of stone fruit, lime, talc power and honeydew melon mark the bouquet. It's crisp on the palate, with a touch of wild salvia on the finish.",86,Argiolas 2011 Costamolino  (Vermentino di Sardegna),,,,
"Lifted peach and chamomile just hint at the maturity of this wine that has barely begun its trajectory. The palate is still taut and firm, fresh with lemon zest and singing with an evolved, lifted purity. This does not need sweetness to propel its flavor: its slender poise and purity make it soar on its own. The more you taste, the more you find: drops of soy, glints of stone, shimmers of citrus and lanolin. It's gorgeous, concentrated, incisive and long.",95,Leon Beyer 2008 Comtes d'Eguisheim Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"Another of Noceto's stellar small-production Sangiovese, this one plummy with tobacco and sour cherry most prominent and a slight hint of sweetness as it finishes. Dos Oakies comes from the winery's oldest vineyard section of Sangiovese and has a loyal following of Sangiovese lovers.",87,Noceto 2008 Dos Oakies Sangiovese (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),,,,
"Ripe Anjou pear, Key-lime skins, white lily and white peach show on the nose of this wine from an increasingly popular vineyard. The palate is clean and straightforward, with pear cider, Gala apple and concrete minerality.",89,Testarossa 2014 Tondre Grapefield Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"A bit tight and dainty on the nose, with reserved apple custard and white-flower aromas, this top-level bottling shows lots of nerve and verve once sipped. It offers salt, lime juice and honeysuckle on the palate, with lots of tension that lasts long after the bottle has been opened. It's a well-structured white.",90,Gainey 2013 Limited Selection Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"A vineyard-designate for the producer since 1975, the fruit shows well in this wine, an exotic tribute to tropical elements and stone fruit like peach, supported by a medium-weighted amount of vanilla oak. The ripeness of the fruit is complemented by endnotes of minerality and herbs.",90,Chateau St. Jean 2013 Belle Terre Vineyard Chardonnay (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Produced from a field blend of Douro varieties, and foot trodden in open granite fermenters, this is a wine that has an excellent future. It also has such delicious juicy black fruits that it could be drunk soon. Ideally, though, keep this ripe sweet wine until 2026.",90,Quinta das Carvalhas 2013 Vintage  (Port),,,,
"The merest touch of apricot caresses the vanilla and hazelnut notes of fine oak. The palate, on the other hand, conveys power and concentration, held tight and taut by lemon freshness. This will take a little while in bottle to unfold and should entice lovers of Chardonnay with its combination of bright freshness and lush fruit.",92,Anton Bauer 2015 Kreuzgang Chardonnay (Wagram),,,,
"Elegant and aromatic, this 2013 offers light flavors of apple and raspberry, a dusting of cocoa and excellent balance. It does feel a bit thin as it fades out, but keeps its definition and focus.",88,WillaKenzie Estate 2013 Jory Hills Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),,,,
"Fresh and bright aromas of blackberry pastry and black-cherry fruit show on the nose of this wine from a longtime Paso producer. There are tart tannins on the palate, with red-cherry flavors enhanced by turned black earth, dried mint and dill.",88,Castoro Cellars 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"Lightly toasted and animated up front, with mixed berry, asphalt and gritty aromas, this feels tough, tannic and chewy. A blend of herbal berry and green notes infiltrate standard raspberry and cherry flavors. This finishes slightly bitter and with notes of green herbs.",84,Portia 2012 Ebeia Roble  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"This copper-tinted rosé of Pinot Noir smells like a rubber gym ball and citrus fruits. A full round bouncy palate brings it around, while dry citrus and stone-fruit flavors show a skins-like quality on a steady finish.",86,Zorzal 2016 Terroir Único Pinot Noir Rosé (Tupungato),,,,
"From a vineyard atop the Cuesta Grade, this atypical yet awesome blend of 68% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Petite Sirah, 5% Petit Verdot and 2% Malbec shows blackberries, beef char, pencil lead, coffee beans and a touch of dried dill on the nose. Though flavors are still unfolding, there's plenty of blueberry, violet, lavender, soy, dried strawberry and night jasmine on the palate.",92,Ancient Peaks 2012 Oyster Ridge Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"Floral fruit gives this powerful wine a great lift, bringing out the tannins, the black fruits and acidity. Its structure is still young and packed with dark tannins, suggesting that this complex, rich wine needs further aging. Drink from 2019.",92,Quinta da Romaneira 2014 Touriga Nacional (Duriense),,,,
"From the outset this is woody and artificial in style. Aromas of milk chocolate and clove are strange and forced. In the mouth, this feels wiry but also gummy, with clove-heavy oak and tannic bite. In general, this is overly woody, candied and seemingly not natural.",82,Santa Ema 2014 Reserva Merlot (Maipo Valley),,,,
"Dense and dark smelling, with coconut, tobacco, perfumed berry fruit and leather aromas. Feels powerful and layered, with tough tannins and a rugged overall mouthfeel. Flavors of dark berry, toast, herb and spice are rewarding, while the finish is herbal and chocolaty.",89,Santa Carolina 2009 Reserva de Familia Carmenère (Rapel Valley),,,,
"There's a fascinating presence of herb-roasted chicken to the well-balanced nose of this Chardonnay from the historic Brousseay Vineyard, alongside chalky minerality, golden apple and Asian pear. Once sipped, it's very easy on the palate, with baked apple, wet stone, slight kiwi and a noticeable salinity.",91,Testarossa 2012 Brosseau Vineyard Chardonnay (Chalone),,,,
"A little green, with a minty sharpness to the modest cherry-berry flavors. But it's dry and sound, and a pretty good everyday sipper at this price.",84,Castle Rock 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"This is an unusual view of the red Castelão grape, here vinified as a white wine with no skin color at all. Some wood aging adds spice and roundness to what is a smooth, while toasty, wine. Its white fruit and acidity are joined by some tannins. So this wine needs a few more months. Drink from early 2018.",86,Wines & Winemakers 2016 Pegos Claros Branco Castelão (Península de Setúbal),,,,
"Harmonious on the bouquet, this has aromas of berry, marzipan and nutmeg. It feels a little acidic but that adds freshness to the package. The flavors of earthy, roasted fruits are a touch salty, and the finish tastes briney and baked, with notes of coffee and toast. A blend of 65% Tempranillo, 20% Merlot and 15% Caberent Sauvignon.",88,Príncipe de Viana 2006 Reserva Red (Navarra),,,,
"Assertively toasty and nutty, this is barrel-fermented in new oak, but in 500-liter puncheons, not the smaller barriques, so that the wood doesn't overwhelm. Peach, vanilla and citrus flavors completely fill the mouth, yet remain fresh and vibrant on the finish. Drink now–2012. Imported by Epic Wines.",91,Yering Station 2005 Reserve Chardonnay (Yarra Valley),,,,
"Leather, smashed berries and juniper reveal the age of this wine, further enhanced with a meaty mouthfeel, redolent with flavors of blueberry and purple fruits. Charred vanilla touches on the finish.",90,Core Winery 2008 Reserve Tempranillo (Santa Barbara),,,,
"Overt can't-miss aromas of mustard and sauerkraut would be fine if this were a hot dog, but it's not. In the mouth, this feels strained and wiry. Sour pickled flavors of cabbage and plum finish raw. This is loaded with challenges and flaws.",81,Pagos de Valcerracin 2015  Ribera del Duero,,,,
"This wine shows good balance between the lively acidity and ripe notes of red apple flesh, pear and orange oil. The round mouthfeel of ripe fruit flavors are lifted on the finish by a tangy, green plum and lime zest accent. Drink now.",86,Winery of Good Hope 2011 Bush Vine Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch),,,,
"Mildly roasted berry and asphalt aromas set up clean berry and plum flavors that also feature accents of herbs and olive. Tastes good and clean, with nothing out of the ordinary. A little generic in the end, but fine for everyday drinking.",86,Caliterra 2007 Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"Good price for a Pinot of this quality. It's dry and silky in the mouth, with classic Pinot flavors of cherries, spices and cola, enriched with smoky oak.",87,Parkers Estate 2010 Four Keys Crossing Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),,,,
"A crisp, very textured wine that has red fruits and a salty edge from the closeness of the vines to the sea. It has a mineral texture, grapefruit and raspberry flavors, intense and bone dry. The wine needs food to be at its best.",90,Les Vignobles Gueissard 2013 Cuvée G Rosé (Bandol),,,,
"Touches of yellow apple and sponge cake entice on the nose. The palate adds ripe, friendly and appetizing notes of yellow plum and lemon alongside creamy fizz set against a softly autolytic background. This presents a lovely union of fruit, freshness and development. Full of flavor, is has a dry, lemony finish.",91,Gustave Lorentz NV Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),,,,
"When people talk about good value Cabs from Chile, this is what they should be referring to. The nose is balanced and offers plenty of clean berry aromas, while the palate is fresh, light in weight and mildly citrusy, with flavors of cassis, plum and raspberry. More snappy and fresh than weighty.",87,Morandé 2007 Pionero Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),,,,
"Made with dried Garganega grapes, this opens with heady aromas of passion fruit, dried nectarine slices and candied lemon. Concentrated and juicy, the delicious palate doles out peach jam, acacia honey and pastry alongside bright acidity that adds freshness.",92,Gini 2011 Col Foscarin  (Recioto di Soave Classico),,,,
"Apple, peach and melon aromas are clean and fruity. The palate on this Verdejo is melony, which matches the wine's melon and papaya flavors. On the finish, a note of apple cider is detectable. Because of moderate acidity and some flab, it's advisable to drink this now.",87,Nisia 2014 Old Vines Verdejo (Rueda),,,,
"Rather lean, with high acidity, the wine has red currant fruits, a taut texture and a light spice character.",83,Roquevale 2007 Tinto da Talha Red (Alentejo),,,,
"Like the label says, this Viognier is sweet, with honey, apricot, orange and vanilla cream flavors, brightened with fine acidity. Give it more concentration, and the score would soar. Still, it's a very nice dessert wine for the price.",90,Novy 2010 Oley Late Harvest Sweet Viognier (Russian River Valley),,,,
This juicy wine's considerable acidity gives freshness and a less pleasant lemon flavor that cuts into the ripe black currant fruit. Herbs and dry tannins at the end suggest an underripe character.,84,Château Fleur de Plaisance 2011  Côtes de Bourg,,,,
"Intensely dense and feral, this wine opens with a thicket of tart cherry and strawberry, followed by leathery black pepper and lavender. Medium in body and acidity, it works for the table, finding balance as it goes, before a rich taste of toffee finishes things off.",92,Gary Farrell 2013 Grist Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Aromas of savory spice and black fruits are mild. This is wide on the palate, with a touch of acidic scour. Blackberry, sweet black currant and chocolate are the key flavors, followed by modest spice and toast on the finish. The wine is good, but low on complexity and character.",87,Rios de Chile 2011 Gran Reserva Syrah (Cachapoal Valley),,,,
"Fresh and informal, this lean, easygoing red offers aromas and flavors of crunchy sour cherry, ground pepper and a hint of star anise. Brisk acidity gives it a racy feel.",85,Convento Cappuccini 2013 Don Giovanni  (Barbera d'Asti),,,,
"Another jazzy, Best Buy winner from Barnard Griffin, this 2011 Chardonnay should be sipped to the tune of Harry Nilsson's “Put The Lime In The Coconut,” which neatly captures the flavors. Complex fruits, including apples, citrus—and yes, coconut—add up to a wine both sleek and satisfying, with toasted almonds rounding out the finish.",90,Barnard Griffin 2011 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Lightly fined and unfiltered, it's slightly cloudy in appearance with notes of mineral, citrus, herbs and spice. Aged partly in neutral oak, with the rest in stainless steel, the flavors are light, with a creamy midpalate and tart, electric acids, that verge on sour. Pair this with shellfish to see it at its best.",87,W.T. Vintners 2012 Underwood Mountain Vineyard Grüner Veltliner (Columbia Gorge (WA)),,,,
"A flagship of the Faiveley range, this is a structured wine with great acidity and beautiful perfumes. The wine is dense, already balanced with the red fruits shining through the tannins. It will develop slowly and will not be ready to drink before 2023.",94,Domaine Faiveley 2014 Clos des Cortons Faiveley  (Corton),,,,
"Lifted, notes of pure lemon zest fill the nose while the palate follows up and throws in some riper notions akin to plump, little, yellow mirabelle plums. There is a wonderfully textured midpalate that lends more body to this slender figure. The purity of the fruit expressed here is thrilling, as is the lemony freshness that pervades everything.",94,Domäne Wachau 2014 Achleiten Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),,,,
"This wine offers notes of woodspice, butterscotch, coffee and blackberry. The fruit flavors are lighter in style with mouthwatering acids and firm, grippy tannins that need some time or perhaps a big, juicy steak to tame them.",89,Henry Earl 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),,,,
"Slightly dusty oak tones of dill, vanilla and sweet spice accentuate the maturity of this barrel-aged Chardonnay. It's a full bodied, densely textured wine with lingering flavors of dried apple and pear. Drink now.",86,Adirondack Winery 2015 Barrel Aged Adirondack Overlook Chardonnay (New York),,,,
"Dark fruit and violet aromas are muted under opulent notes of vanilla and oak. On the palate, skin-driven, dark fruit flavors combine with rough oak, while chewy tannins linger on the long, bitter finish.",89,Trump 2014 New World Reserve Red (Monticello),,,,
"This full-bodied, fleshy wine fits the typical Châteauneuf-du-Pape mold, delivering ample black-cherry and plum fruit, then layering atop hints of Mexican chocolate and baking spices. Drink now–2025.",92,Domaine Lucien Barrot et Fils 2013 La Sousto Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),,,,
"Fruity and easygoing, this blend of 60% Sangiovese and 40% Syrah doles out crushed black cherry, blackberry, spiced blueberry, white pepper and clove. Supple tannins support the juicy flavors and give it a smooth texture. Drink now.",88,Rocca delle Macìe 2012 Sasyr Red (Toscana),,,,
"This stalky wine has black currant fruit and touches of spice and toast. Acidity and tannins are present, offering texture and a crisp finish that make it approachable for drinking now.",84,Vinadeis 2016 Le Val Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de France),,,,
"Said to be the first traditional method sparkling wine produced in Turkey, this is made from Kalecik Karasi, an indigenous red grape. It delivers a bouquet of Granny Smith apple, ripe peach and white flowers. These are followed by a strong sense of effervescence and flavors of nectarine, lemon, green apple and rose petal, with the faintest sense of sweetness. It is zesty and alive, culminating in a lingering peach-pie finish.",91,Vinkara 2014 Yasasin Kalecik Karasi (Ankara),,,,
"Ripe and fruity, the wine has rich cherry flavors, a touch of tannin and a rounded, smooth texture. The tannins are already well embedded in the fruit, giving a wine that is both fresh and ripe.",87,Pardon et Fils 2013 Cuvée de l'Hermitage  (Beaujolais-Villages),,,,
"This pale-colored wine is fruity and soft. With plenty of acidity and a dosage that keeps flavors fresh rather than dry, it has red fruits cut through with attractive citrus acidity. The wine is well balanced and ready to drink.",89,Perrier Jouët NV Blason Rosé Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"This is almost as impressive as Gerin's La Champine Syrah, which is a tremendous achievement as Viognier seems much harder to do well. Hints of crushed stone and struck flint add nuance to the ripe apricot aromas, while the exotic, tropical fruit flavors of mango and pineapple are reined in by a touch of citrus-pith bitterness. Drink now–2018.",88,Domaine Jean-Michel Gerin 2015 La Champine Viognier (Collines Rhôdaniennes),,,,
"Inox is the winery's unoaked Chardonnay, the first of the vintage. This bottling provides a promising glimpse into the quality of the 2012s. It's so rich and ripe in citrus and tropical fruits, you won't miss the barrel influence. Try now with sushi, tuna tartare, or a salad of bitter greens, tropical fruits and feta cheese.",90,Melville 2012 Clone 76 Inox Estate Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Cabernet Franc has been the signature wine for Barrister since the first release in 2001. Once again it comes out dark and smoky in the house style, but with more spine and muscle than the Barrister Merlot. It's fully ripe and not at all vegetal, though you will find that it has the characteristic Cab Franc streak of pepper and coffee behind ripe black cherry and cassis fruit.",90,Barrister 2006 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
High-toned aromatics emphasize baking spices (the wine spent two years in mostly neutral oak). Light red fruits fill in the rest. The flavors recall a morning glory breakfast muffin done as a red wine.,88,Jaxon 2014 Tempranillo (Rogue Valley),,,,
"Big, powerful and flashy, this is made in the modern cult style, showing ripeness, high alcohol and oakiness. The blackberry and cassis flavors are classic Napa, while the texture is smooth and mellow, but as heady as cognac.",89,Roberts & Rogers 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),,,,
"Opens with sharp cherry, cola and mint aromas. The palate is fairly acidic and sheering, but it's also zesty and fresh, with clean berry and mild raisin flavors. Offers reasonably good length, with an acidic choppiness balanced by good fruit flavors.",85,Merum 2006 Old Vines Crianza Tempranillo (Vinos de Madrid),,,,
"Smoky, flinty crushed-stone notes are kissed with a blossomy perfume on this delicately structured, off-dry Riesling. The palate is concentrated with sweet, sunny peach and apricot flavors, but piercing acidity bristles on the tongue through the finish.",90,Ulrich Langguth 2010 Piesporter Günterslay Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"This is a viscous, pruney dessert wine made from 45% Zinfandel and 55% Mixed Blacks. Labeled as 8% residual sugar, it exhibits that sweetness in an intensity of ripe, tannic blackberry and leather.",86,Bodkin 2014 The Crown Jewels Red (Sonoma County),,,,
"As densely built as its name suggests, this wine is grippy with black fruit and robust tannin, its full-bodied concentration laced with integrated oak. Brooding blackberry and black cherry dominate the midpalate, with a one-two punch of chocolate and tobacco, finishing with clove and pepper spice.",90,The Heavy 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Parent company Schramsberg has a great track record with this JD bottling, and with this 2011, they've produced another fine, ageable wine. It's dry, tannic and complex in blackberry jam, mu shu plum sauce and oak flavors. Beautiful to drink now, it will gain traction through 2020.",92,JD 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),,,,
"This savory wine opens with aromas of crushed red berries and violets. The soft, straightforward palate offers juicy black cherry layered with clove and mocha alongside velvety tannins. It's already extremely accessible so enjoy now.",89,Fattoria di Petroio 2010  Chianti Classico,,,,
"Bright and easy-to-drink, this Sangiovese delivers aromas and flavors of candied cherry, raspberry, Mediterranean herb and white pepper. Supple tannins and fresh acidity support juicy flavors.",87,Candialle 2012 La Misse  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"Aromas of ripe raspberry jam, plum, menthol and baking spice lead the nose on this bold red. The dense palate delivers raisin, dried black cherry and licorice alongside assertive, close-grained tannins that grip the finish.",90,Accordini Igino 2011 Le Bessole  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),,,,
"At first, the bouquet seems dense and tinged with a mild lactic note, but that moves on rather quickly. The flavor profile of banana, pear and apple is perfectly fine, while the finish is a bit lean.",85,Casa Rivas 2001 Reserva - Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Maipo Valley),,,,
"The attraction here is the beautiful packaging. Embedded with sparkling crystals that spell Bottega, this showcase wine will appeal to a young crowd. The sparkler is Pinot Noir, made as a white wine, with a floral bouquet and a lean mouthfeel.",85,Bottega NV Bottega (Crystals) Brut Pinot Nero (Veneto),,,,
"Delicate orange blossom and pear aromas waft from the glass. The linear palate offers crisp apple, juicy peach and a bitter almond note coupled with brisk acidity.",88,Ca' Rugate 2013 San Michele  (Soave Classico),,,,
"This 100% Cabernet is so rich with blackberries, black currants and oak, you might be tempted to drink it now. Don't. It's a wine that will develop over many years. The tannins are thick and structured, and the acidity balanced. Begin drinking this beauty in 2018.",94,Goldschmidt 2008 Game Ranch Single Vineyard Selection PLUS Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),,,,
"Hints of smoke, crushed mineral and pollen lend an earthen dimension to pristine white grapefruit and tangerine in this elegant off-dry Riesling. Juicy citrus flavors are satisfying and thirst quenching, accentuated by zesty acidity and a pleasant touch of astringency on the finish. Drink now through 2021.",90,Baron Knyphausen 2013 Charta Kabinett Riesling (Rheingau),,,,
"A richly fruity wine, warm and ripe. Spice, tannins and black plums are all there in a concentrated package that projects richness. It's perfumed although it does need to age. Drink from 2016.",88,C. da Silva 2011 Dalva Reserva Red (Douro),,,,
"One sip is all it takes to understand that this is a vital, impressive and possibly profound wine. A blend of 96% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc, it displays the voluptuous richness of a Heidi Barrett wine, but also shows a firmness of character and a structural dryness that elevate it. Exceptionally flavorful in blackberries and cherries, it has tantalizing hints of herbs, olive tapenade and, of course, intensely fine oak. Drink now–2016.",95,Amuse Bouche 2008 Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Light spice notes and jammy berry aromas are about all you get from this Prieto Picudo-based wine. The palate is sheering in feel, with cherry, plum and apple skin flavors. Just weighty enough, with a juicy profile and finishing flavors of cola and lean red fruits. Drink now.",85,Pardevalles 2006 Gamonal Prieto Picudo (Tierra de León),,,,
"This rarely explored grape, also known as Trebbiano, proves quite exciting in this bottling. Aromas recall ripe lime flesh, white flowers, green apples, Asian pears and white peach, with a nearly tropical banana sap character. The palate tightens around the limey acidity, showing some ripe red apple, but remaining bright, ready to pair with everything from roast chicken to shellfish.",90,Paix Sur Terre 2014 Kiler Grove Vineyard Ugni Blanc (Paso Robles Willow Creek District),,,,
"Heavy, rubbery aromas of iodine and damp cellar are earthy but not fully convincing. Like many Michel Rolland wines, this is huge, spongy and tannic, with maximum extraction. Massive, grapy flavors of black fruits and bacon finish herbal, minty and tannic to an extreme. Drink through 2019.",88,Bodega Rolland 2012 Mariflor Michel Rolland Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Deep, dark and oaky smelling, with tons of mocha on top of ripe black fruit aromas. There's both heft and elegance to this wine, that and coffee, spice and exotic black fruit flavors. Finishes toasty and spicy, with a rich, chunky, structured feel. Impressive; drink now through 2013.",92,Dominio de Tares 2007 Exaltos Cepas Viejas Mencía (Bierzo),,,,
Peach aromas open a smooth wine. It has acidity certainly but also some good melon and pear ripeness. There is an herbaceous edge that cuts through the finish.,84,Château Dame Jane 2010  Bordeaux Blanc,,,,
"The nose gives nothing away apart from the occasional grassy glimpse. The creamy, frothy palate shows soft apple and citrus notes fizzing away and ending on an off-dry, gentle finish, informed by real lemony freshness.",87,Schlumberger Wein- und Sektkellerei NV White Secco Méthode Traditionelle Sparkling (Österreichischer Sekt),,,,
"Aromas of baking spice, clove and dried red fruit lead to full yet elegant flavors that coat the palate. It doesn't quite stand up on its own but should do well at the dinner table.",89,Almquist 2009 Purple Sage Vineyard Dolcetto (Wahluke Slope),,,,
"Poggio al Vento (from the 2004 vintage) shows smoky and savory notes of forest floor, bramble, cured meat, barbecue spice and teriyaki sauce. The wine is compact in the mouth, with polished tannins.",92,Col d'Orcia 2004 Poggio al Vento  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"An attractively aromatic wine, full of open fruitiness. It has layers of black currant fruit that go with the fresh acidity, plus a touch of herbs that are followed by firm tannins. Juicy and ready to drink from 2015.",86,Château Crusquet de Lagarcie 2009  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,,,,
"Notes of vanilla, macerated wild berries and leather lead onto the medium-full, ripe-feeling palate. A note of Nilla wafer surfaces on the finish.",86,Bluestone 2011 Petit Verdot (Shenandoah Valley),,,,
Structured and lean this is wine that seems to have lost its fruit. It will likely remain dry because of the tough extraction.,84,Château les Bertrands 2014 Cuvée Vieilles Vignes  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),,,,
"An earthy geranium note lingers above a core of dark cherry and raspberry on the nose. The medium-bodied palate boasts light tannins and a flavor profile of cherries, wilting red flowers and anise.",87,2 Lads 2013 Pinot Noir (Old Mission Peninsula),,,,
"Silky wine, fresh and light, balanced with high acidity cutting through black berry fruits. The structure has some substance, but this is a light, aromatic wine, developing fast, already delicious, and only for medium-term aging.",93,Château Margaux 2007  Margaux,,,,
"A relatively dry kabinett, with slightly nutty scents of vegetable oil followed by flavors of peach pit and underripe melon. But the sum of the parts is actually better than they sound alone, offering fresh, lemony refreshment with mineral underpinnings. Drink now.",85,Dr. Heyden 2005 Oppenheimer Kabinett Riesling (Rheinhessen),,,,
"A funk city nose is far from fresh and familiar—look for aromas of vitamins, pickled cabbage and warm, dusty radiator. A slightly rough full-sized palate tastes briny and funky, with little fruit. This is chunky, briny tasting and salty on the finish.",85,Damia 2012 1637 Seleccion Especial Brut Rosado Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"Pure varietal, with ripe fruit hinting at an encroaching pruney flavor, this is wrapped in the big flavors of barrel toast, smoke and coffee. Quite consistent with the overall style of winemaker Charlie Hoppes, this is one of those wines that will engender heated discussions between admirers and critics.",86,Fidelitas 2007 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A classic wine from Central Italy, Titulus is packaged in that iconic amphora-shaped bottle and offers fresh aromas of crisp lemon, cut grass and talc powder. With nearly 200,000 cases made, the wine is widely available in retail.",85,Fazi Battaglia 2011 Titulus  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi),,,,
"There's a great freshness to this Chenin, with upfront, juicy notes of clementine, Granny Smith apples and green melon rinds. The light and refreshing palate transitions into a bright, mouthwatering finish, with accents of pineapple-flavored acidity.",89,Beaumont 2011 Chenin Blanc (Walker Bay),,,,
"Fragrant and fruity, this is a bright, crisp and clean wine that's totally ready to drink. Lively, with a cool feeling like the nearby ocean's breezes, it finishes with light acidity.",86,DFJ Vinhos 2012 Coreto Branco White (Lisboa),,,,
"This wine shows unusually prominent aromas and flavors of dried rice that are followed by wilted flowers, dried leaves, cocoa and dark fruit. It doesn't all come together.",85,Columbia Crest 2013 Reserve Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"Coldstream Hills is better known for its Chardonnays and Pinot Noirs than its Sauvignon Blanc, but this is a solid effort. It's medium in body, with simple grapefruit and pineapple flavors and a crisp, clean finish.",85,Coldstream Hills 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Yarra Valley),,,,
"If you expect coquettish flirting you must go elsewhere: this amply layered red will not give up its secrets easily. But engage with it and it will reward with poised, polished structure, subtle pepper spice and ripe but reined-in cherry fruit. The more time you spend with it, the more you'll discover. Ready from 2015.",91,Iby 2011 Chevalier Blaufränkisch (Mittelburgenland),,,,
"This is a stunning, vibrantly robust and intense wine, big, bold and reductive and blended with 3% Petite Sirah. Floral aromas take on meaty, gamy overtones amidst black licorice, tar and juicy strawberry, the tannins silky and supportive and the finish leathery and spicy.",95,Shafer 2013 Relentless Syrah (Napa Valley),,,,
"This dense and spicy wine is powerful, with a dry core that tends toward sweetness. It features pepper as well as lychee flavors, followed by a light touch of acidity and a firmly structured finish.",90,Mittnacht Frères 2010 Les Terres Blanches Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"As an expression of pure power, this wine is hard to beat. It has the classic Brunello color—red with edges of brick. The aromas are of bitter coffee, herbs and mature, ripe fruit. On the palate, the concentration is enormous, the tannins pack a serious punch and the supermature fruit is black and bright. All this gives it a one-dimensional, if impressive quality.",89,Castiglion del Bosco 1997  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"A vibrantly aromatic wine with notes of dried apricot and fresh flowers. It's full bodied, weighty in feel with the flavor concentration dissipating toward the warm finish.",87,Telaya 2012 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This is a supple, medium- to full-bodied red for drinking over the next few years. The plummy flavors are a bit earthy, dark and indistinct, but pleasant enough, and the wine's silky finish features a bright burst of red fruit.",89,Château du Trignon 2009  Gigondas,,,,
"Mellow, ripe Comice pear on the nose leads into a soft, expressive yet light-bodied palate that has slight spritz, subtle, pear-scented flavors and a mellowing earthiness surrounded by overtones of dandelion and jasmine. At the center there is acidic verve. This is very elegant and very balanced.",93,Weingut Christ 2013 Bisamberg White (Wiener Gemischter Satz),,,,
"Slightly more graceful and elegant than the same winery's Mathilde Reserve, which comes across as a bit chunky and oaky. This wine features cherry and vanilla notes, with a slightly creamy, easy-to-like texture in the mouth.",87,Aurum 2006 Pinot Noir (Central Otago),,,,
"Strong and eccentric, this tastes like the grapes from this fine vineyard had a hit of botrytis. But it's not sweet; the end result is dry, with apricot and honey flavors.",86,Suacci Carciere Wines 2009 Heintz Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"From the Columbia Valley AVA in Oregon, this is quite different from Willamette Valley Pinot Noir. It's a warmer, drier climate, and the wine has tighter flavors, with sharp tannins. There's cherry fruit and chocolate from barrel aging, with a hard, slightly bitter finish.",85,Cathedral Ridge 2008 Pinot Noir (Columbia Valley (OR)),,,,
"Barrel fermentation, malolactic fermentation and lees aging add buttery, creamy, spicy complexities to this clean, steely wine. The underlying fruity flavors are not intense and veer toward leaner citrus and green apple flavors. It's a focused wine, not overblown. —S.H.",87,Ventana 1999 Reserve Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),,,,
"Green and yellow pear are subsumed into a savory whole composed of yeast and crushed kitchen herbs. There are highlights of Granny Smith apple and lemon rind, of lovage and white pepper, and all of these flavors are put into tight, peppery focus on the slender but concentrated palate. This fizzes with peppery spice and zest.",93,Jurtschitsch 2014 Loiserberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),,,,
"A fresh style, showing crisp black currant flavors, acidity, a touch of licorice and a layer of dry tannin. Attractive, spicy finish.",85,Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite) 2006 Réserve Spéciale  (Bordeaux),,,,
"Winemaker J. P. Valot, who is from Argentina, shows a confident touch with this grape. Mixed fruit flavors of red plum, golden raisin and fig bring a unique character to this well-balanced wine. Solid through the midpalate, it carries into a generous, lightly chocolaty finish.",90,Silvan Ridge 2014 Malbec (Rogue Valley),,,,
"Here's a simple, softly tannic Pinot Noir to drink now for its fruitiness. Raspberry, cola and oak flavors are wrapped into a silky palate that finishes dry and spicy.",84,Sonoma Cuvée 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),,,,
"Simple but well made, this medium-bodied, supple wine features plenty of tart cherry fruit and a crisp finish.",86,Matua 2014 Pinot Noir (Marlborough),,,,
"Black fruits are wreathed in subtle notes of earth, smoke and graphite. This is a palate-pleasing wine, but seems a little too safe, lacking the complexity and northern Rhône accents that Washington Syrahs often show.",88,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2010 Ethos Reserve Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"There is much to like about the youthful vibrancy of this wine from Texas-raised Ryan Roark. It packs bright and fruity raspberry, pomegranate, hibiscus and crushed violet aromas on the nose. The refreshing palate pairs snappy raspberry fruit with fennel pollen and eucalyptus touches.",93,Roark Wine Co. 2015 Burning Creek Ranch Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Creamy brie rind aromas mesh with scratched yellow grapefruit skin and a steely minerality on the nose of this small-batch bottling from a winery atop the appellation's ridgeline. Light and focused flavors of kumquat juice, iodine and lime skin satisfy the palate, and would be a perfect match for shellfish.",94,Thomas Fogarty 2012 Albutom Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"A beautifully smooth wine, with a rich Port-like texture. The dry, firm tannins give the wine impressive structure, although it remains opulent, its dark fruit, cocoa and herbal flavors just breathing the concentration of the Douro.",93,Quinta Vale Dona Maria 2007 Red (Douro),,,,
"Heavy, raisiny, ripe aromas of prune and earthy blackberry set up a chewy, oaky, mildly tannic palate that's fully stuffed with woody, baked, almost malty flavors of blackberry, chocolate and toast. This is a rich, ripe number, with a loamy, toasty finish that shows black licorice and jammy cassis flavors. Drink through 2018.",91,Santa Carolina 2011 VSC Red (Cachapoal Valley),,,,
"Still in its infancy, this is a white that deserves some time in the cellar to truly harmonize and shine. Currently, it's rich and woody, with assertive notes of creamy pear, apricot, red apple flesh, honeycomb and baking spice. The round and lush mouthfeel offers additional flavors of mango and orange oil, lifted by a fine thread of acidity. Toasty spice lingers on the finish; drink after 2014.",91,Hamilton Russell 2011 Chardonnay (Hemel en Aarde),,,,
"There's lots of brisk, mouthwatering acidity in this Chardonnay. It shows clean, pure apricot, orange, tropical fruit and lime flavors, with a touch of honey and buttery oak.",85,Muirwood 2012 Reserve Zanetta Vineyard Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),,,,
"Although initially austere, this wine then opens out well, giving a firm and structured character. There are spice, solid dry tannins and a fine layer of berry fruits, finishing off with lively acidity.",86,Barton & Guestier 2006  Médoc,,,,
"Wrapped in a coat of oak that provides toasty character, this voluptuously concentrated wine is marked by deeply defined flavors of cola, blackberry and cherry, lifted and given a sense of freshness by spicy acidity.",89,MacPhail 2014 Vagon Rouge Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Very light, even thin, this white lacks the stuffing sought in a simple quaffing white. There are no overtly off-putting elements here, there's just not much here at all. —M.M.",80,René Barbier NV Mediterranean White White (Catalonia),,,,
"Barolo Bricco Gattera delivers a full palette of aromas that are characteristics of the Nebbiolo grape. You'll recognize luscious berry fruit, wet earth, leather, tobacco, licorice and white truffle. The wine boasts excellent concentration, good acidity, firm tannins and an elegant finish. Drink after 2012.",92,Cordero di Montezemolo 2005 Bricco Gattera  (Barolo),,,,
"The fig, licorice and spice aromas seem somewhat dried out and tired. The cherry and cranberry flavors are smooth, with the tannins showing some grit. Drink now.",86,Chateau Rollat 2011 Rollat Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Aged in oak for 12 months, this rich wine is supple, lightly toasty and full of ripe red fruit. With a background of tannins, it's ready to age for another year. Drink from late 2018.",88,Château Laubès 2015  Bordeaux,,,,
"A very nice Cab, a little dry and brittle by itself, but with a rich core of black currants, cherries and herbs framed in rich tannins. All it needs is a good steak to make it sing.",87,Kunde 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"Roughly half of the blend is made from fruit that comes from 30-year-old vines. An addition of 6% Muscat adds a scent of tree fruit, and the lovely citrus and stone fruit flavors are enhanced by a fresh-baked bread note. It has excellent concentration and impeccable balance, plus a long, satisfying finish.",92,Forgeron 2011 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"From Santa Barbara County's first commercial vineyard, this bottling offers a clean line of lemon butter, toast and oak on the nose.

"Substantially tannic and robust in tar and tobacco, this wine smells and tastes big and broad, a good choice for generous cuts of meat, preferably grilled. Black cherry and blackberry expand in waves around the oak and tobacco.",86,Chateau St. Jean 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Firm and powerful, this tannic wine has dense black-fruit flavors, with enough fruitiness to balance the structure. The finish shows a smoky character, a bitter cherry flavor and bright acidity.",91,L. Tramier & Fils 2010 Collection Premier Cru  (Pommard),,,,
"This is a gentle, perfumed wine that is ripe and deliciously fruity. It does have a more herbal, green side as well as a tangy texture but the main impression is of a wine that is soft and ready to drink.",87,José Maria da Fonseca 2014 Colecção Privada Verdelho (Península de Setúbal),,,,
"This elegant sparkler achieves a nice balance between sweet, fruit flavors and lively crispness. Peach, pear, jasmine and white stone characterize the nose and make for a very approachable, friendly wine.",89,Villa Sandi NV Cartizze  (Prosecco Superiore di Cartizze),,,,
"The iconoclastic Emilio Rojo produces this five-grape blend from terraced vineyards located in inland Galicia. The wine is lush, rich and shows barrel characteristics and depth. The nose is toasty and alluring, but the real play comes in the mouth, which is healthy as an ox, with layered flavors of baked apple, tropical fruits and honey. Long on the finish, with an appealing texture and fine acidity. In perfect condition now; drink through 2013.",93,Emilio Rojo 2009 Blanco White (Ribeiro),,,,

It's balanced and delicious with fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2016.",92,Perticaia 2011  Montefalco Rosso,,,,
"Aromas of dried cheese, iodine and candied fruits settle with airing. In the mouth, this is firm and tannic, with savory, oaky flavors of hickory, blackened toast and roasted berry fruits. On the finish, there's both weight and elegance. Best from 2015 through 2020.",90,Emilio Moro 2010  Ribera del Duero,,,,

Richardson 2005 Chockstone Shiraz (Grampians),,,,
"The sweet aromas of this wine are like boysenberry syrup, but flavors are very lean, dry, smoky and tart. The texture coats the palate with puckering tannins.",82,"Donkey & Goat 2012 Broken Leg Vineyard, The Recluse Syrah (Anderson Valley)",,,,
"From six vineyards across the Central Coast, Josh Jensen's annual cuvée shows black cherry, cola and nutmeg on the straight-ahead nose.

A menthol character carries in to the finish.",91,Calera 2015 Fortieth Anniversary Vintage Pinot Noir (Central Coast),,,,

"Red cherries, dark spices of clove and anise and gingerbread show on the nose of this wine from the Foley family portfolio. Darkness pervades the concentrated palate, with black fruits, dark chocolate, beef char and condensed purple flowers. It's so deep that it lacks noticeable flavor layers.",87,Firestone 2011 The Chairman Series Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Mellow on the nose, with sweet aromas of maple, raisin and sautéed mushroom. Just fresh enough in the mouth, with toffee, vanilla, butter, coconut and mature roasted berry flavors.

"New wood aromas are still strongly evident in this young and fruity wine. It has ripe tannins, a juicy character and attractive, forward fruitiness. The aftertaste has delicious acidity and freshness.",90,Château Vieux Cardinal Lafaurie 2011  Lalande de Pomerol,,,,
"This is a dense wine with firm tannins and a solid structure. The black currant fruits are stalky and still developing, along with the acidity. It's a lean wine and needs to age for a few more months to fill out, so drink from 2017.",88,Magnum Vinhos 2013 Maria Mora Red (Alentejano),,,,
"This wine has an intriguing bouquet of mango, straw and toasted nuts. Concentrated flavors of chamomile, lemon and a stony minerality mix playfully. Round in feel, with delicate acidity, the finish is smooth and dry.",87,The Williamsburg Winery 2015 Acte 12 of 1619 Chardonnay (Virginia),,,,

"A lively, light, dancing wine that is lifted by acidity, white fruits, crisp currants and a touch of pepper. Enjoyable, fresh, vibrant and great as an apéritif. Screwcap.",87,Leth 2006 Felser Weinberge Riesling (Wagram-Donauland),,,,

"So deliciously ripe and sweet, you can drink it now, especially with a great steak. Flatters with raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors, accented with the vanilla and caramel of new oak, and wrapped into soft, ripe tannins. Made in the modern style, it's a decadent wine whose pure, refined tannins testify to their Napa origin. Yet it will develop over the next ten years.",94,Harbison Wines 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Solve every steakhouse wine-ordering quandary with this bottle, which features enough structure to stand up to rare beef without any excessive weight. Hints of vanilla and dark chocolate add depth and interest to the red currant fruit, while fine, dusty tannins clean up the finish. Drink now–2023.",89,Peter Lehmann 2014 Potrait Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa Valley),,,,
"The bouquet on this Cava is a bit gaseous, with mild lime and apple aromas. In the mouth, it's foamy but fresh and lifted. Flavors of candied apple and mango finish in sweet fashion. Nice for Cava but with limits.",87,Marqués de Gelida 2008 Brut Exclusive Gran Reserva Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"Very different from the Bricco delle Viole cru expression from the same producer, this wine offers bold, ripe fruit with lingering tones of red cherry, leather, charcoal and campfire.

"Mostly Malbec and Syrah topped off with Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, it's subtle with notes of freshly hewn wood, plum, cinnamon, and cherry pie. The palate's soft cherry flavors are juxtaposed against oak spices but the wood ultimately wins.",87,Newhouse Family 2009 Vestige Red (Snipes Mountain),,,,
"Tart, acidic hard-candy fruit flavors come through, along with hints of sweet spices. But the wine quickly hits a wall, stopping abruptly in a short, tight finish with austere tannins.",86,Griffin Creek 2012 Merlot (Rogue Valley),,,,
"A simple wine, extracted and jammy in raspberries, cherries and blackberries. Very high alcohol and black pepper flavors combine to create a hot mouthfeel. The wine is also sweet in glycerine.",84,Scott Cellars 2008 Cuvée F Sangiovese-Syrah (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"A generous expression of full-bodied fruit and oak, this wine is ripe in black cherry, plum and black licorice, robust and flavorful. The finish offers integrated tannins with a hint of cinnamon spice.",88,Chateau St. Jean 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Candied lemongrass, cut apple, wet cement, lime peel and warmer peach notes show on the nose of this very typical and likable bottling. Flavors are rounded on the palate, with tropical notes of peach, mango and pear custard.",88,Rancho Sisquoc 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"The nose on this Pinot Noir is fresh and bright with scents of fresh raspberries touched with granite minerality. Medium bodied in style, the palate is marked by flavors of cherry cola and currant, wrapping up with a bitter almond finish.",85,Heron Hill 2011 Ingle Vineyard Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),,,,
"A reductive element of petrol and oak blows off over time bouquet-wise, but in taste and weight, the wine retains a sultry sense of oak and baked apple. Full bodied in style, it manages to stay balanced throughout, finishing in a buoyant twist of citrus.",91,Glasshaus 2013 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"This is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, all estate grown. Winemaker Steve Clifton handles the high (over 15%) alcohol well, and the wine feels full and balanced, but not fat or tiring. The fruit is a pleasant mix of raspberry, cherry and currant; with bright acids and firm tannins to back it up.",89,Ash Hollow 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"This is an elegant and refined Barolo with focused aromas of black fruit, drying mineral and root beer. There's also a playful side that emerges thanks to the wine's ripe and plush mouthfeel. Sure, it's a structured, tannic wine but its fine texture helps make it approachable within the next five years or so.",92,Giacosa Fratelli 2005 Vigna Mandorlo  (Barolo),,,,
"Thin on the palate and yet simultaneously oaky, this funky Merlot includes small amounts of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon.",83,Talaria 2012 Merlot (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"This bright pink rosato opens with touches of apple skin and citrus, especially pink grapefruit. This exceedingly informal box wine could work at picnics or pool parties.",82,Cantina di Soave 2011 Volére Rosato (Delle Venezie),,,,
"This organic bottling, made by the winery's former Winemaker Craig Hawkins (who now spearheads his own brand, Testalonga), is a blend of 54% Chenin Blanc, 31% Viognier and 15% Chardonnay. There's an immediately attractive richness to the nose, thanks to upfront notes of beeswax, honeysuckle, Asian pear, yellow apple and a touch of guava. The medium-weight mouthfeel is surprisingly direct and clean, with tart white fruit and pure citrus tones that carry through to the bright finish. Drink now–2018.",89,Lammershoek 2013 LAM White (Swartland),,,,
"There's a strong herbal backbone to the core of this wine, surrounded by fleshy notes of melon and white peach. The earthy notes mix with a lime rind freshness on the palate, with a nice tropical fruit flavor that stays well into the close. Drink now.",89,Spice Route 2010 Chenin Blanc (Swartland),,,,
"This wine is dry, rich and a perfect representation of a modern Napa Cabernet. Shows intricate layers of black cherries, black and red currants, cassis and minerals, with the funky layer of bacon and olives that the winery's other 2010 Cabs display. Way too young to drink now. Should begin to open after 2018 and hold its own for another decade.",91,Alpha Omega 2010 Beckstoffer Georges III Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),,,,
"A ripe while herbal wine, this is crisp and full of grapefruit and gooseberry fruits. Tangy with lively acidity, it is aromatic with white flowers and has a fresh, fruity aftertaste. Drink now.",86,Sauvion 2015 Loire Valley  (Sancerre),,,,
"A vigorous, aggressive Syrah, this is full bodied and tannic, and it deals assertive blackberry, cherry, currant and sandalwood flavors.",86,Mercy 2009 Zabala Vineyard Syrah (Arroyo Seco),,,,
"Light and simplistic compared to other bottlings from the winery, this is still quite tasty, with aromas of lemon curd, sliced green apple and tangerine blossom. The palate shows stone fruit, vanilla cream and lemon wedges, with a decently grippy tension.",88,Tantara 2014 Tondre Grapefield Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"This Amarone has nearly overripe aromas, with hints of nail varnish and raisin. The palate is better, offering spirit-soaked black cherry, black pepper and licorice notes. You'll also notice the warmth of alcohol on the midpalate.",88,Rubinelli Vajol 2009  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,,,,
"This is easy to like for its clean, brisk mouthfeel, creaminess and slightly sweet flavors of lime and strawberry. Made from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, it shows real finesse.",90,V. Sattui 2009 Prestige Cuvée Brut Sparkling (Napa Valley),,,,
"This is a wine for anyone who longs for an old fashioned Barbara. An interesting, funky  and very complex nose of menthol, wet fur, coffee, and strawberries. On the palate, it seemed surprisingly soft (one would have expected more acidity) and the flavors less funky than the nose, with a core of sweet strawberry fruit at the finish.",88,Marcarini 2005 Ciabot Camerano  (Barbera d'Alba),,,,
"Black-fruit scents combined with cheesy oak aromas are common for Toro. This wine has a wide, pulpy, grabby palate and flavors of black plum, herbal blackberry and savory meat. There's plenty of weight and substance, but it's also a bit stretched and bumpy along the way.",90,Maurodos 2014 Prima  (Toro),,,,
"This wine carries aromas of blackberry and olive. Its dominant flavor of berry with an herbal-rhubarb twist is solid. The finish lifts, with a hint of tomato.",86,Santa Alicia 2011 Reserva Carmenère (Maipo Valley),,,,
"This is an extremely textural pink wine, with delicate touches of raspberry, strawberry, watermelon and the slightest twist of lime on the nose. The blend of 68% Grenache, 13% Counoise, 11% Mourvèdre and 8% Syrah shows grip and acidity on the sip, where lime-soaked nectarine and red apple flavors reign.",91,Tablas Creek 2015 Patelin de Tablas Rosé (Paso Robles),,,,
"Intensely earthy, this wine hails predominantly from Susanna's Vineyard, a site in the heart of the Green Valley section of the larger Russian River Valley that's known for its elevation and coolness. Here, crisp raspberry and cherry do provide a sense of that coolness, but the wine develops into a substantial behemoth of full-bodied richness and weight, with a powerful, peppery finish.",90,MacPhail 2012 The Flyer Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This cru wine comes from a 44-acre vineyard with 50-year-old vines supplied by one of Duboeuf's regular growers. It is structured and dense, perhaps too dense with its heavy dry tannins. The wine will need time. Drink from 2019.",88,Georges Duboeuf 2015 Domaine Mont Chavy  (Morgon),,,,
"Made entirely with Refosco, this robust red has a shy nose that eventually reveals prune and a whiff of ground green pepper. The dense palate offers mature plum, vanilla and a hint of cocoa alongside the heat of evident alcohol and evolved tannins. Drink soon.",87,De Stefani 2014 Kreda Refosco (Veneto),,,,
"Dark spice, forest floor, sun-baked soil and toast aromas lead the nose. The ripe, full-bodied palate doles out raspberry jam, vanilla, licorice and espresso notes, while close-grained tannins provide firm support.",90,Villa I Cipressi 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"This brawny wine opens with subdued aromas that recall leafy underbrush, roasted coffee bean and a whiff of stewed plum. The warm, monolithic palate offers prune steeped in spirits, toasted nut, dark spice and a green note of powdered sage alongside raspy tannins that leave an astringent finish. The heat of evident alcohol on the close throws it further off-balance.",86,Fanti 2011  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"This huge, rich wine has weight and density. What make it still recognizably Bordeaux are the black currant fruits, acidity and the stylish tannins. Everything else is larger than life, with power and concentration. Drink from 2018. Owners Mallet Frères use parcel selection for this 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon blend.",91,Château Haut-Macô 2010 Cuvée Jean Bernard  (Côtes de Bourg),,,,
"Sweet buttered toast, vanilla, pineapple jam and cinnamon spice flavors mark this simple little Chardonnay. It's made in the popular style that's delicious at first, and then palls.",84,Hahn 2010 Nicky Hahn Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Aromas like black olive, clove and dark cherry continue in the flavors of this full-flavored and full-bodied wine. Mellow oak notes like cedar and tobacco add complexity.",87,Longevity 2011 deb-ru-vée Red (California),,,,
"A barrel-aged surprise. The nose is round and toasty but not overwooded. The palate is balanced and elegant, with full, round, integrated flavors of dry apple, cream and spice. Has the right texture to be considered elevated and classy; 70% Treixadura with five other white grapes.",90,Viña Mein 2009 Domillor Harvest Selection White (Ribeiro),,,,
"From the Pratt Vineyard on Sexton Road, this impressive offering is bold and lush, smoothly textured even in its concentration of thick red cherry and forest. It exalts in a shock of white pepper that is beautiful to behold.",91,Saintsbury 2014 Pratt Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"This is a richly structured wine. With its juicy red fruits and generous structure, it is delicious now. Berry flavors and acidity go with the mineral edge of the texture to create a wine that is packed with acidity, tannins and fruit. Drink now.",90,Casa da Passarella 2014 Tinto Red (Dão),,,,
"Brisk and fruity but with a distinctive note of spice and pear, this Moschofilero offers approachable, ripe-fruit expression with an exotic edge. Pair with grilled seafood, Chinese cuisine or fruit salad.",89,Nasiakos 2012 Moschofilero (Mantinia),,,,
"Made with 100% dried Zibibbo grapes, this elegant dessert wine offers intense aromas of ripe apricot, lemon jam and acacia honey. The fresh balanced palate doles out juicy layers of tangerine zest, candied fig and a touch of cinnamon.",93,Donnafugata 2013 Ben Ryé  (Passito di Pantelleria),,,,
"Piercing sour raspberry aromas introduce an edgy, scratchy feeling wine with a combo of minty, herbal pie cherry and red plum flavors. This dries out and finishes modestly, but always with true Pinot Noir character.",86,Lomas del Valle 2012 Coast Cool Climate Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"A modest wine that has much to be modest about. It's dry and rather simple, with candied cherry-berry, cola and spice flavors.",84,One Hope 2009 Merlot (California),,,,
"Vintner Riccardo Cotarella's fantastic Cabernet-based Marciliano (both Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc are present) opens with an intense bouquet of red fruit, blackberry, oak spice and chocolate. The ripeness level is spot-on; and the wine leaves a smooth, soft sensation in the mouth that's followed by firm, age-worthy tannins.",93,Falesco 2007 Marciliano Red (Umbria),,,,
"Mouthfillingly juicy and jammy, this is a big, muscular red blend, dense and concentrated in red and blue fruit. Approachable and accessible, with a mellow structure, it finishes thick in wild vanilla.",90,Buena Vista 2012 The Aristocrat Red (Calistoga),,,,
"Stillwater Creek grapes anchor this outstanding Syrah. Rich cherry flavors, generously awash in cut tobacco and vanilla, gain extra complexity, with hints of smoke and a streak of dusty earth. It's clean, with good grip, and a long, smooth finish.",92,Woodinville Wine Cellars 2009 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Blended with 5% Sémillon, this crisp, tropical white is generous with bright acidity and a strong taste of pineapple and lemon. Zippy minerality adds a stoniness to the texture and flavor, as a fresh-cut grass note lingers in the background.",88,Merryvale 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"Fermented and matured in neutral oak barrels for seven months of lees aging, this has a scent reminiscent of slightly oxidized apple and pear slices, with supporting notes of blonde caramel, lemon yogurt and nectarine. Soft and lax on the attack, it gains vibrancy on the midpalate, ending with a pleasing lemon grass lift.",85,Barboursville Vineyards 2011 Reserve Vermentino (Virginia),,,,
"This own-rooted block is usually blended into Peter Hunken's larger bottling, but this extra-special vintage thankfully got its own stage. Dense boysenberry, black peppercorns, asphalt, charred lamb, dried violets, lilacs and lavender show on the tarry yet floral nose. The palate is zesty with acidity but deep with flavor, offering thyme, soy, rosemary and more peppercorns. It's ideal for a lamb or game dish.",95,Holus Bolus 2014 Franc de Pied Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"A wonderful Grenache, one of the best currently available in California. It comes on the heels of the winery's successful 2010 bottling, suggesting that Landmark has an aptitude for the variety. The wine is as silky as a coastal Pinot Noir, with alcohol of only 13.6% by volume. Gently soft, it shows oak-influenced raspberry, cocoa and cinnamon flavors.",91,Landmark 2011 Steel Plow Estate Vineyard Grenache (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"Basic citrus and apple aromas lead to a round palate that won't stay fresh for much longer. It tastes melony and green, with lettuce flavors and a flat finish.",82,Viña La Rosa 2011 La Palma Sauvignon Blanc (Cachapoal Valley),,,,
"Having spent no time in oak, this crisp, clean white is resplendent in lemon curd and vanilla, joined midway by additional layers of just-picked peach. Medium bodied, with the right texture to hold up to a range of spicy foods, it offers a vibrantly lively finish.",90,Swanson 2014 Pinot Grigio (Sonoma Mountain),,,,
"Dark berry, grilled herb and underbrush aromas float out of the glass along with a whiff of rose. The firm palate offers juicy dark cherry, raspberry, clove, anise and tobacco framed in velvety tannins.",90,Vite Colte 2012 La Casa in Collina  (Barbaresco),,,,
"This hard-drilling, bullish Malbec is bright purple in color, with grapy, heady aromas. The palate is rubbery and grabby, with a shock of zesty acidity. Oversized, roasted black-fruit flavors finish with size, power and a grating feel.",86,Concha y Toro 2011 Serie Riberas Gran Reserva Ribera del Tinguirica Malbec (Marchigue),,,,
"The fruit is forward and lush, the grapes nicely blended and complementary, yielding a complex, mouthfilling wine with a riot of tropical, stone and citrus fruit flavors. There is a trace of new oak and a lingering finish that brings in vanilla, butter and coconut.",91,Olsen Estates 2008 Blanc des Coteaux White (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Savory and approachable, this opens with earthy aromas of tilled soil, ripe plum, dark berry and a whiff of game. The straightforward palate delivers juicy black cherry, blackberry, clove and white pepper alongside polished tannins.",88,Carpineto 2013  Chianti Classico,,,,
"The grapes for this Syrah come from the Ballard Canyon area, which is likely to be Santa Barbara's next official appellation. It's a big, full-bodied wine, tannic and dry, with blackberry, blueberry, smoked meat, black pepper and sandalwood flavors. Feels fine and dramatic in the mouth, and should develop bottle interest through 2015.",92,Blair Fox 2009 Tierra Alta Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"This spicy 100% Merlot wine has tangy black fruits as well as dense texture. It is ripe and very juicy, with intense acidity. It needs to relax (25% new oak barrels; 25% one to two years, the rest in tanks), so drink from 2017.",85,Château Gigault 2012 Cuvée Viva  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),,,,
"Here's a pleasant, easy to drink Grenache. It's dry and tannic and filled with cherry flavors, sweetened with toasty oak. Wisely avoids many of the pitfalls Grenache is subject to. Drink now.",87,Jaffurs 2007 Grenache (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Piastraia is a luscious and decadent wine with a plush, smooth mouthfeel. This blend of Merlot, Syrah, Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon opens with focused mineral tones backed by cherry, blackberry and spice.",92,Michele Satta 2007 Piastraia  (Bolgheri),,,,
"This inky glassful is a little tight now, with firm acidity and coating, sandy tannins. A bit of aging will gently loosen the copious black plum, pepper, char, grilled meat and violet aromas and flavors for extended enjoyment.",88,Beaumont 2000 Shiraz (South Africa),,,,
"Ripe aromas start with raisin, while tobacco notes and baked berry warmth reel you in. This blend of Tempranillo, Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon from the Vinos de Madrid region feels layered and welcoming. Earthy cherry, plum and baking spice flavors finish long, complex and slightly toasty. Drink through 2018.",90,Tagonius 2011 Tinto Roble Red (Vinos de Madrid),,,,
"One-quarter of the wine is aged in wood that leaves the merest touch of toast on the palate. The wine is ripe, hinting at yellow fruits along with an abundance of acidity. The end is crisp and tight, and the wine needs further aging. Drink from 2016.",88,Domaine Laroche 2014 Réserve  (Bourgogne),,,,
"Angular and piquant on the nose, with tight aromas of red zinger tea, fresh herbs and raspberry. This is a Pinot made in a light, coastal style; it offers red cherry, cough drop and tea-like flavors in front of a lasting, unforced but mild finish. A year in French oak has added a buttery element, and overall the wine rings true but distant.",86,Montes 2007 Alpha Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley),,,,
"Packaged in an elegantly frosted bottle, this brawny wine deliver the goods. It shows intensity, persistency and is tightly packed with luscious aromas of black cherry, leather, tobacco and black olive. The tannins are velvety and rich without being overdone.",91,Cesari 2008  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,,,,
"This falls a little to the thin side of Syrah, at least Syrah grown here in Washington where the grape thrives. Varietal flavors of herb, pepper and stem are in evidence, with an overall impression of lightly ripened berry fruit, stiff tannins, and ample acidity.",87,Novelty Hill 2011 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Obalo is a consistently very good to excellent example of Rioja crianza. This is full and oaky up front, with tobacco, vanilla and briary black-fruit scents. A flush, voluminous palate is balanced and delivers earthy blackberry and chocolate flavors in front of a lively finish with a touch of buttery oak. Drink through 2019.",90,Obalo 2011 Crianza  (Rioja),,,,
"A touch of honey sweetness accents zesty pineapple and lemon flavors in this harmoniously off-dry Riesling. Concentrated and juicy yet pert with acidity, it refreshes with ease and elegance. Drink now through 2021.",90,Maximin Grünhäuser 2015 Feinherb Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"This is an interesting and different wine. It's much lower in alcohol than most Cabs, but completely dry, with a tobacco and sage pull to the black currant flavors. The firm tannins suggest cellar possibilities.",90,Bonneau 2005 Hyde Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Carneros),,,,
"This brut sparkler is out there on the nose, as earthy, not-too-fresh aromas of peanuts and compost set up a coarse palate. Nutty stale citrus flavors end in sour fashion, with a hint of mustard.",82,Hacienda del Carche NV Brut Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"From one of the most familiar of the Meursault Premier Crus, this wine is crisp and mineral in character. It has tight acidity with apple and green-plum fruit that is laced by a light amount of wood aging. The wine is still young and will be better from 2018.",91,Domaine Jean Monnier et Fils 2014 Charmes Premier Cru  (Meursault),,,,
"Flint, smoke and dried hayflowers lead off the aromas. The phenolic midpalate provides focus and a little heft, striking a natural, clean balance.",90,Setzer 2012 8000 Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel),,,,
"Bright and savory, this offers aromas of wild berry, lilac, baking spice and a whiff of menthol. On the palate, notes of grilled herb, coffee and aniseed accent the wild cherry core while chewy tannins offer support.",89,Villa Calcinaia 2012 Piegaia  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"This is a fine Syrah from a producer with a long history of success with the Rhône variety. It's inky and dark in color with a palate that's tannic and dry, with long, deep, spicy flavors of blackberries, grilled meat, black pepper and toasty oak. It will provide good drinking with grilled meats and stews over the next two years.",90,Joseph Phelps 2010 Syrah (Napa Valley),,,,
"Winemaker Barbara Tamburini is a rising star, and her l'Rennero Merlot is outstandingly juicy and succulent. Notes of ripe fruit such as black cherry and blueberry are backed by sweet spice and a rich, plush mouthfeel. The wine is powerful and chewy but also elegant and balanced at the same time.",92,Gualdo del Re 2004 I'Rennero Merlot (Val di Cornia Suvereto),,,,
"Tannic and chewy, this is simple, sturdy and solidly in the herbal camp. Flavors are short and the finish leans into veggies.",81,Hoodsport 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Clean, fresh and simple. Gran Feudo will neither thrill nor disappoint as it delivers adequate citrus, raspberry and rhubarb flavors propelled by choppy, stinging acids. It shows a good attack before breaking up on the finish. A can't-fail rosé for the summer and fall of 2008.",85,Bodegas Julián Chivite 2007 Gran Feudo Rosé (Navarra),,,,
"Horsey, overripe aromas don't convey a sense of balance. As the nose indicates, this comes across heavy and syrupy, with blocky tannins. Stewy flavors of blackberry and prune finish with hard tannins.",85,Ricardo Santos 2009 El Gran Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"90-92 Packed with new wood, very polished wine, its tannins smooth and velvet. It has a delicious juicy red berry fruit character that shows a fine elegance.",91,Chateau La Tour Carnet 2010 Barrel sample  (Haut-Médoc),,,,
"This is pure Chardonnay, from cool-climate sites, showing a lean, sculpted spine that both defines and expands the flavors. Exceptionally complex for Washington Chardonnay, with good natural acidity, a mix of peach, apple and pineapple fruit, and a finish that shows tight layering. There is a dense core that should unravel with bottle age; this is that rare Washington Chardonnay that will prosper with cellaring.",91,L'Ecole No. 41 2009 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A big, boisterous and concentrated wine, this has an aroma like smoke and rosemary and more rich, fruity flavors like plum and pomegranate juice.",85,Ivory and Burt 2013 Red (Lodi),,,,
"This 100% Syrah conveys espresso, raw meat, flowers, chocolate and peppery spices. It's reserved in style with tart acids.",88,Two Vintners 2012 Some Days Are Diamonds Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
This opens with unusual charred aromas and whiffs of resin. The palate retains the same burnt sensations alongside notes of roasted coffee bean and bitter walnut husk. It lacks fruit richness and ends on an astringent note that dries out the mouth.,85,Luigi Righetti 2011 Capitel de Roari  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),,,,
"This salmon-colored rosé is made from the País grape, a.k.a. the Mission Grape. On the nose, it's a cypher with weak fragrances of peach and mango. The palate is cidery and hard in feel, while briny, tart citrus flavors are pithy and fail to evolve or improve on the finish.",83,Viña Bisquertt 2013 Missing Rosé (Curicó Valley),,,,
"Grenache Blanc is an up-and-coming variety in the state. This standout example brings talc, flower, pear and citrus aromas. The medium-bodied palate is tart and lively, piquing interest.",91,Syncline 2016 Boushey Vineyard Grenache Blanc (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Pure Syrah from 14-year-old vines, this offers classic peppery aromatics, blue fruits, good concentration, and a hint of the Walla Walla funk that marks the better Syrahs of the region. It's lifted with excellent acidity and continues into a focused finish with highlights of coffee grounds.",90,L'Ecole No. 41 2011 Estate Seven Hills Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"This is a nice, lower-priced option of the variety, spicy in raspberry and strawberry, with a medium-built weight. Bulky in tannins that soften in the glass, its simplicity doesn't dete. There's a lasting note of toasted oak on the wine as it winds down.",86,Lucky Rock Wine Co. 2014 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),,,,
"If the term “mellow” were to be made into a liquid this would be it. Both nose and palate have the sonorous gentle richness of very ripe pear, with the richness of some dried pear fruit, too. This late-harvest style has sweet richness but is also utterly balanced. There is enough freshness and structure to corral the fruit into something easy, gentle, generous and warming. This is so unobtrusive, so balanced that it might disappear very quickly.",92,Domaine Mersiol 2015 Frankstein Grand Cru Vendanges Tardives Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"Rich, savory and appealing now for its smooth texture and forward flavors of cherries, raspberries, blackberries and oak. A lovely wine for grilled steaks and chops.",87,X 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"The Valdinara is a soft, seductive wine showing plenty of jammy fruit, and a pleasant smoky spice. On the finish it is a touch stemmy, but it is so slight that it adds an exotic edge to the wine. Pleasant, not very intense and easy to like.",85,Valdinera 2005  Barbera d'Alba Superiore,,,,
"A blend of Peachy Canyon Estate (67%) and Mustang Springs Ranch (33%) fruit. In this vintage the Peachy Zins seem to lack intensity, but this is a well-balanced effort that shows the best of what is there. Clean, forward fruit, with lots of blueberry and a light, toasty framework. Good wine, but pricey.",89,Peachy Canyon 1998 Estate Bottled Zinfandel (Paso Robles),,,,
"Perfumed and fragrant, this is a blend from a number of Kamptal vineyards. It's bright, with an aroma of wild flower that mingles with flavors of currant, crisp apple and mineral-like acidity. Age this for six months or drink it now.",88,Bründlmayer 2011 Kamptaler Terrassen Riesling (Kamptal),,,,
"Mainly Pinot Meunier, as befits a producer in the Marne Valley, this Champagne is soft and creamy. With its edge of acidity, baked-apple flavor and zingy texture, the wine is ready to drink.",88,Emile Leclère NV Réserve Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"This winery is one of the region's bright spots, in this case offering expertly layered touches of vanilla, caramel, cappuccino, blueberry and a touch of oregano in the blend of 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 13% Cabernet Franc, 8% Malbec and 7% Petit Verdot. Cocoa nibs, coffee, black cherry, dill, bay leaf and black olive pop on the palate, where the lingering acidity ensures aging potential.",90,Fallbrook 2012 33 Degrees North BDX Gracie Hill Vineyard Red (South Coast),,,,
"This has firm tannins, and it demonstrates the potential of its juicy fruit flavors. With its powerful structure, this is a slowly developing selection that needs at least five years in a cellar.",91,Jaffelin 2010 Sur les Grèves Clos Saint-Anne Premier Cru  (Beaune),,,,
"An unusual Syrah-based blend with large amounts of Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon, as well as smaller percentages of Merlot and Petit Verdot, this is a fun wine. Soft on the front palate in blueberry and leather, it develops density and scratchy texture on the finish. It's big yet balanced in acidity.",88,CUTT 2012 Fearless Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Candy-pink in color, this soft, fruity wine has ripe strawberry flavors that are lifted by acidity. The aftertaste, rounded and perfumed, is fresh although not crisp.",86,Comtes de Dampierre NV Cuvée des Ambassadeurs Brut Rosé  (Champagne),,,,
"Sourced from a single vineyard in the Blewitt Springs subregion, this is a plush, open-knit Mourvèdre that's ready to drink. Sage, cedar and menthol aromas give it decent complexity, while the flavors of grilled plums and barbecue smoke satisfy cravings for fruity and savory all at once. Drink now–2023.",90,Ess & See 2015 Mataro (McLaren Vale),,,,
"This opens with simple fruit tones of cherry and cassis backed by evolved aromas of spice, leather and cola. It shows impressive purity and a long, silky finish.",90,Giacosa Fratelli 2009 Vigna Basarin  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Ripe, earthy berry and cassis aromas smell damp at first but unfold nicely. Bright acidity and abrupt tannins make for a packed palate. Lightly oaky flavors of plum and berry show a note of vanilla. It finishes crisp and choppy due to the aforementioned bold acidity. Drink through 2022.",90,R+ 2012 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"Enticing complexities of bramble, rose and violet lend freshness to this ripe plummy Merlot. The palate is satisfyingly juicy, accented by crisp acidity and subtle notes of nuts and spice. A fine feathery layer of tannins cushions the finish.",89,Jamesport 2013 Estate Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"Medicinal, earthy aromas of cherry, raspberry and plum are encouraging. This blend of Malbec and Cab Franc is tight and sinewy, with good acidity. Cherry, plum and chocolate flavors rest comfortably in front of a ripe, full finish.",87,Santa Julia 2014 Reserva Mountain Blend Malbec-Cabernet Franc (Uco Valley),,,,
"A blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this is a compelling and exciting expression of territory. The Tassinaia hill produces a balanced wine with black fruit and some herbal notes backed by spice, toast and a long satisfying finish.",92,Castello del Terriccio 2004 Tassinaia Red (Toscana),,,,
"This is appropriately austere for a young Eden Valley Riesling, offering crisp green apple and lime sensations backed by subtle grace notes of wet stone. The finish is long, mouthwatering and almost painfully tart, suggesting it will fare well in the cellar for up to 10 years.",91,St Hallett 2014 Riesling (Eden Valley),,,,
"Reserved aromas of flowers, anise, plum and barrel spice lead to compact fruit and tannins with mouthwatering acids. Give it time to open up.",89,Elevation Cellars 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Roasted and rubbery, this features potent leather and compost aromas that settle with airing. Angular, aggressive and full of power and lemony oak, it also has raw wood and heavily toasted black-fruit flavors. Long, peppery and choppy, it's powerful and stomping. Best to hold this for 3–5 years before drinking, when it should emerge as a better, more approachable wine.",91,Alidis 2009 Expresión  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"Jammy raspberry aromas come with herb, oak and lactic notes. This Malbec feels chunky and pulpy, with a sticky oak-resin feel resulting in creamy grab. Flavors of red apple skins, plum, cardamom and vanilla finish sweet and slightly exotic.",86,Manos Negras 2012 Stone Soil Select Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"This opens with aromas of black-skinned berry, blue flower, French oak and a balsamic whiff of menthol. The smooth, refined palate offers dried black cherry, dark spice and chopped herb alongside supple tannins.",90,Fattoria Le Pupille 2012 Poggio Valente Riserva  (Morellino di Scansano),,,,
"Rooty berry aromas vie for attention with molasses, graphite and earth notes. This Toro is stout and creamy in feel, with bracing acidity and firm tannins. Baking spice, roasted black-fruit and molasses flavors are typically ripe, while the finish is hot, with punchy acidity. Drink through 2020.",91,Bernard Magrez 2011 Paciencia  (Toro),,,,
"Just one barrel was made from this vineyard, which suffered losses from frost and wildlife in 2010. A shame, because the wine is terrific, delicate for Syrah, with boysenberry, raspberry, piercing acidity and refined tannins. Built to age.",92,K Vintners 2010 Phil Lane Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"The extra depth typical of Pouilly Fumé is here. It makes for a full-bodied and dense wine ripe with red apple, lemon and a tangy, orange-zest aftertaste. The wine is still developing and needs time. Drink from 2017.",89,Fournier Père et Fils 2014 Les Deux Cailloux  (Pouilly-Fumé),,,,
"The Sullivan designate mixes Pommard, Wädenswil and Dijon 777 clones, which were aged 10 months in 30% new French oak. It's similar to the winery's Dardis bottling in terms of the balance between fruit and herbs, though here there is a bit of a hole in the midpalate. Otherwise, it's a friendly mix of black cherry, cola and chocolate: forward and open.",89,Fairsing 2014 Sullivan Pinot Noir,,,,
"Made with Montepulciano grapes, this has fruity aromas of crushed berry and citrus. Reflecting the nose, the light easygoing palate offers suggestions of sour cherry and tangerine zest alongside bright acidity.",85,Cantina Ariano 2016 Sogno di Volpe Rosato (Puglia),,,,
"It's rare to see varietal Carmenère outside of Chile, let alone in Long Island, and such a great surprise when it's as tasty as this. It's lusciously fruity yet pristinely fresh, boasting crisp black-plum and cherry flavors that penetrate deeply on the palate. A herbaceous swathe of green leaf and bramble only accentuates the freshness. Fine firm tannins need a few years to meld. Hold until 2020.",92,Osprey's Dominion 2013 Carmenère (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"A fragrant wine, it offers truffle and red fruit aromas. The palate is ripe although it does have intense acidity, more bright red fruits than firmer structure. It feels almost ready to drink, fruity and fresh.",88,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2011 Les Vaucrains Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),,,,
"Its citrus and melon aromas unfortunately also take on the added and unwanted scent of cleaning solution. The mouth is tart and lean, with lots of lemon. It finishes on the sour side. Properly chilled and with the right food, however, it could be refreshing.",83,Sauvion 2001  Sancerre,,,,
"La Poderina is a beautiful, well-managed estate that playfully straddles both a traditional and modern approach to Brunello. Thick black fruit aromas and tangy spice give the wine a soft and opulent first impression. But the firm tannins and bright acidity remind you of its deep Tuscan roots.",93,La Poderina 2008  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Bold juicy blackberry and cherry combine for an elegant expression of the variety in this soft, finessed wine, laced in classic notes of cedar. The wine finishes in a complex burst of black licorice and is a good choice for the table.",90,Napa Cellars 2012 Classic Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"This Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon blend, in roughly equal proportions, is soft and sweet in black currants, dark chocolate, beef jerky and new oak flavors, wrapped into strong but pliable tannins. Drink now.",87,Kuleto Estate 2010 India Ink Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"This Bordeaux blend is a little rough around the edges. It has a sharp, jammy feeling, and seems too sweet in raspberry- and cherry-pie filling. Will appeal to fans of an easy drinking, accessible style of a Cabernet-based wine.",85,Coquelicot 2007 Mon Amour Red (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"This is mild and lightly citric smelling, with an ocean spray note on the bouquet. On the palate, it is fresh and deep, with a note of nectarine. The finish is solid, but loses some fruit and gains some bitterness.",85,Echeverria 2012 Classic Collection Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley),,,,
"This attractive, light-colored rosé is dry, but its richness, crushed strawberry flavor and textured acidity neatly combine to produce a crisp, yet full, wine. Ready to drink.",87,Montaudon NV Grand Brut Rosé  (Champagne),,,,
"Fragrant with peach aromas and wet-stone minerality, this dry Riesling is well integrated, smooth and refreshing. It is delicious on its own as an apéritif or will make a mellow partner to all manner of appetizers, especially those with seafood and a twist of heat or chili spice.",90,Clif Family 2011 Riesling (Mendocino),,,,
"Deep but not showy aromas of velvety lilacs, concentrated blackberry and river rocks pop on the nose of this blend of 42% Syrah, 37% Grenache, 14% Mourvèdre and 7% Counoise. Rounded purple-fruit flavors mesh with a silky, earthy texture on the palate, with olallieberry, caramel and a slow rising acidity.",90,Grey Wolf Cellars 2013 Soulmate Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"This old-school winery sticks to tradition, so if this new-release Merlot seems older than it is, that's by intention. The color is light, and the wine already carries fading edges. The nose is earthy and the flavors are spicy.",84,Cousiño-Macul 2001 Merlot (Maipo Valley),,,,
"Bésoleil remains Grenache-dominated, but this new vintage includes 14% Syrah, 10% Mourvèdre, and (for the first time) 9% Cinsault. Bright and penetrating, the brilliant raspberry fruit is the star here, tart and fresh, with the juiciness of a young Zinfandel.",91,Betz Family 2009 Bésoleil Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
This otherwise fruity wine has a rustic edge. It gives an unattractive herbal character that may come from underripe grapes.,81,Château Haut Mouleyre 2015 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),,,,
"A beautiful Pinot Noir, crisp and silky, for drinking now. It emphasizes ripe cherry, raspberry, cola and dusty exotic spice flavors that finish dry and fascinating.",90,Jigar 2009 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This strongly-oaked wine has apple, lemon and toast aromas that open to a similar palate displaying pear elements and a buttery feel. Full on the nose and palate, this wine, 100% barrel fermented in French oak, finishes long with spicy notes.",88,Jacob's Creek 1999 Reserve Chardonnay (Barossa Valley),,,,
"Dry, tannic and ripe, with flavors of black currant, raisin and a coating of spicy oak. The tannins are rich and thick and high alcohol gives this wine a slight burn, but richly sauced barbecue flavors balance that out.",86,Moonstone 2009 Westside Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"Fermented using 75% whole clusters, this hails from Block 2 of the up-and-coming vineyard. It's aromatically expressive, with black olive, grilled asparagus, garden herb and moist earth notes. The palate shows exquisite restraint and savory flavors, bringing more acidity than the region is known for.",92,W.T. Vintners 2014 Stoney Vine Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Grapefruit, passion fruit, cactus pad and stony aromas make for a textbook Verdejo bouquet. The palate on this fresh, crisp white is compact and clean. Flavors of nectarine and lime finish a touch salty yet refreshing.",89,Bodegas Garci Grande 2013 Señorio de Garci Grande Verdejo (Rueda),,,,
"This is light—the Ten in the name refers to its alcohol level—dry, crisp and fragrantly fresh. It is citrus dominant and deliciously refreshing—a wine that livens up the palate.",87,Casal Paço Padreiro 2011 Aphros Ten Loureiro (Vinho Verde),,,,
"On the lighter side of the Côtes du Rhône spectrum, with a slightly briary note to the cherry fruit. Turns more olivaceous on the silky-textured finish. Drink now.",85,Michel Picard 2007 Red (Côtes du Rhône),,,,
"A sweet, rather heavy wine. Cabernets hardly get riper than this, with its massive, jammy cherry, raspberry and blackberry fruit. Delicious, but one-dimensional. Drink now.",86,Mauritson 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),,,,
"Grown in the mineral rich red soils of Istria, it has enticing aromas of fresh black raspberry, black cherry and black plum. Rich and full-bodied in the mouth, flavors recall fresh plums and ripe cranberries.",89,Coronica 2008 Gran Teran (Istria),,,,
"This has the crunchy, enticing freshness of the very first, pale, almost translucent apples of the year. Underneath it brings earth, chalk, stone and yeast. The autolysis is distinct but expresses itself as a restrained, chalky background that imbues the entire wine with a soft, gentle and very fine creaminess. This is elegant, serious and lasting.",94,Bolney Wine Estate 2009 Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (England),,,,
"Smoky, meaty aromas meet concentrated, fully developed blackberry and cassis flavors in this full-bodied nicely oaky wine. It has a lot of spice and swagger for the price, along with polished tannins, a hint of sweetness and a good mouth-filling texture.",90,Layer Cake 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),,,,
"Tropically fruity and plump, with some banana and custard aromas and flavors--also some tapioca and vanilla. Finishes with a refreshing citrus edge.",84,Anselmi 2001 San Vincenzo White (Veneto),,,,
"This wine is blend of 54% Touriga Nacional, 23% Souzao, 12% Tinta Roriz and 11% Tinta Cão—all relatively new varieties to Washington. It displays light aromas of dark chocolate, clove and spice. The sweet flavors are more restrained than the wine's name might suggest, bringing a pleasing sense of balance that carries through the chocolaty finish.",89,Brian Carter Cellars 2012 Opulento Red (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Delicate scents of white flower and apricot lead the nose. The bright, round palate doles out ripe peach, pear and a hint of hazelnut that lead to a fresh finish.",88,San Silvestro 2015 Parvo  (Roero),,,,
"Rich, solid, with ripe spice and black plum flavors. The considerable richness is balanced with dark tannins, which give a sense of fine-grained texture to this solid wine.",89,Château Lamothe-Vincent 2006 Héritage  (Bordeaux Supérieur),,,,
"This is a polished and intense wine with super thick concentration, a black inky appearance, and almost too much black fruit, mineral and spice. It is the Great Wall of Southern Italian wines with impenetrable density, sweet flavors and a chewy, solid-state texture.",87,Vinosia 2004  Taurasi,,,,
"From a single, high-elevation block of the Alden-Ellis Vineyard, this is somewhat muted aromatically, preferring to present itself in waves of oak and cigar box. Big tannins and weight surround a soft, approachable palate that's ready to enjoy now.",86,Murphy-Goode 2012 Single Deck Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"This is a dark, almost thick, velvet-textured wine with plenty of tannin and flavors of blackberry and black pepper. While mouthcoating in texture, its not overly full in body, and will pair well with cheesy pastas and rich meat braises.",90,Terra d'Oro 2015 Teroldego (Amador County),,,,
"Not your usual SB, this full-bodied version combines herbal, savory aromas and mineral flavors with a fairly rich texture and lingering finish. It's complex and satisfying, and will pair well with rich seafood.",87,Bogle 2013 Bogle Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc (California),,,,
"This is a rounded, rich and soft wine with a creamy texture and ripe pear and lime flavors contrasting with lively acidity. It has a smooth character, but with a bite of spice, lemon zest and minerality. Drink now. Screwcap.",88,Markus Huber 2012 Terrassen Grüner Veltliner (Traisental),,,,
"Here is a fresh and youthful expression of Friulano with pretty aromas of yellow rose, almond blossom and peach. The main characteristic of this variety is excellent texture in the mouth and this wine lives up to that promise.",87,Plozner 2007 Friulano (Friuli Grave),,,,
"Tangy with a strong mineral streak, this wine is crisply fruity and still young. It has green fruits, a ripe character that comes from the warm vintage. There is also plenty of bright acidity to give the wine a tight, nervy aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",87,Quinta do Sagrado 2015 Sagrado Branco White (Douro),,,,
"Marked by strong acidity and minerality, this is an austere Chardonnay for drinking now. With a citrus flavor and a dry, honeyed richness, this sits on the elegant side of the Chardonnay spectrum.",89,Bryter 2010 Affiné Split Rock Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Italy's first cru Verdicchio, Le Moie offers loads of citrus-and lime-like nuances on the heels of stone fruit, field flowers and fruit candy. Sweet fruit notes create a lively, tangy impression. A tiny percentage is aged in wood.",87,Fazi Battaglia 2005 Le Moie  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore),,,,
An initial hint of tropical fruit quickly blows off to reveal notions of fresh pear peel and a pleasantly bitter texture that suggests more pear peel with citrus zest and pith. Underneath is all is a reservoir of pepper and lemony freshness.,89,R&A; Pfaffl 2014 Goldjoch Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel),,,,
"This bottling utilizes fruit from the winery's original 1975 plantings. Aromas of jasmine, flowers and lime lead to off dry, lightly spritzy stone-fruit flavors that linger.",87,Kiona 2014 Estate Bottled Riesling (Red Mountain),,,,
"A light, easy-drinking blend of Grenache Blanc (56%), Clairette (37%) and Roussanne (7%), the Terre d'Ocres displays an array of fresh stone fruit, citrus and a bit of white pepper. Drink now.",85,Domaine de Tara 2010 Terres d'Ocres White (Ventoux),,,,
"Fresh and fruity with creamy green and white fruits, this is a soft, ready to drink Chardonnay. Attractively fruity, the acidity finely cuts through the wine.",85,L. Tramier & Fils 2011 Bourricot Chardonnay (Vin de France),,,,
"Ripe and maybe a touch overdone and weighty on the nose. The palate is plump and melony feeling, with sweet pear and vanilla flavors. Creamy, easy and long on what amounts to an oaky finish.",87,Terrazas de Los Andes 2010 Reserva Chardonnay (Mendoza),,,,
"Coteaux Varois is a small region that gives lively, gentle wine such as this delicious rosé. It's pink in color, ripe, touched by caramel and with a rounded, soft aftertaste.",87,Château Routas 2014 Rosé (Coteaux Varois en Provence),,,,
"The Grenache (20%) blended in shows itself with its aromas of raspberry and spice complementing Syrah's blue fruit. The flavors are full bodied and lush, pulling no punches but staying in balance.",90,L'Ecole No. 41 2013 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Firm and very structured, it has depth plus some spice from wood aging, along with a dry core that still dominates the fragrant red berry fruits. Don't drink before 2018.",94,Château Calon 2011  Saint-Émilion,,,,
"Simple, broad and slightly oily at first, this has generous melon and apricot aromas. There is enough natural acidity to brighten the palate.",85,Paladin 2010 Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie),,,,
"Slightly funky and leesy on the nose, with somewhat sweaty overtones to the citrus and apple aromas. But the flavors are pure, suggesting that the aromatics just need some time to come around—or a quick decanting. It's medium in body, with a crisp, tangy finish that artfully balances sweet and tart.",88,Willi Haag 2007 Brauneberger Juffer Kabinett Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer),,,,
"Aromas of apple and hay are slightly oily but nice. Bright acidity renders this fresh and not too chunky, while flavors of dry oak, melon and salted apple finish steady, with a hint of lemon. If you are interested in barrel-fermented Verdejo, this is a good place to start.",90,Emina 2015 Fermentado en Barrica Verdejo (Rueda),,,,
"This is for people who want the basic Pinot experience at an everyday price. It's silky in texture but brightened with tart acidity and jammy raspberry, cola and sandalwood flavors.",83,Red Rock 2012 Reserve Pinot Noir (California),,,,
"This blend of the three estate vineyards opens with lightly musky aromas and pinpoint herbal highlights. The fruit rolls from cranberry to strawberry to cherry, and the wine has a slightly woody character. Tannins are proportionate, still a bit stiff, and showing leafy notes. A light suggestion of chocolate infuses the finish.",91,Trisaetum 2013 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This fragrant Gewürztraminer from one of the best producers in northern Italy offers aromas of jasmine and honeysuckle, with background tones of apricot and candied exotic fruit. It's creamy and rich on the finish.",90,Colterenzio 2010 Atisis Cornell Gewürztraminer (Alto Adige),,,,
"Continuing a long-running streak of excellence, the latest vintage of Eroica blends fruit from vineyards in the Lake Chelan, Yakima Valley, Royal Slope and Horse Heaven Hills regions. It's a rich mix of peach and papaya, creamy and slightly sweet (16.6 g/L). The citrusy acids keep a fine edge on the lush flavors.",92,Chateau Ste. Michelle & Dr. Loosen 2012 Eroica Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Peppery and bright in acidity, this blend of half Grenache and lesser percentages of Mourvèdre, Syrah and Counoise is a bit mixed. On the one hand it offers red raspberry and pomegranate and perfumed aromatics; on the other hand, the earthiness detracts.",86,David Girard 2010 Coda Rouge Red (El Dorado),,,,
"Stalky underbrush, celery, eucalyptus and oak-driven spice aromas lead the nose. The bracing palate offers raw cherry, licorice, coconut, toast and espresso alongside a backbone of assertive, drying tannins that clench the finish. Let the tannins soften for a few years then drink to capture the remaining fruit.",87,Parusso 2012 Bussia  (Barolo),,,,
"Packaged in a towering bottle with an easy-to-spot red label, this opens with aromas of ripe dark berry, savory herb, leather and tobacco. The palate delivers ripe black cherries, raspberries, licorice and grilled rosemary alongside firm, polished tannins. Enjoy through 2018.",90,Plozza 2009 Rededition Sassella  (Valtellina Superiore),,,,
"Ripe, forward scents of plums and apricots. This is concentrated but not syrupy, fleshy and ripe but not cloying or too sweet. Delicious sipping wine.",88,Willow Crest 2001 Black Muscat (Yakima Valley),,,,
"The wine is pretty basic, with buttered toast, vanilla bean, brown sugar and juicy pineapple and orange flavors.",84,Wolfgang Puck 2012 Master Lot Reserve Chardonnay (California),,,,
"This has a touch of toast and a rich character. A creamed pear note mingles with lime-driven acidity and a delicious, warm tropical-fruit aftertaste.",91,Charles Ellner 2002 Séduction Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"Gritty, stalky aromas override the wine's plum and berry scents. This feels acidic and rough, with abrasive tannins. Thus the flavors are tight, juicy and narrow, with an emphasis on red fruits. Minerality and acidity drive the finish.",85,Genium Celler 2007 Red (Priorat),,,,
"Opaque in color, this saturated Malbec-led blend exhibits coconut and cola aromas along with fully ripe blackberry notes. This is massive in the mouth, with a solid foundation. Maximum berry expression and a jammy, deep-fruited finish give this power and content beyond its price point.",91,Cueva de las Manos 2011 Reserve Red (Mendoza),,,,
"Sweet cherry cola, root beer, leather, dried tobacco and toasted oak emerge from the nose of this blend of Cab Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot. The wine has a powerful center and refreshing crispness on the lengthy finish.",92,Renieri 2004 Re di Renieri Red (Toscana),,,,
"A liquid lullaby more than a wine, this Brunello caresses and smoothes over your senses with amazing intensity and harmonious aromas of cherry-chocolate fudge, almond paste, ginger, balsamic notes, blueberry pie, firewood and vanilla. There's a shroud of cedar and cherry fruit within the wine's unwavering structure and a seemingly endless finish.",95,Poggio Nardone 2001 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"There's a lot of oak on this value-priced Chard, to the point that any fruit aromas are blanketed. In the mouth, there's ample acidity affording good cut, while flavors of pear and apple are spiced up by aforementioned forceful oak. Fortunately a resiny tasting finish isn't too heavy",85,Santa Alicia 2013 Reserva Espiritu de Los Andes Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Maipo Valley),,,,
"Delicate sprays of cherry blossom and raspberry waft from nose to finish on this salmon-pink blend of traditional Champagne grape varieties. Zesty lemonade acidity is lively on the palate, leading to a long, softly foamed finish.",90,Sparkling Pointe 2011 Topaz Impérial Rosé  (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"This amounts to a flabby, basic SB from a hot vintage. The nose is dull and lacks spunk. The palate is soft and fleshy, with bitter-leaning, bland flavors of melon, mild citrus and white pepper.",83,Soleca 2012 3 Generaciones Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley),,,,
"Fragrant and floral, this mix of 85% Chenin Blanc and 15% Viognier is soft and light, in alcohol (12.5%) and texture. With flavors of white peach and a subtle tropical streak, with good minerality, it's a nice sipping wine or a good find with Asian food.",87,Clarksburg Wine Company 2011 Chenin Blanc-Viognier (Clarksburg),,,,
"Beautifully aromatic, this kabinett abounds with luscious peach and honeysuckle perfumes. On the palate, the flavors veer toward peach marmalade. It packs a punch, but stays brisk and delicate in texture, making it refreshingly easy to savor.",89,C.H. Berres 2011 Ürziger Würzgarten Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Of all the Angosto 2011s, El Jefe del Tribu is the most smoky and roasted of the group. Savory aromas of beef jerky and baked blackberry filter onto a ripe, slightly flat palate. Flavors of baked black fruits are gritty and mildly stalky, while the finish tastes of cooked berry fruits and generic blackness.",89,Angosto 2011 El Jefe de la Tribu Red (Valencia),,,,
"A gorgeously salmon-colored rosé made predominantly from Grenache (62%) co-fermented dry with Viognier (58%) out of Yolo County. The wine has a delicately pretty nose of peach and a light-medium body despite its 14.8% alcohol, though the finish falls off fast.",86,Midsummer Cellars 2010 Button and Turkovich Vineyard Rosé (Yolo County),,,,
"Black plum, savory peppercorns and smoke make for a very acceptable nose on this widely available twist-top bottling. The flavors are very juicy and the mouthfeel quite creamy, with slightly sweet flavors of ripe black fruit sure to please the masses.",87,Esser 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Monterey County),,,,
"Here's an easy-drinking Soave Classico that opens with fresh fruit, citrus and a dusty touch of mineral at the back. Crisp and bright, it would pair with light summer meals.",86,Coffele 2011  Soave Classico,,,,
"In this crisp, fresh, very dry rosé Champagne, the red fruits are laced with acidity and apple. A touch of bitterness suggests the wine needs to age a few months in bottle, to soften and get a more generous feel.",87,Tendil & Lombardi NV Cuvée Rosé Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"This is already mature. It has weight and demonstrates a delicious balance between a ripe white-fruit flavor and fresh acidity, with a fine note of tangy citrus. Ready to drink.",88,Willm 2009 Kirchberg de Barr Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"This Paulliac-style blend of mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot presents bright red fruit on the nose alongside black licorice and traditional cigar box scents. The flavors are dominated by red cherries with a touch of anise, sprig of thyme and pleasingly brisk finish.",91,J. Lohr 2010 Cuvée PAU Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"There’s a distinct and unmistakable scent of rotten eggs in this wine, which usually indicates excessive amounts of sulfur were used during bottling. Apart from that we have a rough and tumble, rustic style with big fruit and a yeasty, chewy finish.",85,Montaudon NV Chardonnay Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"This modest Pinot offers light strawberry fruit, a dash of cola, and a component of earth and stem that overtakes the finish. It hints at green tannins, with a bit of brown sugar sweetness, perhaps from aging in 30% new oak.",85,Silvan Ridge 2009 Lazy River Vineyard Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This is an excellent young Cabernet Sauvignon that will take some bottle age. Coming on the heels of the high-scoring 2004, it's full-bodied and extraordinarily rich, with intense blackberry, black currant, chocolate, coffee and cedar flavors, wrapped into near-perfect tannins. Shows great grapes and a deft winemaking hand.",93,Brandlin 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),,,,
"Weighty in cinnamon, this wine is soft and entirely spicy throughout, medium in weight and slightly complex. Blackberry and black cherry play off the firm tannins and structured oak, providing girth but not overindulgence.",90,Sparrow Hawk 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"This is leathery and earthy up front, with cherry and berry aromas that come with a flower accent. It feels snappy, alert and slightly citrusy, with raspberry, red plum and vanilla flavors. It's relatively short and choppy on the finish, but it's fresh, with the proper amount of oak.",89,Ramón Bilbao 2008 Limited Edition Crianza  (Rioja),,,,
"The winery's top-end Bordeaux red, this blends 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Cabernet Franc, 19% Petit Verdot and 15% Malbec. The fruit is sourced from the family's estate vineyard on the eastern slopes of the Napa Valley, then aged 20 months in French oak, 90% of it new. Black in color, it tastes of cedar and smoke, with soft layers of subtle plum and cassis before a grippy finish. Enjoy through 2021.",91,Merryvale 2011 Profile Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Buttery, caramelized oak tones dominate the weak fruit flavors of orange and apricot. A simple and creamy Chardonnay.",82,Red Pony Ranch 2011 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Made from old vines and aged in small barrels, this wine is dominated by oak. Opening aromas include wood, toast and a hint of butter and apples. Oak extract takes center stage on the palate which also reveals citrus peel and a hint of apricot and mineral, as well as firm acidity. It lacks fruit richness.",86,Fraccaroli 2009 Vegnie Vecie  (Lugana),,,,
"This wine's shy nose barely hints at black cherry and plum. The palate is taut and framed by smooth, finely woven tannins that still hold its juicy red fruit tight. A pleasant, fresh, aromatic grip lingers.",90,Gernot and Heike Heinrich 2015 Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),,,,
"Aromas of barrel toast, kiwi and pineapple lead to a sweet, slightly lean, tropical-fruit-filled palate that delivers a lot of easy-drinking pleasure.",88,Maryhill 2015 Proprietor's Reserve Tudor Hills Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A fruit bomb of a Cabernet that has a lot of the things we love about Zinfandel. It has a deep, saturated color, jammy aromas, very ripe cherry flavors laced with maple syrup and a seemingly sweet finish. Juicy and delicious on its own or with casual meals.",86,Ironstone 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),,,,
"Made in a leaner style, with modest in alcohol, this swaps power for elegance. It's streamlined, brisk and bone dry, with complex flavors of sour cherry candy, cola, dusty spice and sandalwood. With decanting this can be enjoyed now, but try cellaring it for 5–6 years and see how it evolves in the bottle.",91,Sandhi 2010 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"This ripe, easygoing red offers fruity yet fleeting aromas and flavors of fleshy black cherry and baked plum. It's made to be drunk young so enjoy now.",85,Fattoria Petriolo 2012  Chianti,,,,
The wine is fruity and also textured. The acidity and dry tannin and wood flavors reveal a wine that will need to develop. It has weight and potential richness that will come out over the next couple of years. Drink this wine from 2018.,87,Château du Bois Chantant 2014 Cuvée Laurence H.  (Bordeaux Supérieur),,,,
"Saucy, scratchy aromas suggest road tar and compost. This wine is wide in feel, with peppery, spicy raspberry and plum flavors. A minty, herbal tasting finish is neither overbearing nor oaky.",87,Finca La Luz 2012 Callejon del Crimen Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Uco Valley),,,,
"Aromas of children's vitamins, corn stalk and white peach set up a lemony stony zesty palate with lemon and nectarine flavors. A stony crisp cleansing finish does the job while not faltering.",89,Zudugarai 2014 Hondarrabi Zuri (Getariako Txakolina),,,,
"This Tempranillo's oaky berry aromas are solid but standard. It shows moderate buttery oak and plum flavors, tasting mostly of creamy oak on a finish propped up by acidity.",87,Manuel Manzaneque Suárez 2014 Ea! Tempranillo (La Mancha),,,,
"This powerful blend of 23% Malbec, 20% Carmenere, 20% Cabernet Franc, 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Merlot and 7% Petite Verdot delivers layered aromas of olallieberry, grape candy, sage, anise and lava rocks. Purple fruits dominate the palate, with complexity provided by creosote and violets, along with ample tannins and acidity.",92,Dubost 2010 Reconciliation Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"A new wine from a new winery. It's actually from a warm easterly section of Napa, Pope Valley, that seems to coax honeydew and watermelon flavors from the grapes. The wine, which is very dry, has been given the royal treatment, with barrel fermentation and extended lees aging, so there's that lovely creamy mouthfeel; malolactic fermentation softens it even more. Pretty lush stuff from a winery to watch.",88,Eagle & Rose Estate 1998 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"A really good wine for the price, this offers a dark color and varietal aromas of black cherry, black olive and faint dried herbs. Next it layers handsome oak on the rich and fruity flavors. The texture is quite dense without being heavy; while somewhat tannic the mouthfeel is not drying.",88,Dark Horse 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),,,,
"A closed, tight and grippy wine, this has a big tannic structure that supports a landscape of cassis, cranberry and ripe plum, along with clove and tobacco. Fuller-bodied in style, it finishes smooth and lean.",84,Katherine Goldschmidt 2013 Crazy Creek Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Voluptuously rich and concentrated, this full-bodied wine is spectacular in leather, tobacco and a whiff of grilled game. While dense, and age-worthy, now through 2022, it remains balanced and vibrant on the palate and would make a wonderful companion to hearty foods.",94,Darioush 2012 Shiraz (Napa Valley),,,,
"The majority of this wine was stainless-steel fermented, with just 20% given time in new French oak. Together it makes for a taste of apple with a twist of caramel, a fresh, medium-bodied style with vibrant, lengthy acidity and an edginess of bread and honey.",88,Bench 2014 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Green elements are often frowned upon in New World Bordeaux, but this wine shows why that's flawed thinking. Black pepper and sour cherry accompany vibrant jalapeño on the nose. That vivid herbaceous character extends to the palate, making for an intriguing, eye-opening drink. Why not pair with chile relleno?",90,Alma Sol 2011 Meritage Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Paso Robles),,,,
"This dark Rosso opens with aromas of dark fruit and bramble, with subtle background hints of wild mushroom and cured meat. Endnotes of crushed black pepper and crushed clove bring up the rear.",86,Tenuta Carlina 2010 La Togata  (Rosso di Montalcino),,,,
"Broad and sinuous in feel, it sports notes of wool, white apricot and papaya. Bright acidity gives the finish some spark.",86,Jefferson Vineyards 2012 Viognier (Virginia),,,,
"Aromas of sea shell, green melon and papaya are a touch briny. This feels good but simple, with no detectable oak. A flavor profile that leans towards generic citrus and apple offers nothing new or different on the finish.",86,Cono Sur 2016 Organic Chardonnay (San Antonio),,,,
"This has a traditional medium-garnet color with brick rim. Effusive aromas that are smoky, beefy and earthy lead to distinctive wild berry, sage and cherry flavors. The texture is smooth but nicely supported by acid and tannins, and all the complexity of this wine lingers on the finish.",92,Bailiwick 2012 Borderline Pinot Noir (Marin County),,,,
"Dark burgundy in color, it has an old-world soul, earthy and brooding in clove, mushroomy forest floor and a light texture of cherry, not what you'd expect from a big-time NASCAR guy. Restrained yet powerful.",90,Jeff Gordon 2011 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"An off-dry, leesy, delicately floral Riesling, this elegantly captures the floral and mineral qualities that make the grape so exceptional. The wine doesn't push too hard, but it persists, mixing white peach and papaya with citrus blossom, rosewater and body powder. Exotic and delightful.",90,Milbrandt 2006 Traditions Riesling (Washington),,,,
"The nose of this lively white is a combination of delicate aromas of wildflower and orchard fruit while the bright palate offers tart Granny Smith apple, tangerine and a hint of crushed stone. Vibrant acidity carries through to the crisp finish.",87,Nals Margreid 2014 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),,,,
"A sophisticated Chardonnay from a winery known for good values. Buttery in aroma, it has a rich texture without being full-bodied, and is appetizingly dry and subtle in fruit flavor. Notes of toasted almond and baking spices come out on the palate and linger on the finish.",90,Guenoc 2012 Chardonnay (Lake County),,,,
"This new winery knocks it out of the park with a terrific Tempranillo that includes smaller amounts of Cabernet and Merlot. The black cherry fruit is accented with rose water and cut tobacco, and the characteristic acidity of Tempranillo lends the flavors a further boost.",91,Flying Dreams 2009 Tempranillo (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This is an eccentric Pinot Noir that's dry, strong and tart in acidity, with moderate alcohol and shows an interesting petrol, resinous note. The silky frames sour cherry candy, spice and sandalwood flavors. Drink now.",86,Gauthier 2011 Richmond Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),,,,
"Clean floral, river stone and Asian pear aromas make for an inviting nose on this wine. There is moderate tension on the palate, where rounded Gala apple flavors meet with honeysuckle, jasmine and grapefruit pith.",87,SeaGlass 2015 Pinot Grigio (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"A firm, dark and concentrated wine that boasts big tannins, dark fruit and a seriously dry element. Powerful and extracted, it needs time to soften and show its more fruity side.",86,Château la Grande Maye 2010  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,,,,
"This is a perfectly formed rosé, from its pale-pink color to its crisp acidity and light tannins. It is balanced and delicious to drink now.",86,Estandon 2014 Terres de Saint-Louis Rosé (Coteaux Varois en Provence),,,,
"Sleek, citric freshness is coupled with a more generous, diffuse nature. The picture that results is focused and rich, with glints of ripe Bosc pear, honeycomb and earth, all shot through with exciting and zesty lemon rind. The finish is exquisitely clean.",94,Malat 2013 Silberbichl Reserve Riesling (Kremstal),,,,
"Scents of plum and cassis lead into a tart wine with acidic, tannic, black cherry fruit flavors. The acids are quite chalky, and the tannins chewy and slightly green.",83,Agate Ridge 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rogue Valley),,,,
"Aromas of pencil lead and lemony oak vie with jammy, raisiny scents. This is a live-wire wine with energy flowing across a jumpy palate. Ripe cassis and blackberry flavors show a licorice note, while the finish is concentrated at first before breaking up and showing some heat. Drink through 2018.",91,Raffy 2010 Grande Réserve Malbec (Tupungato),,,,
"Tight and structured, this mineral, nervy wine tastes of stony vineyards and tenacious grapes. It is cool in character, with lemon and green stone-fruit flavors that leave a crisp impression. Drink from 2017.",88,Vignerons des Terres Secrètes 2013  Saint-Véran,,,,
"Aromas of toasted oak, mint, vanilla and dried berry lead the nose and continue to the palate along with coffee and anise notes. It's rather austere and lacks fruit richness.",87,Nicosia 2011 Rosso  (Etna),,,,
This is a ripe wine that is all fruit. Red berries and crisp acidity come together in a texture that is gently tannic and very ready to drink now.,87,J. Portugal Ramos 2014 Ramos Reserva Red (Alentejano),,,,
"This is a ripe, chewy wine, with jammy aromas of blackberry pie and cherry preserve. It shows a dark, inky structure, with loads of moist pipe tobacco and crème de cassis on the thick, syrupy finish.",87,Teanum 2008 Òtre Aglianico (Puglia),,,,
"Oak, toast and scorched soil aromas lead the nose along with a whiff of dry underbrush. The assertive, robust palate shows dried cherry, licorice and the heat of evident alcohol alongside bracing tannins that leave an astringent finish. While the tannins need time, this lacks the fruit richness to stand up to lengthy aging.",86,La Velona 2010 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"This fresh Amarone offers an inviting fragrance of perfumed berry and exotic spice. Notes of graphite, black pepper and clove give depth to the ripe plum and blackberry flavors. It's balanced with firm, chewy tannins. Drink through 2019.",90,Le Salette 2011  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,,,,
"Stays true to its house style, with intensely grassy, herbal flavors of mint, citrus and hay. Extremely dry with bright acidity, it's a zesty clean wine, very refreshing and invigorating, and a good value. Best Buy.—S.H.",86,Canyon Road 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (California),,,,
A soft and fruity wine that brings out attractive red berries and ripe plum flavors. There is the lightest touch of structure in a wine that is totally ready to drink.,85,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2014 Les Enfants Terribles Pinot Noir (Pays d'Oc),,,,
"A firm and tannic wine, with a hard-edge feel to it. The structure is dry and tough, leaving little room for the fruit, even in the future.",83,Château Saint-Urbain 2010  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,,,,
"The Mother Vine Cabernet is drinking soft and easy now, with gentle tannins framing slightly herbaceous blackberry and black cherry flavors, touched with smoky oak. It feels like a wine you want to age, although the softness suggests it won't for long.",87,Concannon 2007 Mother Vine Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),,,,
"Made entirely with Chardonnay, this pretty sparkler opens with aromas of white flower, peach and citrus backed up by a whiff of bread crust. The vibrant palate delivers Bartlett pear, mature apple, lemon zest and toasted almond alongside a soft perlage.",89,Lo Sparviere 2007 Extra Brut Chardonnay (Franciacorta),,,,
"A blend of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah and Carignane, this wine is dry and rigid in tannins. It's briary and brambly with berry flavors accented with tobacco, currant and spice. There's a raw power to this wine that would suit barbecue or a hearty beef stew.",88,Ridge 2011 Lytton Springs Red (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Aromas that recall raisin, tilled soil and baking spices carry over to the palate together with prune and black pepper. It's rather forward with evolved, fleeting tannins. Drink over the next few years.",87,La Pieve 2009  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"This Riesling is light, delicate and perfumed, revealing the minerality of the vineyard and the wine's aging potential. Keep for 5–10 years. Screwcap.",93,Hirsch 2009 Zöbinger Heiligenstein Erste Lage Riesling (Kamptal),,,,
"The buttered popcorn and woodspice aromas are vibrant. The palate is all about texture and feel, with the spice and stone fruit flavors seeming an accent. The finish lingers. For those looking for a bold, buttery style, look no further.",88,Gordon Estate 2014 Estate Grown Reserve Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Soft, jammy dried plum and berry flavors fill this juicy, slightly tutti–frutti red. A semidry blend of three French-American hybrid grapes, Chambourcin, Marechal Foch and Vincent, it's easy drinking with just a whisper of tannins marking the finish.",85,Thousand Islands Winery NV Saint Lawrence Red (New York),,,,
"Soft, honeyed and oaky, in the California style. But at this price, it offers the Chardonnay lover plenty of fruity richness and creaminess. Easy to find, with 25,000 cases produced.",86,Round Hill 2011 Chardonnay (California),,,,
"Hailing from 70-year-old vines in Cannubi, the most storied vineyard in Barolo, this stunning wine is intensely perfumed with rose petal, violet, sage and eucalyptus notes. The juicy palate delivers creamy black cherry, herb and mineral notes. It's beautifully balanced and has great depth, wonderful energy and ample complexity.",96,Paolo Scavino 2009 Cannubi  (Barolo),,,,
"Delicately light yet showing a fascinating amount of character on both the nose and palate, this bottling by winemaker Nathan Kandler offers aromas of lightly pressed cherries, purple sage, juniper, eucalyptus oil and a hint of mushrooms. The sip sings with cola, raspberries, pencil lead, morel mushrooms and forest-floor flavorings.",95,Thomas Fogarty 2012 Razorback Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"Very ripe and sumptuous notes of blueberry pie make for an appetizing proposition. This blueberry fruit plays the major role on this medium-bodied but fresh, easy-drinking red. It is full of joy and provides a dense, balance palate of ripeness and ease.",88,Gunter Triebaumer 2015 Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),,,,
"Aromas of ripe dark berry, exotic spice, tobacco and an anise note lead the nose on this intense wine. The succulent palate delivers layers of blackberry, raspberry, clove, licorice and allspice.

"This pure Cabernet Franc was barrel-aged for 21 months in 30% new French oak. That barrel toast stands out, along with flavors of tart berries, hints of green fruit and earthy tannins. Aeration is a good idea for this young wine.",87,Ledger David 2013 Cabernet Franc (Rogue Valley),,,,
"Cocoa, bittersweet chocolate, herb, wood spice and cherry aromas lead to lightly styled cherry and cola flavors. The tannins bring a tacky feel.",87,3 Horse Ranch Vineyards 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington),,,,
"The nose does not want to give a lot away. The palate, however, shows spicy hints of nettle and a fresh bouncy zesty backbone of lemon and grapefruit, which makes it all the more appetizing.",90,Steininger 2015 Kittmannsberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),,,,
"From this famous old mountain vineyard, a dense and concentrated Zin that blows you away with deliciousness. It's very dark and young, with a flair of acidity and sweet tannins, and blackberry, cassis and mocha flavors that finish with a superripe raisiny note. But that slight Portiness is a seasoning element, and does not distract.",92,Moon Mountain Vineyard 2002 Monte Rosso Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"An aromatic, low-alcohol Syrah, this opens with spice, pepper and tart cranberry fruit. It layers in flavors of blue plum and a light wreath of smoke. It's an elegant style, miles away from the usual amped-up blockbuster Northwest Syrahs.",88,Delfino 2012 Syrah (Umpqua Valley),,,,
"Starts out very full-bodied and rich, almost too heavy for Pinot Noir. Then the acids kick in to accent the silky texture, and you know it's a ripe, ageable Pinot Noir. With deep flavors of raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice, cocoa and peppery spices, it should develop well over the next 4–6 years.",92,McIntyre Vineyards 2007 Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Pleasing aromas of cocoa, coffee, vanilla, smoke and blue and red berries lead to a palate full of plump fruit flavors with barrel accents throughout. It's a very pretty and elegant expression of the variety.",90,Northstar 2014 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,

"A dynamic balance between ripe, juicy fruit flavors and crisp acidity makes this medium-bodied wine both refreshing and substantive. It smells like a bowl of sliced melons, apples and grapes. After 79% Pinot Gris, the winemaker blends in Roussanne, Grüner Veltliner and a bit of Chardonnay.",90,Kendall-Jackson 2014 Vintner's Reserve Pinot Gris (California),,,,
"This wine starts off with vanilla, cinnamon and dark cherry notes on the nose, with the oak-derived elements marrying nicely with the Grenache fruit. It's full bodied, liquorous and lush, with a long, velvety finish. Probably best over the next 4–5 years.",91,LePlan-Vermeersch 2009 GT-G Grand Terroir Grenache (Côtes du Rhône Villages),,,,
"Robust in red berry and vanilla, this wine is big-boned and ripe, with a tartness under lying the fruit and a moderate structure.",86,Lawer 2014 Betsy's Vineyard Estate Syrah (Knights Valley),,,,
"This is a majority Cabernet Sauvignon, with equal parts Merlot and Petit Verdot and a smaller addition of Cabernet Franc. It speaks to the coolness of the vintage in its dried-herb characteristics and light-bodied smoothness of integrated tannin.",90,Silverpoint Cellars 2011 Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Soft notes of apricot on the nose become far more zippy on the taut, fresh but very fruity palate, growing flatter with the dry finish.",87,Dopff Au Moulin 2015 Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"Typical of the huge power of Guiraud, this is one of the richest Sauternes in 2005. The wine is rich and intense, the dry edge of botrytis just dominating the sweetness. Flavors of honey, almonds and peaches give the wine extra complexity.",95,Château Guiraud 2005  Sauternes,,,,
"Laced with baked apples, ginger and savory spices, there's something unique about the nose on this off-dry Riesling. On the palate, honeyed apples and pears combine with a tart lemon-lime acidity and a hint of bitterness on the finish.",87,Keuka Spring 2009 Riesling (Finger Lakes),,,,
"The chalky limestone soil of Pic St. Loup allows the fruit to shine without being overpowering, translating into lively aromas and flavors of fresh red berries, nectarine, banana and ripe pineapple chunks supported by nuances of talcum and sweet pea. The creamy texture and medium weight are somewhat surprising for this aesthetically light rosé, and with the lingering finish and well-balanced acidity.",89,Château de Fountgraves 2007 Pic Saint Loup Rosé (Coteaux du Languedoc),,,,
"Part of the natural wine movement, this frizzy Lambrusco opens with a dark raspberry color and easy aromas of cassis, sour cherry and chopped mint. The foamy close is easy and thin.",82,Quarticello NV Ferrando  (Lambrusco dell'Emilia),,,,
"The trick with sparkling wine is to achieve finesse. This Pinot Noir-Chardonnay blend is too scoury in bubbles, giving it a rough feel. Nonetheless it's delicious and easy to like for its yeasty flavors of limes, oranges and vanilla honey.",87,Kessler-Haak 2012 Brut Sparkling (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Opens with scratchy, dusty aromas of red fruits and herbs. The palate is round but clunky, with sweet, grapy flavors of blackberry and blueberry. Finishes rather oaky and mild, with a grainy feel.",85,Vistalba 2009 Corte C Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"Mild citrus and stone-fruit aromas include a note of crushed vitamin. This bright-pink rosé is wide but citric on the palate, with mild nectarine and white-grape flavors. On the finish, this is round in feel without much flavor.",84,Arínzano 2015 Hacienda de ArínzanoRosé Tempranillo (Pago de Arínzano),,,,
"A blend with 5% Tannat and 5% Petit Verdot, this wine is squarely focused on pitch black minerality; freshly turned soil and crushed graphite notes overwhelm the fruit. The palate's chipped slate and crushed lava rock flavors also contribute to its dark presence, its dusty tannins shyly revealing hints of blueberry and blackberry.",89,MCV 2014 Black Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),,,,
"Made without the added dosage used to enhance sweetness in traditionally crafted sparklers, this wine proves that with great fruit no corrections are needed. Flavors include ripe McIntosh apple, bright nectarine, toasted almond and vanilla alongside an elegant perlage. It finishes dry in flavor, with tangy acidity.",92,Ca' del Bosco 2009 Vintage Collection Dosage Zero Sparkling (Franciacorta),,,,
"This vineyard-designate expresses the variety with great finesse, offering softly layered black cherry, plum and just a hint of meat. Tobacco, earth and dried currant ride out the finish.",92,Judge Palmer 2013 Blau Vineyard Malbec (Knights Valley),,,,

"This is a dry, relatively austere wine. It showcases aromas of wet stone and lemon thyme, followed by flavors of pineapple and lemon and a long, citrusy finish. Drink now.",90,Redbank 2015 The Long Paddock Pinot Grigio (Victoria),,,,
"This fruity wine is made to be drunk young. It has soft tannins, perfumed blackberry fruit and just enough acidity. Smoothly textured, it's a great barbecue-style of red. The wine is named after the vineyard rather than after the literal Portuguese meaning of “scantily dressed.” Drink now.",86,J. Portugal Ramos 2015 Pouca Roupa Tinto Red (Alentejano),,,,
"Even though this Pinot Noir is instantly likeable for satisfying richness, it has some nuances. Flatters right off the bat with a soft texture housing lush raspberry and cherry pie filling, cola and sandalwood flavors that are easy to appreciate. But there are interesting mineral complexities. Drink soon.",92,Isabel Mondavi 2009 Estate Pinot Noir (Carneros),,,,
"An exceptionally young wine that tastes like bacon and cherry syrup, this offers an overripe, concentrated and thick drink experience.",81,Ashokawna 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This is a solid, well-priced and widely available wine. Deep in color, it offers sultry blackberry jam, cocoa and coffee aromas. Soft tannins coat the palate, bringing tart cherry and woody spice flavors. The acidity and grip are just right.",88,Joseph Carr 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"Sweet-tasting fruits dominate this wine. With its black currant flavor, it's a wine that expresses the fresh character of the vintage without losing its own sense of richness. Charming already, it will certainly age.",88,Clos des Menuts 2008  Saint-Émilion,,,,
"Cherry, red currant and minerally aromas are fresh and appealing. This blend of Tempranillo, Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon is pure and lithe on the palate, while toasty, minerally berry and cherry flavors finish dry, focused and with notes of licorice, cocoa and herbs. This succeeds by offering a little bit of everything good; drink through 2019.",91,Mas Blanch I Jové 2011 Petit Saó Red (Costers del Segre),,,,
"This is crisp and tangy, with a slightly beer-accented nose. Cucumber and apple flavors are found, with a touch of canned asparagus.",85,Boomtown 2011 Pinot Gris (Washington),,,,
"A blend of 50% Cannonau, 15% Bovale, 15% Carignano, 10% Monica and 10% Malvasia, this generous, vibrant rosato delivers intense fruit aromas of red cherry and black raspberry along with a whiff of spice. The fruit sensations follow through to the juicy palate while notes of chopped herb and white pepper provide back up. Fresh acidity lifts up the finish.",89,Argiolas 2014 Serra Lori Rosato (Isola dei Nuraghi),,,,
"Showing surprising structure for the vintage, this medium-bodied white offers aromas of honey, nut, pressed flower and peach. The flavors follow through to the vibrant palate, along with mineral and tangy acidity.",90,Vigne Marina Coppi 2014 Marine Favorita (Colli Tortonesi),,,,
"This is a fruity wine, gentle with its white fruits and citrus flavors. It has just a touch of minerality from the granite soil that brings out acidity and a tangy aftertaste. Drink this refreshing wine now.",88,La Berrière 2016 Sur Lie  (Muscadet Côtes de Grandlieu),,,,

"The variety is hard to find on this wine with aromas of tire rubber, barrel spice, green pepper and herb in the lead. It's medium bodied in feel, with soft tannins.",84,Kennedy Shah 2012 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Passoro opens with an amber, almost deep orange color and overripe aromas of sun baked raisins, dried apricot, strawberry jam and candied fruit. The wine feels heavy and thick on the mouth but a sharp point of lemon zest appears at the very end.",84,Maggio Vini 2006 Passoro 500ml Moscato (Sicilia),,,,
"Aromas of blackberry, strawberry and chocolate open for flavors of blackberry, Red Delicious apple peel, aniseed and vanilla. This wine is harmonious on the palate with understated tannins and breakthrough notes of summer peach on the finish.",92,Psagot 2014 Peak Red,,,,
"Orchard fruit, Mediterranean scrub, violet and wild berry aromas take center stage in this fragrant wine. The fresh, enjoyable palate doles out Marasca cherry and juicy raspberry flavors alongside zesty acidity.",87,Il Feuduccio Di S. Maria D'Orni 2016  Cerasuolo d'Abruzzo,,,,
"Unbalanced, with sweet cherry and orange jam flavors and acidity that's almost sour.",81,Perry Creek 2005 Altitude 2401 Fair Play Farms Syrah (El Dorado),,,,

"Chalky tannins and dried herb mark the entry of this wine, which stays varietal despite the addition of 14% Cabernet Sauvignon.

"Jacob's Creek's top-end red is complex, dense and supple. A seductive bouquet of cassis, Asian spice, leather, cocoa and smoke pulls you in and the palate delivers with a thick, velvety feel and concentrated black fruit. Dry, but ripe and even tannins on the long finish portend a good future for this already attractive wine. Cellar Selection.",92,Jacob's Creek 1998 Limited Release Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia),,,,
"Dry, minty and saucy on the nose, with an old-school sheer palate full of acidity, citrus, cherry tomato, herbs and snap. Shows toasty oak, length and cheeky tannins along with red fruit finishing notes. In between new wave and traditional Rioja. Drink now through 2012.",88,Marqués de Vargas 2005 Reserva Privada  (Rioja),,,,
"A strong, concentrated and ultimately rustic wine, a flavor that derives from the Alicante Bouschet in the blend. This gives it power and alcohol that shows in a pepper character. The final juicy palate feels solid and heavy.",87,Serrano Mira 2005 Herdade das Servas Vinhas Velhas Red (Alentejano),,,,
"This wine is light and fresh, full of crisp and ripe black currant fruits that lie alongside gentle and open tannins.

"For 2014, the Weber is the star of a very fine Winderlea lineup. Dark and deeply concentrated, it's jammed with black cherry fruit, annotated with anise and showing a hint of gunmetal.

"La Grenouille, the frog, is a soft, creamy wine, but with a great waft of acidity, like biting into a green apple. The citrus element is there, but it's that apple flavor and texture that dominates.",86,Domaine de la Grenaudière 2009 La Grenouille Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),,,,
"Especially for a more affordable bottling, Joey Tensley packs in a ton of density on this bottling, from the color to the nose to the palate. Hearty aromas of black currant, charred blackberry, dusty sagebrush and a hint of caramel drop into a deep and rich but not overripe palate of tar and blackened fruit. Soft tannins coat the mouth fully.",91,Los Padres 2016 Red (Central Coast),,,,
"Toh! offers excellent value in the form of fragrant aromas of peach, honey, melon and light floral tones. The wine is lean and compact, yet offers that creamy smoothness that is characteristic of the Friulano grape.",85,Di Lenardo 2007 Toh! Friulano (Friuli Grave),,,,
"The grapes are from the newish region just west of Petaluma, a chilly, windy area.

Drink now–2013.",90,Morris Ranch 2007 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,

"It's good to see a wine in that increasingly rare sight: a Provence skittle-shaped bottle. This is a light and fruity wine from vineyards on the Massif des Maures, close to the sea. It has a bright crisp aftertaste with plenty of acidity to keep it all very crisp. Skittles is the precursor to lawn and indoor bowling.",85,Vignobles Ravel 2016 Château Montaud Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"Just out, this is quite young and tart, tightly wound with green apple and green pear fruit. It's the sort of wine that may well improve considerably with an extra year in bottle. A light touch of cinnamon comes up in the aftertaste.",87,Portlandia 2015 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),,,,

Drink it now and through 2021.",91,Rock Wall 2011 Hendry Vineyard Zinfandel (Napa Valley),,,,

Oak, campfire and rubbery notes sit on top of modest berry flavors, while the finish is oaky but fresh in feel.",85,Emiliana 2011 Natura Made with Organically Grown Grapes Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"Medium sweet and fruit forward, this is loaded with flavors of orange pekoe tea, candied lemon and peach marmalade. It's a fruit circus, with plenty of sweetness. It could be used as a dessert wine with a berry pie, or tried as an adventurous companion to a blue cheese.",88,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2015 Riesling (Willamette Valley),,,,

Drink through 2022.",91,François Lurton 2013 Hacienda Araucano Clos de Lolol Red (Lolol Valley),,,,
"From the producer's sloping vineyard at a 750-foot elevation in the eastern section of the appellation, this wine also contains 4% Malbec from the same site. Earthy in stewed mushrooms, grilled meat and bouillon, it's a bold, dense powerhouse of a wine, with a tobacco-laden finish.",88,Rodney Strong 2012 Rockaway Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"The blend is 50% Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and 17% Cabernet Franc, aged in 100% new French oak. The only wine from this producer that is a blend, it currently shows an abundance of barrel flavors. The baking spices overpower some of the signature elements that this distinguished vineyard imparts—the mineral, saline, iron and steel notes often found in Ciel's red wines. The fruit remains gorgeously ripe, and with a bit more bottle age those subtle flavors may reappear.",91,Côtes de Ciel 2012 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Flagship Reserve Red (Red Mountain),,,,
"Preserved black cherry and berry notes seem lush and ripe on the nose, but are surprisingly tart on the palate. The palate is full bodied, with concentrated black fruit flavor and soft, drying tannins on the finish.",85,Stony Lonesome 2011 Estate Reserve Barbera (Finger Lakes),,,,
"In 2009, this vineyard's yields were reduced, and production of this wine was cut to just 75 cases. It is compact and astringent to such a degree that even 24 hours of breathing time does little to make it budge. Flavors of cassis, white pepper and a hint of herb poke out from a bed of tannins. It's just too soon to tell where this is going.",89,Seven Hills 2009 Klipsun Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),,,,
"A taste of spearmint, black olive and leather interplay on this wine, with black licorice also prominently in the mix. Juicy with tannic grip, this reserve finishes rich in blackberry and dust.",87,Brutocao 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino),,,,
"There's a pleasantly oxidized element to this wine from Michael Mooney (who also makes Chateau Margene from Paso Robles' Creston district). Aromas recall honey and dried apricots, mangos and bananas. The flavors carry that forward, with caramelized apples, melted marshmallow and all types of dried fruit, but with lots of acidic verve too.",92,Mooney Family 2012 Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"The aromas are vibrant, with notes of pear, honeysuckle and peach. The palate is full flavored, dry as promised, with a zing of tart acidity that stitches it all together. It's an outstanding value that shows a beautiful sense of balance.",89,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2015 Dry Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Mirabelle is akin to Schramsberg's second label, but this brut is pretty good. Made from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, it's rich and scoury with flavors of oranges, strawberries, limes and vanilla.",86,Schramsberg NV Mirabelle Brut Sparkling (North Coast),,,,
"This amped-up vintage of the Merlot-dominated, BFM Bordeaux-style red tops 15% alcohol, but seems a bit contrived. Aggressive vanilla and tobacco flavors cover up the nuanced highlights found in past BFM vintages, and the base of black cherry fruit carries a root beer finish. Not that it isn't a tasty drink—it is—it's just less interesting than before.",88,Dusted Valley 2008 Stone Tree Vineyard BFM Red Red (Wahluke Slope),,,,
"A simple Syrah, with decent cherry, licorice and tobacco flavors that finish quick. It's dry and clean, and a certain elegance makes it a nice pairing with a wide variety of fare.",85,Eberle 2009 Steinbeck Vineyard Syrah (Paso Robles),,,,
"Blackberry jam aromas in this wine are followed by a lean palate and ample tannins. It's tough at this stage, but as it opens, the fruit will come through to give damson jelly flavors. Drink from 2020.",87,Château Clos Mansio 2015  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,,,,
"This is overripe, with raisiny, pruny flavors and a hot finish.",81,Adelaida 2009 Michael's Vineyard Zinfandel (Paso Robles),,,,
"Black fruits are fully ripe, then encased in massive barrel flavors. The overwhelming influence of oak brings a barrage of tobacco, smoke and charred wood. The tannins have a bitter edge.",86,Kason 2014 Reserva Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"92-94 Herbaceous style of wine, a Bordeaux white wine classic style, with crisp grassy Sauvignon Blanc flavors, elegant, not heavy.",93,Château de France 2010 Barrel sample  (Pessac-Léognan),,,,
"Lusciously textured and bursting with citrusy acidity, this combines savory tones of burnt sugar and apple cider with hints of fresh orange peel and white flower. Crushed stone and a tea leaf astringency linger on the finish.",88,Channing Daughters 2010 Pinot Grigio (Long Island),,,,
"A disappointing effort This is earthy and dank, with dark, leathery notes contrasting sharply with bright acids on the finish.",82,Père Anselme 2008 La Grivelière Tete de Cuvee Red (Côtes du Rhône),,,,
"Soft and rounded, this has apple and peach fruits, with a lemon zest texture. The acidity is a refreshing counterweight to the smooth character.",88,La Chablisienne 2009 La Sereine  (Chablis),,,,
"This bold, full-bodied and flavorful wine wraps ripe, generous blackberry flavors in a blanket of fine-grained tannins that helps support the richness and keep the wine in balance. It's from a little-known, tiny winery doing interesting things.",91,Wise Villa 2013 Estate Grown Petite Sirah (Placer County),,,,
"With almost no color, this spritzy rosado is prickly and feline on the nose, like Sauvignon Blanc or Verdejo. The palate is lightly bubbly, with bounce and tart tangerine and herbal flavors. Txomin Etxaníz has never made a commercial rosé prior to this. This makes you wonder why they did.",83,Txomín Etxaníz 2011 Getaria Rosé (Getariako Txakolina),,,,
"This savory Pinot Grigio has a little weight on it thanks to grape selection and 20% aging in large barrels. It delivers classic Granny Smith apple, Bartlett pear, nutmeg and flint in a creamy texture brightened by fresh acidity.",91,Colterenzio 2012 Puiten Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),,,,
"This has an elegant, fruity, lightly spicy profile. Red cherry and nutmeg aromas meld with fresh and pure fruit flavors like red cherry and raspberry shaded by cinnamon and clove. It also offers a silky-smooth texture and medium body.",90,Murphy-Goode 2013 Pinot Noir (California),,,,
"Domaine Houchart is one of the top estates in Sainte-Victoire. This ripe while deliciously fruity and fresh wine is full of raspberries, ripe red currants and a refreshing line of acidity.",90,Domaine Houchart 2013 Rosé (Côtes de Provence Sainte-Victoire),,,,
"Despite its young age, this beautiful expression of the Cannubi cru from Michele Chiarlo already shows a high level of evolution and sophistication. The wine blends mineral aromas with fresh fruit, spice and licorice. It finishes on the spicy side with a toasty aftertaste and drying tannins.",92,Michele Chiarlo 2005 Cannubi  (Barolo),,,,
"Green, mildly vegetal and lightly tropical, with a tangy, acid-driven palate and citrusy, sharp flavors of grapefruit, tangerine and orange. Quick on the finish but sizzling, with an abundance of mouth-washing acidity. Very food friendly even toward the end of its prescribed lifespan.",87,Caliterra 2009 Tributo Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),,,,
"This is a full-bodied, sumptuous Pinot Noir that's filled with candied, pie-filling flavors of black cherries, licorice, mocha and spices. While it's a bit common in texture, it does provide plenty of pleasure. Drink now.",87,Riverbench 2010 Mesa Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"The bouquet is dry, briney and otherwise neutral. It feels wide and lemony, with flavors of citrus and white fruits. It remains mildly pickled on the finish.",84,Loess 2010 Blanco Verdejo (Rueda),,,,
"This smooth and creamy wine is spicy with wood aging and rich with yellow fruits. It presents a generous character, rounded and open. The wine is ready to drink.",88,Georges Duboeuf 2015 Clos Reyssie  (Pouilly-Fuissé),,,,
This is a soft wine with attractive ripe strawberry fruits and a soft texture. There is balancing acidity giving an edge of freshness to the otherwise gentle fruity texture.,84,Casa Santos Lima 2015 Portuga Rosé (Lisboa),,,,
"Elegant and ageworthy, this shows dry, firm tannins and bright aromas of wild berry, tobacco and spice. Pair this with roast pork or lamb.",91,Poderi Luigi Einaudi 2009 Vigna Tecc  (Dogliani),,,,
"Ripe black cherry, blackberry and black pepper sensations dominate this brooding blend of 86% Sangiovese and 14% Syrah. The spicy, dense palate is forward and warm accompanied by bracing tannins that carry through to the finish. It's shy on fresh acidity so best enjoy this soon.",87,Loacker 2011 Valdifalco  (Morellino di Scansano),,,,
"A beautifully perfumed wine, all herbs and smokiness. The palate sings the same tune, a rich, sensuous one, laced with more somber notes of dark, dry tannins. At the end of the day, this is already a delicious wine, but one that will really improve over 5–10 years.",93,Chanson Père et Fils 2005 Grèves Premier Cru  (Beaune),,,,
"The nose on this Sauvignon Blanc is an amalgam of white pepper, toast, white peach and pear aromas, highlighted by a squirt of kiwi juice. It feels plump but medium bodied, with a bitter hint of papaya seed and a touch of lime on the midpalate.",84,Doukénie 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Virginia),,,,
"The blend is 70% Pinot Gris and 30% Viognier. The Gris provides the fruit base, with pear/apple flavors; the Viognier adds some light lemon and citrus blossom accents. This is a big wine, bone dry.",86,Thurston Wolfe 2001 Pinot Gris-Viognier White (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This sophisticated wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, which accounts for the firm tannins and dense structure as well as most of the blackberries and blackcurrants. Smaller amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc add cherries and violets, while oak contributes smoky complexities. Rich and elegant, the wine provides lovely drinking now.",92,Silverado 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Shows modest dark cherry fruit with cedar and leather accents. A lean, even mouthfeel and moderate acidity mark the palate. The tart dried-fruit flavors turn somewhat sour on the back end.",83,Vigna Piccola 1996  Chianti Classico,,,,
"Vanilla cookies and sulfuric match stick are about all you can draw from the bouquet. This is flat in feel, with candied, flabby flavors of green fruits. The finish is bland.",80,Santa Ema 2012 Select Terroir Sauvignon Blanc (Maipo Valley),,,,
"This easy expression of Sangiovese offers an unusual set of aromas that spans from sweet Christmas spice to blue flower to green herb. A touch of cola or eucalyptus gives the wine a bright, vertical lift.",86,Tenuta Vitalonga 2009 Sangio'vese Sangiovese (Umbria),,,,
"The aromas and flavors of new wood are dominant in this soft, ripe wine. It has opulent black-plum fruit that shows through the wood influence. A touch of smokiness adds spice.",86,Château Moulin de Canhaut 2009  Médoc,,,,
"Made in a forwardly delicious style from older vines, the XXXV designation is for Sausal's 35th anniversary. The aromas and flavors range from briary blackberries and cherries through carob and licorice to cedar, sweet candle wax, bacon, black pepper and soy sauce. Should develop over the next 6 years.",88,Sausal 2006 Zin XXV Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Granular, baked-fruit aromas are dominant, while the palate is soft and a bit hot, with sticky plum pudding flavors. Turns more sweet, candied and medicinal as it opens, while the finish is peppery and herbal.",84,Indomita 2008 Selected Varietal Carmenère (Maipo Valley),,,,
"Touches of smoke and grain extend throughout this uniquely savory off-dry kabinett. Rich streaks of peach and marmalade brighten the palate, accented by bursts of lemonade acidity, but overall, there's a bit of disarray throughout.",86,Matheus 2013 Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"The richness and structure of the appellation are well represented in this firm wine. It has dark tannins and hints of wood aging as well as ripe black cherry and berry fruits. With its structure and intense acidity, the wine will age well. Drink from 2020.",92,Nicolas Potel 2014  Morey-Saint-Denis,,,,
"Whiffs of cedar and baking spices lead to ripe blackberry and boysenberry flavors in this well-balanced and easy to appreciate wine. The ample fruit flavors are hard to resist, and the supple, modestly tannic texture is just right.",90,Amador Cellars 2013 Cooper & Karmere Vineyards Barbera (Amador County),,,,
This bright and easy-drinking wine opens with delicate floral aromas of acacia and Spanish broom. The linear palate offers notes of lemon zest and peach alongside racy acidity that leaves a refreshing finish. Simple but well-made.,86,Colonnara 2012 Lyricus  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico),,,,
"This was pressed whole-cluster and fermented in French oak, roughly one-third new. It's a flavorful wine with caramel apple appeal, good definition and medium length. The barrels put a pleasing toasty frame around the finish.",89,Sparkman 2012 Lumière Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Unusually for the Médoc, this wine has a significant percentage (14.5%) of Cabernet Franc as well as 12.5% Petit Verdot. These two grapes give the wine its perfume and its dark color. They add to the rich tannins and juicy black currants that pack the wine. Drink this fine wine from 2020.",90,Château Charmail 2014  Haut-Médoc,,,,
"A very pretty Merlot, and a good price for the elegant quality. It's dry and tannic, showing the Clos du Val style of controlled, somewhat aloof ripeness. There's a rich, attractive core of black cherry fruit. Will develop for a few years, but it's really best now, with a brief decant.",90,Clos du Val 2007 Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"This muscular Malbec opens with a blast of ripe berry aromas offset by oaky coconut notes. A plump palate avoids being pudgy, while plum, black cherry and blackberry flavors end with a turn of oaky vanilla and balancing residual acidity.",90,Finca Sophenia 2013 Reserve Malbec (Tupungato),,,,
"Estate-grown from a 30-acre plot planted to three different Chardonnay clones, this wine is robust and hearty in wood, white peach and papaya. With ample acidity, it remains balanced and mouthfilling, with an edginess finished off by a tart lemon flavor.",90,Marimar Estate 2012 La Masía Don Miguel Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Open and simple, this has a light touch of citrus fruit, with an edge of wood in the background. It is bright and ready to drink.",83,Domaine Patrick Javillier 2010 Cuvée Oligocene  (Bourgogne),,,,
"High-toned cherry and orange dance around considerable toasty oak that never becomes obtrusive in this expansive, succulent wine. Smoky tobacco and violets provide a savory component that works with the fruit.",90,J. Rickards 2014 Heritage Selection Carignane (Alexander Valley),,,,
"This opens with aromas of French oak, espresso, toast and a whiff of rose. The dense, chewy palate offers dried black cherry, coconut, roasted coffee bean and grilled sage alongside bracing tannins that clench the finish. An orange zest note signals the close the finish. Give the tannins a few years to unfurl then drink.",89,Pio Cesare 2012 Il Bricco  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Black-fruit aromas include oaky notes of baking spices and vanilla. This Graciano is full in body, with bounce and depth. Dark-fruit flavors include chocolate and spice notes, while this is toasty and oaky but also racy and juicy on the finish. Drink through 2026.",91,Casado Morales 2011 EME Monovarietal Alavesa  (Rioja),,,,
"This is a big burly wine that just has too many off aromas. Heavy barnyard scents mix with tart berry and espresso elements, and although there's body here, and what seem to be basically good elements, the stable-like odors stop the show.",81,Colognole 1997 Chianti Rufina  (Chianti Rufina),,,,
"This elegant wine opens with enticing white spring flower, freshly picked orchard fruit and herb aromas. The vibrant palate offers juicy white peach, nectarine and yellow apple flavors, framed by crisp acidity. An almond note graces the dry, refreshing finish.",91,Ottella 2016 Le Creete  (Lugana),,,,
"This white wine from Basilicata delivers sweet fruit aromas of passion fruit, green melon, papaya and peach. But there are also drying mineral tones that give it a clean and polished feel.",87,Terre degli Svevi 2007 Re Manfredi White (Basilicata),,,,
"90-92 Barrel sample. Good balance between richness and great freshness. The acidity is almost sweet, giving a wine that is spicy, but with a great green aftertaste.",91,Château Picque Caillou 2009 Barrel sample  (Pessac-Léognan),,,,
"Slightly disjointed at first, this Barolo with fruit sourced from four vineyard sites, needs a few minutes to open in the glass. The wine offers tertiary aromas of cured beef, smoked bacon and white mushroom. Drink now.",87,Cascina Adelaide 2005 4 Vigne  (Barolo),,,,
"Christine Saahs is a believer that high alcohol is not a necessity for a powerful, rich wine. And this proves her point. There is weight here, intensity, but the lower alcohol gives the wine poise and delicacy. It stays fresh, and will age with that freshness intact. Keep for another 4–5 years.",92,Nikolaihof 2007 Vom Stein Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),,,,
"Lovely notes of ripe apple with an orange peel touch play on the nose. They also appear on the dry, juicy and very fruit-driven palate. All is driven and slender, fresh but ripe. The fruit is so burgeoning that this is still juicy, even on the apple-scented finish.",90,Joseph Cattin 2015 Hatschbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"A very nice Sauvignon Blanc, and a good followup to the equally fine 2009, at a fair price. It straddles the line between dry and a little sweet, with brisk acidity boosting citrus, sweet hay, vanilla and white pepper flavors.",89,Trailhead 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"The alluring lightness of scent here conjures up citrus-flavored snowflakes—symmetrical and delicate little crystals of lemony deliciousness that melt on the tongue one by one, releasing a constant stimulus of utterly joyous freshness—whichever cloud they fell from. It simply bursts with lemon and grapefruit zest, and even with lime. Slender, incisive purity echoes long in a blizzard of bracing and lasting thrill.",94,Emmerich Knoll 2014 Loibner Federspiel Riesling (Wachau),,,,
"More oak and color than the regular Calina Merlot, but that means more coconut, resin and char as well. Black raspberry and currant-like flavors are plump and medium-long, while the finish has some tannic grab and girth along with woody touches like vanilla and spice. With 20% Cabernet Sauvignon.",88,Calina 2006 Alcance Merlot (Maule Valley),,,,
"Capo Soprano Nero d'Avola delivers black olive and fresh capers backed by jammy fruit and hickory spice. The wine has a sweet, raw feel and would pair well with easy red meat recipes or fried pork chops.",86,Capo Soprano 2006 Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),,,,
"Artadi's top wine is dynamite in a bottle. Ripe, saturated, oaky aromas of blackberry, leather, blueberry pie and aged cheese are incredibly potent and alluring. This is huge in the mouth, with lemony oak and broad tannins that don't grind. Intense blackberry, coffee, toast and smoky flavors finish a mile deep, with all sorts of textural grab and character. Best from 2016 through 2026.",95,Artadi 2011 Viña El Pison  (Rioja),,,,
"Slightly reduced and showing plenty of barrel imprint, this vineyard designate is bold and grippy, its soft entry marked by clove spice and cigar. The fruit is a combination of plum and dark cherry, subtly wrapped in vanilla toast.",91,Goldschmidt 2013 Yoeman Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Tart raspberry fruit limned with orange peel provides excellent definition across the palate. It's bright and tangy, with the balance and construction to develop nicely over the next five to eight years. Drink now through 2025.",90,Left Coast Cellars 2014 Right Bank Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Sweetly extracted fruit and oak star in this rich Pinot Noir. It has flavors of raspberry jam, cherry pop tart, vanilla, buttered toast, brown sugar and cinnamon. All this richness is balanced by brisk, mouthwatering acidity.",88,Talisman 2009 Adastra Vineyard Pinot Noir (Los Carneros),,,,
"For the winery's lower-priced offering, this is a stunner. Baked black cherry, vanilla, raspberry, rose petals and a touch of licorice light up the nose. The lightly poised but intensely focused sip reveals a wild combo of fruit and spice, with sage, bay leaf, thyme and fennel laced through black cherry. It's like walking through the Central Coast scrubland.",94,Center of Effort 2014 Effort Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),,,,
"Earth and rubber notes on the bouquet give way to black fruit and black olive aromas. It feels fresh, with a good acid level and a solid body supporting flavors of wild berry, plum and spice. The finish is toasty, with a fair amount of oak and bacon flavors.",88,Tamarí 2011 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc and a splash of Petit Verdot, this offers bright red berry, menthol, cedar, espresso and savory herb aromas. On the palate, polished tannins support juicy dark cherry, blackberry, licorice, coffee and toasted notes. Enjoy through 2017.",91,Grattamacco 2010 L'Alberello  (Bolgheri Superiore),,,,
"Earthy, meaty black-plum aromas come with a touch of latex and leather. This is plump but lacking in the midpalate, while flavors of herbal plum and currant finish mild.",86,Terrapura 2014 Pinot Noir (Aconcagua Valley),,,,
"This is a really fruity, fresh strawberry-flavored wine. Remarkably pale in color, it expertly balances a dry profile with brisk natural acidity and bright, fresh fruitiness. It's ready to drink now. Screwcap.",86,Weszeli 2012 Rosé (Niederösterreich),,,,
"Tender, teasing perfumes of ivy leaves and citrus with riper notions of pear, yeast and grapefruit peel make for a complete, spicy palate. The phenolic midpalate has a counterpoint in the zesty acidity. Good now, but will develop.",90,Tegernseerhof 2013 Loibenberg Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),,,,
"Cherry-scented, clean and fruity. Good concentration mid-palate, with no discernable new oak, just a balanced, firm attack and a strong, chewy finish. Only 123 cases made.",87,Taft Street 1998 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Don't confuse this with authentic Prosecco from Italy. It's not that good. Dry, thin and textured, this has a rough mouthfeel.",82,Viszlay Vineyards 2009 Estate Bottled Prosecco (Russian River Valley),,,,
"There is a gentle side to this medium-bodied wine, as it offers aromatic complexity with slightly restrained fruit flavors. Light aromas like cedar shavings and black pepper give way to a smooth texture supported by moderate tannins, and pretty plum and pomegranate flavors.",90,Skinner 2013 Eighteen Sixty-One Red (El Dorado),,,,
"The aromas are a touch prickly and sharp, and there's some heavy oak on the nose. But in the mouth it's more harmonious, with sweet fruit and more than enough barrel spice. The finish is simple and clean, so it fades away nicely. The only problem is a lasting salty, wood-dominated essence.",85,San Pedro 2000 Reserva 1865 Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),,,,
"This is one of a collection of Champagnes tasted and approved by a group of growers under the Special Club label. With a predominance of Chardonnay, it's still crisp and fruity, showing rich apple and pear flavors. Its citrusy acidity gives it lift, slowing any signs of maturity. It will continue to age gracefully but is delicious now.",93,Charlier & Fils 2005 Special Club Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"While the wine's aromas are all about wood and smoky toast, it proffers reassuring hints of fruit on the palate. However, it is still an over-oaked wine that will likely never have enough fruitiness.",84,Château La Branne 2013  Médoc,,,,
"Matured in 50% new French oak, this wine offers medium concentration and appealing scents of rose petals, apples and cranberries. The tangy fruit is juicy and firm, and nicely balanced for cellaring.",90,Illahe 2010 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Caramelized oak finds a companion in tangy acidity in this full-bodied, lushly concentrated white from various vineyard sources. A taste of baked pear gives it a richness that veers on sweet upfront before it opens and expands on the palate into a broader spectrum of rounded texture and a lilt of anise.",90,Frank Family 2014 Chardonnay (Carneros),,,,
"This wine offers immediate appeal, opening with aromas of black olive, funk, flowers and moist earth. It does not disappoint, with soft fruit and savory flavors that coat the palate. Meaty flavors add to the enjoyment and the balance is spot on.",92,Saviah 2013 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"There is some of the mineral character that is typical of the Douro in this black-fruit-laden wine. It has acidity and tannins and a stalky, juicy character that keeps it crisp. The wine is ready to drink now.",85,Casca Wines 2015 Bote Red (Douro),,,,
"A bright, fresh Syrah delicious in restrained blackberry and blueberry fruit, it has a luscious mouthfeel, plenty of acidity and an undercurrent of wild herb. Stark managed to do good things with many varieties in 2011. This wine is a standout, ready to pair with something gamey dribbled in black pepper sauce.",93,Stark 2011 Eaglepoint Ranch Syrah (Mendocino County),,,,
"From heritage clones of Wente and Mt. Eden, this top-end Chardonnay from the Foley family offers salted peaches, hazelnuts and crushed sea shells on a nose that recalls a steady sea breeze. It's light and brisk on the palate, with yellow pear, nectarine and lemon salt, all wrapped by a grippy texture. Excellent by itself, it would pair with foods from shellfish to roasted chicken.",94,Two Sisters 2014 Courtney's Vineyard Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Enticing pressed rose, iris, woodland berry, Mediterranean brush and game aromas emerge from this succulent red. The palate is savory, doling out ripe wild cherry, black raspberry, grilled herb, white pepper flavors with a hint of sea salt. Firm but refined tannins and tangy acidity provide polished support. Drink 2020–2028.",93,Lambardi 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
The main issue with this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah is a streak of vegetal unripeness that accompanies the cherries and blackberries. The second problem is excessive softness. Drink up.,82,Heartfelt 2010 Inspiration Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Aromas of fig, tilled earth, exotic spice and a balsamic note mingle together on this tight racy red. Bright and linear, the austere palate is still primary but offers sour cherry, clove and an earthy hint of game framed in firm acidity and fine-grained tannins. Drink after 2023.",89,Bava 2013 Scarrone  (Barolo),,,,
"This Merlot gets your basic dry, full-bodied red wine job done in an inexpensive way. It has raisiny flavors and lots of crunchy acidity.",82,Twisted 2012 Merlot (California),,,,
"This rosé is a field blend of Mourvèdre and Grenache. A very pretty pale-peach color, the aromas bring pleasing notes of herb, spice, strawberry, passion fruit and mineral. The flavors are dry and full in feel, showing weight and intensity but still a sense of lightness.",90,Efeste 2016 Oldfield Estate Rosé (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Minerally, earthy aromas of plum and blackberry are oaky and attractive. This is round and well balanced, with cassis, blackberry, spice and herbal flavors settling on a spicy finish led by cardamom and clove notes as well as a smooth feel. Drink through 2017.",91,Trapiche 2010 Gran Medalla Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"From schist soil, this tight and mineral-driven wine has crisp acidity enmeshed in the taut texture. This complex, young-tasting wine, with its structure, needs to age. Drink from 2016.",91,Bonnet-Huteau 2013 Les Dabinières Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),,,,
"Brawny aromas of asphalt, roofing tar and rubber are balanced by smooth, deep blackberry and cassis scents. This is tannic and rugged, but the palate also offers buttery, oaky richness and depth. Heavily toasted plum and blackberry flavors finish with heat and a taste of dark chocolate. Drink through 2019.",91,Teso La Monja 2012 Almirez  (Toro),,,,
"Do not pop the cork and drink this right away as it's currently tight and tannic. But as it warms up and breathes, it releases its considerable charms. With 16% Viognier blended in, it's fantastically rich and concentrated in black-pepper-accented raspberry and sweet-smoke flavors. Acidity adds balance to the richness. You can enjoy this wine now, after an hour in the decanter, or cellar it for at least six years.",94,Foxen 2010 Toasted Rope Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Produced from organically grown grapes, this wine has attractive red fruits and a warm ripe character. Dominated by Grenache, it has a light peppery edge as well as plenty of bright acidity to contrast the fruitiness. Drink now.",87,Domaines Pierre Chavin 2016 Pierre et Paul Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"From the winery's estate vineyard high on the mountain comes this young wine. Although it's tight in tannins and acidity, it's extraordinarily rich in blueberry, blackberry, chocolate and roasted almond flavors, like a granola bar. Alcohol of 15.3% provides a slightly hot, sweetly tart counterpoint to the fruit. A gorgeous Cabernet to drink now with a perfect steak.",93,Dos Lagos Vineyards 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak),,,,
"This delicious and affordable wine offers a fragrance of blue flower, tilled soil, game and leather, along with whiffs of mature black fruit. The juicy palate delivers ripe blackberry, black cherry, black pepper and licorice alongside firm but refined tannins.",90,Grifalco 2011  Aglianico del Vulture,,,,
"This drinkable Pinot does have a tannic toughness. On the palate, there are good notes of cherry and cola, but hints of green unripeness compromise its future. Give it a good decant and drink now.",86,Wild Horse 2011 Unbridled Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"A fragrant blend of 80% Nebbiolo and 20% Vespolina and Croatina, this stunning red offers enticing scents of dark-skinned berry, tilled soil, new leather, dark spice and a balsamic note. Elegant, structured and savory, it boasts juicy black-cherry, raspberry, white-pepper, cinnamon and tobacco flavors set against a backbone of firm, refined tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2019–2030.",92,Centovigne 2012 Il Centovigne Red (Coste della Sesia),,,,

"Fruity and smoky, this has muddled aromas of ripe fruit and exotic spice. The palate is bright and intense with fresh acidity and firm tannins.",88,Livio Voghera 2007  Barbaresco,,,,
"Young and fruity, this informal wine opens with aromas of dark berry, violet and a whiff of clove. The simple palate doles out tart cherry, raspberry, orange peel and a hint of white pepper alongside bracing acidity.",86,Marchesi di Barolo 2014 Rurè  (Barbera d'Alba),,,,
"96–98. Barrel sample. This is a structured, ripe wine that also has a great sense of freshness—vibrant blackberry flavor and lively acidity. The finish retains the same delicious freshness and brightness of this vintage.",97,Château Pontet-Canet 2012 Barrel Sample  (Pauillac),,,,
"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this easy-drinking wine opens with subdued aromas of toast, espresso, aromatic herb and a whiff blue flower. The round straightforward palate offers dried wild cherry, walnut and star anise alongside supple tannins. Drink through 2018.",87,Il Borro 2013 Polissena Sangiovese (Toscana),,,,
"Very dry in style, this is a beautifully crisp, tight and taut Champagne. It has citrus and green apple flavors, and is steely in character while also fruity. It could do well with some more bottle age.",92,H. Blin 2003 Édition Limitée Extra Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"A touch of sweet spice jazzes up the nose, giving lift to the lightly baked apple and yellow peach characteristics. The round, medium-bodied palate has lively acidity and a sweet orange-oil flavored finish.",86,Gérard Bertrand 2010 Réserve Spéciale Chardonnay (Pays d'Oc),,,,
"This light-bodied, surprisingly affordable wine surprises in its lightness of color and texture, its character driven by high-strung elements of pomegranate and tangerine. On the more savory side, expect nuances of earthy mint, bay leaf and white pepper.",92,Willowbrook 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Crisp green aromas suggest lime and then passion fruit. It's lively and spritzy in the mouth, with high acidity yielding green flavors that transition to pithy and heavy. Lemon-lime mixed with celery notes come up on the finish.",88,Matetic 2010 EQ Sauvignon Blanc (San Antonio),,,,
"Concentrated scents of iodine, olive and herbal blackberry set up a loud palate supported by noticeable acidity. This tastes briny and a bit salty, with herbal black plum and blackberry flavors. A note of prune on the finish is offset by vivid acidity.",87,Viña Casas Patronales 2012 Reserva Privada Carmenère (Maule Valley),,,,
This wine is mostly Roussanne (58%) with the rest equal parts Marsanne and Grenache Blanc. The aromas of herb and peach are light and are followed by elegant lightly styled fruit flavors.,88,Sparkman 2014 Apparition White Wine White (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Complex and well balanced, this elegant dry, barrel-fermented sparkling wine has light white-cherry aromas, crisp fruit flavors with a touch of buttery richness, and a tangy, citrus finish. Quite dry and classic in style, it will get more interesting with age; it will be best to drink after 2019.",91,Schramsberg 2011 Brut Sparkling (Marin County),,,,
"Ripe berry aromas approach raisiny, but settle on jammy plum and leather. This is tannic and wide, with ruggedness to the mouthfeel. Flavors of earthy berry, baked fruits and cocoa end with grab, heat and burn. This is good but rough, like a gravel road.",86,Emina 2010 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"Aromas of underbrush, menthol, dark fruit, violet and a note of exotic spice take shape in the glass. The chewy palate delivers ripe cherry, pomegranate, white pepper, herb and a truffle note while fine-grained tannins provide support and polish.",92,Giuseppe Cortese 2013 Rabajà  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Made in a more extracted, fuller style, this is overwhelmingly earthy and intensely aromatic. Its time in oak has not quite shaken off entirely, and its fruit expression veers on the darker side, with notes of black cherries and blueberries standing out the most. An herbal aura lingers around.",88,Phillips Hill 2010 Oppenlander Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino),,,,
"This is a quintessential Franciacorta, featuring lovely aromas of pressed white flowers and citrus. The round, creamy palate boasts flavors of ripe pear and apple with hints of walnut. The nervous acidity will keep this youthful and fresh for several more years.",94,Fratelli Berlucchi 2006 Brut Riserva Casa delle Colonne Special Cru Sparkling (Franciacorta),,,,
Ripe yellow stone fruit and a floral whiff of pressed Spanish broom lead the nose while the bright round palate offers mature yellow pear and orange zest. It closes on a note of bitter almond.,87,Tenuta La Vigna 2015  Vernaccia di San Gimignano,,,,
"An exotic Chardonnay, this is reminiscent of a Rhône white wine, with its honeysuckle, mineral, apricot, tangerine and sautéed banana flavors. It's certainly savory. Don't drink it too cold.",88,Stark 2009 Windsor Oaks Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"An awesome Chardonnay that gives everything you want in richness, yet frames it in a structural integrity rare in California. Dazzles with tropical fruit, green apple and pear flavors, with a brilliant overlay of oak that adds buttered toast and spice flavors, not to mention sturdy oak tannins. But it's the zesty acidity, like a squirt of lime juice, that really elevates this wine.",95,Paul Hobbs 2008 Ulises Valdez Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Vines in deep red-iron soil on this tiny biodynamic family parcel (1.3 acres) are just coming into their own. This ripe wine balances rich yellow fruit with a tight shot of acidity and citrus. Fresh and crisp with touches of spice and butter., it is ready to drink.",88,Bret Brothers 2014 Domaine La Soufrandière Climat les Longeays  (Pouilly-Vinzelles),,,,
Organically grown grapes are the source of this wine that comes from selected parcels on the Domaine de Rochoy. Flint soil gives a strongly mineral character that permeates the wine. The tight and steely texture contrasts happily with the sliced apple and lemon flavors. It needs to age for several more months. Drink from late 2017.,93,Domaine Laporte 2014 Le Grand Rochoy  (Sancerre),,,,
"This was fermented with 50% whole clusters, which slows down and evens up the process. Along with rich flavors of black raspberry fruit, it's dense with savory herbs and marvelous details of earth and forest floor. Delicious now, but just wait until 2020–2022!",95,Maison Bleue 2011 Boushey Vineyard Le Midi Grenache (Yakima Valley),,,,
"There are still some rough edges here: hints of volatility, burnt wood notes and unintegrated barrel flavors. But there is substantial red fruit at the core, and it's got plenty of punch and power to stand up to a smoky barbequed meal.",86,Delfino 2014 Tempranillo (Umpqua Valley),,,,
"Supple and easy to drink, this cherry-fruited wine easily carries its veneer of toasty, caramelly oak. This would be a great restaurant Pinot; versatile with food and in absolutely no need of cellaring.",86,Barefoot Cellars 1998 Reserve Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),,,,
"The Négrette grape, found almost exclusively in the Fronton appellation near Toulouse, has produced a firm, wood-aged, ripe wine that's packed with attractive juicy red fruits, spice and acidity. The wine has a more serious side, with tannins that will allow it to age. Drink from 2016.",91,Château Bouissel 2012 La Guillotte Negrette (Fronton),,,,
"This wine should be Cesarini Sforza's crown jewel, but this sparkling riserva has a fragrance dominated by oak and vanilla. The palate is aggressively sparkling and shows vanilla, oak and Golden Delicious apple flavors.",87,Cesarini Sforza 2005 Riserva Aquila Reale Chardonnay (Trento),,,,
"There is a lovely balance to this Viognier, and a sense that these cool-climate grapes were not pushed too far. The winemaker, happily, chose to make the wine that the vineyard gave her. Delicate and layered, with paper-thin suggestions of citrus rind, grapefruit and white peach. Still tightly knit, this wine very slowly unwinds long after you've swallowed that first sip or two.",89,Nefarious 2009 Defiance Vineyard Viognier (Lake Chelan),,,,
"Neutral up front except for green apple and mineral aromas. Feels quite good and healthy, with juicy acids pushing fresh bell pepper, lime and white peach flavors. Short but fresh and citrusy on the finish.",88,Chilcas 2011 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"There is a fine combination of lightness and richness in this wine. The lightness comes from its fresh, crisp green flavors. The richness comes from the concentration, the flavor going deep down into the taut palate, acidity, mouth-filling green plums and spice. Screwcap.",87,Högl 2007 Ried Schön Viessling Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),,,,
"This blend of Pommard, Coury and Dijon 667 clones shows bright cherry fruit, bedecked with lovely spices. It's round and forward, with medium weight and depth.",90,Torii Mor 2013 Olson Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),,,,
"Spunky and sweet smelling, with a touch of stemmy pepper to the nose. The palate is narrow but fruity, with your standard allotment of zesty red fruit flavors along with mellow spice. Finishes short, with drying tannins. Good but lacks nuance and sophistication.",86,Quintay 2008 Clava Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"This is Marc Mondavi's project, a nod to his side job as a water witch much in demand. A light-hearted take on the variety, it holds small percentages of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petite Sirah. Basic tenets of cherry and cola-vanilla star in this approachable sipper with soft tannins.",85,The Divining Rod 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"The Pio Cesare starts well; a fat opulent nose of rich fruit mixed with a strong mocha character. It is also big on the palate; plummy and powerful, with good acidity. Towards the end, however, the wine runs out of steam, and it finishes somewhat abruptly and with a slight sourness.",85,Pio Cesare 2004 Fides  (Barbera d'Alba),,,,
"With 39% Petit Verdot, this is a rarity in Bordeaux. It is certainly reflected in the dark color of the wine. It has spice and a densely concentrated structure, firm and chunky. There are the Bordeaux tannins and the acidity of 2008, filled out with a bitter chocolate and black berry character.",88,Château Bolaire 2008  Bordeaux Supérieur,,,,
"This edition of the Spinner is 50% Merlot, 37% Syrah and 13% Malbec. It's scented with leaf and raisin, streaked with smoke and baking spices, and offers up a medium-bodied midpalate with a mix of black cherry, currants and pomegranate. Fine for near-term drinking.",87,Nefarious 2008 The Spinner Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This intense and rich wine has also managed to keep a great sense of balance. The black fruits emerge from the firm tannins, bringing with them juicy acidity and a dusty texture. The wine is still young, but it's developing well to emerge ripe and delicious by 2016.",92,Clos Troteligotte 2012 K-or Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"Machiavelli's “The Prince” is an innovative super Tuscan blend with Sangiovese, Pinot Nero and Cabernet that is fruity and fresh but with excellent power and intensity. The nose is redolent of small berries and exotic spice and the dry finish is long and satisfying.",88,Machiavelli 2004 Il Principe Red (Toscana),,,,
"Aromas of toasted oak, espresso, underbrush and a balsamic note take shape in the glass. The fresh firm palate shows dried sour cherry, cranberry, roasted coffee bean and a hint of star anise set against close-grained tannins that grip the finish.",90,Castello Romitorio 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"On one of the many steep slopes above Nuits Saint-Georges, this vineyard produces wines with much of the classic structure of the appellation. This is rich, full of firm tannins and with a solid structure and future. Blackberry flavors are dark and intense and the wine needs time. Drink from 2019.",92,Domaine Chevillon-Chezeaux 2014 Les Bousselots Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),,,,
"Under the same ownership as Château la Dominique in Saint-Emilion, this estate continues to make impressive wine. With its subtle tannins and ripe berry fruits, it is structured while never letting the tannins overwhelm the fruit. It is an impressive wine to age, so drink from 2021.",91,Château Clément-Pichon 2014  Haut-Médoc,,,,
"If you like your Chardonnay on the fruity side, this one's for you. It's rich in pineapple, orange and apricot jam flavors, with notes of buttered toast and cream.",85,HandCraft 2011 Artisan Collection Chardonnay (California),,,,
"Dusty vanilla and melon aromas come across as lightly candied. This feels regular, with plumpness but nothing heavy to deal with. Flavors of pear and melon come with a green note, while the finish tastes like papaya.",85,Bodegas Muriel 2012 Blanco Vendimia Seleccionada White (Rioja),,,,
"Bigode, meaning the mustache, is fruity, fresh and light in texture. The juicy character needs another few months to integrate fully with the berry fruits. Spice adds interest. It will be better by the end of 2014.",85,DFJ Vinhos 2012 Bigode Red (Lisboa),,,,
"A solid and chunky wine, this balances a rich structure with ripe, rounded fruit. Acidity cuts through the complex texture to give a juicy, fragrant feel. It's worth aging another year.",91,Georges Duboeuf 2009 Cuvée Prestige  (Morgon),,,,
"This blend of 50% Mourvèdre, 25% Syrah, 20% Grenache and 5% Counoise shows blackberry, rose petal, hibiscus and Dr. Pepper spice touches on the nose. There's decent structure to the palate, where blueberry notes meet tarry elements and a touch of charred meat.",90,Lone Madrone 2014 Oveja Negra Red (Paso Robles Willow Creek District),,,,
"A sweet wine, but lively, touched by honey, its acidity coming through as delicious final fruit and spice.",90,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2009 Herrenweg de Turckheim Vieilles Vignes Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
The nose is very shy: a mere hint of earthiness emanates. The slender palate shows very clean fruit of yellow apple residing on a slender lemony palate. This is fresh and sprightly with a dry finish. Drink soon.,89,Domaine Charles Baur 2015 Pinot Blanc (Alsace),,,,
"Earthy and stemmy in dark black fruit, this wine contains 2% Syrah from Dunnigan Hills, though it's unclear how that contributes. Thin on the palate, it has a medicinal, minty flourish on the finish.",83,Mossback 2013 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Minty sage and cedar dot the aromatic profile of this wine that is holding on to tannin and oak with a fierce stubbornness. Tart cherry, pomegranate and blueberry give it a fruity mélange, accented by subtle rose petal and violet.",86,El Lugar 2013 Hawk's Roost Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This Graves estate has vines in nearby Sauternes where it has produced this honey and orange-flavored wine. It is light and fresh while still having a wonderful sweet and dry character. The acidity at the end is delicious. Drink now for its fruit, although the wine will age at least until 2025.",89,Château Lapinesse 2013  Sauternes,,,,
"Whole berry fermented and aged seven months in neutral oak, it shows appealing notes of dried herbs, raspberry and cherry. The palate is fruit focused with a abundant sweet raspberry flavors that linger on the finish.",90,Savage Grace 2013 Copeland Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Rattlesnake Hills),,,,
"Intense but refined flavors include exotic fruit, juicy white peach, Bartlett pear and citrus accented with nutmeg and mineral notes. It's balanced with crisp acidity that generates a clean, refreshing finish.",90,Castelfeder 2012 Lahn Kerner (Vigneti delle Dolomiti),,,,
"Here you'll find a supple melding of red fruit flavors that are accented by a mocha note. The Red Mountain minerality is found in the muscular frame, which resolves into astringent, delicately chalky tannins.",92,Cadence 2009 Ciel du Cheval Red (Red Mountain),,,,
This Nero d'Avola opens with a bright note of forest berry or bramble and continues with solid consistency and plush density. The tannins are polished and tight and the wine would pair with roasted chicken or pork.,87,Ceuso 2007 Scurati Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),,,,
"This is a gorgeous Italian white (made with Pinot Bianco grapes) that shows promising food pairing potential thanks to its silky, creamy mouthfeel and non-intrusive aromas. The wine offers a steady flow of stone fruit, melon and honey-like flavors.",90,Nals Margreid 2010 Penon Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige),,,,
"Rich, sweet-tasting flavors of black cherry jam, licorice and cedar abound in this dry, tannic Merlot. It feels a bit rough on the palate, so let it breathe in a decanter before drinking.",85,Elements 2010 Merlot (Sonoma County),,,,
"A big Pinot Noir, rich and extracted, and lacking delicacy at this time. It's as full-bodied as a Rhône blend, with jammy cherry, blueberry and spice flavors, enriched by lots of sweet new oak. Delicious, yes, if you care to drink it now. Try cellaring for four or five years to see if it mellows.",89,Patz & Hall 2009 Hyde Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),,,,
"A 100% varietal, this represents a tiny offering of this single-vineyard wine. Despite its youth it is silky and supple on the palate. Rich, dense black fruit and graphite marry well and find cohesion among the toasty oak.",91,Envy 2012 Fortuna Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),,,,
"The von Kesselstatt estate released four GG bottlings in 2009, and this wine was perhaps the least of them. It's very good nonetheless, with fresh, slightly floral aromas and bold flavors of baked apple and orange zest. There's a chunkiness in the mouth and a slight coarseness of texture compared to the others, but that's splitting hairs.",88,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt 2009 Kaseler Nies'chen Trocken GG Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Cabernet Franc, this nonvintage wine displays aromas of vanilla, green pepper, woodspice and herbs. The sweet chocolate and cherry flavors are accented by light meaty notes.",85,Jacob Williams NV Sadie Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Crognolo is a warm and sunny super Tuscan with bursting notes of cherry, earth, spice, herbs and leather. The aromas are pristine and clean and the wine seems to emphasize elegance and harmony over intensity and penetration, closing with bright freshness and cherry cola flavors.",91,Tenuta Sette Ponti 2005 Crognolo Red (Toscana),,,,
"Medium in build, with soft, approachable layers of texture and tannin, this wine is big on blackberry and black olive, blending the sweet and savory successfully. It builds tension as it goes, finishing with a taste of smoky leather.",87,Franciscan 2012 Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"Deeply saturated with blackberry and plum flavors, this powerful, boldly structured Merlot balances rich fruit with complex shades of earth and mineral. Umami-rich whiffs of soy sauce and hay linger from nose to finish, hinting towards its development. It's pleasant now, but should meld considerably through 2019.",89,"Wölffer 2010 Lombardo Merlot (The Hamptons, Long Island)",,,,
"Loads of aromatic intensity comes through on the bouquet with lovely layers of ripe cherry, spice, mesquite wood, Indian spice and cola. The oak element is evident here and will integrate with a bit more time in the bottle. In the mouth, this rich, ruby-colored wine offers jammy fruit and soft, velvety texture.",88,Domìni Veneti 2006 Verjago  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore),,,,
"This wine starts off with an assertive aroma of brambly berry, followed shortly after by touches of warm compote and sweet spice. The tannins are structured but fine, lending support to the otherwise round palate brimming with fleshy dark-cherry and black-plum flavors. 100 cases imported; enjoy now–2017.",89,Flam 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Galilee),,,,
"Dry and simple, with pleasant herb, raspberry tea and spice flavors. A little soft and sweet, but okay for everyday fare.",84,Loomis 2008 Ember Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Peach and melon aromas are fresh and clean. This is crisp but a touch flat and boxed in as far as mouthfeel is concerned. Citrus, papaya and nectarine flavors end short but perfectly clean.",89,Morgadío 2014 Legado del Conde Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"Closed aromatically, this Chardonnay has a lemon-lime crispness that follows straight into vanilla and toasty oak. Young, it finishes on a sour note.",83,Jason-Stephens 2012 Estate Select Chardonnay (Santa Clara Valley),,,,
"A spicy wine, this is full of dark fruits and great perfumes. Tannins are integrated into the concentrated fruits and stylish structure. The wine could be drunk, but this style of LBV will be better after a couple of years in bottle. Drink from 2017.",90,Duorum 2010 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),,,,
"This garnet colored Bulgarian Cabernet Sauvignon has aromas of dark cherry and mocha with flavors of cherry cola, black raspberry and black cherry with a smooth silky tannic finish.",89,Minkov Brothers 2013 Tradition Since 1875 Cabernet Sauvignon (Thracian Valley),,,,
"Lithe and dancing in texture, yet robustly concentrated with yellow peach and cherry flavors, Red Newt's Circle delivers great quality for a gentle price, vintage after vintage. Off dry in style, it's zesty and bright, finishing long with a fresh herbal edge.",90,Red Newt Cellars 2013 Circle Riesling (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Dry, acidic and watery, with a suggestion of lemon and lime fruit.",81,Lockwood 2008 Chardonnay (Monterey),,,,
"The aromas are forward, with notes of black currant, blue fruit, herb and spice. The palate delivers a mouthful of sweet blue-fruit flavors, with the oak dialed back. Lightly dry tannins provide support. It's hard to necessarily place it as Cabernet but it brings plenty of appeal.",88,Charles Smith 2015 Chateau Smith Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington),,,,
"A wine that relishes its juicy fruit and acidity. The tannins, by contrast, are light. Close to Macau, south of Margaux, Gironville is in a fresh, black currant-fruit style, not for aging.",86,Château de Gironville 2008  Haut-Médoc,,,,
"Eucalyptus aromas add to the ripe fruit in this wine to give both structure and fine potential. With its black plum flavors, rich texture and warm character, it's impressive and ready to age. Drink from 2020.",91,Château Gauthier 2015  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,,,,
"This is a blend of three vineyard sites important in other designated bottlings: Cider Ridge, Burnside and Sexton. Floral, with a pretty nose, it opens in spicy clove with a meaty texture, ultimately showing as dark, brooding and savory, as spicy in white pepper as driven by acidity. It has tannin and weight, yet remains fresh and lively in the glass.",92,Balletto 2014 18 Barrel Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Citrus and floral aromas are mild. This blend of Viura and Chardonnay feels round and chunky, but hardly stocky. Bland flavors of orange and grapefruit fall off on the finish.",84,Las Valles 2014 Viura-Chardonnay (Cariñena),,,,
"Sultry spice lurks beneath the powdery scent of citrus peel. The palate offers the same intrigue and has welcome freshness, with a touch of oily charm and a dry, clean finish on which the indefinable but undeniable spice still lingers.",88,Domaine Gresser 2014 Kritt Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"This Rhône white blend is fruity, slightly sweet and simple. It has jammy flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes, honeysuckle and vanilla, offset by crisp acidity.",85,Sunbox Eleven 2008 The Maverick Alder Springs Vineyard White (Mendocino),,,,
"This rich, wood-aged wine has ripe plum fruits and dark tannins. It's still young, but it has a concentrated profile that's full bodied and dense. The fruity aftertaste is well integrated with the tannins. Drink from 2016.",88,Château Ramage la Batisse 2012 L'Enclos de Ramage  (Haut-Médoc),,,,
"The cave cooperative in Tavel is the largest producer in the appellation, so it's reassuring that so many of its cuvées scored highly in this year's tastings. Cinnamon and clove notes accent vibrant red berries and citrus in this medium- to full-bodied wine that's long, intense and crisp on the finish.",91,Les Vignerons de Tavel 2016 Le Chant du Soleil  (Tavel),,,,
"This shows greater complexity than most rosés, with hints of leather and spice layered over cherry fruit. It's round in the mouth and rich in weight without beng heavy or warm. The spice-driven finish lingers a long time. Drink now and over the next year.",90,E. Guigal 2010  Tavel,,,,
"Aromas of sour berry, blue flower and leather emerge on this medium-bodied red. The palate is raw and lean, showing unripe cherry, sage and grainy, aggressive tannins that segue into an astringent finish.",86,Borgogno F.lli Serio e Battista 2013  Barolo,,,,
"The highly sought-after, perennially beautiful and brawny Hillside Select is 100% estate grown and 100% varietal. It wows after three years in barrel, painting a lush picture of tobacco, tea and firm, integrated tannin dusted in smoky clove scents. Intensely peppery, its youthful blackberry and cherry flavors shine through but will benefit from even more time in bottle, through 2032.",98,Shafer 2012 Hillside Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),,,,
"This Brunello shows elegant aromatic restraint in its tight aromas of wild berry and red currant. Dark flavors of barbecue spice, cured meat, leather and tobacco layer the midpalate, then turn fine and full on the finish.",89,Le Gode 2007  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Rich red cherry, plum and raspberry tones lead the nose of this fruit-forward wine, with hints of cocoa and cola spice dancing in the background. Those notes follow through to the satiny palate, framed by soft tannins that lead into a solid, medium-length finish.",87,La Forge Estate 2015 Pinot Noir (Pays d'Oc),,,,
"Aromas of oak, toast and espresso dominate the nose. It's lean, with raw red berry, toast, and coffee alongside dry, angular tannins but not much fruit richness.",86,Tenuta di Aglaea 2010 N Anticchia Rosso  (Etna),,,,
"Young and vibrant, but also medicinal and gangly. Dark as night and all black fruit on the palate, but also tannic, grabby and rubbery. Toasted on the finish, which simmers just short of being fiery.",84,Vallobera 2007 Pago Malarina  (Rioja),,,,
"From a Grand Cru estate, this second wine shows the same rich fruit and generous structure as the winery's first wine. It's just softer with an approachable character and generous black fruits that will enable it to mature relatively quickly. Drink from 2020.",89,Château de Pressac 2014 Les Terrasses de Pressac  (Saint-Émilion),,,,
"Amarone Ambrosan opens with lovely tones of plush fruit and savory spice followed by plum cake, cinnamon and sweet bread. This is a deeply layered wine with soft tannins and a blast of bright red cherry on the close. Very nice.",93,Nicolis 2005 Ambrosan  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),,,,
"Full, forward, fleshy nose shows lots of bright, spicy fruit. Unlike a lot of lower cost Zins, this wine has a lot of sweet fruit, and enough body and weight to carry through past the nose into a big, satisfying finish. Nice toast, plenty of acid, a bit hot in the finish.",87,Shooting Star 1998 Zinfandel (Lake County),,,,
"The smooth oak aging is a major element in the success of this elegant wine. While it has rich, polished black fruits and a strong tannic core, it also has a licorice character. It is now maturing, ready to drink as a serious, complex wine.",92,Monte Seis Reis 2007 Reserva Red (Alentejano),,,,
"Soft, ripe, dominated by peaches, pears and a rounded, toasty character. The spice is dominant, giving the wine an exotic edge. The more rounded style gives concentration as well as a fine, finishing velvet texture.",86,Château Tour de Mirambeau 2006  Bordeaux Blanc,,,,
"Coffee grinds, raisin and baked aromas suggest overripeness. This is heavy, broad and a bit clumsy on the palate. Berry and prune flavors are solid but not overly fresh, while the finish is full and raisiny as it improves over time.",87,Jaspi 2011 Negre Red (Montsant),,,,
"This Brunello opens with floral notes of pressed red rose and clay soil. Bright fruit, blackberry, leather and tobacco aromas are framed by firm tannins.",92,La Fornace 2006 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"Despite some tough tannins on the finish, this is an intriguingly complex wine that may prove even better than this rating suggests. It starts with a garrigue note and a hint of tapenade, then adds bright cherry fruit and plenty of dusty tannins. Drink 2014–2020.",88,André Brunel 2009 Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),,,,
"Hailing from Phinny Hill, Two Blondes, Bacchus, Dionysus, Octave, Loess, and Old Stones vineyards, this Cabernet Sauvignon prototype brings aromas of fresh herb, dusty earth, cherry and raspberry, displaying an electric sense of purity. The flavors are elegant and layered showing an exquisite sense of oak and tannin integration. Far from a big bruiser, this is a thinking person's Cabernet that lingers and lingers.",92,Gramercy 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Herbal aromas of tobacco and grass are light and spicy, reminiscent of Cabernet Sauvignon. A rubbery pinchy palate improves with airing, while this tastes of roasted black fruits and tomato. Herbal peppery chocolaty flavors are nice on the finish.",87,Bocopa 2015 Laudum Barrica Especial Monastrell (Alicante),,,,
"Made in an exotic style, this Zin is ultra-concentrated in fruit and rich in tannins, in the way of a Howell Mountain red wine. It's complex in spicy currants, Dr. Pepper, Tabasco, chocolate and anise. A little soft in acidity, but should mellow out for years.",88,Work 2004 Zinfandel (Howell Mountain),,,,
"A wonderfully complete wine, with all the elements in place. It is ripe and powerful, the black fruits jammy and rich. But at the same time, the layer of acidity, the dark tannins and the succulent texture all come together in a finely balanced way. It is almost exotic, but the tannins promise good potential for aging.",96,Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair 2005  La Romanée,,,,
"This bottling from a winery that uses both the highest of technology and most old school of techniques is incredibly subtle at first, but then come waves of mace, mulberry, forest floor and dried shiitake aromas. The palate starts with sharper herbs and spice, from thyme to nutmeg and allspice, and then the purple flower flavors explode like a bouquet in the mouth. Elderflower touches fly into the finish.",96,Clos de la Tech 2012 Domaine Du Docteur Rodgers Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"This Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon blend opens with blueberry and currant aromas that hint at the exotic. A flush racy palate is high in acid and a touch abrasive. Plum and currant flavors are not what you'd call cushioned, while this ends with hard edgy tannins and a reprise of scouring acidity. In terms of aging, this will last a long time. Drink through 2027.",91,Tikal 2014 Jubilo Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon (Uco Valley),,,,
"Deep, dense and penetrating on the nose with the power of graphite, blackberry and mocha aromas, La Nieta is a wide-awake, bright wine that's chomping at the bit to get out of the bottle and run. Coffee, mocha and blackberry aromas are oaky for sure, with toast, vanilla and creamy notes driving a long finish. Drink through 2026.",94,Viñedos de Paganos 2011 La Nieta  (Rioja),,,,
"This blend of Tempranillo, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Garnacha is gamy on the nose, with aromas of tomato leaf, compost and cherry-pie filling. The palate is decidedly acidic, while flavors of zesty red fruits like red currant and sour plum come across herbal and a touch weedy.",84,Pago de Larrainzar 2008 Raso de Larrainzar Red (Navarra),,,,
"This is a very good wine, albeit with some coarseness to the tannins at this time. It's also a little earthy and mushroomy. But there's a solid core of black cherry, red currant, mocha and tangerine zest flavors. The vineyard is near Sanford & Benedict, whose Pinots require time to come around. This young wine should do interesting things.",89,Alma Rosa 2006 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"This classically coastal wine, influenced by wind and fog, is light bodied and buoyant in acidity, perfumed by clove, cola and cherry. The oak is present, while integrated, providing a thickness of texture that should mellow in time.",88,Flanagan 2014 Sonoma Stage Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"A 50-50 split of the two varieties, there's a lot to like in this wine, from its opening steely aromas to its surprisingly robust body of apricot and pineapple, with a crisp floral aspect keeping it balanced on the palate. A curious suggestion of marshmallow closes things out.",89,Rally Point Wines 2013 Limited Production Marsanne-Roussanne (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"Roccato is a blend of 50% Sangiovese and 50% Cabernet Sauvignon that's packed with aromas of blackberry, leather, tobacco and chocolate. It's velvety and rich, with a delicious touch of cherry and cinnamon on the long finish.",92,Rocca delle Macìe 2009 Roccato Red (Toscana),,,,
"A blend of Syrah and Sangiovese, this salmon-colored wine opens with aromas of peach blossom and honeysuckle. The palate doles out juicy red cherry, nectarine, pink grapefruit and a hint of Mediterranean herb alongside zesty acidity.",88,Mazzei 2013 Belguardo Red (Toscana),,,,
"Aromas of smoke, bacon, mature black-skinned fruit and allspice waft out of the glass. The aromas follow through to the dense, monolithic palate, along with oak extract, vanilla, and a confectionary note.",87,Alessandro di Camporeale 2011 Kaid Syrah (Sicilia),,,,
"This is a warm, rich wine. Its fruit is muted at this stage although there's potential in the good acidity and smooth, juicy texture. Let it open out more and drink from 2018.",87,Pierre-Yves et Olivier Fichet 2016 Château London  (Mâcon),,,,
"In addition to the blackberry base, minty herbs, leather and turned loam on the nose, this bottling offers a strong woody character, with cedar, sandalwood and pine needle aromas. The very dry black-currant fruit is awash in flavors of dill, savory black pepper and black olive. Tannins are sticky but not overly aggressive.",92,Joyce 2013 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Carmel Valley),,,,
"Fresh aromas of white gumdrop, quince and peach precede a peachy, citrusy palate. Dry citrus flavors persist on a clean finish. This is a fresh Chardonnay where less is more.",87,Alfredo Roca 2016 Fincas Chardonnay (Mendoza),,,,
"Restrained both aromatically and on the palate, this Riesling offers modest hints of green apple and pear combined with a slightly herbal note. There's not a lot of complexity or concentration, but it's a brisk, refreshing wine.",82,Hunt Country Vineyards 2009 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This has a charming nose that boasts rose, violet and red berry while the juicy, easy-drinking palate offers ripe wild cherry, chopped mint, white pepper and a hint of star anise. There isn't much complexity but it is savory and balanced, with fresh acidity and supple tannins.",90,Casina di Cornia 2012  Chianti Classico,,,,
"Light cherry and mild sulfuric aromas are standard fare for this class of wine, while the palate is snappy and fresh, with sweet-and-sour cherry and strawberry flavors. Finishes a little gritty and candied, but pleasant enough overall.",84,Don Ramón 2006 Tinto Barrica Red (Campo de Borja),,,,
"Here's a simple, slightly sweet sipping wine with plump red fruit, blueberry and cherry. The wine has nice density and tart flavors of sour cherry. It would work well with easy, stay-home meals.",85,Tiamo 2007 Sangiovese (Puglia),,,,
"Dense and one-dimensional, this opens with faint aromas of raisin, leather and a whiff of spice. The evolved palate offers stewed plum, a green note of unripe cherry, powdered sage and a hint of licorice. Raspy tannins create an abrupt, astringent finish.",86,Il Cavalierino 2011  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,,,,
"Winemaker Karen Cakebread has coaxed high-toned highlights of cherry, strawberry and currant from an underlying richness of baked bread and wild earth. Tingling acidity makes for a succulent palate and impressively long finish.",92,Ziata 2012 Chenoweth Vineyard Pinot Noir (Green Valley),,,,
"A common but drinkable Pinot Noir. It's dry and silky, with a rough mouthfeel framing cherry and herb flavors. From Testarossa.",84,Dahlia 2008 Pinot Noir (Monterey County),,,,
"Rich and seductive aromas of black cherry, vanilla-laced fudge, rendered animal fat and chopped dill entice the nose on this bottling. The palate is juicy with blackberry, black cherry and just-pulled espresso, but rather lean and quite restrained, with expert measures of acidity and tannins.",92,Pear Valley 2010 Estate Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"The wonderful old-gold color of this tawny leads into a generous, rich wine that has retained fruits while also showing a woody character that is typical of wines this old. With spice, dried raisins and intense acidity, it is a beautiful wine that deserves to be drunk just by itself.",94,Ramos-Pinto NV RP30 Tawny 30 Years  (Port),,,,
"Here's a light and fragrant Sangiovese from Molise with delicate aromas of forest berry, white cherry and violet. The wine has light concentration and very fruity flavors with soft texture and an easy approach overall.",86,Borgo di Colloredo 2006 Sangiovese (Terra degli Osci),,,,
"This wine has aromas like toasted oak and baking spices, plus flavors like rich blackberry and boysenberry jam. It's also nicely dry and has a good gripping layer of tannin in the texture.",89,The Federalist 2014 Zinfandel (Lodi),,,,
"Cowaramup is a Margaret River subregion. A herbal note adds interest to the aromas, and some lifted red fruit sets this wine apart from Cherubino's other 2010 Cabernets. Otherwise, it's pretty similar in its lavish oaking and meaty, savory flavors, but with a bright, mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2020.",93,Cherubino 2010 Cowaramup Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River),,,,
"This is easy to recognize thanks to its distinctive intensity and opulence. This 2007 may be the best bottling yet. It oozes with sweet flavors of cardamom, cinnamon, crushed clove, nutmeg and all kinds of ripe berry fruit. There's a firm tannic bite on the finish, which is followed by long-lasting succulent sweetness.",92,Tedeschi 2007 Capitel Monte Olmi  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),,,,
"Huge and rich, this offers ripe black fruits and a concentrated structure. It's packed with a seemingly sweet blackberry flavor that serves as a counterpoint to the firm texture. With both density and a dark edge, this will age over several years.",92,Companhia das Quintas 2009 Quinta da Fronteira Selecção do Enólogo Red (Douro),,,,
"This sweet sparkler presents a cheerful and informal side of the fragrant Moscato grape. It bursts open with aromas of rose, jasmine and sweet honey. The soft bubbling is creamy and smooth.",83,Astoria NV Salvatore Principe Mi Amore Moscato (Italy),,,,
"Dusty, earthy mineral tones blow off to reveal layers of fresh flowers and apples on this curious, subtly complex Riesling. Dry in style, it's brisk with acidity, but maintains a deep vein of peach and apricot flavor that penetrates through the finish.",89,Silver Thread 2013 Doyle East Seneca Vineyard Riesling (Seneca Lake),,,,
"Bright fruity plum and raspberry aromas are typical of this wine. The palate is a bit rough and abrasive, while flavors of salty plum and chocolate are punchy prior to a solid but basic finish.",86,Borsao 2015 Garnacha (Campo de Borja),,,,
"Gentle hints of fragrant orange and soft hints of ripe mandarin grace the nose and palate. Despite all the precision, there is a gentleness to the way these heady citrus flavors are expressed. The palate adds ample lemon freshness, a slender body and a clean finish.",91,Brandl 2015 Kogelberg Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),,,,
"Dense and complex, with plum and black licorice notes upfront, followed by cherry and peat moss in the mouth. Gripping tannins and intense mineral notes are cut a bit short by warm alcohol on the finish. Nevertheless, an impressive effort. Drink now to 2010.",87,Domaine de Saint-Antoine 2006 Merlot (Vin de Pays d'Oc),,,,
"One of Altocedro's better efforts starts with meaty, ripe, chunky black fruit aromas and a wave of mocha, cocoa and berry syrup. It's a creamy specimen but has enough acidity and vitality to not run flat. Mocha, carob and plum extend through the finish. Drink now.",89,Altocedro 2007 Reserva Malbec (La Consulta),,,,
"A beautiful Chardonnay, rich and ripe in fruit, yet balanced with dryness and racy acidity and a fine minerality. The pineapple and orange flavors are accented with sweet, smoky oak. Drink this luxuriously elegant wine now.",93,Lynmar 2008 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"The Shea is a bit of an anomaly at 13.7% in a vintage where the other Ken Wright Pinots float around the 12–12.5% mark. Not surprisingly, the fruit is thicker and the midpalate more full and broad, with pleasing cherry-berry flavors framed in chocolaty oak. Though not as aromatically complex as its companions, it offers plenty of rich fruit flavor.",90,Ken Wright 2010 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir,,,,
"A dense, firm selection, this has layers of red fruits and acids that help to give the wine's skeleton some flesh. This is likely to develop into a rich, but always firm, wine.",88,Louis Jadot 2010  Pommard,,,,
"Liquid smoke, brimstone, tar, asphalt, licorice and mesquite follow dense aromas of black cherry, dried currants and mature plums. The wine is on the ripe, chewy side but ultimately finds balance thanks to its naturally firm tannins and fruity freshness.",90,Camigliano 2004  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Here's a very rich and intense expression of Barbera d'Alba with aromas of black fruit, toasted nut, vanilla bean, espresso and cherry cola. It's a modern, smooth wine that would pair with lasagna or rolled pork with prune.",88,Pelassa 2007 San Pancrazio  (Barbera d'Alba),,,,
"Smoky cinnamon dominates the nose, on the palate where notes of red currant and cranberry become apparent. The palate is tightly gathered in its finely constructed, tannic frame. Time in glass reveals riper cherry fruit at the heart. In two to three years it will mellow and show its true aromatic colors. The substance is evident now, but the aromas bid you to wait. Ready from 2016.",90,Bründlmayer 2011 Reserve Pinot Noir (Niederösterreich),,,,
"Red currant, vanilla, toasted oak, coffee and chocolate aromas lead the nose and follow through to the dense, full-bodied palate. It's one-dimensional but muscular, with ample, velvety tannins.",88,Petra 2012 Quercegobbe Merlot (Toscana),,,,
"This organic wine was made without added preservatives. After swampy aromas, the flavors are nicely fruity and herbaceous, with a light-medium body and a clean finish.",83,Our Daily Red 2014 Red (California),,,,
"From 41-year-old vines on just over five estate acres, this is resiny and briny on the nose. A honey-laced creaminess at the core is tensely accentuated by vibrant acidity. Balanced and elegant, with a sunny bite of ripeness, it revels in nuances of fresh and dried apricot while lighter notes of lemon, lime and grapefruit play backup.",93,Smith-Madrone 2013 Estate Bottled Riesling (Spring Mountain District),,,,
"Rich and ultraripe, this is full of yellow fruit, melon and pineapple flavors. Contrasting with this fruitiness are notes of dense wood and spice. It has an elegant structure, with a crisp, citrusy finish.",92,Château de Fuissé 2010 Les Combettes  (Pouilly-Fuissé),,,,
"A concentrated palate of black cherry and wild blueberry combine to give a full-fruited midpalate, with supple tannins and a juicy, moreish freshness. This strikes a convincing balance between rounded richness and refreshing lightness.",89,Prieler 2011 Johanneshöhe Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),,,,
"Intentionally made in a low-alcohol style, this is both a little underripe and a little sweet. Pungent notes of boxwood, white grapefruit and celery leaf don't lack for character or intensity, but the wine finishes short and noticeably sweet.",86,Brancott 2015 Flight Song Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"Dr. Pepper, black plum and poppy-seed aromas show on this bottling by Ken Brown, who planted the first Syrah in Santa Barbara County in 1978. The soft palate offers cola, candied black cherry and violet flavors, lacking many of the gamy qualities found in the region.",89,Ken Brown 2013 Watch Hill Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Ironstone's reserve Cab is getting better and better, the result of attention to detail. The 2005, held back for three years before release, remains a toughly tannic wine, but it's dry, balanced and elegant and contains a rich core of berry-currant fruit. Should develop for the next six years.",90,Ironstone 2005 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sierra Foothills),,,,
"Whiffs of nuts, pollen and earth are savory on the nose, but the palate is full of pristine lemon and tangerine flavors. Zesty and refreshing, it has a touch of honey to soften the finish.",87,Louis Guntrum 2013 Riesling (Germany),,,,
"Black plum, mulberry and a touch of graphite show on the nose of this bottling. Ripe cranberry and pomegranate juice form a tangy fruit base on the palate, enhanced by oregano, cinnamon and, on the finish, some juniper.",86,Irony 2014 Black Pinot Noir (Monterey),,,,
"This wine earns every penny of its modest price tag with a bright palate of petrol, talcum powder and wet stones propping up aromas of white flowers, cumin and lime. The finish could be longer but with this stunning nose and palate, we're not complaining. Drink now.",89,Leasingham 2008 Magnus Riesling (Clare Valley),,,,
This small area in the Loir Valley (north of the Loire) produces fine cool-climate wines. This wine is named after a small parcel of vines on the north bank of the river. It is crisp with a touch of honey and spice as well as aromatic green and white fruits. Drink the wine now.,86,Cave Cooperative du Vendômois 2015 Lieu-dit Cocagne Chenin Blanc (Coteaux du Vendômois),,,,
"Light garnet in color, this wine has a subtle bouquet that is redolent of blue flower, almond paste, tobacco and even citrus. The palate feels tight and crisp.",89,Michele Satta 2007 Cavaliere Sangiovese (Toscana),,,,
"This Chardonnay, Viognier and Vermentino blend from Lebanon starts with aromas of candied allspice, flowers and toast. On the palate, the wine offers soft, subtle flavors of spice, flowers and vanilla. Unusual but approachable—pair with poultry, cheeses.",83,Château Musar 2007 Cuvée Blanc White (Bekaa Valley),,,,
"Raspberry and blackberry fruit, lively spice and a streak of espresso come together in this tasty Syrah. It was fermented with native yeast and spent 23 months in oak. With almost five years of age already, it's drinking well and ready for immediate enjoyment.",89,Schultz 2012 Shepherd Steelhead Run Vineyard Syrah (Rogue Valley),,,,
"This is the entry-level wine from Château Eugénie, and it is delicious. The Malbec is softened with some Merlot, rounding out the wine. It does still preserve the solid structure of Cahors with its dense black fruits and firm tannins.",88,Château Eugénie 2009 Tradition Malbec-Merlot (Cahors),,,,
"Lots of complex flavors in this bone-dry wine, and they range well beyond berry-cherry fruit into more interesting realms of leather, coffee, unsweetened cocoa, bacon, pepper spice and minerals. The wine shows a brisk acidity, and the tannins are intricate. Feels a bit austere and aloof now, withholding its best. Should offer more in 3-5 years, but not much beyond that before the fruit collapses.",89,Sonoma Coast Vineyards 2007 Occidental Road Vineyard Syrah (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Opens with aromas of burnt leaves, roasted bell pepper and tomato and finally secondary red fruit. The palate is saturated but hard, with herbal, leafy, dry red-fruit flavors and a backing of cured meat. Herbal late, with some old-school cherry and tobacco. A tough wine, but at least it's something different.",86,Gordonzello 2007 Peregrino Roble Prieto Picudo (Tierra de León),,,,
"This opens with subtle scents of citrus, pear and white spring flower while the vivacious palate doles out ripe golden apple and a hint of lemon zest. Vigorous bubbles and fresh acidity add brightness.",87,Loredan Gasparini NV Brut Metodo Classico Sparkling (Vino Spumante),,,,
"Rough, green and olive-dominated on the nose. The palate is plump to the point of being weighty, while the flavors are briary and run heavy with olive, green tobacco and green bean. Mild on the finish, with another wave of green olive.",84,Morandé 2009 Reserva Carmenère (Maipo Valley),,,,
"You'll find aromas of menthol, mature plum, cassis and a hint of cedar on this structured blend of 85% Sangiovese and 15% Merlot. On the ripe, round palate, licorice and graphite accent the core of dried black cherry. Fine-grained tannins provide polished support. Drink through 2020.",90,Lornano 2012 Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"The oak is at the fore initially, with aromas of toast, char and exotic spice out in front of green herbs and purple fruit that become more prominent over time. The fruit flavors are sweet and sappy, with abundant toasty and vanilla accents throughout. It delivers enjoyment, but fruit and barrel seem to tussle a bit at times.",89,Silvara 2014 Malbec (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"From a warm vintage, this aromatic offering has notes of candy corn, corn silk, pear and tropical fruit. It's full bodied with sweet fruit flavors that have a creamy feel and lead to a lingering finish.",90,Ryan Patrick 2013 Reserve Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Pouilly-Fumé is often the source of wines for the Sancerre producers. This wine is ripe, full in the mouth with its yellow fruits. There is a spicy character from the oak aging. The wine could age a little longer so drink from 2018.",90,Joseph Mellot 2015 Grande Cuvée des Edvins  (Pouilly-Fumé),,,,
"Sharp, tart and focused, this bright and well-defined wine offers raspberry and black cherry fruit flavors with some bite on the back end. It shows good concentration and length, with the depth and polish to age nicely for a decade or more.",90,Torii Mor 2009 Olalla Vineyard Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),,,,
"This blend of mainly Syrah, with Grenache, is heavy and dull, with candied raspberry-cherry flavors that finish a little sweet.",82,Martin Ray 2007 Dry Rosé (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Flinty and sweaty upfront, with even a hint of onion or garlic. Once past that, things smooth out, with a light to medium weight on the palate and some pleasant melon and citrus notes that linger on the finish.",85,Castell 2009 Schloss Trocken Silvaner (Franken),,,,
"Aromatically a bit dull, this blend of 54% Syrah, 25% Cinsault, 11% Mourvèdre and 10% Grenache is structured, dense and lush, tasting of tar and black fruit.",85,Leonesse Cellars 2008 Melange De Reves Red (Temecula Valley),,,,
"Round fruit flavors meld melon, pears and apricots. Partial barrel fermentation smoothes it all out and adds just a touch of vanilla spice. It's a lovely choice for a Chardonnay alternative that will match appropriately with a variety of food.",88,Quady North 2014 Steelhead Run Vineyard Viognier (Applegate Valley),,,,
"Spicy strawberry and cherry hover over forest floor and a tangle of tangy acidity that keeps this wine fresh and vibrantly compelling. Full bodied and robust, it maintains a balance in the glass, making it both food-friendly and an option on its own.",90,Bougetz 2013 The Cairn Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Young and very much still developing, Sentinel Oak is Terre Rouge's single-vineyard Syrah, a spicy, smoky concoction of great depth, intensity and beauty, concentrated and eager to mature. This wine has a pronounced meaty quality to it, and will pair accordingly, particularly with smoked meat, which will accentuate its own smoky allure.",92,Terre Rouge 2010 Sentinel Oak Vineyard-Pyramid Block Syrah (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),,,,
"A very rich, oaky, dramatic Chardonnay. It's dry and crisp in acidity, showing powerfully ripe pineapple, orange, apricot and honey flavors, enhanced by toasty oak. Brisk acidity makes it clean and vibrant.",93,La Crema 2009 Nine Barrel Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"A mouth-filling red that's dry and chewy in tannins, with a dark berry core surrounded by roasted herbs and earth. Lush on the palate it's in balance and well-made, from a relatively cool growing region near the Sacramento Delta.",87,Urban Legend 2011 Holland Landing Vineyard Tempranillo (Clarksburg),,,,
"Minerality takes center stage in this light-footed but penetrating dry Riesling. While the fruit profile is zesty and green—suggesting tart, under-ripe lime, tangerines and melon rinds—the palate is gilded by slick layers of candlewax and petrol, lending a dense, voluminous mouthfeel. It's an elegant, stately wine to drink now through 2023.",91,Dr. Bürklin-Wolf 2014 Wachenheimer Böhling P.C. Dry Riesling (Pfalz),,,,
"This gorgeous wine, made entirely with Sangiovese, delivers a multifaceted bouquet of blue flowers, ripe plum, black cherry, leather, menthol and clove. The powerful but refined palate doles out layers of juicy black cherry, baking spices, mint, orange zest, anise and tobacco alongside smooth, velvety tannins and surprising freshness for the vintage.",95,Amantis 2007 Riserva  (Montecucco),,,,
"A bit rough and rustic, but packs in plenty of sweet pear-nectar flavors dusted with dried spices.",83,Gaierhof 2001 Pinot Grigio (Trentino),,,,
"From a tiny, seven-acre property in Saint-Estèphe, this is a Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated wine with black currant fruit and good, firm fruit tannins. There is a smoky wood element to balance the lively, youthful acidity.",87,Château Graves de Pez 2009  Saint-Estèphe,,,,
"Lightly aromatic, this ripe full wine is beautifully balanced, poised between crisp citrus acidity and ripe apple and pear flavors. It is zingy, textured and delicious to drink now.",88,Domaine Martin 2016 Les Trois Versants Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),,,,
"Beautiful mountain aromatics of wild flower and Granny Smith apple give this wine a youthful and superfresh personality. The finish is smooth, silky and polished.",87,Girlan 2011 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),,,,
"Inspired by Chinook and Amavi, who also make excellent rosés from Cab Franc, this is quite delicious, round and ripe with mixed cherry and apple fruit flavors. It's on the soft side, very accessible, with beautiful fruit and some delicate spice notes of cinnamon, sandalwood, hints of cotton candy.",89,Trust 2006 Rosé Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A nicely balanced red blend, this is high toned with smooth tannins and dark cherry and plum flavors amid a twist of black licorice. A fine wine for a crowd or easy mid-week drinking.",86,Courtney Benham 2011 Lucca Red (North Coast),,,,
"Pol Roger's excursion into a bone-dry Champagne brings a house style with natural weight up against an almost bony wine style. The resulting mix is certainly dry, edgy, very crisp, leaning towards austere. Extra bottle time would help the wine to gain weight and flesh out the structure.",91,Pol Roger NV Pure Brut Nature  (Champagne),,,,
"A partnership between Ken Forrester and Sonoma County--based winemaker Jesse Katz, this 100% varietal wine comes from a single block of a rocky, hillside site that Katz also sources for his delicious Devil Proof Malbec. Creamy, concentrated waves of vanilla and cherry, with just a hint of almond, open the way to high-toned structure and integrated tannin and oak, finishing balanced and bright.",93,The Bridge 2013 Farrow Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Citrus and peach pit aromas are mild. This is clean but basic on the palate with citrus, nectarine and lime flavors. A clean refreshing finish is a nice way to wrap things up. This is Sauvignon Blanc and Verdejo.",86,Chapter Capítulo 8 2014 White (Almansa),,,,
"This blend of Chardonnay, Nosiola and Pinot Bianco offers up apples and cream on the nose, along with flavors of peach and citrus. It's a comfortable mix of fruit that finishes lively and fresh, making it a fine apéritif.",88,La Vis 2001 Bianco dei Sorni White (Trentino),,,,
"Edwards has worked with this Laguna Ridge site for decades and her intimate understanding of it shows. Rose petals ride a voluptuous texture and concentrated notes of chocolate, caramel and black cherry; it's as savory as it is buoyant and floral. Still holding on to a wealth of tannin and body, it will cellar well despite being delicious and enjoyable today.",95,Merry Edwards 2013 Klopp Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Poised and elegant, this has deliciously restrained fruit that shows green plum flavors and a layer of pepper. To finish this finely balanced wine, there is a layer of fresh acidity. Needs another 3–4 years to develop and round out.",92,Josef Jamek 2006 Ried Liebenberg Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),,,,
"Lush black-fruit and marzipan aromas show notes of tobacco, cedar and leather. This is a ripe, layered Malbec with serious depth and balance as well. Intense currant and berry flavors are spicy and finish with muscular framework and length. Drink through 2019.",92,Bodega Cuarto Dominio 2010 Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"This is a very fine, medium dry wine. It is superbly balanced between honeyed ripeness and tight, bright acidity. Crisp apples dominate the fruit profile of this young wine. That makes it delicious now but the wine is set to age well into a mature wine with great complexity. If you can wait, it will be more mature from 2019.",92,Alexandre Monmousseau 2014 Clos le Vigneau  (Vouvray),,,,
"Subdued red fruit is kept fresh by moderate acidity in this boldly dense and grippy wine rich in violet aromas. Soft, integrated oak adds a spiciness of black pepper and vanilla, while the overall experience is balanced and relatively lean.",90,William Hill Estate 2013 Benchland Series Malbec (Napa Valley),,,,
"There's a clean and polished nature to this pretty Ripasso that delivers aromas of bright red berry, raspberry, cola, leather, tar and a touch of white pepper. It's equally toned and simple in the mouth with good persistency without the chunky consistency.",87,Santi 2007 Solane  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso),,,,
"While the wine has weight, it also has intense mineral structure. It piles the citrus flavors over more notes of apples and apricots, a medley of fruits that are shaped into a firm, concentrated structure. The wine has acidity along with a light toast edge.",90,Alvaro Castro 2011 White (Dão),,,,
"For lovers of the rich and ripe Paso Robles style, this is a high-value wine. Aromas of candied black cherry and vanilla pudding meet with roasted game and crushed gravel on the nose. Vanilla holds strong into the palate, where it blends with blueberry syrup and blackened caramel. Well-measured acidity and chalky tannins complete the experience.",94,Treana 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"This wine was half barrel-fermented, with just 25% of it new and French oak. It benefits from this treatment, offering fruit that leans toward Meyer lemon, melon and a vaguely tropical vibe, remaining balanced throughout, but especially on the finish.",89,Charles Krug 2014 Chardonnay (Carneros-Napa Valley),,,,
"Clean, simple and fresh on the nose, this is showing aromas of lime and apple cider. The palate is creamy and melony more than sharp and acidic, with leesy pear and apple flavors that finish short but bright. Drink now.",87,Shaya 2013 Arindo Verdejo (Rueda),,,,
"A strong spicy meat and smoky aroma adds interest to the mulled boysenberry and blackberry fruit core. Dark fruit flavors continue in the mouth, where licorice, plum sauce, cigar box spice and a touch of black olive also unfold to add depth to the palate. Firm but fine tannins and a long finish seal the deal nicely.",90,Snow Mountain 2009 Syrah (Western Cape),,,,
"The winery went all out on this blend of 50% Syrah, 25% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, giving it three years in 20% new French oak. It's a solid, chunky blend, bright and spicy, with high-toned cranberry and cherry fruit. It's good, but simple.",87,Copper Belt 2012 Keating Reserve Red,,,,
"The aromas of whole lime, flowers, jasmine and watermelon Jolly Rancher pop. It drinks off dry, with floral flavors that carry through the finish.",89,Pomum 2014 Upland Vineyard Riesling (Snipes Mountain),,,,
"This wine comes alive on the expansive, fleshy palate of black pepper and olive tapenade flavors. It walks a fine line between tenacious structure and high-cheekboned fruit—a mélange of raspberry, cassis and blueberry compote. The aromas are enticing and reminiscent of violets. Though it can be enjoyed now, it will evolve well through 2034.",95,Nickel & Nickel 2014 State Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville),,,,
"Very acidic, almost sour, which gives the citrus fruit flavors a lemondrop throat lozenge taste. Sure does get the tastebuds whistling.",85,Lincourt 2010 Unoaked Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"This beautifully perfumed wine has rounded tannins finely integrated into the opulent red cherry fruit. It's already a delicious wine, juicy and fragrant, although still with a long future. If you can wait, drink it from 2018.",93,Roche de Bellene 2012 Pitures Premier Cru  (Volnay),,,,
"Compost aromas open this vineyard-designated wine, a full-bodied, densely concentrated exploration of juicy black licorice, coconut and dust. Soft and lengthy, it develops slowly in the glass, providing a vibrant showcase for the site.",92,Castello di Amorosa 2013 Morisoli-Borges Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),,,,
"Already with a deep golden color, this single vineyard wine is richly honeyed and dense. It has a viscous texture, ripe with Seville orange marmalade and apricot fruits that are cut by the acidity that gives this wine its lift and its ageability. The wine is delicious now, but don't be too impatient: it will get better and better over many years. So drink from 2020.",93,Château Pierre-Bise 2011 Clos de la Soucherie Chenin Blanc (Coteaux du Layon Beaulieu),,,,
"Made with 65% Sangiovese, 20% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has subtle aromas of black-skinned fruit and thyme. The easygoing palate delivers black cherry and cinnamon alongside smooth tannins.",87,Madonna Alta 2014 Nativo Red (Toscana),,,,
"Hints of passion fruit rest among the ripe peach notes. The palate is zippy with ripe orange and zesty tangerine. Full of juicy freshness, this wine would be an exuberant apéritif when well chilled. Drink soon for maximum fruit.",88,Koenig 2015 Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"A blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this opens with aromas of bluish-black fruit, exotic spice and a balsamic note. The firmly structured palate doles out blackberry, spiced blueberry, coffee and black pepper accompanied by assertive but fine-grained tannins.",89,Le Senate 2012 Cacinello Red (Marche),,,,
"Made partly with late-harvested grapes and aged in large casks, this ripe wine leads with aromas of fragrant white flowers, lychee, pear and a delicate note of vanilla. The round palate offers juicy tropical fruit, golden apple and lemon pastry with a flinty, mineral finish.",88,Monte Tondo 2011 Foscarin Slavinus  (Soave Classico Superiore),,,,
"For a late-release 2002, this is still very youthful, packing layers of rich cassis and blackberry fruit into a soft jacket of vanilla, cedar and toasted coconut. It's full-bodied, lush and velvety—a simply terrific Cabernet that should prove to have excellent aging potential as well. Drink now–2020.",93,Jim Barry 2002 The Benbournie Cabernet Sauvignon (Clare Valley),,,,
"Falls into the dark and roasted category, with aromas of leather, black fruits and toast. The palate is saturated and full, with dark, roasted black fruit, molasses and spice flavors. Warm on the finish almost to the point of being hot, but not quite. A very solid wine overall.",88,Marques de Tomares 2006 Crianza  (Rioja),,,,
"Tart but full cranberry aromas meld with sagebrush and cardamom on the nose of this bottling from an increasingly popular vineyard in this appellation. Baking spice and dried ginger mark the palate, which is acid-driven and lively, accenting its core of raspberry and pencil lead flavors.",91,Silver Mountain 2013 Tondre's Grapefield Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Impeccably balanced and extremely elegant, this opens with a multifaceted fragrance of perfumed berry, crushed blue flower, menthol, baking spice and just a hint of new leather. The graceful palate offers layers of succulent wild cherry, white pepper, licorice, mint and eucalyptus alongside firm, polished tannins and fresh acidity. It's sleek and already tempting but hold for complexity. Drink 2016–2030.",95,Castello di Ama 2010 San Lorenzo Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"This is soft, delicate and finessed. It's not a blockbuster, but a silky charmer that offers layers of red currants, Dr. Pepper, vanilla and sandalwood. Ready to drink now.",90,Renteria 2009 River Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"As before, the Estate Selection is the bigger of the two Pinots from Amalie, textural and clean. Strawberry and raspberry fruit flavors hint at herb and stem, but all the details are in proportion and complement each other. Not for long aging, but drinking well right now.",89,Amalie Robert 2008 Estate Selection Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This is a real beauty, with huge intensity and loads of deep chocolate fudge, black cherry, cola, barbecue and black licorice flavors. It manages contrasting tones of sweet versus savory that pleasure the tastebuds. The palate is rich, smooth and superconcentrated.",95,Zenato 2006 Sergio Zenato Riserva  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),,,,
"Sur Peaux translates to “on the skins”—a maceration process that gives this wine its burnished copper hue. More importantly, it's crazy good: soft, supple, delicately spicy yet bone dry, with a buttery mouthfeel.",91,Aubichon Cellars 2015 Sur Peaux Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),,,,
"A curious sauerkraut perfume leads to a hard edged wine, the wood not in balance with the fruit. It is raw and not completely clean. Two bottles tasted.",80,Quinta do Pinto 2008 Touriga Nacional (Lisboa),,,,
"Sizable portions of caramel and honey play off the nose of this inviting wine, which reveals elements of baked apple, grilled pineapple and a tangy, spicy undercurrent of acidity. Structured, layered and complex, it has more to show within its integrated layers and long length.",94,Nicholson Ranch 2013 Cuvée Natalie Estate Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"The aromas of tar, clove, wood spice and dark fruit show nuance. The flavors are velvety and full, pinching together on the finish. The oak seems a bit prominent at times.",88,Swiftwater Cellars 2013 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Made using fruit from one of the top Kamptal vineyards, this perfumed wine has great texture, with tight acidity and notes of green plum skin and lemon zest. With its depth of flavor and nervy, minerally edge, it will age for at least four years.",92,Bründlmayer 2011 Steinmassel Erste Lage Riesling (Kamptal),,,,
"This wine is a blend of Art Den Hoed Petite Sirah (80%) and Gunkel Vineyard Zinfandel. Aromas of barrel spice, vanilla, raspberry and purple fruit are followed by full-bodied palate-coating fruit flavors, brightened by fresh acidity. The interest is as much about feel as flavor.",91,Maryhill 2013 Proprietor's Reserve Rosso Granato Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"CampoRe opens with slightly oxidized (but not overwhelming) aromas of caramel and butterscotch followed by mature melon, apricot and dried almond. The wine tastes soft and slightly sweet with marzipan-like flavors on the close.",87,Terredora 2008 CampoRe  (Fiano di Avellino),,,,
"Relatively low in alcohol (12.2% is the listing), this is thin on fruit but does offer soft flavors of yeasty bread dough, along with some stemmy tannins.",82,Agate Ridge 2007 Clonal Selection Pinot Noir (Rogue Valley),,,,
"Clean but basic in its approach. The nose has dusty apricot and melon aromas, while the palate deals nectarine, citrus and peach flavors. That it's fresh, wet and easy on the tongue is probably the best thing it has going for it. Won't last a whole lot longer; drink now.",84,Errazuriz 2007 Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"Delicious, offering an orchard of oranges and peaches, made even richer with honeysuckle, buttered toast and vanilla notes. Fine acidity makes the flavors bright and clean. The blend is 75% Viognier and 25% Marsanne.",90,Calcareous 2008 Viognier-Marsanne (Paso Robles),,,,
"As a partner to the red wine from this estate, with its Bordeaux blend, this wine brings together the Bordeaux white grapes of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon. The addition of Alvarinho rather spoils the Bordeaux moment, although for the wine it it's a plus, adding crisp taste and brightness to this rich wood-aged blend. Drink this tropical, fruity and pear-flavored wine from 2018.",90,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal 2016 Quinta da Bacalhôa Branco White (Península de Setúbal),,,,
"Just a smidge over the edge into off dry, this is a big, juicy wine with a luscious mix of tropical candy fruit flavors. It's like tasting an entire roll of tropical Life Savers all in a glass. The residual sugar is offset with balancing acidity, and it's a versatile wine that can accompany a wide range of slightly spicy foods.",88,Mercer 2013 Riesling (Yakima Valley),,,,
"91–93. Barrel sample. A fine, dense, opulent wine with a great sense of structure. It's dark and solid with tannins that are dense, dusty and brooding. It's likely to age well.",92,Le Carré 2012 Barrel Sample  (Saint-Émilion),,,,
"The Ab Ovo is principally fermented in a concrete egg, as students of Latin might easily surmise. Richly detailed and layered, the wine displays impeccable balance, ripe citrus and tropical fruit flavors and countering acidity. The egg seems to bring out some additional minerality also.",92,Archery Summit 2012 Ab Ovo Pinot Gris (Dundee Hills),,,,
"Deliciously light and herbal, this smooth, creamy wine is bright, poised with black-currant fruits and ripe gooseberry flavors. Drink this wine young, for its great fruit.",87,Fournier Père et Fils 2015 Côtes de Morogues  (Menetou-Salon),,,,
"Ripe grapes give a rich, fruity, crisp and clean wine. Strong minerality, spice and dried fruits come together with tight lemon flavors to produce an intense wine with high acidity at the end. Drink young.",87,Domaine Rolet Père et Fils 2011 Nature du Jura Savagnin (Arbois),,,,
"Wiry currant and plum aromas show a touch of oak in this value-priced wine. It feels somewhat chunky on the palate, with scraping tannins. Herbal plum flavors finish gamy and with a mild note of oaky clove.",85,Santa Rita 2016 120 Reserva Especial Carmenère (Central Valley),,,,
"The winery calls this unoaked Chardonnay “Homage to Chablis,” presumably because it's a high-acid, low alcohol wine whose main flavors are of minerals, with subtle elements of citrus zest and pear. It's a connoisseurs' wine that requires some understanding to appreciate. Sommeliers will love it, but it's hard to find. Only 120 cases produced.",88,Clos Pepe 2006 Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"A strong blast of oak and wood shavings are up front and on top of the nose on this chunky Cabernet. Baked, herbal flavors of cassis and raspberry are toasty, slightly green and minty. Flavors of herbs and carob rest heavily on a plump, warm finish.",88,Koyle 2013 Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"Toast and spice notes add warmth to crisp blackberry and cassis on this elegantly composed Meritage. Richly concentrated on the palate, it's bold and mouthfilling, with big, brawny tannins that should meld beautifully over the next 3–5 years.",88,Damiani 2010 Meritage (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Sandeman's single quinta vintage is based around Quinta do Vau. Made in a deliberately fruity style, it is full of blackberry fruit jam flavors, with fleshy plums. The tannins are low-key, just showing through as a core of dryness. This is not a long-term aging vintage—best in 5–10 years.",90,Sandeman 2000 Vau Vintage  (Port),,,,
"Aglianico grapes make powerful and tightly structured red wines, but vintner Roberto Di Meo has tamed much of that massiveness and has produced an elegant, polished bottling instead. This shows a long aromatic evolution, with subtle tones of blackberry, prune, leather and spice that evolve with more time in the glass.",91,Di Meo 2006 Riserva  (Taurasi),,,,
"Rich and creamy in pineapple, orange and lime fruit, with a sweet coating of new oak, this Chardonnay is balanced with zesty acidity. It's an opulent, flashy wine.",90,Testarossa 2011 Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"Bright cassis, strawberry and red currant flavors are on vivid display in this 100% varietal wine. Soft and easy to enjoy, it impresses with full-bodied accetnes of dusty cigar and mocha.",92,Beaulieu Vineyard 2013 Maestro Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),,,,
"Mint flavors showcase the new wood used to age this wine. That wood balances well with the ripe, full, berry flavors and solid fruit tannins, yielding a structured and impressive wine worth aging over at least four years.",90,Château Lecusse 2006 Vieilli en Fût de Chêne Red (Gaillac),,,,
"A blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache, this has a chocolate mint edge to the sugary sweet LifeSaver candy blackberries and cherries. The tannins and acids are good, though, and the wine would score higher if it were drier.",84,Cass 2005 Rockin' One Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"Brightly colored, this wine is full both of fruit and smoky tannins. It is structured now, firm with its dry core. Around it, fresh blackberry and red-berry fruits are beginning to show well. Drink this attractive wine from 2018.",87,Château du Cartillon 2013  Haut-Médoc,,,,
"Red-fruit aromas of currant and raspberry aren't sophisticated but they are good and fruity. Firm and solidly built, this likeable, easy-drinking blend offers plum, blackberry and raspberry flavors along with a loamy finish that contains a ripe hint of raisin.",87,Casa L'Angel 2012 Made With Organic Grapes Syrah-Tempranillo (Valencia),,,,
"Flint and yeast vie with each other to give the first impression of this rich wine. The palate backs this up with concentration and a fluid, soft but defined texture. There is a streamline of lemon freshness at the core. This is like a powerful beast that has barely flexed its muscle. Let it come towards you.",92,R&A; Pfaffl 2015 Hundsleiten Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel),,,,
"This is sourced from vines more than four decades old. It's the sweetest of the non-dessert Rieslings from Brooks, with rich flavors of candied citrus, honey and orange marmalade. That said, it's crystal clear, dense, fresh and juicy, and can fill a variety of slots, from an accompaniment to blue cheese, to a wine to pair with fresh fruits and ice cream.",93,Brooks 2015 Sweet P Brooks Estate Vineyard Riesling (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
"A great wine to drink as a cocktail or with light finger foods, Case Ibidini has a clean, crisp disposition and loads of citrusy intensity.",86,Valle dell'Acate 2010 Case Ibidini Insolia (Sicilia),,,,
"Cedar, graphite and concentrated plum aromas mark the nose of this full-bodied wine from the southern end of the appellation, where it's cool and breezy from the Pacific Ocean. Entirely varietal, it shows a wealth of red and black berry fruitiness, dotted with dried herb.",92,Rodney Strong 2013 Alexander's Crown Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"This elegant sparkling wine has a subdued fragrance that reveals delicate floral and nut aromas. The palate is more expressive, offering citrus, tropical fruit and roasted almond flavors. The pleasant foamy texture is accompanied by lively acidity.",89,Antica Fratta NV Brut Sparkling (Franciacorta),,,,
"The new American oak brings notes of vanilla, wood and coconut that largely overwhelms the seemingly green, citrusy fruit. There's a pleasing tartness to the acids but overall the fruit flavors get lost.",86,Vortex 2009 Reserve Tempranillo (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"A hint of dill lends curious contrast to bright sour-cherry and raspberry flavors in this full-bodied wine. Supple on the palate and framed by the softest of tannins, it finishes briskly with a kick of cranberry acidity.",85,Sannino 2013 Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"This vintage is thick in dusty chocolate, clove and cinnamon tones, with a sage underbite that gives it a wild edge. Soft, approachable tannins provide a crowd-pleasing entry and midpalate, while the finish reveals the wine's full-bodied, riper side.",85,Castello di Amorosa 2012 Reserve Il Barone Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"With its intense spice and rich texture, the wine seems bigger than it is. In fact, it is fresh while soft and very aromatic, with a pale salmon color. It's delicious, smooth and ready to drink.",86,José Maria da Fonseca 2013 Colecção Privada Moscatel Roxo (Península de Setúbal),,,,
"A bouquet of peach, melon and freesia sets the scene for flavors of white peach, apricot, watermelon and rose petal with a touch of spearmint. It is bright on entry and soft in the mouth, and the spearmint note holds strong into the bright finish.",87,Turasan 2014 Emir (Turkey),,,,
"Leafy underbrush, ripe black cherry, clove, mocha and licorice sensations come together in this robust Rosso. It's forward and shy on freshness so enjoy this soon with hearty first courses or stews.",87,Tenuta Valdipiatta 2012  Rosso di Montepulciano,,,,
"Aromatic and refreshing, with scents of white blossoms, stonefruits and a hint of beeswax, this is fermented entirely in stainless steel and meant to be enjoyed fresh and young. Squeaky clean on the palate with hints of white peach, underripe pineapple, lime pith and a bright, lemony acidity that tickles the palate.",89,Paumanok 2011 Festival Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
This bright Dolcetto offers tones of mature fruit and wet earth that are enhanced by the wine's soft and silky mouthfeel. Clean acidity brings up the rear and makes this wine a perfect match to tortellini with a creamy cheese sauce.,86,Pasquale Pelissero 2008 Cascina Crosa  (Dolcetto d'Alba),,,,
"A lovely dessert wine in almost every respect. It's crisp in acidity and has complex, somewhat oxidized or Madeira-like flavors of oranges, tapioca and vanilla. Could be a little more focused and intense, but very fine, although it calls for a certain appreciation of this oxidative quality.",89,Gypsy Canyon NV Ancient Vine Angelica Debit (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"A blend of estate-grown Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a juicy, liquorous wine wrapped up tightly around sweet and tangy blackberry and cherry fruits. The tannins are svelte and the finish long, while the barrel aging brings on substantial flavors of cedar, Bourbon and vanilla.",93,Woodward Canyon 2010 Estate Reserve Merlot-Petit Verdot-Cabernet Franc-Cabernet Sauvignon Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"This wonderful under-$20 Malbec opens with a blast of black-fruit aromas as well as mild rubber scents and minerality. The palate is solid, with baked berry and integrated saline and mineral flavors. A bright, lively finish with a ton of berry essence closes this out.",90,Finca Lalande 2012 Made with organically grown grapes Malbec (Tupungato),,,,
"Salmon-peach in color this rosé is made from 87% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Malbec and 10% Pinot Noir, the end result of which is a thirst-quenching array of pineapple and papaya aromas and flavors in a crisp, straightforward package.",86,Simi 2013 Dry Rosé (Sonoma County),,,,
"This perfumed, light wine has ripe fruits along with soft acidity and structure. By blending some Merlot with the Malbec, the producer has softened and broadened the tannins and allowed for attractive juicy red fruits at the end,",88,Château Bovila 2012 Malbec-Merlot (Cahors),,,,
"Potent and pungent, it holds juicy acids tasting of grapefruit. It plunges into a chocolaty midpalate with strawberry fruit that thins into light flavors of soda pop.",88,Le Cadeau 2011 Diversité Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Aged, like so many Loire sparkling wines, in the caves of Saumur, this is a rich wine. It has a nutty charm as well as ripe apple and white stone-fruit flavors. Its acidity is finely integrated giving a smooth wine. It is ready to drink.",90,Domaine du Petit Clocher NV Brut  (Crémant de Loire),,,,
"Baked plum, brick dust, stewed tomato and leather aromas are rugged but good. Chewy and only moderately tannic, this basic Monastrell delivers raspberry and plum flavors sweetened by hints of brown sugar and molasses. A lasting, chocolaty finish is easygoing, with a shot of acidity for balance.",87,Comoloco 2013 Monastrell (Jumilla),,,,
"A creamy, simple and very fresh Italian sparkler, this Frizzante Prosecco offers a soft, foamy feel in the mouth with tones of peach, lemon and apple on the finish.",84,Capo di Vigna NV Frizzante  (Prosecco),,,,
"There's a striking minerality that adds depth to varietally characteristic scents of ripe cassis, violets and cedar. Full bodied and densely concentrated, with sweet, black-fruit flavor, it's balanced by brisk acidity and fresh herb flavors that linger on the finish.",88,Cramele Halewood 2009 Hyperion Limited Edition Cabernet Sauvignon (Dealu Mare),,,,
"Thin in character, this is a pleasant wine without much style. Light and ready to be drunk immediately.",82,Château le Noble 2012  Bordeaux Blanc,,,,
"This is a supple, forward and pleasantly drinkable wine. If it is to be criticized it's that it lacks precision and focus. The fruit flavors are a diffuse mélange of cherry, berry and plum, leading to a chalky finish that tastes of tartaric acid with a splash of chocolate.",87,Panther Creek 2006 Winemaker's Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"A high-toned whiff of Band-Aid opens into a broadly flavored wine, with notes of black fruits, baking spices and dark threads of charcoal and roasted coffee. Best for drinking over the next 2–3 years.",88,Pondera 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This blending house adds 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Malbec to boost this Zinfandel-based wine, which shows baked strawberries, blackberry puree, beef char and smoke on the nose. The fruit is tart and black on the palate, with mint and anise notes.",90,ONX 2013 Brash Red (Templeton Gap District),,,,
"The entry-level wine in the Esclans range, this is as fresh and fruity as possible. Juicy red currant and tangy acidity combine in this delicious blend of Grenache, Cinsault and Syrah. The wine is dry while showing exuberant fruit. It can be drunk either as an apéritif or with food.",89,Château d'Esclans 2015 Whispering Angel Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"A clean, crisply elegant Sauvignon Blanc. Shows a fancy structure of tart acidity framing dry, mouthwatering flavors of Meyer lemons, limes, lemongrass, figs and vanilla. Very pretty and polished.",89,Chimney Rock 2008 Fumé Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"Some rosés are made simply by bleeding the juice from the fermenter, to concentrate the remaining wine. Whether or not that is the case here, the wine has the simple pleasant lightly candied strawberry flavors one might expect from such a technique. It's fruity and undemanding. Drink up.",86,Z'IVO 2015 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
"Fire up the grill, or pan fry a juicy steak to eat with this robust red wine, a Bordeaux blend with 24% Syrah. It's bone dry and tannic and juicy in berries, cherries, currants, leather and herbs, and while it's an easy sipper, the structure was harder to achieve than you might think.",87,Longoria 2007 Blues Cuvée Red (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Buttered toast, oaky smoke and a slight mango tropicality converge for an epic nose on this Chardonnay from a vineyard that was planted in 1976. There are layers of flavor too, lime citrus at first evolving toward brioche with a butterscotch finish, and some salt and cracked pepper throughout.",93,Mount Eden Vineyards 2012 Wolff Vineyard Chardonnay (Edna Valley),,,,
"Ripe and creamy, with flavors of pineapple candy, honey, brown sugar, buttered toast and cinnamon. It's just what millions of Chardonnay lovers want.",85,F.J. Serra 2012 Chardonnay (California),,,,
"Made entirely with the rare grape variety Rebo, this hearty red opens with aromas of wild blackberry and cassis. The robust straightforward palate delivers =red berry and blackberry jam alongside round tannins. Enjoy soon.",89,Pisoni 2012 Reboro Rebo (Vigneti delle Dolomiti),,,,

This affordable wine offers tangy oak and tannin along with vibrant red fruit. Leather and juicy black plum add to its soft layers of flavor.,91,Alexander Valley Vineyards 2014 Wetzel Family Estate Grown and Bottled Syrah (Alexander Valley),,,,
"This wine is beginning to get some age to it, but remains fresh. There is some toast, even coffee, while the aftertaste is soft and slightly candied.",88,Duval-Leroy 1998 Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (Champagne),,,,
"Steely in wet stone and high-toned citrus, this Chardonnay is from Hyde-Old Wente clones and deftly made in a light style that doesn't skimp on delicious complexity. Apple and herb figure prominently, as does a remarkable mouthfeel of minerality, a testament to the winery's cool growing sites.",93,Iron Horse 2012 Native Yeast Chardonnay (Green Valley),,,,
"Chalky, intensely mineral aromas stand out in contrast to the plush, intensely fruity palate of this Cabernet Franc rosé. Slightly off dry in style, its black plum and cherry flavors are voluptuously rich and ripe, accented by fresh cranberry acidity.",86,Atwater 2014 Dry Rosé of Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Spicy and earthy, this medium-bodied red is rewarding in its layers of dried herb, sage and strawberry patch. The tartness lingers on the lean palate, ending in cranberry and cardamom.",87,Spicy Vines 2015 Peter's Delight Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"With an unusually high proportion (nearly 17%) of Petit Verdot in the blend, this is both darkly structured and dark in color. It is weight, intense youthful acidity and black-currant fruits. It's also rich, full of tannins and in need of several years. Drink from 2021.",90,Château du Retout 2014  Haut-Médoc,,,,
"Petit Verdot is a character actor who's never really grabbed the spotlight for itself, but makes an interesting appearance now and again. This McLaren Vale example is oaky but backed by ample plum and cassis fruit and framed by tannins that seem soft for the variety. Cedar and spice come through on the finish. Drink now.",88,Gemtree 2008 The Phantom Petit Verdot (McLaren Vale),,,,
"This is an attention-grabbing example of how compelling cool climate Grenache can be. Rosewater, fennel, black plum and loamy soil aromas grow more rosy as the wine opens. The palate is superdry, with chalky tannins and zesty acidity, revealing more floral flavors. An extremely elegant wine.",93,Stephen Ross 2014 Bee Sweet Vineyard Grenache (Edna Valley),,,,
"Aromas of ripe plum, violet, vanilla, toast and leafy underbrush come together on this is full-bodied red. The palate offers black cherry marinated in spirits, grilled porcini mushroom and dried aromatic herb alongside assertive tannins that leave a somewhat drying finish.",89,San Fabiano Calcinaia 2012  Chianti Classico,,,,
"This simple white opens with faint aromas that recall hazelnut, coffee bean and toast. The aromas make their way to the lean, rather diluted palate along with yellow apple skin. Bracing acidity gives it a brisk finish.",84,Lagaria 2014 Chardonnay (Vigneti delle Dolomiti),,,,
"Incredible aromas of barbecued meat leap out of this wine, followed by a taste of sweet raspberry jam. It has penetratingly thick tannins that are dusty too. There's a pronounced amount of smoky oak going on, which might be pleasant with similar food.",83,Putah Creek 2009 Tannat (Solano County),,,,
"This big, brawny wine slathers its rich pear syrup and orange marmalade flavors with toasty oak and butter. All that oaky richness dominates the taste from the first whiff to the lingering finish, so pair with an equally bold dish.",88,Blindfold 2014 White (California),,,,
"Jammy aromas of raisin and baking spices are a touch herbal. This kitchen-sink blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carignan, Garnacha, Petit Verdot and Tempranillo feels rugged and grating. Classic Chilean flavors of reedy plum, berry and tomato end with a minty green note and a touch of fennel.",88,Chono 2014 Entre Cordilleras Dalca Series Red (Cauquenes Valley),,,,
"Lightly floral aromas are dilute while hinting at quince jelly. There's not a lot of vitality to the palate, while tangerine and nectarine flavors are watery. Pithy citrus notes carry the finish before it putters out.",84,Vicente Gandia 2014 Hoya de Cadenas Organic Verdejo (Spain),,,,
"This is made in the somewhat austere style of a Loire valley Chinon, done well here, adding nothing harsh, bitter or unpleasant to the wine. You will also find soft plum and cherry fruit, modest but perfectly ripe and proportionate, rounding out the midpalate.",88,Substance 2008 Cf Cabernet Franc (Washington),,,,
"The oak (21 months spent in French and American) takes the lead, with aromas of baking spices, green wood and vanilla out in front of cherry. The flavors are sweet, supported by grainy tannins that show some dryness.",88,Gordon Estate 2012 Block 3 Reserve Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"The medium-intense nose opens with scents of ripe stone fruit, caramel apple and candied walnut. Medium in weight, there's good lift to the rich, spicy fruit core, with lasting notes of baking spice and peppery warmth on the close.",89,Diví Elegància NV Ambré White (Rivesaltes),,,,
"Rich and ripe, this wine full of blackberry fruits and balanced tannins has improved since it was reviewed from barrel. It has good concentration for the vintage, dominated by black fruit that offers good acidity at the end. Drink from 2022.

"Savory, citrusy and pear-scented, this is fresh, crisp and light, making it ideal for a party.",85,Winzer Krems 2013 13 Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),,,,
"A heavy, acidic and boring wine, not offering much in the way of flavor except for some bitter cherries.",80,Fenestra 2007 Silvaspoons Vineyards Touriga Nacional (Lodi),,,,
"Light in body, yet sinewy in texture and a bit sweet, This Riesling has turned out well. Floral, green apple and lime aromas and flavors are almost Mosel-like, but the wine is richer and weightier than that, clocking in at 10% alcohol.",90,Felton Road 2007 Riesling (Central Otago),,,,
"Rich and ripe on the nose with dark black fruit and olives, this is an easygoing blend of Syrah, Cab and Merlot. Medium-bodied in style, it's soft on the palate with plush tannins and flavors of cooked plum compote accented by darker hints of olive and sage.",85,Shalestone 2007 Synergy Red (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Morellino di Scansano is the perfect wine to pair with Italian dishes like ricotta-filled ravioli in meat sauce or fettuccine with porcini. It shows soft cherry and blackberry aromas, plus bright acids and spicy endnotes.",88,Fattoria Mantellassi 2010 Poggio Etrusco  (Morellino di Scansano),,,,
"This bottling opens with clean and light yet pure aromas of peach blossoms, beeswax, rounded nectarine and sharper Granny Smith apple-skin notes. The palate is very high-toned and pithy with flavors of pear skin, Key lime, chive, sea salt and a touch of smoke, leaving the mouth with quite a sizzle on the finish.",92,Testarossa 2014 Soberanes Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Dry, spicy berry aromas are pedestrian but fine. This is tight, fresh and a touch scraping on the palate, with plum, currant and roasted flavors. Spicy, minty and solid on the finish, this is a perfectly good Merlot with limitations.",87,Viña Requingua 2013 Toro de Piedra Grand Reserve Merlot (Curicó Valley),,,,
"Blending Chardonnay and Arinto, this wine has come with a fine balance between a creamy texture and bright acidity. It is ripe, fruity with a soft character that also has an aromatic element. Drink the wine from 2018.",89,Quinta do Casal Monteiro 2016 Margaride's White (Lisboa),,,,
"Rich, ripe blackberry preserves, vanilla and toasted coconut flavors make this full bodied Cab Franc feel deliciously warm and generous in style. A sharp whiff of graphite and lean acidity on the midpalate add structure and balance on the finish.",87,Belhurst 2009 Cabernet Franc (New York),,,,
"The fine folks at Castello di Monsanto manage to always produce elegant and harmonious wines from Tuscany. This exceptional Cabernet Sauvignon shows remarkable quality both in terms of its flavor presentation and its territory-driven personality. The long fade is colored by blackberry, cherry and spice flavors.",93,Castello di Monsanto 2004 Nemo Cabernet Sauvignon (Toscana),,,,
"This garnet-colored wine conveys aromas of cranberry, black cherry and bramble. Flavors of dark cherry, cranberry and black plum have a strong acidic backbone and a long finish.",88,Miloš 2009 Plavac Mali (Peljesac),,,,
"Incredibly syrupy aromas of concentrated blueberry, blackberry, dried black cherry and kirsch show on the nose of this dense and dark bottling. It is a hearty sipper, with lots of espresso bean and cappuccino flavors, more dried cherry and blueberry, and some soy. The cooked flavors are a little overpowering but also luscious.",88,Lorenzi Estate 2012 Estate Grown Syrah (Temecula Valley),,,,
"This single-vineyard Barbaresco offers underbrush and tobacco leaf aromas layered with toast, espresso and oak. The palate is succulent, featuring black cherry, licorice, spice and eucalyptus notes. Nicely balanced, but still young and aggressive; best after 2015.",91,Tenute Cisa Asinari dei Marchesi di Gresy 2010 Martinenga  (Barbaresco),,,,
"This perfumed expression of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot shows a great depth of complexity and deliciousness for the price. Firm, grippy tannin stars alongside dark cherry, currant, clove and tobacco, all along a softened layering of texture.",88,Taken Wine Co. 2014 Taken Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Dark berry, leather and herbaceous notes on the nose open to cherry, currant and tobacco flavors—it's all very much in the Bordeaux vein. The mouthfeel is similar: somewhat lean and angular but very flavorful, with an expansive cherry flavor on the spicy, long finish. Has good tannic structure, and may merit a higher score with some age. Hold for four to six years, and then drink til 2012.",89,The Terraces 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Oh the purity of freshly cut red-cheeked apples illuminated by equally pure lemon freshness. Yes this is high in the acidity stakes but comes with so much purity of fruit, one simply has to rejoice in all the liveliness. This offeing has a real spring in its step and will enliven any occasion, balanced and concentrated as it is.",93,Weszeli 2014 Steinmassl Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),,,,
"Lafòa is one of the best expressions of Sauvignon from Italy. Careful fruit selection and oak aging create a wine that is important aromatically, as well as structurally. Pristine flavors of citrus, peach and honeysuckle are backed by a creamy feel and a touch of -piquant spice.",91,Colterenzio 2009 Lafòa Sauvignon (Alto Adige),,,,
"This is ripe and full in the mouth, with fine acidity and rich white stone fruit. It's delicious and floral, balancing its crisp texture with generous fruitiness. Great as an apéritif or with food, it's a refreshing wine to drink now.",90,Les Rocailles 2016 Chignin Jacquère (Savoie),,,,
"This is a bright and approachable wine, with forward notes of blueberry, plum and wild strawberry accented by hints of garrigue and vanilla. Swaths of mocha and sweet spice add richness to the palate and linger on the medium-length finish.",86,Domaine Grier 2009 Odyssea Red (Côtes du Roussillon),,,,
"As with the Avery Lane Merlot, this is a rather complex blend, here including Syrah, Cab Franc and Lemberger. Fruity and spicy, with strawberry and cherry candy flavors. Very pleasing picnic wine.",86,Avery Lane 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington),,,,
"Ripe fruit, juicy acidity and a fine balance of tannins give this wine great potential. It's full of blackberry flavors as well as some solid, structured tannins. Drink from 2020.",90,Château Magdeleine Bouhou 2015 Boha  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),,,,
"Peachy and a little sharp on the nose, but the palate is smooth and glides along nicely, and the flavors of citrus, honey and caramel are good and hold form through the finish. You can definitely taste the botrytis here, especially on the finish. Fresh and not at all funky. Drink now through 2013.",87,Viu Manent 2008 Botrytis Selection Noble Sémillon (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"Opulent tones of toasted espresso bean and soft chocolate fudge play a supporting role to bold berry and dried raspberry. Background floral tones of dried lavender and red rose. There's a touch of earthiness, too, with button mushroom and forest floor. Tannins are nicely polished and firm. Streamlined, elegant.",93,Canalicchio di Sopra 2007  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Scents of black currant, green bell pepper, cedar and a hint of violet slowly emerge in the glass. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, toast, coffee, mocha and a touch of vanilla alongside polished, fine-grained tannins.",89,Barone Ricasoli 2013 Brolio Riserva  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"Thick and rich in black sugarplum, this memorable Pritchard Hill-grown red is lovely and bold, velvety in texture with a softness to the firm, integrated tannin. Dried herb and spice provide memorable seasonings amidst a larger theater of dark chocolate, leather, clove and pepper.",94,Chappellet 2012 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),,,,
"This wine was given quite a bit of time in bottle. It offers cranberry, olive and a sanguine touch of dried cherry. Medium in weight and oak, it finishes with tart acidity.",85,Halleck 2010 The Farm Vineyards Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Here's a beautifully well-balanced but easy Nero d'Avola that does a very good job of expressing the natural flavors of this native Sicilian grape. The wine's aromas include roasted almond, pistachio and black currant. It delivers power and strength that are both valuable assets if you plan to drink it with stews or roasted meat.",86,Feudo Arancio 2006 Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),,,,
"Red fruits dominate this wine with its soft tannins and wild strawberry flavors. It is young, although with its gentle texture it is ready to drink now. The wine comes from the northern part of the Mâcon region.",84,Vignerons de Mancey 2014  Bourgogne,,,,
"This is a grand wine with serious concentration and savory complexity to complement its base of ripe apple, melon and mango flavors. Subtle butter, nutmeg and mineral aromas lead to a rich palate, where its smooth and expansive mouthfeel finishes with creamy, spicy accents.",92,The Tribe 2016 The Tribe Chardonnay (Lodi),,,,
"This is a simple, tart red, crisp in cranberry and red currant fruit and perfumed with spicy oak. Despite the high acidity on the front palate, it hangs heavy in full-bodied ripeness.",85,Spann Vineyards 2012 Cross Creek Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Moon Mountain District Sonoma County),,,,
"Here's a blend of 85% Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon that offers succulent plum, black currant and prune flavors layered with notes of oak, spice and cocoa. While rich fruit and smooth tannins make this appealing now, fresh acidity gives this some staying power. Drink through 2020.",89,Cirulli 2010 Ginepreta Red (Umbria),,,,
"Very impressive color, fruit concentration and tannic structure add up to an outstanding Petite Sirah. What's compelling is that this full-bodied wine seems to get its character purely from the concentrated and tannin-laden grapes rather than from new oak barrels or add-ins. This needs time in a cool cellar to show all its potential complexity. Best from 2016–2022.",93,Helwig 2012 Petite Sirah (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),,,,
"It opens with aromas of oak extract and burned tire rubber. The lean palate delivers toasted oak, vanilla and espresso alongside astringent oak tannins. It lacks fruit richness.",86,Diego Conterno 2010 Ginestra  (Barolo),,,,
"Opening aromas of wildflowers and pears lead to a subtle palate offering tart green apple, juicy nectarine and Barltett pear alongside crisp acidity. Pair this with appetizers and light first courses or sip as an apéritif.",87,La Tunella 2013 Pinot Grigio (Colli Orientali del Friuli),,,,
"Rich, blood warming and heady, this has vast and complex flavors of blackberry jam, licorice, bacon, spice and sweet, smoky sandalwood. It's hard to imagine a better wine to drink with barbecue.",93,Summers 2009 Four-Acre Zinfandel (Calistoga),,,,
"Buttery warmth shows on the nose of this wine by vintner Travis Proctor, alongside poached pear fruit and an iodine edge. Featuring original artwork by James Caprell on the label, the wine offers pan-seared golden apples, tart pear skin and more of the iodine edge once sipped.",89,Poiema 2013 Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"This is a big, brawny wine that offers moderate structure, opting for richer, denser notes of leathery tannin and bittersweet tobacco leaf, its accents part cedar, part clove.",87,Judd's Hill 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Floral red fruit aromas carry a hint of minerality and garrigue. The palate is lively, with good overall balance. Tastes of ripe red plum, raspberry and vanilla, while the finish is light in weight and quick, but satisfying.",88,Nice 2008 Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Whispers of fresh green herbs and lavender lend elegance and refreshment to intensely ripe yet pristine black cherry and plum flavors. The palate is succulent and juicy, marked by crisp, cutting acidity. Fine, velvety tannins cushion a long finish. Drinks well now but should hold beautifully till at least 2024.",92,Franz Keller 2014 Schwarzer Adler Pinot Noir (Baden),,,,
"An aroma of toasted hazelnut is at the fore, and subtle notes of honeyed toast, beeswax and brown spice lurk in the background. The glossy texture is threaded with a nutty melon flavor that continues onto the medium-long finish.",86,Old House 2011 de Maison Chardonnay (Virginia),,,,
"For the modest tariff, this is really good. Aromas of crushed stone and dried flowers lead the way, followed by ample berry flavors and a medium-bodied, silky feel. Drink now.",87,Boutinot 2016 Les Cerisiers Rosé (Côtes du Rhône),,,,
"Adam Tolmach picked the grapes a little earlier than usual for this low-production bottling. It's definitely not as ripe as his other Pinots, showing an aroma of grass, dried hay, nettles and sage. Yet the wine turns richly complex in the mouth, offering waves of cherries, raspberries and spices. Should age well and interestingly.",91,Ojai 2005 Clos Pepe Vineyard Early Harvest Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Boysenberry aromas and blackberry jam flavors fill this Bordeaux-style red blend to the brim, while a smooth texture and touch of sweetness make it an easy sipper. A great pairing for spicy Korean barbecue.",87,Andis 2013 Painted Fields Red (Amador County),,,,
"Delicious and wood-aged , this is a cool wine from a hot place. With as much citrus as tropical fruits, it is crisp, fresh, cut with refreshing acidity that contrasts with the toast and minerality. The wine could be drunk now, although it will be better from 2016.",89,Muxagat 2013 Branco White (Douro),,,,
"This opens with attractive aromas of yellow spring flowers and an assortment of white tree fruits. The vibrant palate offers lemon, tangerine, apple and pineapple flavors alongside fresh acidity.",89,Belisario 2012 Terre di Valbona  (Verdicchio di Matelica),,,,
"Initially this smells green and candied, with overripe and underripe aromas. The palate is chunky and bulky, while flavors of black fruits and green herbs finish grassy, with notes of oregano and tarragon. Overall this is heavy, extracted, sweet and sticky.",84,L'Atzar 2012 Red (Priorat),,,,
"Concentrated, muscular aromas of leathery blackberry set up a full, grinding, powerful palate with dark, earthy flavors of toast, blackberry and black plum. A peppery, spicy finish simmers with mild heat and burn.",88,Venta Morales 2013 Made With Organic Grapes Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),,,,
"This light- to medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc appears to aim at a minerally style, marrying hints of green (veggies?) with otherwise pleasant citrusy aromas and flavors. Grapefruit and anise make an appearance on the finish. Drink up.",85,Cairnbrae 2007 The Stones Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"This blend of 67% Cabernet Franc and 33% Petit Verdot is packed with layers of aromatics, ranging from cassis and grilled meats to mocha and coconut shavings. A hefty wine, it sports a deep, warm and concentrated midpalate that is bolstered by polished tannins and tender acids.",89,Jefferson Vineyards 2010 Estate Reserve Red (Monticello),,,,
Old vines are the source of this ripe tropical-fruit-flavored wine. It is concentrated and dense with a flinty texture that is taut and nervy. There is a crisp aftertaste that gives the wine its delicious lift. Drink the wine now.,91,Daniel Chotard 2014 Cuvée Marcel Henri  (Sancerre),,,,
"Bold and delicious, this opens with earthy aromas of mature black-skinned fruit, truffle, scorched earth and a whiff of game. The savory, full-bodied palate doles out juicy black cherry, blackberry, licorice, and baking spice alongside bright acidity and refined tannins.",92,Cascina delle Rose 2012 Donna Elena  (Barbera d'Alba Superiore),,,,
"While dry in style, S.A. Prüm's 2005 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Old Vines showcases the staggering ripeness and richness of the vintage with super concentrated flavors of peach preserve and caramel.

Prüm 2005 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Old Vines Dry Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"This deeply hued wine opens with aromas of toast, roasted coffee bean and butterscotch. The palate delivers lemon drop, baked Golden Delicious apple, custard, tangerine zest and vanilla while a walnut note closes the finish. Drink sooner rather than later.",89,La Castellada 2009 Bianco della Castellada White (Collio),,,,
"This wine is abundant with aromas of cherry Coke, sarsaparilla and baking spice. The palate is delicate yet is given some weight from seven months in neutral French and American oak. This wine gains a soft texture from Tannat skins added during fermentation.",87,Fabbioli Cellars 2013 Chambourcin (Virginia),,,,
"Here's a youthful expression of Sangiovese Grosso in which the grape's trademark acidity and fruity brightness shine through. Cherry, white almond, dried raspberry and rum cake notes present a soft, chewy feel in the mouth, although the overall structure is solid.",91,Fuligni 2007  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Equal parts Syrah and Merlot combine with 20% Cabernet Sauvignon in a big, concentrated package of generous fruit and tannin, bringing together fruit from both Napa and Sonoma counties. Full-bodied and grippy, blackberry and gamy meat are the stars of the show, with Cab's mix of dried herb and cedar coming through on the finish.",91,Terlato 2012 Galaxy Red (Sonoma County-Napa County),,,,
"Aged in wood, this wine is ripe, with a smoky character from the toastiness. Next to the spice, the red currant and berry fruits are intensely fresh and disclose a tight line of acidity. The wine is still young, although developing well as the acidity softens. It will be ready to drink from 2018.",88,Domaine Arnoux Père et Fils 2014 Les Beaumonts  (Chorey-lès-Beaune),,,,
"Juicy peach and aromatic orange make for an appetizing fruit-driven opening. The palate adds an element of pure zestiness and bright freshness to these exuberant, ripe and enticing fruit notes. This masters this playful tension between fruit and freshness beautifully. There is a touch of heat on the just-about-dry finish, but this spells fun, full fruit and total refreshment. Drink 2017–2025.",92,Domaine Mersiol 2015 Frankstein Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"Richer, fruitier and heavier than Sangiovese really ought to be, but then, this is Alexander Valley, not Tuscany. It's a big wine, jammy in chocolate-covered cherries and licorice, and while the only thing Italian about it is the acidity, it's a tasty wine.",87,Seghesio 2010 Sangiovese (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Campfire, animal, horseradish and berry aromas make for a slightly difficult nose. This Malbec feels pinched, with tannic pull. Salty black-fruit flavors finish similar, with popping acidity that keeps this lively.",86,Junta 2014 Momentos Reserve Malbec (Curicó Valley),,,,
"Vintage 2002 is turning out to be a great year in Champagne, and this wine is a reflection of that. Made from the heart of the pressing, it starts crisp and creamy. But then the power of the year shows through with its depth of flavor, yeast and apples, and a fine mineral structure, offering aging potential.",93,Aubry 2002 Aubry de Humbert Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"Polished and structured, it's loaded with fragrant yellow flower, peach, nectarine, white pepper, ginger and mineral sensations that are supported by a backbone of crisp acidity. The lingering finish closes on a note of hazelnut.",89,Feudi di San Gregorio 2012  Fiano di Avellino,,,,
"A beautifully perfumed wine is give shape by its great swathe of minerality, its intense acidity. The fruits range from citrus to white peach, a gallery of delicious flavor. Like any great Riesling, it needs years to mature.",96,Franz Hirtzberger 2010 Hochrain Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),,,,
"From a parcel on this 12-acre estate, the wine is structured and rich. It has layers of firm tannins under the black fruits. Acidity and a crisp mineral texture mix with the solid structure and concentration. The aftertaste shows the generous future of this fine cru wine. Drink from 2018.",93,Domaine Baron de l'Ecluse 2015 Les Garances  (Côte de Brouilly),,,,
"A ripe, tropical fruit flavored wine that is both fresh and rich. While produced in an area of Vinho Verde that is predominately dedicated to the Alvarinho grape, this dry wine is a refreshing, bright blend of many of the local varieties. It is juicy, crisp and ready to drink.",88,Anselmo Mendes 2015 Muros Antigos Escolha White (Vinho Verde),,,,
"This Premier Cru vineyard lies north of the Grand Crus, with a west-facing exposure. It has yielded a wine with soft, generous floral character, ripe yellow fruit and a crisp, mineral edge. Finely sculpted and ageworthy, it will be best from 2019.",93,La Chablisienne 2014 Fourchaume Premier Cru  (Chablis),,,,
"This unusual wine, from Dunham's estate vineyard, is dark and shows Rhône-like flavors of blood and cured meats. The fruit is tart—wild berry and cranberry flavors just on the edge of herbal, but laden with grace notes of herb, mineral and coffee. It's a pleasure to taste a Washington Syrah with this complexity at a very French (13%) level of alcohol.",90,Dunham 2005 Double River Estate Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"This firm and austere Taurasi opens with dark aromas of plum cake, chocolate, dried currant, cola and smoky barbecue sauce. The tannins are firm and dense and the wine needs a few more years of cellar aging before it softens.",90,Donnachiara 2006  Taurasi,,,,
The wine is dense with some fine concentrated fruit. Blackberry flavors give richness and sweetness which are topped with spice and layers of wood. Drink starting from 2018.,88,Château Lauduc 2014 Tradition  (Bordeaux Supérieur),,,,
"Sauvignon Blanc makes up three-quarters of this blend with the balance Sémillon. The aromas offer notes of herb, toast, nut oil and star fruit. The elegantly styled flavors of kiwi and spice are creamy in feel with a lingering finish.",90,DeLille 2014 Chaleur Estate White (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"There is a good touch of honey here, with attractive fruit flavors and layers of almonds, spice and a ripe finish.",87,Pierre Chainier 2010 Clos de Nouys Sec  (Vouvray),,,,
"Smoky, toasty oak forms an obvious part of this full-bodied wine's personality, from the first whiff to the spicy, cedary flavors and on to the finish. Moderate tannins add texture.",86,Black's Station 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yolo County),,,,
"A true Sangiovese with texture, structure and tannin. Ample fruit and savory components begin in the aroma and spread out on the palate. It tastes dry, medium-bodied and mouthwatering in a way that is flavorful yet holds a bit of itself in reserve. Made from 77% Amador County grapes, with the rest from Yolo and Lake. Enjoy through 2017.",92,Rosa d'Oro 2012 Sangiovese (California),,,,
"Showing just a hint of sweetness, this well-rounded effort offers a ripe and tangy mix of lime, grapefruit, pineapple and white peach fruit flavors. There's a touch of honey running alongside and trickling out through the finish. It's drinking at or near its peak.",89,Melrose 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Umpqua Valley),,,,
"Black cherry, currant and plum swirl in the bouquet, with hints of baking spice and bittersweet chocolate in the background. It's promising, but the palate comes across a bit flat, with soft tannins and a fleeting finish.",84,Domaines Pierre Chavin 2015 Iconique Cabernet Sauvignon (Pays d'Oc),,,,
"Half-and-half Petit and Gros Manseng, this is a classic dry Jurançon blend. Soft and rich, it is a wine that is dry while demonstrating fine fresh fruitiness. The structure and strongly mineral texture both suggest the need for aging, so drink from 2018.",89,Château Jolys 2014  Jurançon Sec,,,,
"Zesty lime and green fern aromas rise from the glass. The palate merely adds a little green pear fruit to this refreshing and enlivening combo of utter cleanness and verve. The linearity and drive make this moreish, very exciting and totally lip-smacking. Echoes of pepper on the aftertaste make it even more intriguing.",93,Berger 2015 Lössterrassen Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),,,,
"Lime, apple and mineral aromas come with a note of eggy yeast. The mouthfeel is regular and a touch foamy, with semisweet flavors of kiwi, apple and gooseberry. Mild and feeling good on the finish, it's basic but well worth a go.",87,V&N; Cellars NV Reserva Brut Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"Fleshy, sun-kissed black plums and cherries abound in this supple, velvet-textured Merlot. It's mouthfilling and rich, but brisk cranberry acidity lends firm structure. The palate is subtly nuanced, marked by soft tannins and layers of brambly wood, cedar and baking spice. Aged 19 months with a large proportion of new French oak, it drinks well now but should meld beautifully from 2020–2028.",91,Anthony Nappa 2013 Reserve Merlot (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"Some winemakers have a special feel for Pinot Noir, and Michael Stevenson, winemaker for Elizabeth Chambers, has earned a place among those select few. Previously known as Panther Creek, the winery has been re-branded and re-imagined under the current owners. This deliberate, controlled single vineyard effort punches through with a concentrated mix of plum, rhubarb and cherry fruit, showing exceptional grip, balance and length.",93,Elizabeth Chambers 2014 Menefee Vineyard Pinot Noir,,,,
"This is so ripe it smells like raisin extract and prune juice. A murky, stewy palate and overt raisiny flavors finish with a rubbery, tannic feel. Acceptable but with glaring weaknesses.",81,Bodega Privada 2012 Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"This Cab Franc is very delicious for its soft cherry pie and oak flavors. The tannins are pure Napa— thick, rich and detailed. Easy to like it now with a smoky grilled steak.",90,Peju 2009 Reserve Cabernet Franc (Rutherford),,,,
"This well-balanced ripe wine shows the hand of Pedro Sâ, wine and vineyard director for all Sogevinus Ports. Sweet with a hint of yeastiness and good acidity, its ripe strawberry flavors are strong and fresh. This is a pink Port wine that is ripe and fruity, finishing with both sweetness and freshness. Drink now but with this blend, Kopke doesn't rule out sip-store-sip over a couple months.",88,Kopke NV Rosé  (Port),,,,
"Light raspberry fruit carries a suggestion of clean earth and dried herb. The tannins show some substantial grip. The overall balance is fine, though the wine drinks younger than most 2012s. Best after 2020.",91,Domaine Divio 2012 Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
"Cramele Recas's Dreamfish series of international varieties consistently offers bang for your buck, and this vintage of Cabernet Sauvignon is no exception. Rich, full bodied and easy drinking, this offers flavors of bright black cherry and berry, framed by notes of vanilla, toast and wet graphite.",87,Cramele Recas 2011 Dreamfish Cabernet Sauvignon (Viile Timisului),,,,
"Very little Auxerrois is grown in Oregon, and the earliest plantings, the owners note, were here at Zenith. This could be mistaken for a Chardonnay, with ripe melon, peach and banana fruit matched to rounded out flavors of butter and caramel. It was barrel fermented and put through malolactic, much like a fine Chardonnay.",90,Zenith 2015 Auxerrois (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
"Whiffs of candle wax and crushed minerals lend depth to the concentrated tangerine and honey flavors in this sun-kissed, citrusy kabinett. It's forward and fruity yet zippy and fresh, showing balanced acidity and a cool, mineral finish.",90,Willi Haag 2016 Juffer Brauneberg Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"This blend of 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Syrah and 17% Petit Verdot retains a reductive quality on the nose even after being opened for quite a while, with slightly funky blackberry and burnt cedar aromas. Dried blackberries and black cherries show on the palate, but the tarry sensation permeates throughout.",86,The Farm Winery 2011 The Big Game Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"This is made in an earthy-savory style, offering hints of roasted meat, black olives and espresso. It's also firmly constructed, with firm tannins that suggest a couple of years of cellar time would do it some good. Drink 2018 through 2025.",91,D'Arenberg 2012 The Footbolt Shiraz (McLaren Vale),,,,
"Made in a drier, earthier and perhaps slightly less ripe style, this balanced Pinot Noir features cherry, herb tea, anise and cola flavors. It's very light and gentle in the mouth. Great with pepper steak, lamb with rosemary and garlic.",87,Pellegrini 2006 Olivet Lane Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Not very expressive, but this wine's fragrance does reveal delicate aromas of rose and berry, which carry over to the palate. It doesn't have quite enough fruit richness to support the vigorous, almost aggressive, bubbles and drying finish.",86,Antica Fratta 2009 Essence Rosé Sparkling (Franciacorta),,,,
"Not quite up there with previous vintages, although they've held the price and that's a good thing. The cold vintage took its toll, making this wine tart and somewhat green and herbal. Shows enough citrus and peach fruit to get by.",86,Matanzas Creek 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),,,,
"This is a spirited, funky white made from old vines, the wine aged in neutral oak. High in acidity, it has flavors of white peach and coconut.",87,Leto 2015 The Hidden One Sauvignon Blanc (St. Helena),,,,
"Made from 100% Montepulciano, this opens with aromas of rubber, coffee and espresso. The palate offers black fruit sensations, alongside slightly bitter tannins. This is simply structured and already accessible, so drink soon.",85,Piantate Lunghe 2011  Rosso Conero,,,,
"Made to be drunk young, this is a soft, ripe and fruity wine. It has a juicy blackberry flavor, plenty of acidity and a soft, smooth aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",88,Famille Laplace 2015 Aramis Rouge Tannat-Syrah Tannat-Syrah (Vin de France),,,,
"The wine has bold tannins, generous fruit and an excellent future. With its concentration and density, it needs time to soften. For now, the black fruit flavors are developing well, balanced with acidity and ripe tannins. Drink from 2021.",91,Château de Birot 2015 Vintage  (Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux),,,,
"This is soft and juicy with just a hint of a more tannic structure in the background. It is designed as an immediate easy-drinking wine, full of fruit and blackberry fruits.",85,DFJ Vinhos 2014 Casa do Lago Touriga Nacional-Cabernet Sauvignon (Lisboa),,,,
"Layers of luscious mango, tangerine and pineapple mark this gloriously fruity, forward Riesling. It's unabashedly plump, but delicate sweetness and staccato strikes of lemon and lime lend balance. It shows remarkable elegance for something so accessible and irresistibly gulpable.",90,Leonard Kreusch 2013 Rhein Riesling (Rheinhessen),,,,
"A very good Merlot except for some sharpness. The wine is dry and finely tannic, with black and red cherry, mocha, dried herb and tobacco flavors.",87,Folie à Deux 2008 Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"A hint of earthiness accents this medium-bodied, moderately tannic and berry-flavored wine. It smells savory and leathery, and tastes like raspberries and blackberries.",87,Fenestra 2010 Conjugation Red (Livermore Valley),,,,
"Dark, muscular and concentrated, with char, rubber and blackberry aromas. Thick but not soupy, with big tannins and firm acids. Flavors of blackberry, cassis and dark plum are drawn, leaving an oaky, minty finish. A good but arguably overextracted organic Shiraz.",85,Caliterra 2009 Bio-Sur Shiraz (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"Drawn and leathery on the nose, and then as it opens it reveals citrusy red fruit aromas. The palate is lean and tight, with light cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. Toasty, dry and a bit buttery tasting on the finish.",86,Marqués de la Concordia 2008 Hacienda Abascal Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"Fresh citrus notes make this beautiful rosé smell like a zesty white wine. The palate, however, adds the fresh delight of ripe strawberry fruit. This adds up to a refreshing, superdry and elegant but fruitful pink summer wine.",90,Biokult 2015 Rosé Zweigelt (Austria),,,,
"This fruity wine has fresh pineapple, peach and white fruit flavors. It is crisp and dry, with an attractive touch of honey. This would be a great partner with Asian foods.",86,Château de la Roulerie 2014 Le Petit Chenin Chenin Blanc (Anjou),,,,
"This wine's orange and lemon aromas are crisp and fresh overall. And like all standard Chilean Chardonnay, it's plump and round. The wine tastes of melon, honey and peach, and even as it turns slender in flavor, the finish remains strong.",85,Casa Silva 2011 Reserva Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"Primary fruit flavors of cranberry are at the core here, with medium concentration and acidity. Flavors of leaf and stem come into play and turn the finish slightly bitter. Give this until 2015.",86,Duck Pond 2012 Fries Family Cellars Pinot Noir (Oregon),,,,
"As is often the case, a poor red wine vintage in Bordeaux is a good year for sweet wines. This unctuous wine, still young and dominated by 95% Sémillon, is beautifully balanced. Its honey and botrytis flavors give it a dry edge that comfortably contrasts with the opulent sweetness. The acidity, a source of freshness, gives the wine the lift it needs. Drink this serious and major wine from 2023.",95,Château Clos Haut-Peyraguey 2013  Sauternes,,,,
Bottlings of this variety remain an extreme rarity but it's showing a lot of promise in the state. This wine has aromas of wet stone and star fruit that are followed by a full feeling yet still elegant palate that displays a textured mouthfeel and a lingering finish.,90,Syncline 2015 Boushey Vineyard Grenache Blanc (Yakima Valley),,,,
"For an entry-level wine, Rosso dei Notri is a sophisticated and compelling red. A blend of Sangiovese (60%), Merlot, Syrah and Cabernet, it boasts dense extraction and a chewy, chunky mouthfeel. Aromas include bursting blueberry, talc powder and smoked bacon. Bright acidity appears on the finish.",90,Tua Rita 2006 Rosso dei Notri Red (Toscana),,,,
"Siduri has a good track record with this vineyard. The ‘07 is not a longterm ager, but if you're looking for a complex Russian River Pinot for now and through 2011, this will please. Dry and silky and complex, it has fully ripened cherry, currant, cola, rose petal and spice flavors.",91,Siduri 2007 Sapphire Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Superripe in blackberry, red plum, cherry, mocha, fig and caramel flavors, this wine certainly scores high on the deliciousness factor. It could use greater structural depth and complexity but is good overall.",87,Addamo 2005 Reserve Syrah (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"This straightforward wine opens with scents of prune, blue flower, coffee and resin. The aromas follow through to the round, accessible palate along with fleshy blackberry and a hint of anise. Drink through 2016.",87,Nativ 2013 Aglianico (Irpinia),,,,
"Extremely oaky and resiny, this offers aromas of wood grain, resin, vanilla and sawdust that crowd out any fruit that might seek to escape. The palate feels heavy and resiny, with flavors of wood, vanilla and coconut, but again almost no fruit. This is 70% Chardonnay and 30% Sémillon.",85,Bressia 2011 Lágrima Canela White (Mendoza),,,,
"Aragosta is one of those wonderfully light and crisp Italian whites that would pair so well with the seafood dishes we love most (fried calamari and crab cakes, for example). Tonic aromas of peach, citrus and white flower emerge from the nose.",86,Santa Maria La Palma 2010 Aragosta  (Vermentino di Sardegna),,,,
"There's an exotic, almost Indian personality, with aromas of dark spice, clove and cardamom. Black fruit, prune and currant are also in evidence. Bold, black and inky thick. It's soft, round and long on the close with pretty freshness, too.",93,Poggio Nardone 2007  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"This wine provides aromas of iron, red currant, cranberry and herb, along with a rubbing alcohol note that provides a bit of distraction. It's reserved but flavorful, with fruit and savory notes lingering on the tart, extended finish.",90,Ross Andrew 2010 Old Block Boushey Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Aromas of powdered bubble gum, plum and chlorine aren't great, nor is the clamping, gritty feeling palate. With flavors of tart citrus and not much more, this is a limited but decent South American rosé.",84,Piattelli 2014 Premium Rosé of Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),,,,
"Big and bold, this opens with aromas of mature dark-skinned berry, exotic spice, leather and resin. The concentrated full-bodied palate delivers black cherry steeped in spirits, raspberry compote, vanilla and nutmeg framed in velvety tannins. There is just enough fresh acidity lifts the finish.",90,Arduini 2013  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,,,,
"A juicy, fruity wine that is named after the Knights Templar who built a magnificent castle and convent in the local city of Tomar. It is fresh with red berry acidity and some perfumed tannins. It should be ready to drink soon, but wait until the end of 2016 for the best results.",87,Quinta do Cavalinho 2013 Templários Colheita Seleccionada Red (Tejo),,,,
"This opens with aromas of toast, vanilla and stewed plum. The rich, monolithic palate offers fleshy black cherry, vanilla, anisette, plum cake and a confectionary note alongside round tannins. Drink 2016–2022.",88,Tenute Silvio Nardi 2010 Poggio Doria  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"Fragrant with pretty berry scents, this compact wine rewards some hours of breathing time. The tangy fruit is complemented by streaks of herb, mineral and citrus peel, all woven together into a gently fading finish that adds a lick of dark chocolate.",91,Amavi 2009 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Char, firepit, barrel spice and herb aromas lead to elegantly styled cranberry flavors in this wine. The tannins lend a light structure.",88,Finn Hill 2013 L'abime Corfu Crossing Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This inexpensive Aussie Shiraz seems to have deteriorated in recent vintages. The 2007 tastes sweet, filled with candied fruit and turning a bit cloying on the finish.",80,Red Knot 2007 Shiraz (South Australia),,,,
"Though it's 92% Cabernet Sauvignon, this includes a splash of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. The pretty, floral nose is all about rose petals and milk chocolate. It tightens up in the mouth and battens down with blueberry, blue plum, milk chocolate and a somewhat astringent finish. A streak of smoke and tar runs through the tannins.",89,Januik 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Packaged in the appellation's specially designed bottle, this Syrah from Steve Beckmen's mountaintop vineyard shows smashed blackberry, elderberry, graphite and roast beef aromas. Meaty flavors show strongly on the palate, where herbal touches of thyme and rosemary cling to the firm tannic structure. Vibrant acidity suggests good cellaring potential. Drink 2019–2029.",92,Beckmen 2014 Purisima Mountain Vineyard Syrah (Ballard Canyon),,,,
"A blend of grapes from seven well-known vineyards, this Pinot is made in a widely appealing style. Delicately silky but crisp with acidity, it has flavors of raspberry and cherry jam, cola and mooshu plum sauce, along with some sweet new oak.",86,Schug 2011 Pinot Noir (Carneros),,,,
"This is divided relatively evenly among the components—40% Grenache, 31% Syrah and 29% Mourvèdre. A pretty plum shade, it's still showing youthful tart acidic flavors. Cranberry, strawberry, raspberry and a touch of apple are all here, with more of that tart astringency as it concludes. This should continue to improve through 2021.",88,Quady North 2014 G-S-M (Rogue Valley),,,,
"A decent everyday sipper. Soft and a little dull in texture, it's rich in blackberry, currant, chocolate and pecan pie flavors.",84,CC 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"A lovely, heady lift of lemon, peach and passion fruit dances on the nose. This rich sweet-fruited tropicality is played out fully on the medium-sweet palate where the passion fruit swirls tartly alongside sweet ripe generous peach. It is the passion-fruit aroma and tartness that gives this a real edge. This not only has sweetness but a real tropical thrill. It's a very concentrated, pure-fruited wine with lots of promise. Drink 2017–2027.",94,Domaine Fernand Engel 2015 Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"The local Beira grape, Maria Gomes, makes a star turn in this apricot and peach flavored wine. The ripe fruit is cut by fresh, crisp lime juice, adding crispness. A final tang of orange completes the picture.",88,Luis Pato 2013 Maria Gomes (Beira Atlantico),,,,
"Whiffs of cedar and baking spices lead to ripe blackberry and boysenberry flavors in this well-balanced and easy to appreciate wine. The ample fruit flavors are hard to resist, and the supple, modestly tannic texture is just right.",90,Amador Cellars 2013 Cooper & Karmere Vineyards Barbera (Amador County),,,,
"With a sweet finish, this easy white wine has ripe flavors of oranges and limes. Brisk acidity helps keep the finish clean and zippy.",85,Delicato 2011 Domino Pinot Grigio (California),,,,
"As with all Beresan reds, this tilts sharply in the direction of dark fruits, earthy tannins, and streaks of iron and herb. The plum and berry flavors are framed in sappy acids, and the purity of the single-varietal wine is impressive. It's a fine alternative to Cabernet with that thick steak.",91,Beresan 2009 Malbec (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),,,,
"Dry Red No. 2 is virtually all Shiraz, though small amounts of Viognier, Marsanne and Mataro are often included. The 2008 displays slightly vegetal shadings of capsicum and tomato that may prove controversial, but there's ample cassis as well, rounded out by a cedar note. Its medium weight and delicate, silky texture combine to impart those ineffable qualities of grace and elegance.",94,Yarra Yering 2008 Dry Red Wine No. 2 Shiraz-Viognier (Yarra Valley),,,,
A sweet Lodi Zin with much chocolate and mint from beginning to end.,84,Grands Amis Winery 2008 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),,,,
"Initially mineral and austere, but after a moment, the richer sweet berry fruits come through. The wine has spice from new wood as well as a solid core of dry tannins. The aftertaste reveals the dense texture, and the aging potential.",90,Château Belle-Vue 2008  Haut-Médoc,,,,
"Dark, sweet and candied on the nose, with hints of raisin and licorice that become more prominent in the mouth. Saturated but also somewhat monotone and single-leveled in terms of flavor, where you get a narrow band of sweet black cherry and raisin in front of a short finish. Very nice as always, but not the best Allende we've reviewed.",89,Finca Allende 2006 Allende  (Rioja),,,,
"Aromas of Bosc pear, apple, diesel and apricot lead to elegant fruit flavors. It drinks just a hair off dry. The concentration seems a bit wanting but what's there is well balanced.",88,Pacific Rim 2014 Solstice Vineyard Riesling (Yakima Valley),,,,
"This is an easygoing but richly flavored wine that starts with light toast and spice aromas preceding somewhat sweet jammy flavors, a soft texture and medium body. Petite Sirah, Zinfandel, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon formed the blend.",87,Buck Shack 2014 Small Batch Red (Lake County),,,,
"There is the faintest prickle on this dry, ripe and creamy wine. It has ripe acidity with crisp apple and green plum fruits. There is just the edge of minerality to give this wine texture. Drink now.",86,Quinta da Raza 2015 Dom Diogo Colheita Seleccionada Arinto (Vinho Verde),,,,
"This Roero offers very good intensity of aromas that are characterized by layers of white cherry, wild berry and exotic spice. The wine offers a soft, velvety feel in the mouth although those tight tannins definitely appear on the close.",88,Cascina Cà Rossa 2007 Audinaggio  (Roero),,,,
"Aromas of Sherry and barrel resin are all you get from this wood-fermented, oxidized number. While neither foul nor severe, the all-wood nature of this is overly dominant and not pleasant enough to stand on its own.",81,Attis 2013 Nana Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"This textbook Barolo's new leather, cake spice and menthol aromas jump out of the glass. On the firmly structured palate, cinnamon and licorice notes underscore red cherry, cranberry and orange zest flavors. Tight, noble tannins and bright acidity provide the framework, suggesting it will age beautifully for decades. Drink 2023–2043.",97,Brovia 2013 Brea Vigna Cà Mia  (Barolo),,,,
"This is a plush, earthy Montepulciano d'Abruzzo Riserva that opens with aromas of ripe fruit, leather, tobacco and exotic spice. The wine shows impressive elegance in the mouth, thanks to its polished tannins and drying, mineral finish.",90,Cantina Tollo 2008 Cagiòlo Riserva  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),,,,
"Fresh boysenberry juice aromas meet with licorice, iron, smoke, cinnamon, rooibos tea and dried lilacs on the nose of this blend of 65% Barbera and 35% Sangiovese. It's soft on the sip and then quite tart, with blackberry fruit cut by tangy plum skins that are lifted by rustic tobacco and leather notes.",90,Opolo 2012 Montagna-Mare Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"The color on this is surprisingly evolved, showing more brick than garnet, while the nose offers underbrush, tobacco, fennel and red berry. The palate is closed and rather lean, offering raw red cherry, licorice, menthol and mineral alongside assertive but fine-grained tannins.",88,Podere Scopetone 2010  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"A mature, serious wine, showing toasty flavors that are rounding out the fruit. A definite food wine, its richness tempered with a bite of acidity and delicious final crispness.",88,Dopff & Irion NV Cuvée Prestige Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),,,,
"The region's most widely available wine remains a solid benchmark. Exotic aromas of citrus blossom and tropical fruit make a bold impression, followed up on the palate by ample weight and a touch of oiliness. Drink now–2016.",91,E. Guigal 2011  Condrieu,,,,
"This vineyard is far better known for Pinot Noir, although Failla has excelled with its Chardonnay. Novy's 2010 isn't particularly like Chardonnay. Too floral. Could almost be Viognier. Yet it's a fine wine, crisp and rich in orange, lime and honeysuckle flavors.",87,Novy 2010 Keefer Ranch Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This blend of 45% Sangiovese, 20% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Cabernet Franc, 5% Petit Verdot and 5% Freisa is very approachable and food-friendly, showing baked black-cherry pie, star anise and pine resin on the nose. The palate dries up with red plum and flashes of strawberry set against shaved clove spices. It's layered in flavor but softly textured.",91,Toccata 2013 Classico Red (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"This is a blend of 67% Merlot grown in Carneros with 33% Cabernet Franc from Atlas Peak. Tense in bittersweet clove, tea and big, extracted tannins, it settles down midpalate to reveal an underlying crispness of red fruit.",88,Virage 2012 Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"This is a solid effort, with good varietal character and definition. Half was fermented in stainless, half in neutral barrel, and the wine was given extended (130 days) lees contact. The herbal, peppery tang of the grape is clearly there, with intriguing hints of slate laced through the finish. This would be dynamite with sushi.",87,Daedalus 2006 Elton Vineyard Grüner Veltliner (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Aromas of rubber band, smoky berry and plum come with herbal, rustic overtones. This feels grabby and tannic, while punchy acidity releases angular black-fruit flavors. A roasted, meaty tasting finish brings the heat and feels aggressive.",85,Vecordia 2011 Roble  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"The sourcing is Bien Nacido and the old Ashley's, two of the best vineyards in the county. The pedigree shows in the wine's balance and harmony, while the warm vintage is evident in the pie-filling fruit and spice flavors and a touch of funk. Probably at its best now and in the next few years.",89,Wild Horse 2004 Cheval Sauvage Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Some lemon-zest texture characterizes this otherwise rounded wine. It has good bright fruitiness, a hint of wood and full white fruit flavors. It needs to age, so drink from early 2015.",87,Château Deffends 2012 White (Côtes de Provence),,,,
Appealing aromas of citrus rind and pear lead to fleshy full-fruit flavors. The alcohol pokes through at times but it still provides enjoyment.,87,Maryhill 2015 Proprietor's Reserve Otis Vineyard Albariño (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Vegetal notes, mild citrus and sulfuric aromas make up the nose of this fresh but limited SB. Herbal, peppery green-fruit flavors are lean and finish with notes of rosemary and other green herbs.",85,Ventisquero 2015 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"The sweetness of this wine is well contained by acidity, with spice, lemon and honey flavors. It has fine fruit, a crisp texture and a feeling of lightness. Drink from 2020.",91,Château Doisy-Védrines 2014 Petit Védrines  (Barsac),,,,
"This well-priced white wine is simple and clean with fruit-driven aromas of peach, melon and honey. You can taste sweet notes from the strong sunshine and the wine has good density and firmness throughout.",85,Farnese 2007  Trebbiano d'Abruzzo,,,,
"This pure Merlot is made from fruit that was sourced from Bacchus, Conner Lee, Dionysus and Klipsun vineyards. Sappy, spicy and loaded with black fruits, this delivers plenty of flavor across the rich midpalate. Notes of black cherries, coffee grounds, licorice and smoke all come into play.",90,Arbor Crest 2010 Four Vineyards Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Plum and cranberry mark the entry into this clone-specific wine, which becomes expansively juicy as it makes its way on the palate. Orange peel, cranberry and cardamom provide an exotic take on the variety, ending in earth and spice.",92,August Briggs 2013 Dijon Clones Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),,,,
"This red opens with reticent jammy aromas that expand to include licorice and asphalt notes. The wine is so saturated that it weighs down on the palate. Flavors of savory berry fruits are matched by saucy tomato and spice notes. On a sinewy finish, tomato sauce, raspberry and red-plum flavors stick out. Drink through 2026.",93,Cellers Unió 2013 Roureda Llicorella Gran Selecció Vitis 60 Grenache-Carignan (Priorat),,,,
"The merest touch of lemon appears on the nose. The palate is equally reticent, only gradually revealing a touch of orange blossom and apple peel around a very lemony, bright, linear core. This has concentration but no heaviness, there is depth and toned muscle. The finish is dry and alluring, focusing on that lemon purity with a lovely earthy edge of apple peel. Drink 2019–2030.",93,Jean Biecher & Fils 2016 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"This is a fruity, immediately drinkable wine. It has red berry flavors and bright acidity that gives the wine freshness and a light, juicy touch. Light tannins add structure to the bright aftertaste.",86,Quinta da Foz 2013 Vinha da Foz Red (Douro),,,,
"The wine is ripe and soft with black-currant acidity and gentle tannins. There is a firm structure behind the jammy fruit flavors, enough to give the wine support. It is ready to drink.",87,Herdade da Comporta 2012 Private Selection Red (Península de Setúbal),,,,
"Fresh, crisp, lightly grassy flavors make this wine instantly refreshing. There are touches of apricots and green plums, and a center which is ripe and full.",86,Vie di Romans 2001 Piere Sauvignon Blanc (Friuli Isonzo),,,,
"A soft, simple wine, with candied cherry and raspberry flavors. It has a sweet finish. Drink now.",83,Ticket Cellars 2008 Standing Ovation Sangiovese (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"From an outstanding vintage in the Willamette Valley, here's a beautifully blended Pinot with impressive concentration and detail. Spicy berry and red plum fruit is speckled with chocolate drops, coffee beans and a whiff of clean straw. Drink any time; it's ready to go.",91,Lange 2012 Three Hills Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This solid value wine would pair perfectly with pizza. An easy expression of Syrah, the wine is soft and silky, with simple, fruity layers of blueberry and cherry.",86,Viticultori Associati Canicatti 2008 Aquilae Syrah (Sicilia),,,,
"All of LVV's 2011 Saint-Joseph's are impressive. This one is fuller bodied and more lushly textured than the others while still showing intense Syrah character. Blueberry fruit and hickory smoke mark the nose, while the palate reveals remarkable nuances of crushed stone yet ends long and velvety. Drink now–2020.",92,Les Vins de Vienne 2011 L'Arzelle  (Saint-Joseph),,,,
"Aimed at the millennial market, this Bob Lindquist GSM blend shows light aromas of stewed red cherries, cola and lavender. The palate is light and fresh with purple flowers, toast, charred blackberries and candied cherries. It's a great pairing for backyard barbecues.",87,Qupé 2013 Red (Central Coast),,,,
"Tropical aromas mixed with pear are just right, and overall this Treixadura-Godello-Torrontes blend is ripe and delicious. It's round but zesty, with pear, kiwi and honeydew flavors. It stays on message from front to back, and despite its size and ripeness it keeps everything in balance. Drink now.",89,Finca Teira 2006 White (Ribeiro),,,,
"The winery's most approachable Cabernet when young, this features notes of chocolate-covered cherry and red and blue berry, intermixed with soft, yet substantial tannins. Peppercorn dances on the palate through the finish. A high-octane intensity suggests that the wine should spend more time in the cellar, through 2021.",91,Hall 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
This is a wine that's made to be enjoyed young. It is fresh and fruity with a high proportion of Aragon (a.k.a. Tempranillo) giving a sophisticated touch of dusty tannins and red berry fruit. The wine is ripe and ready to drink.,87,Companhia das Quintas 2014 Portas da Herdade Red (Alentejano),,,,
"Try this superrich wine as a twist on Chardonnay. It's full bodied and creamy, with intricate flavors of tropical fruits, limes, oranges, white chocolate, vanilla and cinnamon spice. Straddles the border between dry and off-dry.",86,Occasio 2009 Del Arroyo Vineyard Pinot Gris (Livermore Valley),,,,
"Savory notes of bacon and cured meat open the bouquet of this nicely evolved Brunello. The wine is raw and sharp on the close with brambly notes of sour fruit and white cherry. Overall, the wine presents a balanced juxtaposition between sweet-and-sour fruit that seems characteristic of the 2008 vintage.",89,La Colombina 2008  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Another terrific offering from Shafer, this is a wine that seems to do well regardless of the vintage. It always shows a firm minerality and slight herbaceousness, with tropical fruit flavors and a smoky coating of fine oak. It's a shade less opulent than the 2009, making this very elegant and refined, yet still rich and complex. Don't drink it too cold—airing brings out subtle nuances.",93,Shafer 2010 Red Shoulder Ranch Chardonnay (Carneros),,,,
"Despite herbaceous aromas of eucalyptus and thyme, this choppy, grating blend of Carignan, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec offers forward bold plum and currant flavors along with can't-miss herbal notes. This is aggressive on the finish, with mild heat and raw tannins.",87,Odfjell 2012 Capítulo by Odfjell Carignan-Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec Red (Central Valley),,,,
"This is a powerful wine, made to age for a long time, from this estate which is performing in top gear. Complex tannins and dark fruits both make their presence felt. It has weight, ripeness and a dense structure. A great success, it is unlikely to be ready to drink before 2027.",96,Château Smith Haut Lafitte 2014  Pessac-Léognan,,,,
"There's a polished mineral note here of lead pencil or graphite that gives this wine very direct and immediate appeal. At the back, you'll notice subtle tones of black fruit, plum, ripe cherry and spice. The wine is concentrated and dense with drying tannins at the close. This beautiful wine can age many more years.",93,Caprili 2004 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"In this vintage the Klipsun Vineyard Merlot (75%) is blended with Cabernet Sauvignon from Ciel du Cheval (22%) and Cabernet Franc from the Taptiel Vineyard, all prime property on Washington's Red Mountain. Tight and focused, this exceptionally well-structured Merlot mixes red and black fruits with exotic spices. Muscular and built to age, it's an amazing wine.",94,Quilceda Creek 1999 Merlot (Washington),,,,
"Yeasty, rounded and almost earthy notes are conjured up on the nose. That almost soy-like yeastiness remains on the palate, where citrus zest cuts through the richness. Texturally this is creamy and buffered, but not without tone.",89,Kurt Angerer 2013 Loam Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),,,,
"This dark-colored Merlot offers reduced berry, chocolate and herbal aromas. In the mouth, it's displaying rubbery tannins. Dried berry and oak-based flavors of spice and wood grain finish with hints of clove on a finish that could use more harmony and depth.",87,Viña Casablanca 2014 Nimbus Single Vineyard Merlot (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"On the nose, the red berry aromas are rough and scratchy. The palate feels acidic and clipped, with tart flavors of red plum, cranberry and pie cherry. The finish is long and acidic.",82,Tierra de Antes 2010 Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"A tangy feeling on the palate makes this light-bodied wine especially refreshing. It has appley, floral aromas and flavors, good acidity and a clean, bracing texture.",88,McFadden 2015 Blue Quail Pinot Gris (Potter Valley),,,,
"Earthy aromas of blue flowers, game, tilled soil, red berry and leather come together in the glass. The elegant palate offers juicy red cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon and savory herb, while a backbone of firm but fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity provides an age-worthy structure. It's still a bit austere, but will blossom into a beauty over the next several years. Drink 2016–2025.",93,Contucci 2010  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,,,,
"The cool vintage was a challenge, which speaks well of the winery's vineyard team. Blended with 5% Petite Sirah, the wine is unusually complex and sumptuous, even by Dry Creek standards. The flavors are rich with wild summer blueberries and blackberries, and savory with pepper and other exotic spices.",93,Dry Creek Vineyard 2011 Somers Ranch Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Fresh and fragrant, this offers aromas of rose and violet with a whiff of woodland berry. The elegant palate delivers bright red cherry, crushed strawberry, clove and peppercorn alongside polished tannins and fresh acidity. Drink through 2020.",90,Lornano 2010 Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"The richness of this bottling seems to have been falling over the last few vintages. The '06 is very dry and tart, with modest cherry, rhubarb, cola and spice flavors that are unlikely to evolve.",85,Dutton-Goldfield 2006 Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Franc (42%), Merlot (41%) and Cabernet Sauvignon. Aromas of flowers, herb, pencil lead and red fruit lead to light, flavorful, reserved and lengthy fruit flavors. The tannins are tightly wound and need some time to uncoil. Best after 2022.",90,Fall Line 2013 Artz Vineyard Red (Red Mountain),,,,
"This opens with bright fruit notes of blueberry and wild cherry, followed by savory touches of exotic spice and green tea. It offers heft and endurance without the chewy thickness found in some Amarone.",87,Ca' Rugate 2010 Campo Lavei  (Valpolicella Superiore),,,,
"Toast, hay, pear, light ginger and savory herb aromas take shape in the glass. The linear palate offers tart green apple, citrus, brimstone and a smoky note, while crisp acidity adds freshness.",88,Costantino 2013 DeAetna Bianco  (Etna),,,,
"Initially tannic, this concentrated wine shows itself to be young, with its structure still waiting to open. A dry texture lies over the big berry flavors that will develop over the next year.",88,Cooperativa Reguengos de Monsaraz 2010 Monsaraz Red (Alentejo),,,,
"This is a wine that feels heavy, with rich apricot flavors that lack freshness and balance. It's not a wine for aging, but will go well with cakes or pastries.",85,Rosenhof 2010 Orion Eiswein Grüner Veltliner (Burgenland),,,,
"Something of a disappointment in this vintage, a wine that has an awkward bitter character. The wine is fine enough, with rich berry fruits, but misses the style of previous vintages.",87,Herdade do Esporão 2008 Esporão Reserva Red (Alentejo),,,,
"An icon in Australia, Mount Mary has never made a huge splash here in the States. Perhaps because such miniscule quantities are available (30 cases of the 2005 Quintet). The 2005 Quintet presents as a medium-bodied, nicely rounded Bordeaux-style blend, marrying cedary, meaty notes with cherry fruit and graced with touches of cinnamon and mushroom. It's nicely balanced and reasonably complex; ready to drink now.",88,Mount Mary 2005 Quintet Red (Yarra Valley),,,,
"This wine is firm and taut. Cassis, mulberry and blueberry fruit finishes with some dusty tannins and crisp acids. Drink now–2022.",89,Esk Valley 2015 Gimblett Gravels Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec-Cabernet Franc Red (Hawke's Bay),,,,
"Ripe strawberry pie and cigar box aromas frame the nose on this top-end offering from Broken Earth. It's surprisingly light on the palate, with cherry pie and cranberry tartness leading the way alongside bright acidity and dainty tannins.",89,Broken Earth 2010 CV Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"Aromas of toast, scorched earth, leather, dried herb and a balsamic note emerge on this solid, brawny red. The warm, chewy palate delivers raspberry compote, chopped mint, dried sage, coffee and licorice framed in close-grained, drying tannins. You'll also notice the wallop of evident alcohol. It shows the heat of the vintage so drink sooner rather than later.",88,Tassi 2011  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"This opens with violet, red berry and leather aromas. The savory, straightforward palate offers ripe red cherry, raspberry and clove notes, with a hint of sage and fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2020.",89,Citille di Sopra 2015  Rosso di Montalcino,,,,
"Chunky berry and cured meat aromas turn sweaty and herbal with airing. In the mouth, this is wholly basic. Flavors of soupy, herbal berry fruits lack definition, while the finish deals molasses and peppery bitterness.",83,Fabre Montmayou 2010 Phebus Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"Secondary characteristics like mushrooms, hay, and nuts make this unusual but in a mostly charming way. Tropical fruits take a back seat on the palate; Green beans and peas are in the driver's seat. Texturally it has a surprising weight, but there's enough acidity to keep things fresh.",86,Invivo 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"Here's a simple but well made wine, with raspberry, cherry and red currant nuances punctuated by a hint of white pepper. It's soft and ready to drink young, with a nice freshness. This will go well with mushroom-stuffed ravioli.",86,Cantina di Soave 2011 Rocca Alata  (Valpolicella Ripasso),,,,
"The Fairvalley Chardonnay begins with aromas of lemon, pear and spice, and on the palate, offers citrusy, spicy flavors that are both refreshing and appealing. Though not the most complex wine, it's a good go-to wine for everyday drinking. Solid and well made.",86,Fairvalley 2008 Chardonnay (Coastal Region),,,,
"This delivers a playful touch of sweetness in the mouth, with bold aromas of blackberry, plum, spice and leather. It shows harmony, with a velvety mouthfeel.",88,Nals Margreid 2009 Aus Gries Lagrein (Alto Adige),,,,
"Healthy and lively fruit characterize this vibrant Brunello from Capanna. The wine offers cheerful buoyancy and pristine aromas of red cherry and exotic spice. It's tight and firm on the palate with a good balance of acidity and tannins and a luminous, polished feel overall.",92,Capanna 2004  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Linear and refreshing, this vibrant sparkler offers aromas of ripe citrus, yeasty bread crust and a whiff of Mediterranean brush. A blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Nero, the sleek, polished palate delivers ripe lemon, nectarine, rosemary and a mineral note alongside bright acidity. It finishes clean and dry.",90,Donnafugata 2012 Brut Metodo Classico Sparkling (Sicilia),,,,
"Wild-berry, truffle, leather, menthol and sunbaked soil aromas lead the way. Tightly wound but ripe tannins wrap around the firmly structured palate, underscoring mature Morello cherry, black raspberry, white pepper, licorice and chopped Mediterranean herb. A subtle hint of game closes the finish. Drink 2019–2026.",90,Donatella Cinelli Colombini 2011  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"With some age, this bone-dry wine has softened and filled out. There's still a lemon aroma as well as crisp acidity on the palate, but they are less tight now, rounded and with a fine balance between fruit and acidity. It is still a year off maturity, so wait until 2018.",93,Lombard et Cie 2008 Brut Nature Grand Cru Millésime  (Champagne),,,,
"Rich honeysuckle, marzipan and oak aromas meet bright lemongrass on the nose of this bottling, showing both the fresh and oxidative sides of the grape. Smoked chicken and brioche notes are prominent on the palate, leading to a tangy, botanical, juniper-laced finish.",90,J. Lohr 2015 October Night Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),,,,
"Ripe, earthy aromas of berry fruits and raisins come with lactic oak and baking spice notes on the nose. Drying and tannic on the palate, this wine shows tart flavors of red berry and currant, with vanilla and oak tones leading to a creamy, soft finish.",87,Viña Eguía 2009 Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"This tight wine has intense acidity, smoky tannins, a light texture and an attractive strawberry-jelly-flavored finish.",89,Frey-Sohler 2009 Fleur de Granit Pinot Noir (Alsace),,,,
"This Bolgheri Superiore shows luscious and clean notes of mature black fruit, plum, prune and loads of vibrant black cherry. Wood elements of spice, tobacco and leather are well integrated and the wine is impressively smooth and generous on the finish.",92,Podere Guado al Melo 2007  Bolgheri Superiore,,,,
"This fresh Vermentino from Lazio in Central Italy opens with fresh notes of cut grass, peach and citrus. There's a touch of dusty mineral that adds a dry feeling to the finish.",85,Cantine Lupo 2010 Terra Marique Vermentino (Lazio),,,,
"Pinched on the nose but solid in terms of aromas: blackberry, cassis and a touch of oak come together well. The palate is just big enough to hint at richness, while plum and berry flavors are good despite being a touch briney. Toast and mint come up on the finish.",86,Emiliana 2010 Natura Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),,,,
"A warm, toasty wine, maybe with too much wood at the moment, but with proper plump, ripe peach flavors and an edge of apple-skin acidity. The wine needs aging —give it 4–5 years.",92,Albert Bichot 2007 Domaine du Pavillon Les Charmes Premier Cru  (Meursault),,,,
"This deeply fruited wine is a rich cranberry/purple in hue, and flavors put blueberry and plum front and center. There's a touch of cassis, and the tannins are brushed velvety smooth, while remaining substantial, even muscular. Bergamot, pomegranate and marionberry flavors come through as well, in a lush cascade of spicy fruits.",93,Lavinea 2014 Lazy River Vineyard Pinot Noir,,,,
"Another of the producer's 100% varietal, single-vineyard wines, this is a lovely quaff, dark black in color and attitude, with a taste of black olive tapenade.

This Riserva from Calabria offers sweet aromas of Christmas spice and candied fruit backed by tobacco and tealeaf.

Pair it with something sweet such as pasta with gorgonzola or piquant cheese.,86,Ippolito 1845 2004 Colli del Mancuso Riserva Superiore  (Cirò Classico),,,,
"There's a sweet, succulent quality to this sparkler, expressing notes of lemon pie and honeydew. It's soft and creamy on the finish thanks to the rich and persistent quality of the effervescence.",87,Conte Collalto NV Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
"Toro is known for its massive wines, and this fits the bill. Oak, tobacco and mocha aromas share space on the nose with cassis and berry scents. Fully extracted tannins and resiny oak create a sizable palate of plum, cassis and vanilla flavors. Oak-derived spice notes inflect the intense black fruit flavors on the finish. Drink through 2026.",92,Matsu 2014 EL Viejo  (Toro),,,,
This is a beautifully mature Champagne with layers of toast and almond flavors overlaying its rich white fruit. It's concentrated and tense with minerality and acidity within a framework of broad ripeness. Drink now.,93,Collet NV Esprit Couture Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"An unusual but alluring perfume of boxwood and spicy grapefruit zest rises from the glass. The palate follows on light feet, with a delicate, translucent body that shimmers in green citrus and spice tones.

"This wine is light and fruity, well balanced with plenty of red berry flavors and only light tannins. It will be fresh and ready to drink from late 2016. The 30-acre vineyard on one of the appellation's highest spots was bought in 2009 by Denis Durantou, the owner of Château l'Église Clinet in Pomerol.",85,Château Montlanderie 2013  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,,,,
"Fully ripe, this opens with scents of hibiscus tea, mixed berry, plum and black cherry. The fruit flavors are bold and intense, right on the border of showing some prune character. Streaks of balsamic, tobacco and black olive make it a real potpourri. Drink up now through 2018.",89,Leah Jørgensen Cellars 2013 Loiregon Cabernet Franc (Southern Oregon),,,,
"From a vineyard that's northwest of the already very coastal Sta. Rita Hills, this racy and unique bottling shows clean precise lines of grapefruit pith, almond and key lime pie on the nose. There's a vibrant coil of acidity driving through the palate, with flavors of lime, lemongrass and lime skins, wrapped in a chalky crisp texture. It will age with grace or pair perfectly with sushi today.",94,Cebada 2014 Chardonnay (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Aged three months in wood, there is a noticeable amount of toast and spice in this wine. That balances the blend of Chardonnay and Antão Vaz, yielding a smooth character of bright fruit flavors blending with warm apricot notes. Drink from 2017.",89,Cooperativa Agricola de Santo Isidro de Pegoes 2014 Adega de Pegões Colheita Seleccionada White (Península de Setúbal),,,,
"A blend of Riesling, Pinot Gris, Gewurztraminer and Muscat, this is a wine that fascinates. Both fresh and rich, this wine combines strongly perfumed notes with a pure, steely texture. It is drinkable now, although it will be better in three years' time. Glass stopper",92,Domaine Pfister 2010 Cuvée 8 White (Alsace),,,,
"A strong followup to the excellent 2005, Amisfield's 2006 Pinot Noir seems riper and weightier, marrying dark black cherry and plum fruit with hints of chocolate and spice cake. Finishes with soft tannins and a slightly dusty feel. Drink now–2015.",91,Amisfield 2006 Pinot Noir (Central Otago),,,,
"This refreshing sparkling wine is made entirely from Chardonnay. It offers pear and Golden Delicious apple aromas and flavors, along with a hint of baked bread and almond notes. It's elegant, with a creamy texture and crisp acidity.",90,St. Pauls NV Praeclarus Cuvée Brut Chardonnay (Alto Adige),,,,
"With its new wood and mint flavors, this is a smooth, polished wine, full of delicious ripe black fruit flavors and acidity. The wine is elegant, the wood already well integrated into the fruit. Age for 3–4 years.",90,Château Saint-Sernin 2009 Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"A strong caramel aroma and flavor spoils the suggestions of fruit. They give a ripe, almost sweet character that doesn't match with the red-currant fruit flavors.",82,Château de la Vieille Tour 2015 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),,,,
"Bright and loaded with an earthy finesse, this offers alluring scents of wild berry, pressed violet, new leather, aromatic herb and a balsamic note. The ultrarefined palate doles out juicy red cherry, cranberry and star anise set against fresh acidity and firm, polished tannins. Drink 2019–2030.",92,Livio Sassetti 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"There is a lightly toasty aroma here. On the palate, this wine is ripe, rich and full in the mouth.It has a smooth, creamy texture that is round while keeping plenty of room for acidity. This attractive wine should be drunk now.",87,Collin-Bourisset 2013 Les Burdines  (Mâcon-Villages),,,,
"The Hospices de Saumur is a charitable foundation, with the Clos Cristal one of the donations of vineyards. This young, fruity 2011 shows some rough, rustic edges while also giving full, red berry fruits and some tight tannins. For aging over the next 2–3 years when it will smooth out.",88,Hospices de Saumur 2011 Clos Cristal  (Saumur-Champigny),,,,
"Very big, modern, sweet and oaky. And that doesn't mean it's bad, because the richness, high alcohol (15%), buttery barrel notes and candy-like qualities are all rendered well. Still, be on the watch for creamy oak, cinnamon, café mocha and butter more than precise, angular fruit character. Should get more integrated with another year of bottle age. The boisterous blend is Garnacha, Syrah and Mazuelo.",88,Can Blau 2006 Mas de Can Blau Red (Montsant),,,,
"Hints of smoke and roasted nut add a savory tone to the zesty lemon and pear flavors on this structured Chardonnay. Lusciously textured, with a touch of lemon curd and zingy tangerine acidity, it's a powerful wine with a long finish.",89,Sutor 2008 Chardonnay (Vipavska Dolina),,,,
"Another side of Steven Kent's Ghielmetti Vineyard designates, Clone 30 being a bit more viscous and woody than the Clone 337. This shows supple tannins, black cherry, chocolate and cranberry on the nose and in the wine, and a lengthy finish. Aging will benefit this wine.",90,Steven Kent 2007 Ghielmetti Vineyard Clone Thirty Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),,,,
"This dense, wood-laden wine has ripe spice and dark tannins. It's heavy with wood as well as black currant fruits and acidity. It is young and needs time to integrate, so don't drink before 2016.",86,Château Roc de Ségur 2013  Bordeaux,,,,
"92–94. Barrel sample. Solid, firm and tannic, this is a powerful success. It has equal weight of fruit and tannins and a palate that's intensely structured and complex. For long-term aging.",93,Château Beauregard 2012 Barrel Sample  (Pomerol),,,,
"This smells big but flat, with rich, jammy scents of berry and cherry. The palate comes across heavy and grabby. Flavors of pastry, lactic plum, berry and cassis are heavily influenced with oak, while the finish is full in feel but short in flavor. A blend of 62% Malbec, 26% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Syrah.",87,Hacienda del Plata 2009 Arriero Reserve Blend Red (Mendoza),,,,
"This tastes sweet and clean, with mango, peach and orange flavors that are brightened with zesty acidity.",85,Ruby Red 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (North Coast),,,,
"A high-end Malbec experience at a reasonable price, this boasts rich aromas of cola, graphite and boysenberry that leap from the glass. The palate is bright and just thick enough, with wild berry, cherry, plum and oak-based flavors. Another whack of oak, along with vanilla, chocolate and tobacco flavors, graces the finish. Drink now–2015.",91,Trapiche 2008 Finca Las Palmas Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Babcock's Grand Cuvée hasn't changed its style over the years. It remains dense and sappy in youth, showing extracted cherry, raspberry and cassis fruit, with complex notes of bacon, leather and spice. Not particularly subtle now, it should gain elegance in a few years. Best late 2008 through 2012.",90,Babcock 2006 Grand Cuvée Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Gorgeous from head to toe, this opens with cedar, maple, blackberry and the essence of schisty minerality. On the palate, it's tannic and firm but not overpowering. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, fig and vanilla finish with chocolaty notes and more than enough leftover berry fruit. Hold until 2017, then drink through 2024.",94,Mas d'en Gil 2009 Clos Fontà Red (Priorat),,,,
"Notes of mint and thyme add savory tones to bright, pristine flavors of cassis and black cherry in this blend of Merlot, Pinot Noir and Cabernet Sauvignon. Structured and full bodied, this has warm oak tones and striking acidity. It's delicious now, but it should continue to develop over the next five years.",91,Movia 2004 Veliko Red (Brda),,,,
"Deliciously rich and extracted in jammy raspberry, cherry and cola fruit, with lots of sweet oak adding vanilla and buttered toast. Could use greater depth, though, as it's a little one-dimensional. Drink now.",87,Bernardus 2009 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
The spicy nose already signals joy: Bosc pear is edged with mandarin and white-pepper spice. The concentrated palate flows with ripe juicy white-fleshed pear fruit but is given direction by gentle ripe citrus freshness and sheer bundling of flavor. There is welcome texture to the midpalate and beautifully penetrating zestiness. The finish is long and very moreish.,94,Alzinger 2015 Steinertal Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),,,,
"A fresh while spicy wine, this is full of apples and crisp pears that cut the rich texture. It's a fragrant wine, packed with acidity and touched by lemon, lime and spice. Drink this refreshing wine from 2016.",88,Château de Beauregard 2013  Pouilly-Fuissé,,,,
"The parcel called La Mission in the heart of the Mercurey vineyards is wholly owned by the Devillard family, so they call it a monopoly. It is a wine that effortlessly balances tangerine and lemon flavors with ripe spiced peaches and a tight mineral texture. The wine is still young, still developing, so wait until 2018.",93,Domaines Devillard 2014 Château de Chamirey La Mission Monopole  (Mercurey),,,,

"Made of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, this has subdued black-skinned fruit and underbrush aromas. Assertive tannins frame a palate of prune, tobacco and black pepper flavors. Drink soon to capture the remaining fruit.",87,Villa Montignana 2011 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"This wine combines elegance and power, complexity and drinkability. Orange rind, strawberry, flowers, Chinese Five Spice and a hint of raw meat all dance together on the pretty, lifted nose. The palate is satiny and leans more towards tart cranberry, with the spice character really shining, followed by superfine but sturdy tannins. Pair with roast duck, beef teriyaki, or a veggie stir fry.",93,Paxton 2015 Grenache (McLaren Vale),,,,
"This is an austere, elegant study in power and grace, blending 53% Merlot with 33% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Petit Verdot and 5% Cabernet Franc. Substantial and tannin-defined as many of its brethren of this vintage, it shows cedar, pencil shavings and a touch of tobacco, more savory than fruit-driven. Drink now through 2023.",92,Chimney Rock 2013 Elevage Red (Stags Leap District),,,,
"Give this dry, elegant Pinot a couple of years to let all the parts knit together. Right now, the oak stands out, and the acidity seems out of balance with the rich raspberry and persimmon fruit. It's a remarkably complex wine, however, and should be even better by 2016.",90,Kessler-Haak 2010 Kessler-Haak Vineyard Pommard Clone Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Awkward, opening with vegetal aromas that turn cloyingly sweet in the mouth. It's also a very acidic wine. Not offering much charm now.",83,Renwood 1995 Vintage Port Port (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),,,,
"This shows classic valley-floor aspects of dusty tannin, brushy sage and cedar, staying true to the Bordeaux varieties it holds. Pencil lead and mocha accent the medium-bodied background, while soft, pillowy tannins are approachable.",91,Oakville East 2013 Core Stone Red (Oakville),,,,
"A slightly prickly nose that offers hints of green herbs and cactus sets up the citrusy palate, brimming with grapefruit, orange and green-herb flavors. The finish is shear and citrusy, with cleansing acidity.",86,Pata Negra 2013 Verdejo (Rueda),,,,
"An ancient variety now seen rarely, this Códega do Larinho has produced a wine that has a steely texture and tangy citrus flavors. It is bright with acidity, lime and grapefruit fruits and so crisp. It is ready to drink.",88,Wines & Winemakers 2014 Lua Cheia em Vinhas Velhas Andreza Reserva Códega do Larinho (Douro),,,,
"An ultrapure nose and tons of polish and precision define this tasty reserve-style blend of several vineyards. Pretty much an easy-drinker, with an undercurrent of sweet cherries and vanilla. It hits all chords and fades away smooth. Style and power come in proper proportions. Will age nicely for at least five years.",91,Panther Creek 1998 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This Super-Tuscan-style wine won't be confused as anything from Tuscany. It's soft, tannic and very fruity, with a sugary finish. Bring on the hamburgers.",83,Pietra Santa 2009 Sassolino Sangiovese-Cabernet Sauvignon (Cienega Valley),,,,
"The style of Piper-Heidsieck's nonvintage Champagne is getting more and more refined. It is drier than in the past while also full of ripe white fruits. There is a tight structure, a hint of toast from bottle age and fresh acidity at the end. Ready to drink.",90,Piper-Heidsieck NV Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"A brilliant white wine, very tart in acidity, with mineral flavors that make your mouth water. The flavors veer toward bright, tart citrus fruits, with suggestions of Chinese five-spice. The grapes were biodynamically farmed, which may partially be why the wine is so pure.",89,Ca' del Solo 2007 Ca' del Solo Vineyard Albariño (Monterey County),,,,
"This is a small production wine blended by French sommeliers. The result is a soft, rich wine, deliciously ripe and perfumed. There are touches of honey as well as yellow fruits and mango juice. The acidity gives the wine a lift and makes a contrast to the richness of the wine. Drink now.",90,Producteurs Plaimont 2014 Le Faîte  (Saint-Mont),,,,
"This delivers the best of both worlds for this aromatic grape. Crispy cut-grass notes blossom into tropical pineapple guava and green papaya. A laser focus of lime on the palate subsequently opens toward green pears, freshly cut oregano and dill, and an apple skin-driven bitterness.",91,Refugio Ranch 2012 Tiradora Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"A huge wine that's tannic as nails but so aromatic and flavor packed. Toasted oak, mint, cola, maple, marzipan work the potent nose, while the saturated palate thumps along with massive black-fruit flavors and coffee, fudge and light herb accents. This is one of the most powerful wines from Spain or anywhere. Drink or hold.",94,Marques de Griñon 2005 Emeritus Red (Dominio de Valdepusa),,,,
"Now managed organically, this estate has produced a light, fruity wine. Fresh red berries are sustained by a firm tannin edge that offers a solid base for the fruitiness and acidity. Drink from 2017.",88,Château des Annereaux 2011  Lalande de Pomerol,,,,
"Easy and informal, this is exactly the style of wine you'll want to pour with family and friends at, say, an outdoor picnic or barbecue. Packaged in a screwcap bottle, the wine offers aromas of melon, citrus and pear.",85,Esperto 2009 Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie),,,,
"Just-squeezed lime mixes with soda for a light, refreshing aroma on this wine from the longtime Sauv Blanc producer in the middle of the Santa Ynez Valley. The palate is all citrus, with lime sorbet and lemon-pith flavors.",88,Buttonwood 2013 Signature Blend Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Most Pinot Noirs would kill to have this depth of flavor. Although it's the winery's most basic, non-vineyard-designated Pinot, it's a fantastic wine, rich, mellow and delicious. Offers wave after wave of cherries, currants, cola, pomegranates and persimmons that are as sweet as jam, yet the finish is thoroughly dry. The wine is a masterful blend of seven vineyards. Drink now–2014.",91,Merry Edwards 2010 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This tart, plush and broadly appealing wine is fruit-forward and rounded with red cherry, cola and vanilla flavors.",88,J Vineyards & Winery 2015 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Charred smells of burnt popcorn or campfire appear at first but blow off to reveal cherry, blackberry and toasted almond. The wine is compact and lean in color with bright berry notes on the finish.",84,Piegaia 2005  Chianti Classico,,,,
"The local Baga grape makes an appearance in this blend, creating a firm texture with solid tannins. Its rich, dense core is dark and brooding in character, but could soften out with age. Drink after 2015.",87,Caves Aliança 2011 Aliança Reserva Red (Bairrada),,,,
"This Bordeaux blend feels harsh in the mouth. It just doesn't offer the richness you want from a Napa wine. The blackberry flavors are edged in overripe raisins, but the biggest problem is the bitter tannins.",84,Pinanfarina 2006 Vino Rosso Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"89-91 Barrel sample. Well balanced, the fruit fresh but ripe. There is an edge of dry tannins which slashes through the fruit, giving a firm, dry aftertaste.",90,Château Clarke 2008 Barrel sample  (Listrac-Médoc),,,,
"Wild berry, dark baking spice, aromatic herb and espresso aromas are present along with a floral note. The linear palate offers raw red cherry, dried sage and a white pepper note framed in vibrant acidity and firm, fine-grained tannins.",89,Cecchi 2013 Riserva di Famiglia  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"Heaps of blueberry, blackberry and mocha flavors make up the palate of this dry, soft Merlot. A few drops of Petite Sirah, Malbec and Petit Verdot add layers of flavor and texture.",85,Barefoot NV Merlot (California),,,,
"This is rich and full of superripe fruit that gives the otherwise structured wine a jammy feel. It has a solid, dense texture that brings out blackberry jelly flavors as well as a more tannic core. It's not a wine for long-term aging, so drink from 2015.",87,Cortes de Cima 2012 Trincadeira (Alentejano),,,,
"A fresh, fruity and fun rendering of Pinot Noir, this medium-bodied wine features lightly floral aromas, red cherry and raspberry fruit and a silky, mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2020.",90,Wakefield 2015 Pinot Noir (Adelaide Hills),,,,
"This is a rich, very rich wine that is packed with tropical fruits, generous apricot and peach flavors and spice. It is full in the mouth, showing some pepper from the alcohol that spoils the otherwise fruity character. The aftertaste does introduce some freshness.",88,Quinta do Pinto 2014 Antão Vaz (Lisboa),,,,
"A brooding, savory and smoothly textured wine, velvety more than silky, this offers black tea, truffle and high-toned cherry. The wine is named for sandstone, “mother rock” of the Goldridge soils that are so prominent where these vines dig down. Soft, it's also lengthy, a substantial and substantive bottling.",93,Wayfarer 2013 Estate Grown Mother Rock Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),,,,
"This Brut style Prosecco from Gancia (one of the most historic producers of this popular Italian sparkling wine) offers fresh floral aromas backed by drying mineral tones and pulpy notes of peach and apricot. The finish is crisp, cleansing and tonic.",86,Gancia NV Brut  (Prosecco),,,,
"So incredibly thick and sweet it's almost chewy in texture, with aromas and flavors that feature a fascinating interplay of fresh and dried apricots, peach and citrus, kept lively by healthy acidity. The finish lasts for minutes; the wine should age well for decades.",97,Schloss Johannisberger 2006 Trockenbeerenauslese Goldlack Riesling (Rheingau),,,,
"This blend of 50% Friulano, 25% Sauvignon and 25% Malvasia opens with aromas of apple, crushed rock, chamomile flower and a whiff of tomato vine. The tense, tangy palate offers white peach, citrus zest, fennel and mineral. An almond note accents the finish.",89,Bracco 2013 La Mont-Brach White (Collio),,,,
"This is ripe and smooth, with a generous creamy texture. Spice and apple combine to give a tangy edge that will soften and integrate as the wine ages. It's full of potential. Drink from 2017.",91,Hubert Meyer 2012 Winzenberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"This opens with aromas of wild herbs and field greens. This wine is full but flat in feel, with green, minty flavors that overshadow the minimal fruit. The finish is herbal and broad.",83,Quintay 2012 Clava Reserve Carmenère (Rapel Valley),,,,
"A nutty apricot aroma marks the nose. It feels creamy and sticky, with sweet vanilla and baked fruit flavors. With time it turns more cloying.",81,Telteca 2011 Roble Chardonnay (Mendoza),,,,
"Lush and concentrated in texture, this vineyard-designate is bright and tart with a bite of crunchy tannin and a bouquet of rose and lavender lurking on the nose. Light bodied and ultimately balanced, it brightens on the palate with a whirl of blood orange that complements the cranberry, pomegranate and cherry cola.",93,Saintsbury 2015 Sundawg Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Green Valley),,,,
Candied aromas of plastic and earthy black cherry lead to a medium-full palate that's creamy in feel. Lightly oaked and resiny cherry and plum flavors finish loamy and with modest acidity. Drink lightly chilled for best results.,86,François Lurton 2013 Hacienda Araucano Reserva Pinot Noir (Central Valley),,,,
"Deep, earthy, ripe aromas of blackberry, cola and asphalt are potent. This varietal Syrah from Catalonia is fleshy and wide across the palate, with tannic grip and structure. Satisfying, lusty flavors of raspberry, plum and cassis come with peppery spice in front of a meaty, firm finish. Drink 2017–2023.",92,Alta Alella 2013 Privat Orbus Syrah (Alella),,,,
"This wine has the classic richness of Pinot Noir, with a touch of textured tannin and bright red fruits. It needs more bottle age, so drink this wine from 2017.

"Flowers, melon and stone fruit inform the aromas and flavors of this unctuous, weighty and viscous wine, smooth with a lingering taste of ripe peach on the finish. Tiny percentages of Riesling and Gewürztraminer figure into the mix, too.",87,FlyWine 2013 The Party Starter Pinot Gris (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"With a brisk fizziness, this dessert Muscat is fairly sweet, with orange, vanilla and butterscotch flavors. It would benefit from being sweeter and more intense.",86,Quady 2008 Red Electra Muscat (California),,,,
"From Frank Family, this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend was grown in Rutherford. It's marked by intense flavors of blackberry, black cherry and currant, wrapped into firm, ripe tannins, and aged in 75% new French oak barrels. A perfect wine for drinking now with a great steak.",93,Winston Hill 2008 Red (Rutherford),,,,

"A nose of peach, nutmeg, toasted nut and honey leads this Viognier from Splitsa. On the palate, smooth waves of white fruit, orange blossom and honey are expressive but refreshing, thanks to the balanced acidity. A fun wine with class.",88,Skouras 2009 Eclectique Spilitsa Viognier (Peloponnese),,,,
"Only faint notes of apple and lemon appear on the nose. The palate has a creamy, leesy element and a light, toned body. There is real freshness here, even if the aromas are subdued.",88,Landhaus Mayer 2014 Riesling (Niederösterreich),,,,
"Both tart and tannic, it's unusually tight in personality, with a mouth-puckering texture, sharp fruit flavors and astringent finish. While there are too many soft and overripe Zins, this one goes pretty far the other way.",83,Witching Stick 2012 Fashauer Vineyard Zinfandel (Anderson Valley),,,,
"Mostly neutral aromas include a note of peach and citrus, and a hint of butterscotch. The body is full and the textue is good, while the overall balance is on the money. Creamy flavors of vanilla, coconut cake, toffee and baked apple finish similarly, with some heat and burn.",89,Mas Igneus 2011 Barranc dels Closos White (Priorat),,,,
"This tastes like it could be anything from Chardonnay to Sauvignon Blanc to Grenache Blanc, but it's rich in honey, orange and buttered toastflavors. It's seems a little sweet, but it has a good cut of acidity.",85,Dante 2010 Reserve Chardonnay (California),,,,

"Tinta Miúda, known as the rare Graciano grape in Spain, is not often found in Portugal. Here it makes a ripe, juicy and jammy wine that's soft, with only a minimum of tannins to keep it together. It has a typically warm character and is ready to drink.",85,Fiuza 2015 Tinta Miúda Red (Tejo),,,,
"This wine brings out the fruitiness of the vintage. Its bright red berry aromas presage the attractive fruit and juicy acidity. Wood aging gives it a dry core, although it is developing quickly. Drink from 2019.",87,Château le Piat 2014  Côtes de Bourg,,,,

Flavors of lemon are layered over poached apples, all presented with a mouth-enlivening acidity, and culminating with a touch of vanilla bean on the finish.",90,Joyce 2013 Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Winemakers: Adi Badenhorst and Duncan Savage. A blend of 65% Shiraz, 27% Grenache and 8% Cinsault, this blend made by two friends is bright and vibrant, much like their personalities. The bouquet is brimming with fruity character, expressed in waves of boysenberry, blueberry and raspberry, all hit by accents of pressed purple violets and fresh fynbos. The medium-weight palate is full in body and flavor, with a texture like crushed velvet and lingering flavors of spiced berries and chewy chocolate brownie on the long, evolving finish. A baby right now, though delicious, it should age well through 2026.",94,Adi Badenhorst & Duncan Savage 2016 Cape Winemakers Guild Love Boat Red Red (Swartland),,,,

Shows a classically thick, full-bodied texture, with dark currant, plum and licorice flavors edged with baker's chocolate. Fully dry, it's marvelous now with tri-tip, and should age for many years.",93,Vina Robles 2006 Jardine Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),,,,
"Sweet in jammy apricots and pineapples, with even richer notes of smoky vanilla and buttered toast. Crisp acidity fortunately provides some balance. From Venge Vineyards.",85,Saddleback 2008 Viognier (Clarksburg),,,,
"Meaty in wild berry and leather, this is a high-toned wine with a gritty texture that evolves to become velvety in the glass. Generously ripe and rich in body, it's intense and fresh in equal measure, showing a complement of balanced brawn and beauty.",94,Carlisle 2015 Papa's Block Syrah (Russian River Valley),,,,
"A smoky, lemon and lime dominated wine, which has fine concentration, lifted by tight tannins and edged by a creamy baked apple flavor. There's plenty going on here, and it's all good.",89,Sauvion 2007 Cardinal Richard  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),,,,
"You can taste the oak and lees influence in this rich, full-bodied Chardonnay. With a creamy mouthfeel, it gets serious on the midpalate, with flavors of buttery peach, orange and nectarine fruit. Outstanding and elegant.",93,Darioush 2009 Signature Chardonnay (Napa Valley),,,,
"This delicious Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon blend offers an alluring fragrance of blackberry, red currant and thyme punctuated by tarry, leather aromas. The palate shows ample plum flavor layered with chocolate and cinnamon accents, as well as round, polished tannins.",91,Castello di Gabbiano 2010 Alleanza Red (Toscana),,,,
"Gorgeous fruit aromas, generous and deep fruit flavors and soft, chocolate accents add up to a very flavorful but relaxed wine. Touches of clove and cedar pop up with the second sip, while some welcome tannins clean the palate. The fruit flavors come back on the finish. It is full-bodied but very smooth.",93,Easton 2012 Old Vine Rinaldi Vineyard Zinfandel (Fiddletown),,,,
"Dusty mineral complexities juxtapose luscious melon, peach and Mandarin orange flavors in this dry-style blend of Gewürztraminer and Riesling. Perfumed on the nose and silky on the palate, it's a widely appealing wine with a brisk, composed finish. Drink now through 2020.",90,Pflüger 2015 Biodynamite White (Pfalz),,,,
"Here's a big, dark, ripe and oaky Pinot Noir, brimming with cherry pie, raspberry Newton, oatmeal cookie and Asian spice flavors. It's a little soft in acids and tannic, but dry and silky. Try aging until at least 2011, and should develop additional bottle complexity through 2014.",89,Paraiso Vineyards 2007 West Terrace Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"From a cold vintage, this coastal Malbec offerssnappy cherry and boysenberry aromas along with woody spice notes. The palate is wiry and fresh, with zesty acidity. Tart plum and berry flavors end with raw oak and bitterness as the wine's modest fruit content fades out.",85,Lomas del Valle 2013 Coastal Cool Climate Single Vineyard Malbec (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"Smells a little herbal-weedy, tastes a little semisweet and soft, with raisiny blackberry and cherry flavors. Ready now.",84,Miner 2004 Stagecoach Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"While initially a bit smoky, or even slightly sulfurous on the nose, time and air restore prettier notes of berry and cherry to this zesty dry rosé. Sprightly and crisp, it offers a refreshingly breezy finish.",86,Hosmer 2015 Dry Rosé (Cayuga Lake),,,,
"Hugely extracted in cherry pie flavors, this Merlot makes up for the absence of subtlety with its sheer deliciousness. The tannins are soft, making it ideal for drinking now with steak.",88,Frog's Leap 2010 Merlot (Rutherford),,,,
"This wine's bright raspberry jam, pencil lead and barrel spice aromas lead to quite ripe, dried out fruit and barrel flavors. The tannins are a bit drying.",87,Maryhill 2014 Kiona Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),,,,
"This robust wine opens with aromas of forest floor, meat juices and game. The dense palate shows mature black cherry, plum, prune, cake spices and a hint of orange rind. It's extremely accessible so enjoy soon.",88,Trambusti 2012  Rosso di Montalcino,,,,
"Rather hard and baked on the nose, with a heavy helping of char and molasses. The palate is angular and tannic, while the flavors revolve around lemony oak and spice more than fruit. Spiky on the finish and sharp-edged as a whole. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère, Malbec and Syrah.",85,Botalcura 2006 Cayao Red (Central Valley),,,,
"There's a lush, decadent edge to this wine, thanks to heady aromas of vanilla cream, chocolate-covered raspberry and boysenberry preserves. The palate shows more restraint, with textured, fruit-skin flavors of plum and cherry that finish slightly chewy. Enjoy this now.",88,Beau Joubert 2009 The Ambassador Red (Stellenbosch),,,,
"Plummy aromas mix in the glass with whiffs of pressed blue flower, vanilla and mocha. The taut structured palate offers dried black cherry, coconut, licorice, espresso and black pepper while firm fine-grained tannins provide the framework. A note of pipe tobacco closes the tight finish. Give it a few more years to unwind and fully develop. Drink 2020–2027.",92,Banfi 2012 Poggio alle Mura  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"This has clove, cinnamon, herb and rhubarb notes on the nose. It's creamy and pasty feeling, with a heavy dollop of wood resin. Flavorwise, it's sweet and candied, with caramel, mocha and stewed tomato notes.",84,Tacora 2010 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"Fresh ripe black currant fruits are the delicious hallmark of this wine. It is full, rich, juicy, its core of tannins and oak a foil to the freshness and mouthfilling character of the fruit.",87,Pezat 2006  Bordeaux Supérieur,,,,
"This Bordeaux blend from New Jersey has appropriate aromas and flavors of dark berry, cedar, tobacco and spice, but it lacks the dimension and muscularity that makes this type of blend memorable. Still, it's a pretty wine and will pair well with numerous meat and fowl dishes.",82,Unionville 2004 Hunter's Red Reserve Meritage Red (New Jersey),,,,
"This barrel fermented and aged blend of Fiano and Greco opens with attractive floral aromas that recall Spanish broom and acacia with a whiff of beeswax. The austere palate offers green pear, citrus and mineral alongside fresh acidity.",88,Feudi di San Gregorio 2012 Campanaro White (Irpinia),,,,
"Chocolate, elderberry, roast beef and purple flower notes emerge on the complex nose of this bottling. Richer blackberry and black currant flavors show on the palate, with touches of soy, char and sugar plum, proving quite savory all around.",88,Vinum 2015 The Insider Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"This shy, robust red reveals faint whiffs of underbrush, leather and Mediterranean brush. The subdued, one-dimensional palate offers raisin and licorice flavors, an alcoholic warmth and brawny tannins.",87,Lazzeretti 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Soft citrus notes of clementine are streaked with fresh lemon to create this fresh, fruit-driven but very appetizing wine. The body is slender, dry and totally refreshing.",89,Joseph Cattin 2015 Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"Another of the producer's 100% varietal wines, this comes from two head-turning sites: Broken Rock Ranch at the foot of Atlas Peak, and Beckstoffer Las Piedras. The two marry well, offering sizable tannin and power atop complex layers of leather, cedar, pencil lead and coffee. Soft, integrated oak makes the wine enjoyable now, while its structure suggests further time in bottle, too. Drink now through 2021.",92,Guarachi Family 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"This winery has made a nice Sauvignon Blanc as far back as I can remember. The 2016 is a linear, precise example, tightly focused and crisp on the finish. The ample pineapple and grapefruit aromas and flavors are zesty and refreshing.",90,Shaw and Smith 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills),,,,
"Made from Grecanico, fermented and aged in terra-cotta amphorae, this amber-colored wine delivers a great depth of flavors that include dried apricots, orange zest, cured meats, Mediterranean herbs, lemon drop and forest floor alongside energizing mineral. It would make a great vino da meditazione. Drink through 2021.",92,COS 2011 Pithos Grecanico (Sicilia),,,,
"A blend of Syrah and 7% Viognier, this has a tremendous perfume on the nose. Mouth-filling and savory, it is adorned with flavors of mushroom, earth and black raspberry. Cellar this for a while, or enjoy it now with roasted game served in a mushroom ragout.",92,Prospect 772 2010 The Brawler Syrah-Viognier (Calaveras County),,,,
"This complex rosé effortlessly combines hints of flowers, dried spices, garrigue and red berries. It's full-bodied yet paradoxically weightless, buoyed by a long finish of crushed stone and fresh lime juice. Drink it over the next few years.",92,Domaine Maby 2014 Prima Donna  (Tavel),,,,
"A rich nose of clove, tea, mint and cedar start this red from Greece. The palate offers clean bursts of cedar, spice and red currant. Fresh and light, the wine is a good house red.",84,Koutsoyiannopoulos 2006 Red (Santorini),,,,
"At first this Merlot-led blend is heavily charred and toasty on nose, but with time baked berry aromas rise up. A full palate features a lactic note offset by jagged acidity, while toasty, herbal flavors include berry, mint and wood resin. This is Merlot, Shiraz, Tempranillo and Viognier.",86,Palo Alto 2012 Reserva II Red (Maule Valley),,,,
"Soft and simple, this bears cola, cherry pie, red currant and pepper flavors that finish sweet-tasting. This is a fine choice to drink with pizza and Mexican food.",84,Peacock Cellars 2010 Barbera (Paso Robles),,,,
"A very rich Chardonnay, explosive in lemon custard, grilled pineapple and the ripest peaches imaginable. At the same time, there's a firm, tangy minerality. Some will find, however, that the oak dominates it all with a blast of buttered toast and caramel.",88,Gary Farrell 2009 Keefer Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This nonvintage Brut epitomizes the fruit of Pinot Meunier and the more structured character of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. It is balanced, full of white fruit and touches of apricot, with a lively line of acidity. Drink this bottling now.",90,Besserat de Bellefon NV Cuvée des Moines Brut  (Champagne),,,,

Cherry candy and red licorice play broadly across the palate, lingering through a beautifully balanced and extended finish.",95,Betz Family 2011 Père de Famille Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Made from the native Pecorino grape, this has pretty floral aromas that mingle with bright sensations of tropical fruit and citrus. It's simple but well constructed and enjoyable.",85,Le Corti dei Farfensi 2012 Curtes Pecorino (Falerio),,,,
"The reductive scent of rubber meets with deep blackberry on the nose. The palate proves more interesting, with mocha and espresso notes laid over blackberry fruit, all framed in strong tannins.",85,Joullian 2011 Family Reserve Syrah (Carmel Valley),,,,
"Aromas of bread crust, oak and summer orchard lift out of the glass. The mature, concentrated palate offers citrus zest, mature apple, toasted hazelnut and a yeasty note alongside a firm but refined perlage. A bitter almond note closes the finish.",89,Castello Bonomi 2006 Cuvée Lucrezia Extra Brut Pinot Nero (Franciacorta),,,,
"Cool-climate Touriga Nacional brings forth intriguing red-fruit flavors and tannins that are soft. The wine is spicy and herbal, and lightly textured with a floral character and a smooth aftertaste, touched by brisk acidity. Langdon Shiverick, Comète Wines.",89,Quinta do Pinto 2009 Vinhas do Lasso Tinto Touriga Nacional (Lisboa),,,,
"Sweet and simple, tastes like that syrup they pack canned peaches in, except of course it has good acidity. Make that super acidity, which is its saving grace. The acids get up under the fruit and push it, saving the wine from being insipid. —S.H.",84,Yalumba 2000 Y Series Viognier (South Australia),,,,
"Espresso, toast, new leather, menthol and French oak aromas take center stage. The firm palate offers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, anise, roasted coffee bean, vanilla and sage alongside tightly knit fine-grained tannins.",92,Cascina Bongiovanni 2013  Barolo,,,,
"Although the intensity of the papaya, blonde caramel and dill flavors leaves something to be desired, the flavors prove to be more virile. The wine feels buttery and rich, with a precise, tenacious toasted-almond note that clings to the finish.",87,Attimo 2011 Sonnet 98 Vidal Blanc (Virginia),,,,
"There is power here, the weight of fruit packing white peach and currant flavors structured around a mineral core. The wine is for aging, with its strong texture, its edge of apple skins and its layered acidity.",91,Malat 2008 Gottschelle Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),,,,
"Merlot (57%) takes the lead on this lighter-colored wine that offers raspberries, cherries, herbs and woodspice. The fruit flavors are fresh and elegant, with lightly chalky tannins.",88,Pondera 2011 Entwined Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Deliciously drinkable now, with very dry but ripely opulent flavors of black currants, cherry marmalade, mocha, root beer and caramelized oak. Could have greater structure and a longer finish, but lovely with a charbroiled steak.",87,Palmaz 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Fleeting leather and black fruit notes creep onto the medium-full palate, which feels malleable with its lank acids. The finish comes with a focused note of long-cut tobacco.",85,Page Cellars 2010 Landscape Page Springs Estate Vineyard Yavapai County Red (Cochise County),,,,
"Fairly light aromas of red cherry juice, licorice and dried violets show on the nose, following by a rather light density on the palate as well. Hints of minty cherry and charred wood also arise, as do grippy tannins that vanish quickly.",84,Midnight 2011 Merlot (Paso Robles),,,,
"This has a friendly feel thanks to its harmonious aromas of peach, passion fruit and honey. There is nice balance here, and more depth thanks to the wine's slightly sweet disposition. Pair it with Thai or Indian curry.",87,Casa alle Vacche 2007 I Macchioni  (Vernaccia di San Gimignano),,,,
"The rarest of the Spring Valley wines, this pure Cabernet Sauvignon offers ripe plum fruit flavors, wrapped in baking chocolate and licorice. It finishes with accents of sandalwood and citrus.",90,Spring Valley Vineyard 2008 Derby Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
A smooth and rich wine that has a good mix between wood aging and ripe plum flavors. Tannins present a judicious support for the full fruits. Drink from the end of 2014.,88,Fiuza 2012 Red (Tejo),,,,
"The barrel time in neutral French oak has softened and polished the edges of this wine. Flavors of green banana and apple carry some grace notes of marshmallow and coconut. It's an interesting, smooth and tasty effort.",89,Phelps Creek 2015 Reserve Barrel Fermented Pinot Gris (Columbia Gorge (OR)),,,,
"Whiffs of baby powder and blossoms lend a floral, perfumed tone to this pretty Gewürztraminer. It's bold in body and alcohol, but the palate stays bright thanks to fresh grapefruit and tangerine flavors.",87,Silver Thread 2012 Gewurztraminer (Finger Lakes),,,,
"The Sheila reserve is a block and barrel selection, and brings an extra dollop of fruit concentration when compared side-by-side with the other estate reserve. Both are wines of immaculate detail, here with a lush mix of strawberry, raspberry and cherry fruit, augmented with streaks of cola and red licorice. The balance and length are impressive.",92,Blakeslee 2012 Estate Reserve Sheila Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),,,,
"There is a citrus purity on the nose that suggests fresh lemon juice, but it is tempered by some spice, like that of still-green Seville orange rind. The palate is streamlined and equally pure, it has an almost cleansing quality. This is luminous and delicious and slips down far too easily.",92,Schloss Gobelsburg 2014 Heiligenstein Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),,,,
"Here's a very rich and full-bodied wine. It does have structure, giving firm tannins to balance the ripe red berry fruits. With this solid character, the wine will age and should be drunk from 2016.",87,Château Barrail Chevrol 2011  Fronsac,,,,
"Very dry and tannic, a style of Cabernet that relies more on structure than flash. Despite fairly high alcohol, it keeps a tight rein on the blackberries and cedar, locking the flavors in astringency. Needs time. Give it until 2013 and see where it goes.",90,Rutherford Ranch 2007 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"There's a subdued, easy quality to the bouquet, encompassing aromas of wild berry, ginger, cola and leather. The finish is smooth, fine and slightly chewy.",88,Ricossa 2007  Barolo,,,,
"This blend of 70% Sauvignon Blanc and 30% Semillon is lean and racy. Grassy, lemony notes on the nose include a touch of pickled jalapeño, while an acidic laser beam of citrus creases the palate, leaving behind a puckery, austere impression.",83,Man O' War 2012 Gravestone Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Waiheke Island),,,,
"Dried herb, tobacco, plum and woodspice aromas are followed by tart cranberry and cherry flavors that have a lick of dry tannins behind them. There's plenty of interest but this wine needs food to combat the tannins.",85,Cana's Feast 2012 Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This offers bright raspberry jam, herb, pepper and spice aromas. It's full of vanilla flavors, seeming somewhat disjointed.",86,Kestrel 2013 Falcon Series Tribute Red (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Well structured wine, the red cherry fruits laced with some banana hints. The wine is deliciously fruity, the tannin edge just a light coating.",84,Georges Duboeuf 2010 Sélection  (Régnié),,,,
"This is a ripe, slightly jammy blend of Nero d'Avola and Merlot with tones of cooked spice and blackberry pie. There are also some green leafy notes in the back backed by dense black tea that come as a surprise. You'll feel some grit on the palate and more fruit flavors on the close.",85,Principe di Corleone 2004 Evoè Red (Sicilia),,,,
"Aromatic and rich, this rounded, ripe wine has hints of yellow fruits along with green plums, perfumed acidity and a hint of minerality. It's buttery at the end, with ripe, lively acidity. Drink from 2019.",92,Henri de Villamont 2014 Les Caillerets Premier Cru  (Meursault),,,,
"Aromas of sunbaked soil, truffle, game, Mediterranean scrub and mature black-skinned fruit lead the nose on this earthy red. Made entirely with Nero d'Avola, the round, delicious palate tastes of ripe black cherry, blackberry, orange zest, spice and chopped herb. Velvety tannins and bright acidity support the juicy flavors. Drink through 2017.",91,COS 2014 Nero di Lupo Nero d'Avola (Terre Siciliane),,,,
"Merlot is at the center of this blend, combined with Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. A bitterness of green tannins and black leather make for a hugely tannic, puckering effect on the palate.",83,Kirkland Signature 2013 Meritage (Rutherford),,,,
"One in a series of field-blend wines from the producer, this comes from a 100-year old parcel within the Gaivosa estate. Packed with both tannins and rich, jammy fruit, it's a serious wine that deserves aging. Drink from 2020.",93,Alves de Sousa 2011 Quinta da Gaivosa Vinha de Lordelo Red (Douro),,,,
"A splash of Barbera enlivens this wine, which boasts boysenberry, understated earthy notes and a dash of vanilla. The tannins are firm, suggesting at least 10 years of ageability.",91,Wit's End 2014 Luna Shiraz (McLaren Vale),,,,
"Ripe and aromatic, this encapsulates the Viognier so well. Classic apricot flavors are enhanced by a smoky, wood-aging character, rich almonds and warm acidity. It's a well-composed wine, now ready to drink.",92,Quinta do Monte d'Oiro 2011 Madrigal Viognier (Lisboa),,,,
"A fresh and ripe blend that brings the richness of Chardonnay and the perfumed Viognier well into focus. It is rich, full of apricot and green plum fruits that are cut by acidity. The name Vin de Lune (moon wine) is a reminder of the time when grapes were harvested at night to avoid detection by the local lord and so escape taxes.",88,Jean-Luc Baldès 2014 Clos Triguedina Blanc Sec Vin de Lune Viognier-Chardonnay,,,,
"A firm and tannic wine, it is still developing. The dry structure and the smoky wood aging are dominant, giving a hard feel. It does have a juicy hint underneath, so the fruit will develop although tannins are going to remain prominent.",85,Château de Tourteyron 2011  Médoc,,,,
"Black plum, candied blueberry, garden herb and anise aromas show on the nose of this luscious bottling from Matt Villard and Rick Hudson. It doesn't rely on sheer power, instead offering nuanced sage, thyme and oregano flavors against a backfrop of baked red and black cherry fruit. Fennel, smoked meat and vanilla notes play a supporting role.",92,MCV 2014 Rosewynn Vineyard Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),,,,
"This brings a lot of flavor to the table for its relatively modest price. Round and spicy, it leads with juicy strawberry, cherry and apple pie fruit flavors. Hints of cinnamon wind through the finish, and overall the impression is of a pretty, lively and slightly sweet wine without pretense.",88,Château Bianca 2005 Cellar Select Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Chewy, earthy and tannic, this rather awkward wine matches cranberry and black cherry hard candy fruit to a rough, stemmy underbelly. There is some leather and barnyard in the middle; all in all it's a bit of a rough ride.",82,Spangler Vineyards 2006 Cabernet Franc (Southern Oregon),,,,
"Medium-bodied, this delivers sensations of mature black plum, blue flower and sweet baking spices. The juicy fruit is supported by lithe tannins and just enough fresh acidity. Enjoy throughout 2015.",89,Le Bèrne 2012  Rosso di Montepulciano,,,,
"Aromas of black cherry, brambly berry, violet and oregano give way to sophisticated flavors of dark fruit, spice and leather. This nicely balanced Syrah offers harmonious tannins, with just a touch of grippiness, leading to a smooth, somewhat savory finish.",92,Kavaklidere 2010 Pendore Syrah (Aegean),,,,
"Nice, clean and brisk, this has flavors of lemongrass, white pepper, cream, butter and just a hint of white flower. While it's technically dry, there's lots of California-style ripe fruit. Easy to like as an appetizer wine.",87,Rutherford Hill 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"Soft, peach fruits abound in this simple and attractive wine. It's fragrant and fruity, with a light texture and fresh acidity at the end.",85,Jean-Claude Debeaune 2011 Domaine Saint-Martin  (Saint-Véran),,,,
"Much improved, with different vineyard sources than in 2004, this strong, varietal Cabernet mixes cassis, black cherry, light herb and hints of moist earth. Aging for 18 months in new French oak brings in coffee and chocolate, balanced and subtly displayed. Nice details of leaf and leather run richly into the tannins.",90,Whitman Cellars 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Aged in a mixture of concrete and stainless steel, this wine offers notes of melon, canteloupe and spice that intrigue. The just off-dry flavors are well balanced, possessing a textured feel.",88,J. Bookwalter 2015 Old Vine Willard Vineyard Chenin Blanc (Yakima Valley),,,,
"The nose shows irresistable youthful notes of pear and apple while the palate is a bit simpler and fairly soft. Short, cherry-infused finish. Drink by the pool.",85,Lakewood 2007 Gigliotti Vineyards Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This wine's aromas are fruit forward, suggesting cantaloupe, melon and pear. The palate is spicy and broad, bringing a lot of appeal.",89,JM Cellars 2015 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This dry, medium-bodied wine has mild berry aromas and flavors. It offers a firm mouthfeel and moderate tannins.",85,McKahn 2014 Zinfandel (Mendocino County),,,,
"Ground pepper, tilled earth and black-skinned berry aromas all come together on this generous, full-bodied red. The fresh, delicious palate doles out ripe black cherry, black currant, licorice and clove alongside vibrant acidity and polished, fine-grained tannins.",93,Braida di Giacomo Bologna 2013 Bricco dell'Uccellone  (Barbera d'Asti),,,,
"Refreshingly crisp in acidity, with a clean mouthfeel and pleasantly rich peach, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors. There's even a diesel-like petrol note, like Riesling. Great value in a stylish white wine.",86,Smoking Loon 2008 Viognier (California),,,,
"Dense and dark, this is an extracted wine with polished fruit. What stops it going over the edge is the delicious sweet fruits, the dense structure and the elegance that gives it shape and aging potential.",93,Château Kirwan 2005  Margaux,,,,
"They packed a lot of flavor into this rich Chardonnay for the price. It's toasty buttery and popcorny from winemaker treatment, with ripe fruit notes of pineapples and exotic tropical fruits. A brisk streak of minerals and acidity provides clean balance.",91,Cambria 2009 Katherine's Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"This wine's heavy oak aromas are toasty but not overdone, while bacon and tobacco notes lurk in the background. Its raw, supremely tannic palate delivers woody, spicy berry flavors.",87,Bodegas Bilbainas 2014 Viña Zaco  (Rioja),,,,
"Dark berry, pressed flower, iron, leather and spice aromas come together on this firmly structured wine. The full-bodied palate delivers juicy black cherry, eucalyptus, anise and clove alongside big, velvety tannins. A licorice note closes the lingering finish. It's already almost approachable but hold for more complexity. Drink 2018–2028.",94,Luigi Baudana 2011 Cerretta  (Barolo),,,,
"This is a fruity wine, and its black currant flavor emerging right away. Next comes the bright acidity, while the tannins form a solid, dark and dry contrast. The wine needs at least two years to soften into something rich.",87,Château de la Bouyère 2010  Bordeaux,,,,
"Pinot Noir in name only, a dry, silky wine whose berry flavors are definitely on the thin side. It's somewhat sweet.",82,Mark West 2009 Pinot Noir (California),,,,
"Entirely estate-grown, 100% Merlot from old vines, this unfined wine is labeled vegan. Plush, briary, brambly fruit from the 30 year old vineyard brings an extra dimension to the wine, which shows a lovely balance of cranberry, raspberry, pie cherry and baking spice flavors. There's a hint of pastry crust in the finish, which is seamless and long. An absolute delight.",93,Seven Hills 2011 Seven Hills Vineyard Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Touches of cinnamon and spice accent crisp red apples in this dry, medium-bodied rosé. The palate is tart but refreshingly brisk on the finish.",84,McGregor 2014 Rosé of Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),,,,
"While the tannins are still powerful and dense, the wine has rich berry fruits and juicy acidity that give freshness. It's ripe, well balanced, and full bodied, with a dark, concentrated character at the end. Drink from 2016.",87,Château les Reuilles 2011  Bordeaux,,,,
"La Fornace is a dark, savory expression of Cabernet Sauvignon that shows aged tertiary aromas of dark spice, cured meat and prune. It feels rich and dense, with a gritty quality to the tannins and long endnotes of bacon, black pepper and leather. Drink now.",90,Carpineto 2003 La Fornace Cabernet Sauvignon (Toscana),,,,
"Enormously ripe and rich—this is honeyed, with citrus and tropical fruit flavors. It's creamy, too, with a butterscotch accent. The magic comes on the finish with a swirl of acidity and dry mineral. Decadent but never cloying, this defines the ripe California style.",93,Clos Pegase 2010 Mitsuko's Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros),,,,
"The wine opens with a luminous garnet color that is typical of young Barolo and segues to aromas of wild berry, road tar, black truffle, leather and cigar box. It shows well-evolved mineral characteristics on the palate and offers a blast of bright berry fruit over firm, chewy tannins.",90,Damilano 2005 Brunate Cannubi  (Barolo),,,,
"Tastes hot as a chile pepper, and no wonder. The alcohol is 15.8%. Some red wines get away with it, but this one doesn't. The berry-cherry flavors are baked, and the wine is clumsy and inelegant.",82,Sextant 2006 Holystone Zinfandel (Paso Robles),,,,
"A very dry Port, the tannins concentrating the fruit into a tight, mineral ball. Even if the fruit is suppressed at this stage, it will show through in years to come, leaving a structured but rich wine.",93,Niepoort 2008 Bioma Vinha Velha Vintage  (Port),,,,
"The wine is rich, possibly too rich with its dark tannins and tarry character. While there are plenty of black plum fruits, there is also some bitter licorice that comes from extraction during winemaking. Considering its age, it is likely this character will remain. The wine is ready to drink.",86,H. Abrantes Douro Wines 2011 LVW Red (Douro),,,,
"Light, clear color betrays a balanced, vibrant wine, nicely weighted in ripe Bing cherry and raspberry. The ethereal nature of things take on body and oak midway through, and a satisfying, herbal earthiness of cola spice. Enjoy through 2022.",90,Acacia 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Reserve Alexandre is always a really nice, interesting wine, but with recent price increases, consumers should be wary. The '04 shows classic Alexander Valley softness and herbs, along with cherries, blackberries and oak, and it's an elegantly balanced wine. But it doesn't seem to be an ager, as it's a little thin on the finish, so drink now.",87,Geyser Peak 2004 Reserve Alexandre Meritage Red (Alexander Valley),,,,
"This is a dry Gewurz that's delightful to drink now. The lychee, Asian pear and citrus flavors feel elegant and refined. Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese and Burmese fare are all natural companions.",88,Cartograph 2012 Floodgate Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Shows the exotic fruitiness of Viognier, with a blast of tangerines, pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes and green apples, with flowery honeysuckle and jasmine notes. The wine shows subtle oak notes, but is mainly notable for its forward flavors, elegant dryness and crisply bright acidity.",88,Kunde 2008 Viognier (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"Though this bottling is Peter Hunken's least-expensive Syrah, it gives his single-vineyard expressions a serious run for the money for best of vintage. Amazing aromas of chipped asphalt, smoked beef, dense boysenberry, soy, cedar, sandalwood and soy drop into a palate of peppery berry juice, beef jerky, underripe blackberry and elderberry, and pepper-crusted teriyaki beef.",95,Holus Bolus 2013 Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Overripe and raisiny, with sweet, shriveled blackberry and oak flavors, leading to a hot finish. Drink now.",83,Midnight 2007 Zenith Red (Paso Robles),,,,

"Produced by the largest Bordeaux cooperative, this is a freshly fruity wine, with simple red fruit flavors and soft tannins. There is a smoky edge and pink raspberry acidity.",84,Univitis 2009 Chevalier de Saint-André  (Bordeaux),,,,
"Ripe, forward flavors of raspberry and cherry jam and spice mark this blend of Tempranillo, Grenache and Mourvèdre. Dry and crisp, it has tannins that make the palate pucker, and it calls to be paired with beef, lamb or pork.",87,Sea Shell Cellars 2010 Balboa Reserve Estate Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"A spectacular Pinot, continuing a string of great vintages from this little vineyard. The year 2007 gave California supernaturally rich but balanced Pinot Noirs, and this is one of them. It's sensational, offering broad, exotic fruit flavors, pinpointed with exotic spices, and exquisitely highlighted with French oak. Truly fine, this small-production wine should age over the next 6–8 years.",97,Goldeneye 2007 Confluence Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),,,,
"A kitchen-sink blend of varieties with Merlot (44%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (26%) taking the lead, this wine offers appealing aromas that suggest high-toned, sweet barrel spices, plum and herbs. It's loaded with cranberry, cherry and plum flavors with a rich mouthfeel that keeps the interest high.",91,Pendulum 2012 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Cherry and plum aromas are generic but largely clean. This tastes sweet and buttery, with creamy, lactic notes which accent cherry and berry flavors. A candied tone of residual sugar creates a sticky sensation on the finish.",84,Bota Box 2014 Pinot Noir (Chile),,,,
"This wine has a rustic but appealing air about it, with its cedary pepper and luscious jam nose and elegant balance of berry, smoke and spice. The wine is approachable and will pair with smoked meats and spicy dishes well.",87,The Foundry 2004 Syrah (Coastal Region),,,,
"Intense violet, red-skinned berry and cooking spice aromas set the stage in this bright red. The lively palate delivers red cherry, blackberry and cinnamon touches alongside round tannins and lively acidity. Enjoy soon.",88,Il Falchetto 2016 Pian Scorrone  (Barbera d'Asti),,,,
"Coming from the oldest block of the oldest Syrah vineyard in the state (1986 plantings), this wine brings a pleasing assortment of herbs, blue plum, mineral and spice along with a kiss of smoked meat. It's focused and rich with densely packed fruit flavors and tannins that show a surprising amount of heft. Best after 2017.",93,Betz Family 2012 La Côte Patriarche Syrah (Yakima Valley),,,,
"This fresh white should pair with chicken salad or fish tacos. It offers aromas of lemon, pear and honeydew melon. Screwcap.",87,Bollini 2010 Pinot Grigio (Trentino),,,,
"The producer stays true to its roots with this deliciously made white, a blend of mostly Sauvignon Blanc with some Sauvignon Gris and Sauvignon Musqué. Waxy apple comes first, followed by fully etched acidity that manifests itself as fresh-cut lemon and tangerine. A 100% stainless-steel wine, it finishes refreshingly.",90,Dry Creek Vineyard 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"From ex-Penfolds winemaker John Duval and made in part from vines over 150 years old, this Grenache offers a complexity and depth. This favors dark fruit on the nose and is chock full of intriguing aromas of cumin, clove, chocolate, sandalwood and mint. The palate offers more of the same multifariousness, with added minerality reminiscent of hot stones and graphite. Drink now–2027.",92,John Duval Wines 2015 Annexus Grenache (Barossa),,,,
"One of the first Super Tuscan wines, this iconic blend of 80% Sangiovese, 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc opens with aromas of scorched earth, underbrush, ripe plum and a whiff of blue iris. The palate offers dried black cherry, prune, mocha, licorice and clove. Assertive but refined tannins provide the framework. Drink 2016–2021.",93,Marchesi Antinori 2011 Tignanello Red (Toscana),,,,
"A full, yeasty wine, this has gentle acidity, with a touch of smokiness as well as a note of apple It feels full, without the necessary crispness.",85,Bründlmayer NV Extra Brut Sparkling (Österreichischer Sekt),,,,
"A limited production wine (only 3,440 bottles produced) that has the depth and concentration one would expect for a wine with this price tag. Dark and floral with aromas of crushed African violets, black plum, cherry and clover. The mouth is lush and velvety, loaded with flavors of cassis, black berry, pepper and leathery spice that continue through the finish. Drink now through 2015.",90,Doolhof 2007 Minotaur Red (Wellington),,,,

"This reedy smelling, jammy boxed wine is on the cusp of acceptability. It's gooey in feel, a bit fake and sugary in flavor, and sticky on the finish.",80,Gran Verano 2011 Gran Verano Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),,,,
"The aromas are bright, with notes of lime leaf, apricot, citrus peel, flowers and lime. It drinks off dry, with abundant stone-fruit flavors that provide plenty of pleasure.",88,Nine Hats 2015 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Though labeled as a red wine, this could just as easily be labeled as Cabernet at 91%, and it drinks like one. Spice, herb, coffee and black-cherry aromas are followed by plump fruit flavors that show purity and depth, trailing ever so slightly toward the finish.",90,Soos Creek 2012 Terrible Beauty Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This wine dazzles with detailed aromas of black currant, plum, herbs, cassis and earth along with barrel accents. The palate is wound up tightly at present but still accessible with layered, seamless fruit flavors along with a lengthy finish. It will be best enjoyed from 2022–2030.",93,Leonetti Cellar 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,

"This deliciously perfumed wine originates from a small appellation west of Sancerre. With its crisp texture and aromatic Sauvignon Blanc grapes, it is a wine to appreciate as an apéritif rather than drink with food.",88,Jean-Michel Sorbe 2015  Quincy,,,,
"Cassis spritzer and pine tree-like herbals provide a promising start on the nose. It's rich in the mouth, with cherry, blackberry and a nice edge of black pepper.",90,Tolosa 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
This is a stalky wine with dry tannins under the wild blackberry fruits. It has a green edge to it that spoils its fruitiness.,83,Wines & Winemakers 2016 Dona Helena Red (Península de Setúbal),,,,
"Aromas of wild raspberry, smoked meat and oregano lay the groundwork for flavors of raspberry, black cherry, thyme, rosemary and smoked meat. There is an interesting yet sophisticated array of fruit and herbal flavors, and the burst of orange zest on the finish complements the soft but ever-present tannins.",90,Tulip Winery 2011 Reserve Syrah (Galilee),,,,
"Tart black-cherry fruit carries a load of earth and stem flavors, along with notes of bitter chocolate shavings and espresso grounds. It's tannic and tart, with a dash of sassafras threaded through the finish.",89,Panther Creek 2014 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Uplifting aromatics of blackberry soda and purple flowers provide a nose that could be sniffed all day, hinting at a fun but elegant GSM. The flavors fall in line, with cola, Bing cherries and rose water combining for a light, floral palate, yet with green tea tannins and tartness to keep it grounded.",93,Transcendence 2012 Parea G-S-M (Central Coast),,,,
"This wine is firm and structured, with dark tannins and a dense texture that is still dry. It offers ripe fruit as well as acidity, currently overshadowed by the tannins but will come to the fore with some time. The wine will age well, thanks to the solid structure and dry core of tannins. Drink from 2020.",91,Louis Latour 2014 Les Chaillots Premier Cru  (Aloxe-Corton),,,,
"Medium bodied and not too tannic, this enjoyable wine has vanilla and cedar aromas, moderate plum flavors and an almost soft mouthfeel.",86,Grindstone 2014 Valley View Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (California),,,,

"Leafy and burnt smelling, with muddled fruit aromas that don't offer much. Feels grabby and tastes mostly of baked berry fruit and bitter spice. Shows some heat and burn on the finish, which is herbal in flavor.",83,Marqués de Riscal 2009 Próximo  (Rioja),,,,
"This very expensive release is one of the rare examples of Chardonnay that absolutely requires bottle age. Dry and leesy now, with a mineral compactness, it shows a rich core of baked peach, spiced apple, butterscotch and smoky honey. As it warms in the glass, it develops great flavor and textural complexities. Should come into its own by 2009, and improve for many years after.",96,Hanzell 2005 Ambassador's 1953 Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"Earthy, leafy red-fruit aromas are a bit rustic and burnt-smelling. This solid, chunky Pinot has spicy oak leading slightly cooked but good berry flavors. A woody, somewhat hot finish is somewhat generic.",86,Veramonte 2012 Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"Still young and needing additional cellar time to achieve full integration, this dark, brooding Brunello opens with very masculine aromas of Spanish cedar, root beer, forest floor, dark fruit and bramble. There's still slight bitterness on the close and a firm tannic bite.",89,Belpoggio 2006  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"There's a touch on barnyard on the nose of this bottling by one of the region's earlier settlers, with aromas of hay and oyster mushrooms adding intrigue to the cranberry fruit. The forest floor and juniper character is strong on the palate, where tart red fruit mixes with pencil lead and bergamot rinds.",88,Manzoni 2013 Home Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Baked plum, fragrant blue flower, dried herb, eucalyptus and cake spice aromas unfold on this full-bodied red. The elegant, structured palate offers mature black cherry, licorice, mocha and grilled herb while firm, fine-grained tannins provide the framework. This shows more aging potential than many of the 2011s. Drink 2019–2031.",94,Donatella Cinelli Colombini 2011 Progetto Prime Donne  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"This is a banana and red-cherry-flavored wine, that has a light tannic structure to contrast with the fruitiness. It is ready to drink.",84,Domaine de Boischampt 2015  Beaujolais-Villages,,,,
"This wine has traveled miles in the right direction compared to its early incarnations. It's piercing and potent up front, with cigar box, mocha, toast and coffee aromas in addition to fine flavors of tobacco, cassis, vanilla and lightly baked berry and cassis. Finishes wavy and long; 50% Syrah along with Merlot, Cab and Carmenère.",91,Aresti 2007 Family Collection Red (Curicó Valley),,,,
"Those familiar with Morgan's more expensive Chardonnays, such as the Double L (which comprises 55% of this blend) will find true value in this regional wine. It shows similar power and authority in a showy, Chablis-style wine whose acidic, minerally structure frames intense citrus and oak flavors.",91,Morgan 2006 Highland Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"A lovely Zinfandel, classic and balanced, with an elegant tannin-acid structure. Shows typical Dry Creek Valley spices and briar, in addition to ripe blackberry, cherry, currant, Dr. Pepper cola and tobacco flavors.",90,Mauritson 2007 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"This wine breaks on the palate like a slider crossing the corner of the plate, just out of reach. A forward, fruit-driven entry drops into a tart midpalate, with plum and berry fruit. It fades away into a finish with strong acids, light chocolate and a hint of bitterness in the tannins.",89,Saffron Fields Vineyard 2014 Heritage Clones Pinot Noir,,,,
"Firm and with dark tannins, this wine has great potential. Ripe berry fruits and a concentrated structure are already well balanced with acidity cutting through. As it matures, this wine with its dense structure will develop well. Drink from 2017. Enologist Sebastien and vineyard manager Nicolas are the latest Carreau generation managing family estates.",89,Château Les Petits Arnaud 2012 Excellence  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),,,,
"This full-bodied and effusive wine has a sweet, oaky aroma and similarly rich flavors of black cherry and blackberry jam. It feels smooth and luxurious.",87,FEL 2013 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),,,,
"Aromas of toast, oak, earth and berry lead the way. The lean palate is rather diluted, showing dried cherry and hints of black pepper and espresso. Dusty, rather fleeting tannins leave a mouth drying finish.",86,Nicodemi 2014 Le Murate  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),,,,
"Cherry, plum and raspberry aromas are basic but clean. This is a midlevel, good wine with a medium body and nothing abrasive or biting. Modest flavors of chunky berry fruits finish loamy and earthy.",86,Baluarte 2009  Ribera del Duero,,,,
"Spicy and intense, this excellent Pinot Gris is loaded with Gravenstein apple, cut pear, and a taste of orange peel. Surprising length and power for a Euro-styled wine with modest alcohol.",90,Rainstorm 2012 Pinot Gris (Oregon),,,,
"This full-bodied, voluptuous wine is spicy in red fruit and floral aromas that lend it a finessed, elegant air. Soft and round, with structure and acidity, it ends in bittersweet chocolate and clove. Drink now through 2023.",91,Snowden 2013 Lost Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"A selection from the many parcels owned by the producer, this wine comes from the north slopes of the Montagne de Reims. It is a delicious, balanced wine that is 50-50 Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, rich and full in the mouth with perfumed acidity and a generous texture. The wine is ready to drink.",92,Henriet-Bazin NV Sélection de Parcelles Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"A certified organic wine, this offers easy berry aromas of cherry and raspberry that would pair with informal foods like pizza. The mouthfeel is lean and bright.",85,Cielo e Terra 2011 Primi Soli Primitivo (Puglia),,,,
"Accents of flint and charred apple skin mingle with the orange rind and pear flesh notes on the nose and mouth. Round and flabby on the palate, with a short but clean finish.",85,Robertson Winery 2011 Chenin Blanc (Robertson),,,,
"Smoke meets game on the nose of this wine from a vineyard named after Fess Parker's late son-in-law, along with blueberry and asphalt aromas. The flavors are rich and dense, with blackberry, tart boysenberry and more smoked meat, proving the perfect pairing for hearty fare.",90,Fess Parker 2012 Rodney's Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"This wine comes from the San Lucas area of the southern Salinas Valley, on the way toward Paso Robles. It's a peppery wine, rustic, hot and dry, with strong jammy flavors of cherries and blackberries, and a long, spicy finish. Drink now.",86,Pomar Junction 2007 Syrah (Monterey County),,,,
"From a prime site relatively high in elevation for the appellation, this wine shows beautiful, crisp acidity, as robust layers of mountain raspberry, blackberry and coffee flavor vie for attention. Full bodied and densely structured, it unfurls in wisps of black licorice and clove on the lengthy finish.",94,Sbragia 2013 Godspeed Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),,,,
"Fruity frills of strawberry surround a core of black New Mexican chiles, with cinnamon and clove emerging the longer one sniffs. There's nice tension between the fruit flavors and the nearly bell pepper greenness. Throw a chill on it and serve with barbecued pork.",91,Still Waters 2010 Estate Cabernet Franc (Paso Robles),,,,
"A dense vanilla-bean character coats a nose of seared white peach and toasted nuts. The palate features thick, ripe fruits, preserved lemon, a touch of walnut and a rocky grip.",87,Inception 2013 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"This is initially dark and earthy, with brandied cherry, leather and tobacco aromas. It feels complete and offers core acids to keep it feeling fresh. Flavors of black fruit and spice lead to a lasting finish with cola and cherry notes.",88,Bodegas Palacio 2005 Glorioso Gran Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"This stellar expression of Teroldego, a native grape of northern Italy, is only produced in the best years and in limited quantity. It delivers a soft, supple texture accented by savory notes of black fruit, leather, black pepper and a touch of shaved truffle.",92,Mezzacorona 2005 Nos Riserva  (Teroldego Rotaliano),,,,
"Black-skinned fruit, cooking spice and balsamic aromas come together in this solid, straightforward Brunello. On the palate, firm, close-grained tannins frame black cherry jam, clove and vanilla flavors. Drink 2018–2022.",89,Tenuta Buon Tempo 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Soft, very round, already approachable, the wine is flavored with spice, black berry flavors and sweet tannins. Juicy, ripe Merlot for medium-term aging.",89,Château Couhins-Lurton 2008  Pessac-Léognan,,,,
"The name, Mineral, says everything you need to know about the texture of this wine. It is also rich, generous and ripe with apricot and melon flavors. This easygoing wine has a soft aftertaste that makes it drinkable now.",85,Cave des Grands Crus Blancs 2016 Minéral  (Mâcon-Loché),,,,
"Made entirely from Sangiovese, this opens with delicate red-skinned berry and Mediterranean herb aromas. The simple palate delivers red cherry and underbrush notes, with a mildly tanninic texture. Drink soon.",85,Palagetto 2014  Chianti Colli Senesi,,,,
"Pear, melon and anise aromas lead the way, followed on the palate by a broad, soft mouthfeel and flavors that add peppery spice on the long finish.",87,Dauvergne & Ranvier 2013 Vin Gourmand White (Côtes du Rhône),,,,
"This offers subdued whiffs of blue flower, red berry and a hint of moist soil. On the rustic, rather diluted palate, bracing acidity and raspy, fleeting tannins accompany suggestions of tart sour cherry and orange peel. It finishes on an astringent note.",85,Poggio Nardone 2014  Rosso di Montalcino,,,,
"Glorious aromas of coffee, vanilla and exotic spices mark the nose of this very impressive red. Strapping tannins are the backdrop for dense mineral, tar and leather flavors which carry over to the lingering finish. This is a wine built for the long haul. The tannins should start to be approachable in 2012 while the fruit density will carry it to 2020 and beyond.",93,Pio Cesare 2004  Barbaresco,,,,
"Overripe and Porty, with raisin, prune and chocolate flavors that finish hot and slightly sweet. The heat simply overwhelmed this Merlot.",81,Cerro Prieto 2008 Reserve Merlot (Paso Robles),,,,
"Cabernet Franc produces lightly pink-colored wines, as in this bone-dry rosé. It is balanced between fresh raspberry fruits and crisp, nervy acidity. Drink now while it is still so bright and refreshing.",86,Alliance Loire 2014 Domaine du Grand Breviande Rosé (Chinon),,,,
"Forward, fruity and flavorful, this is a quite pretty compendium of raspberry and cherry fruit, accented with a touch of orange peel. As with J. Christopher's pricier cuvées, it spent 18 months in one-quarter new French oak. Though labeled simply Willamette Valley, the fruit was sourced principally from the prestigious Dundee Hills AVA.",91,J. Christopher 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"The instantly recognizable label, sporting a bright green praying mantis on a plain brown background, is a quirky choice for a fine, estate-grown reserve. The fruit reaches blackberry concentration, with stiff, ripe tannins swathed in dark chocolate. Hints of earth and stem fade out through a lingering finish. It's already drinking well but could be cellared until 2019.",91,Watermill 2009 Praying Mantis Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),,,,
"A robust blend of 70% Sangiovese and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, this offers aromas of baked plum, mocha, menthol and oak-driven spice. The hearty palate initially opens with black fruit, chocolate, licorice and dried herb flavors but the heat of evident alcohol dominates the finish and the close.",89,Cabreo 2011 Il Borgo Red (Toscana),,,,
"A sturdy wine, sporting plenty of roasted cherries and caramel on a medium-weight frame. Turns strongly sour on the finish, where the flavor of charcoal dust also intrudes. —J.C.",82,Tyrrell's 2000 Old Winery Pinot Noir (South Eastern Australia),,,,
"This is a perfumed, elegant wine. Button mushrooms and cranberries combine to provide earthy underpinnings and bright fruit. It's medium in weight, with a silky texture, yet seems a bit warm on the finish.",89,Cambridge Road 2011 Pinot Noir (Martinborough),,,,
"Leesy vanilla aromas give this Garnacha Blanca a cookie-like nose. Plump and round across the palate, this tastes pithy like citrus peel, with a mildly bitter aftertaste. A simple finish doesn't offer anything new.",87,Celler Bàrbara Forés 2014 Blanc Garnacha Blanca (Terra Alta),,,,
"Impenetrably dark in color, this potent wine marries black fruit to ample barrel accents of smoke and char. Though aged in just 5% new French oak, those dark scents and flavors permeate the wine. It's a style with broad appeal.",91,Abacela 2014 Barrel Select Malbec (Umpqua Valley),,,,
"Initially it's rugged, but airing reveals black-cherry aromas and dry spice. The palate is crisp and a little sheer by itself, but the call here is that with food it'll be a winner. Flavors of red fruits are dry and collected, while the finish blends in coffee, spice and a touch of herbal Navarran panache.",87,Marco Real 2006 Crianza Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon (Navarra),,,,
"A majority varietal, with 10% Roussanne blended in, the whole is then aged in stainless steel. This white is fuller-figured than many, with big, bold flavors of fig and vanilla. It finishes crisply with just the slightest accent of anise.",87,Cairdean Estate 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"All varietal coming from Heart of the Hill Vineyard, this brooding wine offers aromas of dark coffee, cherry, bittersweet chocolate, clove and assorted barrel spices (80% new French). It's classically styled with reserved, almost elegant fruit flavors, bright acid and firm tannins that need time in the cellar to soften. Best after 2020.",91,Native Sun 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),,,,
"You don't hear much about Cab Franc from Chile, but this is one that is worth seeking out. The aromas are spicy and attractive, even if there's some lemony oak masking the fruit. In the mouth, raspberry, red cherry and red apple run the show, and then comes a fresh, lithe, balanced finish. Everything is generally in place here, including some bright, refreshing acidity. Only the heavy oak dulls it down a touch. Best Buy.",88,Valdivieso 2000 Single Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Franc (Lontué Valley),,,,
"An appealing fragrance of red rose and violet mingled with a whiff of baking spices drifts out of the glass. The juicy palate offers crushed Morello cherry, vanilla, licorice and cinnamon alongside firm but fine tannins. It's a balanced, classic Barbaresco.",92,Ressia 2011 Canova  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Eola Hills Pinots often offer this sort of interesting flavors—a mix of earth, herb and forest; the red fruit is tart and the tannins hard. A wine to cellar, it already shows depth and penetration, with a darker, smoky streak in the finish.",89,Seven of Hearts 2008 Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
"Delicate aromas of black-skinned berry, raisin and cooking spice lift out of the glass. On the straightforward palate, hints of vanilla and licorice add interest to ripe black cherry while pliant tannins provide easygoing support. Drink through 2020.",87,Luigi Righetti 2014 Campolieti  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso),,,,
Both ripe mirabelle and yellow juicy pear appear on the nose. The palate brims with the same fruit. The body is precise and fresh with a lip-smacking citrus finish.,89,Domaine Jean Sipp 2015 Les Trois Terroirs Pinot Blanc (Alsace),,,,
"This opens with earthy aromas of scorched earth, overripe plum and a whiff of game. The straightforward palate offers juicy wild cherry, raspberry jam, coffee and vanilla alongside zesty acidity and fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2017.",88,Icardi 2012 Suri di Mu  (Barbera d'Alba),,,,
"The green fruit and subtle, yeasty hay aromas are inviting. It feels nice and not abrasive, with notes of dried apple, citrus and rich, toasty yeast. It perks up on the finish, with dryness, zest and complexity. Very nice for $15.",89,Loxarel NV Cuvée Henri Reserva Limited Production Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"Coming from a who's who of Red Mountain vineyards, the inaugural release of this brand from Duckhorn Vineyards offers generous notes of dark coffee, espresso bean, dark cherries, sage and vanilla, with a pleasing interplay between fruit and barrel (64% new French). The plum and coffee flavors are restrained in style, with well-integrated tannins.",90,Canvasback 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),,,,
"A light tan color and dusty sweaty aromas of apricot, matchstick and onion set up a clampy, pithy, citrusy palate. Flavors of nectarine and orange are mild, low on stuffing and grabby on the finish.",84,Vivanco 2014 White (Rioja),,,,
"A generous and ripe wine, this is rich with citrus, apple along with hints of tropical fruits. The mineral texture gives the wine its shape and brings out the full-throated fruitiness. It is a wine to age for a few months, so drink from 2018.",88,Collegiale des Domaines de Loire 2016 Domaine Pascal Balland  (Sancerre),,,,
"This deeply colored wine shows plum, blueberry and black currant on the nose, with turned earth and pencil shavings providing depth. It's a bit thin on the sip, despite the chalky, somewhat clunky tannins, and the acidity is quite bright, delivering flavors of dark fruit and herbs.",86,Twisted Paso 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"A little rough and scoury, but fine and crisp and clean, with a slight sweetness from the dosage enriching the citrus, apple, yeast and vanilla flavors. Fancy and elegant.",87,J Vineyards & Winery NV Brut Rosé Sparkling (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Ripe and rich, it's full of tropical fruit, pineapple and mango flavors. Fresh acidity balances the full fruitiness. The aftertaste brings out a more mineral character.",87,Herdade de São Miguel 2013 Ciconia Branco White (Alentejano),,,,
"A citrus-rind aroma takes on an earthy bee-pollen tone on the nose. A streamlined and citric palate shows a mild tropical fruit flavor, while racing towards an off-dry finish.",83,St. Julian 2013 Braganini Reserve Traminette (Michigan),,,,
"Chorey vineyards, on the plain close to Beaune, often produce good-value wines. This attractive wine is a good example from an uneven vintage. It has structure and fruit, maybe not enough, along with a fresh, tangy character. It is developing fast, so drink from 2017.",87,Domaine Maillard 2013  Chorey-lès-Beaune,,,,
This is a ripe creamy wine. It is all fruit: ripe apples and sweet pears. There is a fine touch of spice as well as attractive acidity. It may be young but it is certainly ready to enjoy for its rich fruit. The producer's vineyards lie under the dramatic cliff of Solutré.,88,Domaine du Chalet Pouilly 2015  Saint-Véran,,,,
Raspberry jam and oak are the flavors of this drink-me-now wine. Brisk acidity gives it a mouthwatering cleanness. The single-clone angle has resulted in a certain one-dimensionality.,86,Fess Parker 2011 Pommard Clone Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"The winery has been quietly building up a solid track record with this bottling, and with the 2009, they've produced their best yet. The wine is gigantic in every respect. Vast, deep flavors of roasted coffee bean, blackberry, currant, violets and dark chocolate are complex, with plenty of toasted oak in the bargain. The tannins are strong, strong, strong, numbing the palate. While nobody can assure you it has a longterm future, this should evolve nicely with time; drink through 2022.",92,Krupp Brothers 2009 Black Bart Stagecoach Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley),,,,
"The nose is quiet but the bright, simple palate offers lime and a hint of bitter hazelnut. It's rather lean, with brisk acidity.",85,Bottega Vinaia 2014 Nosiola (Trentino),,,,
"The aromas bring notes of toasty spices, black currant, green pepper and blue fruit. The fruit and smoke flavors are smooth and easy drinking, with lightly grainy tannins providing support. It needs some more time to fully come together.",88,Milbrandt 2014 Traditions Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"From midway between Bordeaux and Toulouse, the small area of Buzet produces wines in the likeness of Bordeaux. This blend has the tannins of Cabernet Sauvignon prominent in the mix, giving the wine structure and density. Drink the wine from 2018.",89,Lionel Osmin & Cie 2015 Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon (Buzet),,,,
"There is only the faintest of aromas on this soft, lightly juicy wine. It is a warm-climate wine, rounded, soft and gentle. The freshness comes at the end, bright and with a citrus touch.",85,Bougrier 2015 Alain de la Treille Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de France),,,,
"This is a straightforward, plummy, raisiny wine with medium body and an earthy, tomato-like touch in the flavors. It will be good for very casual occasions.",83,Charles B. Mitchell NV Bella Rossa Italian Style Red (Fair Play),,,,
"All the Lemelson Pinots in 2014 are strikingly similar—rather light, tart, clean and simple. Cranberry and raspberry fruit, bright and tangy, tells the whole story here. Drink it over the next few years while that freshness remains.",89,Lemelson 2014 Jerome Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Made from estate-grown Dijon clones, this saw a touch of new oak. It's fruity and forward, as befits the ripe vintage, but stops short in the finish. There's also a light streak of vanilla and a suggestion of ginger.",86,Kramer 2012 Estate Chardonnay,,,,
"This is a robustly reduced, tightly wound and still quite youthful wine, showing both the vintage and the appellation in warmer years, with an intensity of black tea, tar and black cherry. Full bodied, it's powerfully weighted and structured.",89,MacPhail 2013 Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Green Valley),,,,
Spine-tingling acidity shines a spotlight on crisp sour cherry and cranberry flavors in this bristling Pinot Noir sparkling. Dry and a bit stark in style.,85,Hosmer 2013 Pinot Noir Brut Rosé Sparkling (Cayuga Lake),,,,
"This wine's nose is rather subdued, but the palate comes in with hints of green pear and lemon. Dry, light and clean, with the tiniest bit of enlivening spritz, it's as thirst-quenching as its name (Getränk, which translates to “beverage”) suggests.",88,Dürnberg 2016 Getränk Grüner Veltliner (Weinland Österreich),,,,
"A savory, lightly herbal aroma and somewhat meaty flavors like canteloupe make this wine a bit different than the norm. Light bodied and lean in texture, it's crisp with acidity, with tangy flavors last on the finish.",84,Sanglier Cellars 2013 Eight Barrels Family Reserve Chardonnay (Sonoma),,,,
"Rich and dazzling, this has a chocolate-covered cherry flavor, complexed with notes of anise, wild mushrooms, bacon and smoky sandalwood. It feels soft and velvety all the way through. Drink it now.",92,Margerum 2008 Purisima Mountain Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
Twizzler and other red candy aromas lead to a creamy feeling yet acidic palate that tastes like raspberry extract. Sharp acidity prevents what would otherwise be a cloying wine.,81,Bodegas Valdemar 2011 Conde de Valdemar Rosado Tempranillo-Garnacha (Rioja),,,,
"A smoky perfume marks this young wine immediately as Cabernet Franc. Its ripe blackberry and juicy black currant flavors give it richness, while tannins come through strongly. It's a powerful, solid wine, with great potential. Drink from 2020.",93,Château Tour des Gendres 2015 Les Anciens Francs Parcelle A252 Cabernet Franc (Côtes de Bergerac),,,,
"Here's a pleasant, fruity, rich Bordeaux blend that impresses for its sheer wealth of flavor. Floods the mouth with blackberries, cherries, red and black currants and sweet, smoky oak, with firm but finely ground tannins. Feels direct and simple now, but that could be a function of youth. Try holding for 4–6 years and see where it goes.",89,Girard 2007 Artistry Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Quite a good Cabernet, virgorous and dry, with an earthy edge of sweet, dried herbs alongside the blackberries and cedar. More elegant and food-friendly than many of the fruitier, high alcohol, oaky Cabs out there.",92,Round Pond 2008 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),,,,
"This new Artist Series red is three-quarters Cabernet Sauvignon, 18% Merlot, and the rest a mix of Cab Franc and Malbec, mostly from the Cold Creek Vineyard. Blue and black fruits are enhanced with barrel flavors of smoke, tobacco and espresso. Some additional years in bottle should help this wine knit together seamlessly.",91,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2010 Artist Series Meritage (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Aromas of scorched earth, underbrush, spicy plum, allspice and graphite lead the nose. On the palate, notes of cracked pepper and clove accent the mature blackberry, raspberry and fig flavors. It's balanced with well-integrated tannins and finishes on a note of bitter almond. Drink through 2016.",88,Mocavero 2010 Curtirussi Negroamaro (Salento),,,,
"This is a subdued and elegant Prosecco with pretty aromas of cut grass, dried herbs, peach, citrus and green melon. There's a touch of piquant acidity backed by menthol flavors that taste great against all that creamy foam and bubbling.",88,Bortolotti NV Extra Dry 47  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
"This wine has intense acidity along with red fruits, showing the freshness of the year. A smoky, burnt character from the wood aging needs to integrate, with a youthful crispness that needs to soften. Drink from 2020.",88,Domaine Jean Monnier et Fils 2014 Les Montrevenots Premier Cru  (Beaune),,,,
"Produced by the cooperative of the Hautes Côtes, this wine is bright and fruity. It has light tannins and warm, red cherry character. With its acidity and structure it could age, although not for long. Drink from 2018.",87,Nuiton-Beaunoy 2015  Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Beaune,,,,
"This Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon blend offers aromas of sweet berry, blackberry, pipe tobacco and molasses. It has great, thick concentration and bright fruit flavors.",89,Castello di Meleto 2004 Rainero Red (Toscana),,,,
"Based in the village of Les Loges, close to the Loire, this producer has made a light, fruity style of wine. It is crisp with citrus, bright acidity and only the hint of a more mineral texture. It can be drunk now for its fruitiness.",88,Domaine Dominique Pabiot 2014 Les Vieilles Terres  (Pouilly-Fumé),,,,
"Fragrances suggest wild berry layered with notes of forest floor, red rose, leather, clove and balsam. On the palate, sage, thyme and espresso back up sensations of ripe Morello cherry alongside tightly woven and assertive tannins that need time to unwind. Drink 2016–2023.",90,Socré 2011 Roncaglie  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Though quite light, this widely available Pinot could be tossed in with a group of village Burgundies without any trouble. Flavors of berry, compact earth and herb carry through onto the gentle, fading finish.",86,Erath 2010 Pinot Noir (Oregon),,,,
"This is a ripe, wood-aged wine that is rich with dark plum and ripe berry tones. Its big, bold character is primary and a far cry from subtle. Drink now.",85,Ribafreixo 2012 Barrancôa Red (Alentejano),,,,
"Stemmy in earthy pine and clove-like spice, this is a powerfully dense and delicious wine. It's on the higher side in terms of alcohol, though doesn't reflect it in bouquet or taste. Savory dark berry wraps itself around mushroomy truffles and black tea to linger on the tongue through a lengthy, weighty finish.",91,Pali 2013 Sangiacomo Roberts Road Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"This gorgeous wine, a blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo and Colorino, opens with aromas that recall underbrush, mint, woodland berries and balsamic herbs. The palate offers layers of sour cherry and white pepper accented with exotic Asian spices and sage that add depth. It's surprisingly fresh for the hot vintage and the solid tannins carry through to the finish. Still youthful, this will benefit with a few more years aging. Drink 2015–2022.",94,Castello di Monsanto 2007 Il Poggio Riserva  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"Perhaps Temecula's future is in Super Tuscans. This balanced blend of 50% Sangiovese, 21% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and 9% Cabernet Franc offers a complex nose of cranberry, pomegranate, pencil lead and chocolate sauce. Flavors of hot brick, white pepper, raspberry and stewed mushrooms rock the palate.",92,Falkner 2011 Amante Red (Temecula Valley),,,,
"Organic grapes go into this fresh, crisp and fruity wine. With raspberry flavors, it is bone-dry and full of acidity. The wine is refreshing—light and bright.",86,Château Sainte Marguerite 2015 L'Esprit de Sainte Marguerite Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"Dusty aromas of apple and vanilla break up fast as the wine shows oxidized notes. The palate feels narrow and lemony, while the flavor profile is one dimensional and settles on lemon and tart apple. On the finish, things turn stalky in flavor and acidic in feel.",85,La Caña 2011 Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"Inky violet-red to the eye, this wine has a nose of blueberry, white chocolate and violet. It is pleasant on the palate from start to finish, with velvety tannins supporting flavors of black cherry, blueberry, vanilla, star anise and lavender that slowly drift off into closing notes of floral spice.",92,Shiloh Winery 2013 Mosaic Exclusive Edition Red (Judean Hills),,,,
"A wine with power and structure from one of the great Grand Crus of Burgundy. The wines have weight with generous red fruits and a great sense of depth,  and are very firm at the end. The vines are managed by Bernard Bouvier.",94,Domaine René Bouvier 2011  Echézeaux,,,,
"A 100% varietal wine from grapes sourced in Coombsville, this offers cranberry, currant and clove in equal measure. This tiny-production project features tight-grained tannin and a dusty texture built around moderate acidity and body.",88,Trotter 1/16 2013 Oak Canyon Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"A very dark color and densely packed aromas of blackberry, charred wood and dark chocolate are followed by a richly tannic texture and generous flavors that are dry and reminiscent of espresso beans and black cherries. The concentration of flavor and equally impressive tannic mouthfeel make this wine bold and memorable.",91,Marietta Cellars 2014 Christo Red (North Coast),,,,
"Rich layers of honey and nectar roil through this lip-smackingly tropical wine. It's penetrating and juicy, flush with sweet mango, guava and citrus flavors. Cutting lime acidity and mineral intensity jolt the midpalate through an endlessly lingering finish. Stunning already it should improve for decades to come.",95,Robert Weil 2015 Kiedrich Gräfenberg Auslese Riesling (Rheingau),,,,
"A common nose of apple, mild toast and baked corn is about what you'd expect from this brand and Chile. Like its cousin called Cefiro (from Viña Casablanca), it's geared toward apple, spice and vanilla. Not overoaked or forced; good but basic.",86,Santa Carolina 2008 Reserva Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"This is a fresh type of Pinot, with a pointy bouquet containing herbal raspberry and nettle qualities. It feels juicy, fresh and lifted due to the acidity, while the flavors of raspberry and herb come with dry, oaky, toasty accents. It's peppery, dry and light on the finish.",85,Apaltagua 2011 Reserva Pinot Noir (Curicó Valley),,,,
"Even at a considerable 15 g/l of residual sugar, this wine comes across as almost dry, thanks to its crisp acidity. Scents of petrichor, green apple and lime start things off, while those razor-sharp acids show up on the finish. Drink now.",87,Nelson Bay 2009 Riesling (Nelson),,,,
"Lush and thickly concentrated, this crowd-friendly wine offers a brightness of cassis that complements its darker, richer tones of chocolate mocha and clove. Medium in build, it uses its oak well, integrating it into the whole.",90,Folie à Deux 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Underbrush, truffle, ripe red berry, violet and pipe tobacco aromas emerge on this beautiful, structured red. The delicious, full-bodied palate shows ripe black cherry, fleshy raspberry, star anise, ground pepper and clove framed in ripe, velvety tannins. A generous, gorgeous wine.",95,Rizzi 2011 Pajorè  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Wisps of smoke and crushed rock imbue this dry, broadly textured wine. Lemon and lime acidity strike the midpalate like a laser before melting into the mineral-rich sheen that extends the finish. It's remarkably bold for a Mosel Riesling, yet never loses it's elegant appeal.",93,Fritz Haag 2013 Brauneberger Juffer Sonnenuhr Trocken GG Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Underbrush, camphor, balsamic notes, game, French oak and oak-driven spice lead the nose. The tight, firmly structured palate shows oak, mature plum, baked fruit and a hint of vanilla alongside assertive, grainy tannin that dry out the finish.",88,Luigi Voghera 2011 Basarin  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Fresh, clean apple and white-peach aromas are good but not overly expressive or complex. This feels fresh and lifted, with minerally, stony flavors of apple and lime. A clean, pointed finish feels nice and tastes like lettuce and bitter greens.",88,Segura Viudas NV Reserva Heredad Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"Violet blossoms and orange peel aromatics jump out, followed by scents and flavors of lamb tartare and mixed charcuterie. Cofermented with 5% Viognier, it's an elegant and beautifully proportioned wine, offering ripe purple fruits with finishing hints of baking spices and dark chocolate.",96,Cayuse 2011 Cailloux Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),,,,
This opens with sweet notes of dried strawberry and Christmas spice backed by touches of bitter chocolate and toasted hazelnut. The finish has elements of both sweetness and sourness.,89,Montalbera 2008 Selezione Limpronta  (Ruché di Castagnole Monferrato),,,,
"This wine is so woody and toasty upfront, the bouquet brimming with scents of wood-grilled apple, mealy melon and lemon custard. The medium-plus-weight palate follows suit, with forward toast and ripe-fruit flavors that are partnered with just enough acidity to keep the decadence in check.",87,Olsen Private Vineyards 2014 Chardonnay (Paarl),,,,
"Parts of Clare Valley are ideal for Cabernet Sauvignon, illustrated by this reasonably priced bottling. Mint and cassis show remarkable purity on the nose, while the palate is properly restrained without being hard or austere. That said, there are some dusty tannins on the finish, so drink 2020–2030.",91,Kilikanoon 2013 Blocks Road Cabernet Sauvignon (Clare Valley),,,,
"One of Schramsberg's younger releases, and made from all white grapes, this wine has tantalizing aromas of vanilla, apple and light toast that lead to layered and creamy flavors. A nice brisk balance with good acidity underlies the spice and fruit.",90,Schramsberg 2012 Blanc de Blancs Sparkling (North Coast),,,,
"Blackberry, black pepper, crushed rocks and a touch of herbs show on the nose of this always solid-for-the-price bottling from this crew in southern Paso. There is firm structure on the sip, with soy and peppercorn giving umami touch to the blackberry syrup and purple flower flavors.",88,Ancient Peaks 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Margarita Ranch),,,,
Don Peppino's vineyard lies on the lower slopes of Mt. Etna where the black volcanic terrain is easier to cultivate. The resulting fruit here comes across as focused and well-defined by mineral and berry tendencies with excellent crispness and enormous endurance on the close.,94,Tenuta delle Terre Nere 2007 Prephylloxera La Vigna di Don Peppino  (Etna),,,,
"Named after David Moreau's mother, Simone, this old-vine wine is concentrated, with sweet-tasting fruit and spicy tannins. The tight acidity gives a delicious lift to the red berry flavors.",89,David Moreau 2010 Cuvée S  (Santenay),,,,
"Barone Ricasoli delivers a top-class Chianti Classico that is penetrating, proud and modern at the same time. The wine is creamy and dense in the mouth with satisfying flavors of blackberry, cured meat and exotic spice. Very nice.",92,Barone Ricasoli 2004 Castello di Brolio  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"Stone, earth and hay are about to merge into notions of lanolin and chamomile: clearly this is a maturing wine at an early point of its evolution. The palate is fluid and has the texture of drenched chalky, stone. The fruit is hiding in the wings, only to appear as orange oil here or as apple scent there. The dryness shows every nuance of this earthy, wine from a historic, co-planed vineyard of Riesling, Pinot Gris and Gewurztraminer. What a triumph. Drink 2016–2026.",94,Cave de Ribeauvillé 2009 Osterberg Grand Cru Clos du Zahnacker White (Alsace),,,,
"Aromas of stewed plums are offset with more rustic fragrances reminiscent of barnyard, wet fur and meat juices. The palate conveys red cherry and spice notes but astringent tannins give this wine an abrupt finish. It's tired and lean.",86,Verbena 2009  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Massive and dark up front, with gritty aromas of herb, cola and black olive. It feels chunky, ripe and full bodied, bearing an herbal, minty flavor and notes of black fruit, licorice and earth. A chocolate/carob flavor marks the finish.",88,Odfjell 2010 Orzada Carmenère (Maule Valley),,,,
"A bit reduced when first opened, it throws off scents of burnt rubber, then slowly opens into a roundly fruity, lightly toasty Pinot with a firmly tannic base. Flavors of Dr. Pepper drift through the midpalate. Give it a good decanting and it's fine for near-term consumption.",89,Panther Creek 2008 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This wine is expansive and juicy on the palate. A tight grip shows its youth while the underlying softness on the texture reflects the relative coolness of the growing spot. It imparts Napa's robust ripeness in its depth of cassis, chocolate and black pepper.",90,Trefethen 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oak Knoll District),,,,
"Made of 85% Sangiovese and small amounts of Ciliegiolo and Canaiolo, this opens with subtle Morello cherry and underbrush aromas. The palate delivers black plum and tobacco flavors, bolstered by dusty tannins. Enjoy soon.",87,Castello di Poppiano 2014 Il Cortile  (Chianti Colli Fiorentini),,,,
"Montesei shows authentic Soave Classico aromas of pear, stone fruit and dusty mineral at the back. Aged only in stainless steel in order to maintain its aromatic freshness, the wine feels smooth and richer than you'd expect on the palate.",87,Le Battistelle 2011 Montesei  (Soave Classico),,,,
"Here is a broadly appealing, instantly approachable white wine with mouthwatering flavors of melon, white peach, pineapple and still more exotic tropical fruits. The wine is round and full, forward and just a little tart, but nicely supported with sweet, spicy barrel flavors.",90,Novelty Hill 2006 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Roussanne (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This sugary-sweet dessert Chardonnay tries hard to please, offering waves of honey, tangerine, mango and vanilla flavors. It's tantalizingly delicious, but could be just a tad more concentrated, especially at this price.",88,Lynmar 2011 Divinity Late Harvest Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Sweet-seeming oak aromas and flavors mingle with ripe fruit notes in this full-bodied, soft-textured and well-priced wine.",86,Grayson 2015 Lot 10 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),,,,
"In reaction to Mount Etna's volcanic eruptions, local farmers have adopted a unique mix of Christianity and mysticism to protect against imminent dangers. Many vineyard sites are anointed with religious names, like Santo Spirito, as if the name were a lucky charm in itself. This delightful vineyard-designate wine is ethereal and bright, with loads of small berry intensity and a dusty, dry finish.",92,Tenuta delle Terre Nere 2008 Santo Spirito  (Etna),,,,
"So acidic, it's almost sour, and the cherry and cranberry fruit isn't rich enough to offset that tartness. As a result, it feels unbalanced and uncomfortable.",84,Adelaida 2008 HMR Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Paso Robles),,,,
"Tangy and crisp in acidity, this easy-to-drink white wine has tangerine, lemon, kiwi fruit and Asian pear flavors. It's a little sweet on the finish, with a sugared lemonade richness.",85,Dancing Bull 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (California),,,,
"A 100% varietal wine coming from Block 14 of this up-and-coming vineyard, it has a lot of appeal with notes of dark-brewed coffee, chocolate, cherries and black raspberries. Aged 18 months in half new French oak, it's silky, soft, and supple, showing a lot of polish and restraint.",91,Columbia Crest 2010 Reserve StoneTree Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Wahluke Slope),,,,
"Good concentration and clear varietal flavors mark this excellent Washington Mourvèdre. The mixed red fruits are well integrated, with a strong vein of mineral, and a finishing wash of vanilla, coffee and chocolate. Lots of barrel flavors to be sure, but the fruit can take it.",90,Robert Ramsay 2009 McKinley Springs Vineyard Mourvèdre (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
95–97. Barrel sample. An impressively dense wine with a serious structure. Dusty tannins go with a powerful structure and a wonderfully deep texture. Very solid and chunky.,96,Château Cheval Blanc 2012 Barrel Sample  (Saint-Émilion),,,,
"Not a lot of stuffing in this Pinot Noir. The raspberry and cherry flavors hit fast and disappear quickly, with a mushroomy finish. But the wine does show a certain flair and elegance.",85,Calera 2011 Pinot Noir (Central Coast),,,,
"Perfumed like a summer garden, this wine is spicy and oaky, offering a wealth of cardamom and cola. Dark cherry, cranberry, orange and rhubarb vie for a balance between tart and succulent, the acidity ruling the day in the end.",92,Pahlmeyer 2015 Jayson Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Aromas of wild berry, clove and white pepper lead the nose on this fresh rosato. The juicy palate delivers candied wild cherry, crushed raspberry and a cinnamon note alongside refreshing acidity.",87,Tommasi 2013 Masseria Surani Helios Negroamaro (Puglia),,,,
"This wine is 90% Syrah, with the balance Grenache (8%) and Mourvèdre. The aromas are reserved initially, with notes of blueberry pie, dark-roasted coffee and raspberry. The palate is surprisingly light for the aromas (and producer), with the finish seeming attenuated. The oak also comes off as a bit heavy.",88,Gorman 2015 Old Scratch G-S-M (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This opens with white flower, yellow stone fruit and honeydew melon aromas. The fruity sensations carry over to the palate, with a tangerine zest note and tangy acidity that leads to a juicy finish.",87,Bertaini 2016 Sereole  (Soave Colli Scaligeri),,,,
"The quality is fair for the price on this soft, one-dimensional wine. It has straightforward flavors of sour cherry candy and cranberry sauce.",83,Guenoc 2012 Petite Sirah (California),,,,
"Les Gras Moutons is regarded as one of the top vineyards of Sèvre et Maine. Here it has produced a richly fragrant, aromatic wine that is structured and tightly textured. It's full of acidity, freshly squeezed lemon and some minerality. Drink from 2016.",92,Domaine Claude Branger 2013 Terroir les Gras Moutons Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),,,,
"Funky, off-base floral aromas and a sweet, cotton candy flavor profile. Feels flat and sugary to the end, with a nip of bitter almond.",81,Graffigna 2007 Centenario Estate Bottled Pinot Grigio (San Juan),,,,
"This wine won't be available until 2013/2014, but for the moment it is a mouthful of extremely ripe blackberry and blueberry jam, with layers of tar and dirt. Big and ripe, the additional time in bottle will help smooth out its edges.",88,Easton 2009 Estate Zinfandel (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),,,,
"Smooth and seductively intense, this wine offers rich layers of black cherry and blackberry that lengthen on the palate, buoyed by soft tannins. An earthy sublayer keeps it complex and compelling.",90,JCB 2012 No. 22 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Aromas of dried herbs, green olive, grilled asparagus and smoke lead to intensely concentrated savory flavors with a flat-out dazzling mouthfeel. It's a knockout that overloads the senses.",96,Cayuse 2012 Bionic Frog Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Made with organically grown Pinot Nero, this opens with a fragrance of perfumed red berry and cream-filled pastry. The elegant palate offers creamy strawberry, wild raspberry and spice alongside bright acidity and a soft mousse.",92,Barone Pizzini 2010 Rosé Pinot Nero (Franciacorta),,,,
"Shows the hallmarks of a fine Mount Veeder Cabernet, namely immediate succulence, intensely concentrated mountain fruit, and yet an almost certain capacity to age. Lush, ripe flavors of blackberries and crème de cassis lead to a long, soft finish. Drink now–2018.",92,Crosby Roamann 2010 Cupiens Videre Lucem Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),,,,
"A drier, more minerally style than many coming out of Marlborough, with white grapefruit flavors that come across as brisk and refreshing. There's fruit weight on the palate, with the sort of stony flavors that pair with virtually any seafood dish.",89,Huia 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"La Nerthe's Cuvée des Cadettes shows a bit of oak on the nose in its hints of vanilla and toasted coconut, but also copious amounts of raspberry fruit. It's full bodied and lush, with the fruit gently cosseted by oak, not at all overwhelmed, and the finish is long and plushly textured. While approachable even now, it should be at its best sometime after 2020.",94,Château La Nerthe 2010 Cuvée des Cadettes Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),,,,
"Dark, heavy and foresty on the nose, with astringent cherry and coffee flavors. Sharp in terms of feel, with plenty of leftover acidity on the finish. Tartaric acid is all over this wine.",82,Santos Beck 2003 Cavas de Santos Gran Vino Red (Mendoza),,,,
"This elegant bottling by two service-industry veterans shows tons of potpourri, dried lavender, black raspberry and red plum on the nose. The flavors are quite broad and inviting, with hibiscus and ripe tomato meshing into juniper and clove. It's light in mouthfeel and weight, but well structured.",93,Point & Line 2015 Reserve Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Green beans and snap peas give this Sauvignon Blanc a green cast overall, but there's some citrus and gooseberry fruit as well. It's clean and refreshing on the finish.",87,Evans & Tate 2015 Breathing Space Sauvignon Blanc (Australia),,,,
90-92. Barrel sample. This is an impressively rich wine that's packed with forward fruit and spice flavors. It has power and dark tannins while retaining a fine sense of style.,91,Château Grand Corbin-Despagne 2011 Barrel Sample  (Saint-Émilion),,,,
"Elegant and fresh, this linear wine brings together sensations of black raspberry, blue flower, licorice, white pepper and clove that are balanced with vibrant acidity and graceful tannins. Bright and delicious, it's made to be enjoyed young, so drink now.",89,Rivetti Massimo 2012 Avene Nebbiolo (Langhe),,,,
"Commemorating the small boats that once plied the Loire river, this wine is fresh with a ripe yellow-fruit character that contrasts with the salty, tangy flavors to give the wine its texture and tight, steely structure. The wine will be best kept for a few months; drink from 2017.",89,Joseph Mellot 2014 Domaine des Mariniers  (Pouilly-Fumé),,,,
"A classic blend of Dão grapes, including Tinta Roriz and Touriga Nacional, this is a generous, full wine that balances a firm, mineral texture with ripe plum and damson fruits. Wood aging has given an extra dimension to its broad opulence. Drink from 2018.",92,Magnum Vinhos 2012 Ribeiro Santo Reserva Red (Dão),,,,
"Lemondrop, buttered toast and vanilla cream flavors mark this soft, opulent Chardonnay. It becomes a little cloying on the finish.",85,Kunde 2012 Kinneybrook Chardonnay (Sonoma County),,,,
"Rather lean aromas and spare fruit flavors meet more lavishly rich flavors for dual personalities in this medium-bodied, soft-textured and slightly sweet wine.",83,Cambridge & Sunset 2013 California Series Cabernet Sauvignon (California),,,,
"Berry fruits and very soft tannins mark this wine. It has a green pepper edge to it, allied to high acidity. Drink within two years.",84,Château Grand Rolland 2008  Bordeaux Supérieur,,,,
"With aromas like Bartlett pears and butter cookies, and rich flavors that almost turn sweet, this is a full-bodied, soft-textured confection. The crispness factor is rather low to support that richness fully.",84,Baron Cooper 2013 Chardonnay (California),,,,
"This blend of Syrah and Grenache has minty, wet-plaster aromas, but also some pure Grenache notes. The palate runs tart, with cranberry and cherry. And the finish is tight and bitter, with more acids than tannin. A viable bistro wine but go no further.",82,Château de Jau 2002 Jaja Red (Vin de Pays d'Oc),,,,
"Yeasty funk still dominates the nose and only lets a touch of lemon zest through. The palate continues with the zesty background against which flashes of riper fruit appear: juicy pear and luscious tangerine. The fruit expression is ripe but utterly fresh. The taut dry palate is anchored in something cool and fresh, something that expands as texture and fills not only the palate but also the mind. This is fresh and luminous, elegant and fine boned. Drink now through 2030.",94,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Roche Calcaire Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"Aromas of blackberry, vanilla and violet lead into flavors of black cherry, blueberry, custard, anise and a suggestion of mint. This wine is bright and fruity at first sip, but it stiffens up after a few moments as plush tannins coat the palate. The strawberry finish is marked with a touch of black pepper.",90,Yatir 2012 Petit Verdot (Judean Hills),,,,
"There's no mistaking the variety with this wine's aromas of herbs, dried tobacco, coffee, flowers and cherry. It dazzles with its supple feel and exquisitely balanced cherry flavors that carry off into the distance.",93,Owen Roe 2012 The Pearl Block Union Gap Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Yakima Valley),,,,
"An obviously smoky, peppery aroma leads to equally smoky, even ashy flavors and a very tannic texture.",82,Enoteca Five 2012 Instant Gratification Red (California),,,,
"Here's a fresh and lively super Tuscan blend that would make a fantastic companion to roasted lasagna with ground beef and hearty tomato sauce. The wine is soft, velvety and layered with mature aromas of red berry, spice, leather and tobacco.",89,Máté 2006 Albatro Red (Toscana),,,,
"This brand is winemaker Heidi Peterson Barrett's ode to Rhône, as well as a place for her own Bordeaux-varietal wines. The first vintage of this 100% varietal wine on its own, it's soft and supple with a tannic backbone. Pretty plum aromas and a streak of peppery spice and leather are joined on the palate by juicy blueberry and finished off in restrained oak.",90,La Sirena 2012 Grenache (Napa Valley),,,,
"Golden caramel in color, this wine opens in a decadence of creme brûlée, a richness that subsides on the lighter style on the palate, marked by a saltiness of wet stone, pineapple and vanilla oak. Together, the light and heavy balance one another and the wine tastes complete.",92,Dutton Estate 2014 Kyndall's Reserve Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This potent Syrah is marked with strong scents of organic compost, umami, and roasted meat; it's packed with plenty of purple and black fruits. Though it tails off slightly in the finish, it seems destined for a good 6–8 year ride in the cellar, improving all the way.",92,Bunnell 2008 Boushey-McPherson Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),,,,
"This honeyed white wine made from late-harvest grapes is both intensely rich and so fresh and crisp. Its acidity cuts through the ripe apricot and candied orange flavors, creating a balance that will allow it to age. Drink from 2019.",89,Château Jolys 2015  Jurançon,,,,
"This full-bodied, fleshy wine fits the typical Châteauneuf-du-Pape mold, delivering ample black-cherry and plum fruit, then layering atop hints of Mexican chocolate and baking spices. Drink now–2025.",92,Domaine Lucien Barrot et Fils 2013 La Sousto Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),,,,
"Old-fashioned Petite Sirah, dark, heavy and hot in alcohol. It tastes overripe, with extracted flavors of raisins and prunes, leading to a bitter finish.",82,San Simeon 2009 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),,,,
"On the nose, this Cab delivers a mix of vinegar, rubber and jumpy berry aromas. The palate is smooth but bland and soft, while flavors of licorice, prune and herbal notes finish easy.",86,Valle Secreto 2010 First Edition Cabernet Sauvignon (Cachapoal Valley),,,,
"Significantly riper than the elegant 2011, this well-priced cuvée has some real muscle. Plum and cherry fruit are set in a rather thick frame of earth and rock, buoyed by moderate acidity. Just 15% of the barrels were new.",88,Winderlea 2012 Dundee Hills Vineyards Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),,,,
"Juicy, youthful raspberry and cherry aromas come with tobacco and dried  grass details. This wine has a broad, malleable texture and a floral flavor that make it quite quaffable.",86,Bogati NV Black Label Club CMC Reserve Red (Shenandoah Valley),,,,
"Floral and fleshy, this is a big-boned, concentrated wine. A ripe rendering of apple, pear and peach is spiked in intriguing seasonings of lemongrass and nutmeg.",91,Saintsbury 2015 Sangiacomo Green Acres Catarina Clone 4 Chardonnay (Carneros),,,,
"A nice, easy Syrah made for immediate drinking. It's dry and balanced, with rich flavors of black currants, cherries, cocoa, leather, tobacco and pepper flavors.",86,Bodega del Sur 2005 Syrah (Calaveras County),,,,
"Aromas of dark berry, forest floor and Mediterranean spice lead the nose on this vibrant wine made with 100% Sangiovese. The palate offers crushed blackberry, ripe dark cherry, black pepper and savory herb, while firm but fine-grained tannins provide support.",90,Fattoria di Magliano 2012 Sinarra  (Maremma Toscana),,,,
"Some sweetness is immediately apparent in the fruit, which seems to be a juicy blend of cherry, berry and hints of prune. Forward and open, this offers single-vineyard fruit flavor at a budget wine price. Nice winemaking; not for the cellar, but a lovely bottle to drink right now.",88,Balboa 2008 Mirage Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Packaged in a long, elegant bottle with a wax seal, this precious Picolit dessert wine offers aromas of stone fruit, apricot, dried mint, orange zest and ginger. It shows pretty complexity and a smooth, creamy mouthfeel.",90,Colutta 2007 Picolit (Colli Orientali del Friuli),,,,
"A warm, ripe and fruity wine that holds a mix of crisp apple acidity and richer yellow fruits. There is just enough acidity to give freshness while the wine has a richer, full character. It should age until 2015.",86,Herdade do Rocim 2012 Branco White (Alentejano),,,,
"Trefethen has been on a roll the last few years, producing some of Napa's most spectacular Cabernets. This bottling, which contains minor quantities of Petit Verdot and Merlot, spent 28 months in new French oak barrels. The fruit is incredibly ripe and intense, with flavors of black currants and chocolate-covered cherries. As hard as the tannins are, they must have been even more aggressive two or three years ago, so kudos to Trefethen for holding the bottle back for five years. This beauty is just now beginning its long journey. Drink now–2020.",95,Trefethen 2008 HaLo Cabernet Sauvignon (Oak Knoll District),,,,
"A delicate and subtle expression of Sangiovese Grosso, with tight touches of wild berry, almond skin, forest bramble, rum cake, cola and eucalyptus. Streamlined and tight, with great power on the close. A very compact and tightly constructed wine.",89,Agostina Pieri 2007  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Starting to lose fruit at the age of four years, with the cherries and blackberries fading into the background, which lets the alcohol show through. Soft, too. Seems a bit threadbare, and probably was better a year ago.",85,Beauregard 2006 Zayante Vineyard Syrah (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"Made of 100% Kalecik Karasi, this wine is deep garnet to the eye, offering aromas of cherry, shale and orange zest. It fills the mouth with flavors of raspberry jam, orange marmalade, chocolate, anise and smoke. Velvety tannins continue into the cool anise-laden finish, with a touch of lemon zest making its appearance at the final moment.",91,Kavaklidere 2011 Prestige Kalecik Karasi (Ankara),,,,
"Inky aromas of ripe blackberry, black currant, lemon peel and graphite set up a chewy, concentrated, intense palate with blackened flavors of licorice, chocolate, peppercorn and blackberry. A charred, tannic, mouthfilling finish says this should spend more time on its side before opening. Hold until 2017, then drink through 2025.",93,Bodegas y Viñedos Tábula 2011 Tábula  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"The grapes taste too ripe, showing shriveled fruit notes of raisins and prunes, with dry, bitter tannins that will never age away. A heavy dose of new French oak does nothing except to add oaky sweetness.",84,Michael James Wines 2010 Beatty Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),,,,
"Peppers and cloves accent cherry-berry fruit on the nose of this single-vineyard wine. On the palate, it's full bodied and deep and silky in texture, with a long spice-inflected finish.",90,D'Arenberg 2010 The Derelict Vineyard Grenache (McLaren Vale),,,,
"With vines in the northeast of the Gers region, this winery produces impressively ripe red wines. This wood-aged and spicy wine is still young and needs time to integrate the wood with the red berry fruits. It does have weight and potential richness, so give it until 2016.",88,Domaine d'Arton 2012 La Croix d'Arton Red (Côtes de Gascogne),,,,
"This is a big, full-bodied and nicely balanced wine, with hefty blackberry and cherry flavors matched to a firm texture of rich acidity and fine-grained tannins.",88,Weibel Family 2012 Patriot Red (Mendocino County),,,,
"Made from the Gros Manseng grape, this pineapple and mango flavored wine is dry, but so fruity. The acidity just floats in the mouth, while the slight fruit-skin texture adds an edge to a wine that's delicious.",90,Lapeyre 2006  Jurançon Sec,,,,
"An exotic bouquet suggests dried roses, brown sugar, cranberry and plum jam. There's a sweetness in the mouth that continues the impression of brown sugar, or maybe a streak of cola. It's an interesting bottle that could develop further or fall off a cliff; it turns a little funky in the finish. More than 12,000 cases were made.",86,Archery Summit 2004 Premier Cuvée Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),,,,
"Juicy, leathery and earthy on the palate, this is a densely extracted blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. It presents dry, lengthy tannins and a rusticity of dusty clove, finishing lean and restrained.",88,Von Strasser 2013 Sori Bricco Vineyard Red (Diamond Mountain District),,,,
"This is the first Viognier produced by the winery. The wine was aged in neutral oak, but nonetheless there's a solid hit of vanilla cream and butterscotch on the palate. The underlying flavors are solidly Viognier, suggesting tropical fruits, peaches and pears.",88,Judd's Hill 2012 Viognier (Napa Valley),,,,
"This wine takes a modern approach, recognized by the ripe blueberry, currant, vanilla and toasted nut aromas that characterize it. The wine is soft and silky in the mouth with a caressing quality and bright spice notes on the finish.",88,Collosorbo 2005 Red (Sant'Antimo),,,,
"Plum, French oak, coffee, vanilla and Oriental spice aromas emerge in the glass. The concentrated palate offers mature black cherry, blackberry jam, vanilla and licorice alongside fine-grained tannins.",88,Rinaldi 2012 La Bricca  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore),,,,
"Maple, brown sugar, caramel and cinnamon powder aromas portend sweetness. In the mouth, this is fairly heavy and syrupy, with moderate acidity. Caramel and mushroom flavors finish fragmented but with potency.",87,Delgado Zuleta NV Premium Cream Sherry (Jerez),,,,
"From vines close to the medieval castle of Numão in the Douro Superior, this wine represents the top of the range for this family-owned estate. Layers of new wood vie with the ripe fruit of this wine that offers spice as well as black-plum fruits and acidity. It is developing well, giving a rich wine that will be ready to drink from 2019.",92,Conceito Vinhos 2014 Conceito Red (Douro),,,,
"From the northernmost appellation of the Côte de Nuits, this firm and solidly tannic wine comes from one of the vineyards on the list to get Premier Cru approval in the near future. Its tannins are well balanced already with the red-berry fruit and bitter-cherry flavors that are shot through with acidity. Drink from 2018.",92,Domaine Huguenot 2013 Champs-Perdrix  (Marsannay),,,,
"Here is a wonderful example of Sauvignon Blanc from Northern Italy at its most aromatic and fragrant. The wine boasts pristine notes of sage leaf, kiwi and honeydew melon. The mouthfeel is firm, tonic and compact.",88,Colterenzio 2007 Prail Sauvignon (Alto Adige),,,,
"Juicy in a slightly overripe way, this sweet, plummy and jammy wine is soft and supple in broad tannins. On the finish, a combination of smoke and vanilla make their point.",85,Deering 2011 Maus Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"Lucid yellow in the glass, yet lightly oxidized on the nose. A spacy, unique Viura. There's dry apricot and peach pit flavors, and the mouthfeel and acidity are impeccable. A treat for explorers; eschews all blueprints for modern white wine.",91,Marqués de Murrieta 2003 Capellanía Viura (Rioja),,,,
"Cedary, leafy, dry aromas of cherry and lemon peel filter into a sinewy, oaky palate with cherry, plum and vanilla flavors. A direct finish is hard-driving and a bit herbal. Like many 2008 Riojas, this is rough and firm in its delivery.",87,Viñamada 2008 Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"Smooth, ripe and rounded, it's ready to drink with its light perfume and spice. Rich pear and quince fruits add freshness to the fullness. Drink now.",87,Henri Schoenheitz 2011 Val Saint Grégoire Pinot Blanc (Alsace),,,,
Crisp lemon aromas follow through to an equally crisp wine. It has a touch of pepper as well as citrus and green-plum fruits. The acidity and the tangy texture are given weight by the lees aging. Drink now.,86,Domaine du Colombier 2016 Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),,,,
"Ripe Sauvignon Blanc, bringing out pear and apple flavors, topped with cream. There is a bite from an apple skin texture, along with bright, delicate acidity.",84,Guy Saget 2008 La Petite Perrière Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de Pays de France),,,,
"This age-worthy wine was given plenty of time to develop in used French oak, and will stand up to further time in the cellar. Right now it offers structured depths of high-toned cherry and leather, with a floral flourish that keeps it bright and fresh despite its substantial concentration. Drink now through 2020.",92,Epiphany 2012 Stagecoach Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley),,,,
"This easygoing wine smells mellow and plummy, tastes more like brown sugar than fruit and has a soft texture and medium body.",84,Oak and Vine 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),,,,
"Champagne producers pick Pinot Noir for sparkling wines less than fully ripe. In this wine, there are some attractive yeasty, bread-dough aromas, but it shows too many of the green herbal and stemmy flavors of unripe Pinot.",83,Laurent-Perrier NV Cuvée Brut Rosé  (Champagne),,,,
"Usually the bigger, more opulent of the Kumeu River Chardonnays, the 2015 version of the Coddington is medium to full in weight, but strikingly focused and vibrant. Bacony smoke notes frame white peach flavors, finishing long.",93,Kumeu River 2015 Coddington Chardonnay (Kumeu),,,,
"Beautifully perfumed, this is now maturing. It has an elegance, lightness of touch and a wonderful almond and spice character. The fruit is softened and rounded, with the acidity lending a vivid aftertaste.",91,Arndorfer 2008 Die Leidenschaft Riesling (Niederösterreich),,,,
"A wine that is lean and angular, austere, the fruit dominated by very dry tannins. It misses weight with the licorice, meaty flavors and a hard-edged structure.",84,Château Ramafort 2007  Médoc,,,,
"Tightly structured, this is a dense wine. Packed with dry tannins, it is starting life as a firm wine. It is equally rich in fruit, a panoply of black plums and red currants. Drink this concentrated wine from 2026.",93,Château Latour-Martillac 2014  Pessac-Léognan,,,,
"This is green from front to back. Starting with the nose, this smells like bell pepper and green beans. A raw, scratchy palate confirms where this is headed, and that's toward an underripe palate with a finish that tastes like fresh-picked green beans.",81,Domingo Hermanos 2014 Hermanos Cabernet Sauvignon (Salta),,,,
"A touch of funkiness hovers over fresh pear notes. The palate then offers fresh-faced, tart and ripe pear notes, etched with citrus freshness for extra precision and purity. This is so inviting and disarming, it is a joy to savor. Despite the generously ripe fruit, a coolness runs through this, anchoring the flavors in freshness and drive. Simply delicious and so balanced, so you can enjoy it now, though it will cellar well through 2027.",94,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Roche Calcaire Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"Marked by extreme ripeness, this Pinot is a blast of red cherry pie filling, red licorice and cola flavors, with a smoky note of bacon fat. Delicious, but a bit soft and simple in texture.",87,CULT 2009 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This wine's new leather forest floor, menthol, pressed rose and exotic spice scents emerge in the glass. Full-bodied and focused, the palate delivers layers of cherry, pomegranate, crushed herb, licorice and cinnamon flavors. Bright acidity and youthful tannins provide balance and an ageworthy structure. Drink 2023–2038.",94,Curto Marco 2013 La Foia  (Barolo),,,,
"With apricot, orange, honey, butter cream and vanilla flavors, it's a simple wine at a fair price.",83,Seven Daughters 2012 Chardonnay (California),,,,
"Vanilla cream, banana, Golden Delicious apple and a rubbery note characterize the intense aromas of this Northern Italian wine that moves over the palate in a pleasing way thanks to its creamy smoothness.",89,Eugenio Collavini 2005 Dei Sassi Cavi Chardonnay (Collio),,,,
"Cabernet Sauvignon dominates in this 66% to 35% blend, with both varieties grown on the producer's Lookout Mountain estate. Full bodied, it features stewed plum, dark chocolate and mocha, with a base of cedar and clove. Extended tannins make it fleshy and full.",89,Ferrari-Carano 2014 PreVail West Face Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Crisp and clean with medium aromatic intensity and an easy finish, this Pinot Grigio would wash down with chicken or tuna salad. Citrus and stone fruit appear as zesty endnotes.",84,Forchir 2010 Villa del Borgo Pinot Grigio (Friuli Grave),,,,
"A traditional style of Rioja with earthy, peppery, dry aromas in front of a healthy, lively palate. Tastes like vanilla and buttery oak on top of zesty but restrained raspberry and red plum. Shows spice, character and a wholeness that makes it a winner. Drink now through 2015.",91,Marqués de Elciego 2005 Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"Minerally red-berry aromas suggest vitamins and latex. Like most RDD jovens, this is raw and rubbery in feel, with high-intensity plum and berry flavors. A loud, acidic finish is fresh as can be but entirely simple in terms of complexity.",86,Torrederos 2013 Joven  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"A clear, ripe pear note rings through this medium-bodied Chardonnay from the aroma to the palate to the finish. Even the texture is a bit thick like pear juice, though there is some subtlety in the light vanilla and pastry cream accents.",86,Hoopes 2012 Hoopla Unoaked Chardonnay (Napa Valley),,,,
"Classic open, generously juicy St. Laurent. The flavors just burst into the mouth: red cherries touched by wood, sweet fruit zest and ripe stone fruits. The wine is underpinned by a layer of very dry tannin, and topped by beautifully fresh acidity.",89,Judith Beck 2006 Schafleiten St. Laurent (Burgenland),,,,
"There are tiny hints of sweetness on the nose of this Pinot Grigio that recall peach, honeysuckle and exotic fruit. The wine is lean and streamlined in the mouth and ends with a crisp blast of citric acidity.",85,Villa Rubini 2008 Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie),,,,
"This blend of 58% Petite Sirah and 42% Zinfandel provides a good example of a winery going over the top and succeeding. Aromas recall blackberry-laced tea, dried rose petals and Luxardo cherries. Cassis provides the centerpoint of the flavor profile, with a backbone of ample tannins and touch of tar.",93,Derby 2011 The Maneater Derby Vineyard Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"Lightly lemony, slightly waxy in the nose, with interesting details of green berries, yellow fruits and citrus oils, this wine sneaks up on you. It's lively and clean, with flavors much like a crisp, stainless steel-fermented Chardonnay.",87,Torii Mor 2008 Pinot Blanc (Rogue Valley),,,,
"In acknowledgement of the superior quality of 2002, Moët has released this wine well after the 2003. The decision is fully justified, for this is still young. It is impressive, intensely concentrated, mineral, showing tight grapefruit and apple flavors. Excellent aging potential.",94,Moët & Chandon 2002 Grand Vintage Brut  (Champagne),,,,
The nose of Concord grapes is immediately appealing and leads to notes of overripe raspberries. Substantial residual sugar in combination with medium acidity render this a good for pool-side sipping or with paté.,86,Willm 2007 Réserve Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"Soft, smooth and ripe, this wine has a sure-fire crowd-pleasing style. It's bursting with flavors of banana, papaya and pear, with just enough acidity to keep it from turning flabby. Put a little chill on it and drink soon.",90,Goose Ridge 2011 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"The Courselle sisters, Marie and Sylvie, continue to boost their white style with the lovely blend of 50% Sémillon, 35% Sauvignon Blanc and 15% Sauvignon Gris. The wine is still developing, although it is already giving hints of its spice and ripe apple future. It is a full-bodied wine, only lightly textured. As it develops, it will add to its rich character.",86,Château Thieuley 2015  Bordeaux Blanc,,,,
"Light in color, this is a tight, cherry fruited wine with fruit that seems underripe. It's almost rosé in feel with just a leather and tannin underlay to give it structure. Drink now.",84,Pierre and Charles Sparr 2011 Cuvée Tradition Pinot Noir (Alsace),,,,
"The nose of this dry Riesling is demure with delicate scents of lime and lemon, but the palate is succulent and ripe with juicy pink grapefruits, cherries and nectarines. It's lush with fruit yet squarely balanced with brisk acidity and a zesty mineral finish.",89,August Kesseler 2012 Junge Reben Trocken Riesling (Rheingau),,,,
"A beautifully dense wine, concentrated and ripe. With its opulent style, packed with sweetness, this is dominated by its smooth, velvet texture, the botrytis packed behind. An impressive wine that is good to drink now, but should age well.",92,Château de Malle 2006  Sauternes,,,,
"A wine that is very mineral, very structured in its tannins, the black fruits flavors a straight line cut through with acidity.",93,Camille Giroud 2008 Latricières Chambertin  (Latricières-Chambertin),,,,
"Fresh, ripe and fruity, this is a rich wine, produced from vines to the west of Reims. It has perfumed wild strawberry flavors and acidity. Attractively crisp at the end, it's a ready-to-drink wine that will be just right as an apéritif.",88,Lelarge-Pugeot NV Premier Cru Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Champagne),,,,
"A bright, saturated rosé with a pink raspberry color and bright berry aromas, this Cerasuolo from central Italy will pair with shellfish or white meat. The wine finishes with a crisp, easy close.",86,Valle Reale 2009 Vigneto Vigne Nuove  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo Cerasuolo),,,,
"A smooth, wood-aged wine that has a rich texture, layers of toast and nutmeg from the wood and peach fruits. The wood needs time to integrate, but already shows that this is going to be a rich wine.",88,Château Bertinerie 2009 Cru Réserve  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),,,,
"There's no doubting this is a rich wine. It's flamboyant in jammy cherry, boysenberry and cola flavors, while oak adds pronounced char and vanilla. It's the most expensive wine ever released by the winery, but tasty as it is, it's sweet and simple. Tasted four times.",86,De Loach 2005 Sonoma Stage Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"A little minty, raisiny and flat on the nose, but still it's appealing. The palate has a condensed, syrupy feel and soft, semisweet flavors of red berry mixed with herbs and pepper. Spicy and a touch hollow on the finish, but still a good value Cab to drink now.",85,Quasar 2007 Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),,,,
"Aromas of exotic spice, plum, violet and a whiff of chopped herb lead the nose. The firm palate delivers tart red cherry, espresso, anise, vanilla and coconut alongside brisk acidity and grainy tannins.",88,Broccardo 2013  Barbera d'Alba,,,,
"Aromas of black currant and a whiff of bell pepper slowly emerge on this hearty blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc. Concentrated and robust, the palate offers cassis, black cherry, licorice and the heat of evident alcohol alongside big velvety tannins.",90,Poggio al Tesoro 2013 Sondraia  (Bolgheri Superiore),,,,
"This high-end offering is a blend of New Zealand's own Abel clone with Dijon clone 777. Mocha, toast and charred wood notes fame pristine black cherry and plum fruit in this medium- to full-bodied wine. A dusty, lingering finish wraps things up nicely, suggesting up to 10 years of aging potential.",91,Marisco Vineyards 2013 Craft Series The Journey Pinot Noir (Marlborough),,,,
"Made of 61% Syrah and 39% Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine has a nose of blackberry, tart cranberry and rosemary. Flavors of black cherry preserves, strawberry, fennel bulb and nutmeg mingle on the tongue, with a nice balance of fruit and spice amid smooth tannins. The spicy finish is characterized by a burst of tart cherry and a hint of mint.",91,Ixsir 2010 Grande Reserve Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon (Lebanon),,,,
"This wine delivers aromas of molten-lava chocolate cake with black cherry syrup and a mint leaf on top. The palate shows bacon fat, blackberry extract, dark chocolate and freshly ground espresso, with a peppery roast-beef crust on the finish. It's a touch hot, but the wondrous flavors are worth it.",93,Ancient Peaks 2011 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),,,,
"White flowers and wild anise give this a crisp, tangy quality, the fruit balanced and refined, showing up as Asian pear and Meyer lemon. The voluptuous finish adds depth without overbearing power.",90,Les Voleurs 2013 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Seven Soils comes from six vineyards, spent 14 months in 28% new oak, and still seems a bit of a puzzle. It's a rather pale, modestly ripened wine, from a vintage that produced more than its share of blockbusters. It's perfectly fine, just not particularly memorable.",87,Rex Hill 2012 Seven Soils Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Aromas of blueberry, cherry and anise yield on the palate to flavors of cherry, blackberry, eucalyptus and black pepper. Smooth tannins appear early on and endure into a pleasing finish that is interspersed with bright and spicy notes.",90,Bazelet HaGolan 2011 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Galilee),,,,
"Very slight reduction on the nose shows that these wines—despite their beguiling youthful aromas—are built to last. This has the generous ripeness of plump stone fruit and the edgy freshness of tart, fragrant citrus zest. The palate is precise, streamlined and clean; the finish tells of purity and lasting power. Enjoy now through 2035.",94,Brandl 2015 Heiligenstein Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),,,,
"A fine Chard, richly oaked and ripely forward in tropical fruit, pear and green apple flavors wrapped into a spicy, buttercreamy mouthfeel. Really nails the California style.",88,Roche 2006 Chardonnay (Carneros),,,,
"While lush and ripe on the nose, with aromas of stone fruit and citrus, this dry Riesling is remarkably lean and steely on the palate. The lemon-lime acidity is searing, but highlights an intense minerality that lingers through the finish.",90,Geh. Rat Dr. von Bassermann-Jordan 2011 Deidesheimer Hohenmorgen Trocken Erste Lage Riesling (Pfalz),,,,
"This wine's subdued baking spice, clove and mature black-skinned fruit aromas follow through to the lively, simple palate. Round tannins provide easygoing support. Drink soon.",86,Cascina Radice 2015 S. Martino  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore),,,,
"Morandé likes to dabble in Malbec, and we haven't been big fans in the past. This wine is much better; it is still a bit saucy on the nose, and there's a touch of that herbal essence that gets into so many Chilean reds. But overall it has fast-hitting black fruit, soy, spice and mocha notes that serve it well.",87,Morandé 2004 Edición Limitada Malbec (Maipo Valley),,,,
"Shows lean red berry and herb aromas. Mild tea and currant flavors play on the tongue, but the desired weight and texture of Shiraz aren't there. Finishes short, with a tea note.",82,Carmel 1998 Vineyards Selected Shiraz (Shomron),,,,
"Petit Manseng, just beginning to get its rightful recognition, produces superb sweet wines that avoid any sense of cloying, instead offering honey flavors in a fresh, fragrant context. Here it performs superbly with lively acidity and a bright, if sweet, aftertaste.",92,Château de Rousse 2010 Cuvée Prestige  (Jurançon),,,,
"Noceto is a Sierra Foothills' Sangiovese specialist but does a nice job with Barbera as well, this wine being well-integrated, not heavy-handed (13.8%) with a deft balance between acidity and fruit, mostly sweet cherry and blueberry. Very good.",89,Noceto 2008 Linsteadt Barbera (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),,,,
"Blackberry aromas with tobacco accents turn slightly barnyardy. Brisk acidity supports the solid, spicy red and black berry fruit here, but the palate feel is rather thin. It's fairly full-scaled, but not particularly graceful, and finishes dry and burnt-toasty, with a briar and tobacco note.",84,Lake Sonoma 1998 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
An underripe streak of wintergreen mint accompanies lemon and lime flavors in this crisp wine. It would be a good companion to Chinese and Vietnamese food.,84,Hess Collection 2012 Small Block Series Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"There's no questioning how rich and delicious this Cabernet is. It's dazzling in ripe blackberry jam and cocoa flavors, with riper, more concentrated black currants, as well as plenty of toasty new oak. In the dark fruits and superb tannins, as well as the overall balance, the wine defines Oakville Cabernet. Ready to drink now and over the next 6–8 years.",91,Rockroom Winemaking Cooperative 2008 TKO Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),,,,
"Vigneti di Foscarino is a beautiful Soave Classico with a rich and round personality followed by sophisticated aromas of stone fruit, melon and dried sage. There's a playful touch of piquant spice and freshness on the close.",91,Inama 2009 Vigneti di Foscarino  (Soave Classico),,,,
"Blended from grapes from a range of different soils, this open, generous wine has richness and a structure that comes from the ripe apple and gooseberry fruits. The wine is textured and deserves to age. Drink from 2017.",90,Jean Pabiot et Fils 2014 Domaine des Fines Caillottes  (Pouilly-Fumé),,,,
"Rusty in color and overdone on the nose, this Pinot smells charred and burnt out. Rough and abrasive in feel, with weedy herbal berry flavors, this tastes roasted and savory on the finish while leaving a lot to be desired.",82,Pisano 2014 Río de los Pájaros Reserve Pinot Noir (Progreso),,,,
"Rich, full-bodied wine with a serious nature. It impresses with its ripe red fruit, the layer of caramel well integrated with acidity. The feel is soft, but certainly dry, giving an impressive structured aftertaste.",91,Château Sainte Marguerite 2009 Grande Réserve Cru Classé Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"The grapes come from the cooler Oak Knoll area of Napa Valley, yet this wine is very soft and melted, without much acidity to provoke and enliven the ripe cherry, vanilla and sassafras flavors. It does show Pinot's silkiness, and is easy to drink.",84,Beringer 2006 Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),,,,
"Ripe black-fruit aromas are cuddly and reflect the warm conditions of 2012. Tight and ribbed on the palate, this has the structure to handle blackberry, chocolate and peppery spice flavors without seeming overripe or jammy. A saturated finish benefits from the right amount of acidity. Drink through 2023.",93,Godelia 2012 Selección Mencía (Bierzo),,,,
"Leathery on the palate with sizably structured tannins, this estate-grown wine is robust in black cherry and blackberry, sprinkled subtly in black pepper, tar and coffee. Grown on the producer's BCD Vineyard off Olivet Lane, where it also grows Pinot Noir, it finishes softly, and spicy, with length.",90,Balletto 2012 Syrah (Russian River Valley),,,,
"The cold 2011 vintage has taken its toll on this wine. It's bone dry, crisp in acidity and not quite ripe, with its citrus and tropical fruit flavors compromised by a touch of green bean.",84,Groth 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"Made with Pinot Nero, this delivers a fragrance of rose, violet and woodland berry. The bright palate offers red cherry, strawberry, white pepper and a note of bread dough. A soft perlage lends elegance.",88,Borgo Maragliano 2009 Giovanni Galliano Brut Rosé Pinot Nero (Vino Spumante),,,,
"Packed with mature fruit, this is a ripe wine from one of the top premier cru vineyards in Puligny-Montrachet. It has a delicious, full and creamy texture that's cut with lemony acidity. Toast from oak aging is still present and will soften as the wine ages further. With its mineral aftertaste, it will need time. Drink from 2021.",93,Maison Champy 2015 Les Folatières Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),,,,
"This bottling from the Scheid family, one of the region's largest growers, shows aromas of baked red cherry in a vanilla pie crust as well as marjoram, bay leaf and cinnamon. The palate balances tart and ripe cranberry and pomegranate with both dried and fresh herbs.",91,Metz Road 2015 Riverview Vineyard Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Monterey),,,,
"This wine is tight and closed at this stage, although it has great potential. The fruit is lively and crisp, just waiting to burst out with citrus and sliced apple fruitiness. Wait until late 2017.",88,Château de Lussac 2016  Bordeaux Blanc,,,,
"Meat, compost and leather notes mark the entry of this Syrah blended with smaller amounts of Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah. Light black pepper and red fruit flavors are sustained by a soft, round texture and lingering finish.",90,Crux 2013 Syrah (Russian River Valley),,,,
"An unusual edge of licorice clings to nose and palate of this fresh, zingy Riesling. The streamlined body is dry and pervaded by brisk, friendly lemon freshness.",89,Domaine Schoffit 2014 Lieu Dit Harth Tradition Riesling (Alsace),,,,

"Here's a Pinot Grigio that fulfills the variety's basic responsibilities of dryness, crispness and a clean mouthfeel. It's a drily brisk, racy wine, with suggestions of ripe pink grapefruit, lemongrass and honeysuckle.",87,Oak Grove 2007 Reserve Pinot Grigio (California),,,,
"This is sweet, soft and easy to drink, despite its scoury mouthfeel. It has fruity raspberry, strawberry and lime flavors.",86,Chandon NV Brut Classic Sparkling (California),,,,
"Cherry cough-drop aromas are friendly enough. This feels hollow, with quick-hitting plum and cherry flavors. A touch of chocolate dust defines a simple finish.",84,Bota Box 2013 Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Delicate tones of stone fruit, lime, talc power and honeydew melon mark the bouquet. It's crisp on the palate, with a touch of wild salvia on the finish.",86,Argiolas 2011 Costamolino  (Vermentino di Sardegna),,,,
"This is the companion wine to the equally-flirty Buxom Blonde White. Here the blend includes Cabernet, Merlot, Syrah and Sangiovese. It has substantial scents and flavors of fig and prune, earth and espresso. Done in a dark, soft, ready-to-drink style, it's fine for drinking with any barbequed meats.",85,Calendar Girl 2009 Bodacious Brunette Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Sweet pea blossoms, stone fruits and red raspberries perfume this lovely dry rosé made predominantly from Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. Sparkling acidity and an astringent tea-leaf note add structure to the ripe, supple red-fruit and berry flavors.",89,Paumanok 2011 Dry Rosé (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"Gritty, spicy, schisty berry aromas are composed, while this Garnacha-led blend feels saturated and layered. Spicy plum, herbal notes and black pepper make up the flavor profile, while this is strapping, peppery tasting and complex on the finish. Drink through 2022.",91,Mas d'en Gil 2010 Coma Vella Red (Priorat),,,,
Classic varietal aromas of pear flesh and skin open into just slightly underripe fruit flavors. The wine is balanced and adds tart apple to the pear fruit.,87,Siltstone 2014 Guadalupe Vineyard Pinot Gris (Oregon),,,,
"Honeysuckle scents and flavors of pear, papaya and cucumber lead into a fresh and delicate wine, with plenty of acid behind the crisp fruit.",86,Gypsy Dancer 2006 Christine Lorraine Vineyard Pinot Gris (Oregon),,,,
"Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and a drop of Petit Verdot, this opens with aromas of red currant, cedar, toasted notes and a whiff of exotic spice. Black pepper, espresso and grilled herb accent the core of fleshy black cherry and cassis. Tightly wound tannins provide the framework and leave an astringent finish, while an anise note marks the close.",89,Fattoria Montellori 2010 Salamartano Red (Toscana),,,,
"Soft and seamless on the palate, this wine offers berry, vanilla and a touch of cedar and leather. It balances fruit with more complex varietal characteristics. Full bodied, the finish is easygoing and lengthy in clove.",90,Provenance Vineyards 2012 Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),,,,
"Slightly soapy in the nose, this enters softly, then turns sharp and slightly bitter. Hints of melon and butter emerge, but the mouthfeel is somewhat disjointed and the flavors not yet fully integrated.",85,Torii Mor 2011 Pinot Blanc,,,,
"Concentrated aromas of pineapple, banana and papaya meld harmoniously with notes of new oak. The palate is more oaky and nutty than fruity. It's round and creamy in feel and offers a long and toasty finish.",87,The Williamsburg Winery 2015 Vintage Reserve Chardonnay (Virginia),,,,
"The nose of this succulent Rosso opens with red berry, candied cherry and blackberry tar. Its firm tannins give the wine a textured, almost gritty, mouthfeel.",87,Lazzeretti 2010  Rosso di Montalcino,,,,
"Punchy prickly citrus aromas are clearly that of Sauvignon Blanc. Light in color and weight, this tastes of tangy citrus with a shot of black and green pepper. Lime is the key flavor noted on a clean but mild finish.",85,Salentein 2016 Portillo Estate Bottled Sauvignon Blanc (Uco Valley),,,,
"There's a subtle difference between this Pinot and Loring's eight other vineyard-designated 2012 Pinots. But by a hair, this is the best and most compelling, delicious in blackberries, blueberries and cherries. It's hard not to drink the entire bottle now, with its tantalizing acidity and soft but intricate tannins. And yet this gorgeous wine will develop bottle complexity until 2020 or 2021. The vineyard is in the sweet spot of the Santa Rita Hills.",94,Loring Wine Company 2012 Clos Pepe Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Sharp, pungent grass scents and a bit of rough citrus form the nose. Once sipped, thin and brisk apple cider flavors get help from slight kiwi and fresh acidity. Serve with bay scallop salad.",86,Refugio Ranch 2011 Tiradora Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Light in color, this is a somewhat murky, reduced and bittersweet wine, earthy in fresh compost, mushroom and pine. Its fruit flavors tend toward rhubarb and cranberry, as the finish ends in black tea.",86,Ampelos 2013 Lambda Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"This is no simple red; deep black fruit and leather aromas suggest an intense, young untamed wine. It's rugged and muscular, with an opaque color, tight tannins that starch the cheeks, and a powerful, multilayered finish. Baby Brunello? Hardly. This is a full-grown wine all its own, and it still needs several more years to open up.",90,Salicutti 1999  Rosso di Montalcino,,,,
"Waxy citrus skins and pressed apple notes are accented by a whiff of pine in this racy light-footed Riesling. It's just a shade off dry, with an invigoratingly brisk texture. Drink now through 2019.",87,240 Days 2015 Riesling (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This is a dry wine, with hints of yeast as well as spice and nutmeg flavors. The fruit is well integrated into this mix of flavors, giving a ripe wine that is ready to drink.",87,Château Penin 2016 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),,,,
"This wine is soft and velvety, awash in classic notes of black currant and berry, textured in full-bodied, oaky waves of toast and cigar box. Approachable on the palate, it winds its way powerfully though softly from start to lengthy finish.",91,Turnbull 2012 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),,,,
"A blend of 90% Sangiovese, 8% Canaiolo and 2% Colorino, this has earthy aromas of truffle, sunbaked soil, leather and a balsamic note. Round and savory, the smooth, polished palate tastes of raspberry jam, ripe black cherry, licorice and a hint of pipe tobacco. Velvety enveloping tannins provide the framework while a dried herb note accents the finish. Enjoy through 2022.",91,Capitoni 2010 Red (Orcia),,,,
"One look, one whiff, one taste and you're swooning. This mature, tawny, ready-to-drink gran reserva with aromas of lemon peel, cedar and dried cherry is the epitome of elegance. A juicy, supple palate is highly approachable, while flavors of vanilla, orange peel, saffron and dried plum don't waver on the finish. Drink through 2027.",96,La Rioja Alta 2005 Gran Reserva 904  (Rioja),,,,
"Lucky Failla gets to source grapes from this vineyard that most winemakers would trade their left arm for. It's lush, ripe and amazingly generous in raspberries and cherries, yet retains an elegant balance, as well as fine, mouthwatering acidity. Part of the attraction is low alcohol, which lets the stones and earthy complexities of the wine shine through. This is really a brilliant wine—light, delicate and powerful. If you want to age it for eight years or so, you won't be sorry.",95,Failla 2011 Keefer Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"You'll find plenty of tart green gooseberries in this dry Sauvignon Blanc. Yet there are also ripe grapefruit, kiwi and papaya flavors. It's a refreshingly clean wine for drinking now.",87,Voss 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"Rich, soft and chocolaty, this Merlot has fruity flavors of cherries, blackberries, mulberries and blackstrap molasses. It's dry, and at its best now.",86,Emmolo 2006 Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"The Novak family continue to produce an understated style of gorgeous Cabernet year in and year out. This vintage provides a fine example, a blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon with 10% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot, all from the historic, 40-acre estate. Complex and smooth, it offers an exotic array of cigar, tar, black pepper and currant, the tannins soft and integrated, yet strong. Coffee and chocolate make appearances on the finish, ever so slightly, never at risk of dimming its freshness. Drink now through 2022.",95,Spottswoode 2012 Family Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),,,,
"This wine is mature, ripe and perfectly ready to drink. With hints of toast mingling with minerality and tangy acidity, it is a balanced, delicious wine full of rich flavors. The acidity has softened while keeping the tension of pure Chardonnay from the Côte des Blancs. Drink now. Gonet uses this label for the American market.",93,Charles-Gilbert de Vindé 2005 Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),,,,
"Full bodied but elegant, this opens with aromas of crushed tomato vine, exotic fruit and a whiff of bell pepper. The ripe, round palate doles out creamy white peach, juicy nectarine, pink grapefruit, celery and mineral alongside soft but refreshing acidity.",92,Vie di Romans 2012 Piere Sauvignon (Friuli Isonzo),,,,
"The second wine of Château Ausone is an impressive younger brother. It has the same density and suavity, but the fruits are fresher, lighter. Those fruits go right through the firm tannins, leaving spice and delicious, juicy flavors. It is a complete wine, showing all the exuberant freshness of 2006.",92,Chapelle d'Ausone 2006  Saint-Émilion,,,,
"This is one of the most delicious rosé Champagnes around, a gorgeous vibrant red currant- and pink grapefruit-dominated wine. It's ripe, but so well balanced, its acidity merging into a fine creaminess. It is a wine that is lively, vivid, but remaining dry.",91,Delamotte NV Rosé Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"Pungently earthy in forest and truffle, this is a soft, medium-built wine with a density beneath it, the palate explosively juicy in blackberry and currant. Balanced despite a significant concentration of savory fruit, it'll pair well at the table with seared and grilled meats.",93,12C Wines 2013 Beckstoffer Vineyard Georges III Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),,,,
"This wine is surprisingly brooding for the variety, with notes of jasmine, flowers and apricot struggling to get to the surface. The floral flavors are dry and light weight, providing intrigue.",87,Pomum 2014 Oasis Farms Riesling (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Ocone's organic Greco offers a sweet-smelling, floral nose with aromas of honeysuckle, jasmine and citrus blossom. You can taste some of its natural mineral nuances behind its pulpy peach tones.",86,Ocone 2007 Greco (Taburno),,,,
"Principally Cabernet Sauvignon, this also holds with Merlot, Malbec and Syrah. The coolness of the vintage shows through with aromas of dried and fresh savory herbs along with coffee, licorice and dark fruit. The palate is equal parts elegant and flavorful, with supple fruit notes that glide.",91,Kontos 2011 Alatus Blend Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"88-90 Barrel sample. Lots of spiced wood, with sweet blackberry fruits. The wine is initially soft, but the tannins do kick in. The fruit finally has great freshness",89,Château Beaumont 2009 Barrel sample  (Haut-Médoc),,,,
"Spicy purple fruits come up quickly, followed by flavors of leaf, earth and stem. Tannins are tight and slightly coarse, and it ends suddenly.",85,Reustle 2013 Winemaker's Reserve Syrah (Umpqua Valley),,,,
"Drawing a blend of Merlot, Tannat and Syrah from several regions in southwest France, this soft and fruity wine is light with a juicy mix of acidity and dry tannins. Berry fruits and a fresh aftertaste suggest it is ready to drink now.",87,Lionel Osmin & Cie 2013 Villa de Cocagne Red (Vin de France),,,,
"Stalky, leathery aromas lack freshness and purity of fruit. This feels light to the point of dilute, while flavors of stalky raspberry finish salty and earthy, with a raw feel.",83,Conde de Jauregui 2006 Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"Seems a little of the soft, sweet side, an easy wine to appreciate for its cherry, raspberry and cola flavors.",85,Black Kite 2006 Kite's Rest Vineyard Redwoods' Edge Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),,,,
"With a clarity of fruit and minerality, this wine is brightly floral and noticeably stony, with highlights of melon, lemon and green apple.",90,Iron Horse 2014 Unoaked Chardonnay (Green Valley),,,,
"Lifted by 8% Carménère and Viognier, it's straight down the fairway with notes of blueberry, orange peel, pepper and brambly fruit. Lighter in style, it tapers toward the finish.",86,Waterbrook 2011 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Almost entirely Cabernet Sauvignon (98%), this structured and dense wine is packed with concentrated dark fruits that are firm, showing intense acidity and freshness under the dark tannins. It's classic Bordeaux, with fruit and tannins in equal measure and needing time. Drink from 2024.",94,Château Lafite Rothschild 2013  Pauillac,,,,
"Crafted from a mix of 48% Syrah, 45% Grenache and 7% Mourvèdre, this aromatic rosé is spicy and bursting with star fruit, citrus, apple, pear, apricot and more. It's a lively full-bodied wine with a smooth finish.",89,Quady North 2016 Rosé (Rogue Valley),,,,
"Don't drink this Chardonnay too cold, as it needs a little while in the glass to show its stuff. Right off the bat, it's austere, but when it airs, the tropical fruit, orange and oak complexities come out. The parts have not yet come together, though, so give it 3–4 years to develop.",90,Patz & Hall 2010 Hyde Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros),,,,
"Principally Tempranillo, this blended red shows light berry fruit and stiff, earthy tannins. Aged 17 months in 17% new French oak, it doesn't quite come into balance, and finishes with chalky acids.",85,Ledger David 2013 Dark Night Red (Rogue Valley),,,,
"A smoky nose carries a strong suggestion of bacon fat, wrapped around tightly wound blackberry fruit. Flavors play out broadly and thin out quickly, but this young wine offers solid value and immediate pleasure.",87,Jezebel 2013 Pinot Noir (Oregon),,,,
"Produced from Pinot Noir, this is a particularly crisp example of a Sancerre rosé. It has red-currant fruitiness along with an edge of tannins. The finish is smoothed with caramel. Drink now.",86,Michel Vattan 2016 Rosé (Sancerre),,,,
"Dense black cherry and stewed plum aromas introduce this round, jammy and ultraripe Syrah. In the mouth, the wine is rich and chunky, with brandied cherry and baked berry and plum flavors topped with sprinkles of nutmeg and cumin. Nothing evaporates on the ripe finish. Drink through 2018.",90,Clos Berenguer del Molar 2008 Selecció Syrah (Priorat),,,,
"Young and still intensely oaked, this wine holds undeniable promise in its fleshy, viscous and smooth layers of stone fruit and guava—an untrammeled expression of the Napa Valley's ability for generosity and structure. The finish is bittersweet in Meyer lemon.",90,Black Stallion 2013 Limited Release Chardonnay (Napa Valley),,,,
"Juicy and austere in understated waves of cranberry and cherry fruit, this wine delivers subtle power and intensity in a leathery-textured package. True to its old vine heritage, it shows a dry dustiness of peppery spice.",90,Del Carlo Winery 2014 Home Ranch Teldeschi Vineyards Century Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"An unfortunate green, vegetal streak cuts through the heart of this Pinot Noir. It blurs the cherry fruit and detracts from the fine silky texture.",82,Tondré 2009 Tondre Grapefield Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"A troubled Pinot Noir. The mouthfeel is all wrong, lacking Pinot's sensuality, but marked by harshness. And the raspberry and cherry flavors have a green, minty edge. Not likely to age, so if you drink it now, give it a good long decant.",85,Alysian 2008 Floodgate Vineyard West Block Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Tight and concentrated, this is a very fine wine. Great acidity and great tannins go with the most intense fruit. Blackberry and black-cherry flavors power through this structured wine. There is also elegance and a fine sense of style. Drink from 2025.",94,Les Astéries 2014  Saint-Émilion,,,,
"Full bodied, muscular and intense, this brooding Shiraz is built for the cellar. Smoke and blackberries are crunchy with acid and primary fruit, finishing crisp. Drink 2018–2025.",90,Wirra Wirra 2013 RSW Shiraz (McLaren Vale),,,,
"While there are wood aromas and wood flavors, the wine is equally about ripe fruit and generous tannins. It has spice, red-berry fruits and a rounded structure. It will age well, giving a rich wine from 2022.",92,Henri de Villamont 2015 Clos des Guettes Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),,,,
"Barrel fermented in neutral French oak, this mouth-watering Pinot Blanc uses fruit from the Meredith Mitchell and Freedom Hill vineyards. It rested on the lees until bottling, yielding a rich, even creamy wine, with a gentle spiciness and plenty of acidity. A hint of beeswax and the lightest suggestion of toast bring more interest to the finish.",91,Ken Wright 2011 Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley),,,,
"If anyone can make converts to Lemberger, Washington's one-time answer to Zinfandel, it's talented winemaker Don Townshend. This bright, tangy, raspberry-laden wine comes across as a stable-mate to Grenache or a light Dry Creek Zin, but it really occupies a niche all its own. Barrel-aged and ripened to a moderate 13.5% alcohol, it screams out for pizza.",87,Townshend 2005 Lemberger (Yakima Valley),,,,
"A tart, tight and tannic Merlot, that shows simple flavors of young red fruits. It is still quite hard and compact, and seems likely to remain so.",85,Wooldridge Creek 1999 Merlot (Applegate Valley),,,,
"This is a terrific American debut for this winery, which blends Syrah from the Gimblett Gravels and Te Awanga subregions. It's full-bodied and richly textured, with bold blueberry and raspberry fruit combining seamlessly with savory notes of black olive and marinated beef. Drink now–2025.",92,Elephant Hill 2014 Syrah (Hawke's Bay),,,,
"Concentrated but fresh aromas of black cherries and blueberries mesh with hot black gravel and nose-tickling lilacs on this wine by the Fess Parker family. Dark chocolate, peppery spice, black cherry syrup and mocha flavors shine on the robust, rich and delicious palate.",92,Epiphany 2012 Rodney's Vineyard Petite Sirah (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Made from superripe grapes from old vines that have aged on lees, this is a rich, concentrated wine. Full-bodied yellow fruit and ripe pear flavors are sustained by the tight, steely mineral texture and the tangy aftertaste. This dense wine deserves to age until 2018.",91,Isabelle et Pierre Clément 2014 La Dame de Châtenoy  (Menetou-Salon),,,,
"This seems sweet like a Port. It tastes like raspberry and cherry jam, with lots of heat from the alcohol.",84,Minassian-Young 2010 1000 Vines Zinfandel (Paso Robles),,,,
"Made from 100% Nero d'Avola, this offers ripe red berry and Mediterranean herb aromas. It's straightforward, with red cherry, raspberry and baking spice flavors, framed by smooth tannins. Drink soon.",87,Feudo Solaria 2014 Foglio Cinquanta Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),,,,
"This winery's best bottlings are its red blends, and this is certainly one of them. Made from a unique combination of Syrah, Malbec and Petit Verdot, it's bone dry, deeply tannic and sweet in blackberries, plums, herbs, tobacco, bacon and sandalwood. The tannins suggest drinking with rich meats and cheeses.",90,Ancient Peaks 2009 Renegade Margarita Vineyard Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"This wine is a success for the vintage with its ripe Cabernet flavors and dark, dense tannins. It is fruity certainly, with a juicy, perfumed background. However, the structure and texture show best—firm and dry, indicating a good potential. This concentrated wine will not be ready to drink before 2024.",94,Château Figeac 2013  Saint-Émilion,,,,
"Coffee bean, leather and tobacco tones are surrounded by delicate aromas of wild berry, violet and spice. The tannins are tight and bone dry, making for a good pairing with cheese fondue.",87,Deltetto 2006 Braja Riserva  (Roero),,,,
"This blend of 60% Syrah, 20% Carignan and 20% Grenache opens with pleasant but soft scents of herbed cherry, plum and violet. The palate is light and easy, with soft tannins and juicy red-fruit flavors that finish clean and bright. Drink now.",86,L'Ostal Cazes 2012 Estibals Red (Minervois),,,,
"From leading Vino Nobile di Montepulciano producer Poliziano, this opens with aromas of black currant, bell pepper and tobacco. On the palate, juicy black cherry makes up the core while notes of licorice and ground pepper offer backup. It's smooth and easy drinking, with plush tannins.",89,Poliziano 2011 In Violas Merlot (Cortona),,,,
"With only 75 cases made, this is 100% Pommard clone Pinot in all its glory. Opening with a great red cherry nose, the wine is bright with a luscious texture, noticeable balance of acidity and depth and a long finish. A Mendo Pinot not from Anderson Valley that does the county proud. Made from biodynamic grapes.",91,Jeriko 2010 Pommard Clone Pinot Noir (Mendocino),,,,
"Rounded and mellow, with a backbone of lemony acid, this wine convinces on the palate rather than the nose: there's texture, fresh acidity and mouthfilling length.",89,Bernhard Ott 2012 Rosenberg Grüner Veltliner (Wagram-Donauland),,,,
"Deep, pure cassis and red berry aromas are integrated and thorough. This Bordeaux-style blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Merlot is racy, tight and hard-driving, with bold berry, pepper, baking spice and chocolate flavors. A toasty, peppery finish is juicy, forward and long. Drink through 2020.",92,Caliterra 2012 Edición Limitada B Red (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"Exotic richness defines this lovely young wine. It displays the tannin-acid balance you expect from Anderson Valley Pinot Noir, plus the exceptional intensity of fruit characteristic of the vintage. Floods the mouth with concentrated cherries, raspberries, red currants and cola that, influenced by smoky oak, turn to white chocolate on the finish. But it's totally dry.",94,Dogwood 2007 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),,,,
"A little sharp and raw in mouthfeel, but silky, elegant and dry. Shows cherry pie filling, orange tea, mocha, cola and mint flavors. Ready now.",87,W.H. Smith 2007 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Dry, scratchy plum and raspberry aromas come before an energetic palate. Loud berry and plum flavors run quick and bright, finishing with candy-like cherry flavors and wham-bam acidity.",86,Santa Rita 2014 120 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),,,,
"This wine is rich, full of fruit and with a medium-term potential. Attractive berry flavors are ripe and full of juicy acidity. Drink this lively, fruity wine from 2018.",88,Quinta do Filoco 2014 Filoco Tinto Red (Douro),,,,
"Big, rich and ripe, this is packed with intense black fruits and dark tannins, with the solid structure yielding a dense core. Its fruit is balanced by acidity, giving the wine ­essential lift. Age for 4–5 years.",91,Ataide da Costa Martins Seredo 2009 Ataide Seredo Reserva Red (Bairrada),,,,
"Working with both Klipsun and Ciel du Cheval, winemaker Casey McClellan extracts the essence of both these great vineyards in his Red Mountain cuvées. Here is the raw power of 100% Klipsun Cabernet Sauvignon, full-throttle black fruits and mineral-soaked, chewy, dark tannins. It's all done in a wine with both length and precision; one that will surely age well over at least a decade.",93,Seven Hills 2010 Klipsun Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),,,,
"This blends 70% whole cluster-pressed juice with 30% saignée, vinified entirely in stainless steel. Fresh flower, cherry, strawberry and tangerine flavors wash brilliantly over the palate, lifted by acidity and just enough weight to feel lush.",91,Bouchaine 2016 Vin Gris of Pinot Noir (Carneros),,,,
"An open-book Cabernet medium in tannin structure and expressive in plum, blackberry and tobacco. Juicy with a rustic edge.",85,Loken Cellars 2010 Penn Valley Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Sierra Foothills),,,,
"A great value choice, I Versi Bianco (made with Grecanico, Inzolia and Grillo) is a crisp wine, with easy aromas of lemon zest, cut grass, almond skin and crushed brimstone. Pair it with Southwestern grilled chicken salad.",85,Fondo Antico 2010 I Versi Bianco White (Sicilia),,,,
"This still needs a little time to come into its own but all the principal features are present. A concentrated palate provides texture framed by fresh acidity, linear length and fleshy fruit, hinting at ripe pears and yellow plums.",90,Weszeli 2013 Steinhaus Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),,,,
"This represents a softer, more subtle side of the variety, holding back on overripeness in favor of simple leather, compost and black pepper. Touches of unearthed truffle offer the wine's one note of richness.",88,Balletto 2013 Estate Grown Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Edgy from the start, this blend of Cabernet, Malbec and Petit Verdot smells of asphalt and burnt toast. Pinching in feel, with hard tannins, this tastes roasted, leafy and like carob. Overall the flavors struggle to avoid earthy and rustic.",85,Kaiken 2014 Terroir Series Cabernet Sauvignon Malbec Petite Verdot Red (Mendoza),,,,
"This creamy, oaky Malbec opens with aromas of rubber and raw oak, although with airing black plum, blackberry and chocolate scents rise up. Full, creamy and jammy in feel, this tastes of black plum, blackberry, chocolate and vanilla. A heady, oaky, sticky finish wraps it up.",88,Don Miguel Gascón 2012 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Herbal aromas come with bell pepper and berry fruit notes, while the palate is solid in terms of feel but shows classic Navarran flavors of jalapeño and green pepper. Good texture and mouthfeel, but probably too green for a lot of people. Tempranillo with Merlot and Cabernet is the blend.",85,Otazu 2004 Dimension Crianza Red (Navarra),,,,
"Crisp, clean and nice on the nose, with a hint of white pepper. The palate is round and not overly acidic, making it friendly and endowed with mass appeal. Flavors of green melon and citrus are smooth and not too demanding, while the finish is easy and clean. A welcome entry into the land of Rueda and its Verdejo.",88,Emina 2009 Verdejo (Rueda),,,,
"Cool, grapy black-fruit aromas are front and center on the nose. This feels dense and a touch hard and tannic. Bumpy, chewy blackberry and dark plum flavors are lusty and come with a hint of sawdust and oak prior to a tannic finish that's hard, powerful and can still use some time. Drink through 2020.",90,Cadus 2011 Single Vineyard Finca Las Tortugas Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),,,,
"Aromas suggesting baked plum, menthol, aromatic herb and dark cooking spice lead the nose. The taut, lively palate offers black cherry, espresso and star anise alongside firm, fine-grained tannins and nervous acidity. It's still a bit austere and needs a few more years to unwind. Drink 2018–2025.",90,Castello Vicchiomaggio 2013 Agostino Petri  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"Dark but reduced aromas of tire and blackberry set up a muscular palate with pinching tannins. Roasted, oaky flavors of spicy berry, clove and cocoa finish with a final woody note and choppy toughness.",88,Trapiche 2014 Broquel Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Crisp, steely and fresh, this pure Chardonnay wine has a touch of minerality, signs of attractive bottle aging and a soft aftertaste. Balanced and fruity, it's ready to drink now.",89,Nominé-Renard NV Brut Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (Champagne),,,,
"Initial aromas of stalky, saucy plum and berry fruits become more acceptably rustic with airing. The palate is wiry and scratchy but full in size. Short berry flavors are leathery and horsey, with a pinch of mustard character. The finish is similar, with a molasses note and heat.",85,Las Rocas de San Alejandro 2011 Garnacha (Catalunya),,,,
"Dark mauve in color, nearly approaching a red-wine tone, this shows a fruit-forward nose of red cherries and strawberry jam. The palate is a mix of tart, sour and grippy texture, with cherry fruit and plum-skin flavors.",86,Manzoni 2014 Pedregal Vineyard Rose of Pinot Noir (San Benito County),,,,
"Seemingly one dimensional, this wine is tight and packed with acidity. It has a fine texture marked with lemon-and-lime zestiness, but misses the mark in terms of depth and complexity. Drink now.",86,Domaine Buronfosse 2010 Varron Chardonnay (Côtes du Jura),,,,
Moderately floral aromas of stone fruits and fresh carrot juice feed into a round palate that's balanced and well shaped. Nectarine and peach flavors are nice and easy. This wine is slightly leesy-tasting on a medium-length finish.,89,Terras Gauda 2016 Abadía de San Campio Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"Noticeably lighter in color and density than other Syrahs, this bottling packs a wide array of freshly shaved cinnamon and clove on the nose, along with rose petals, raspberry and chaparral scrub. Bright on the palate with dried strawberry and hibiscus notes, this intriguingly low-alcohol exploration boasts rose hips and orange-rind complexity, almost more Grenache-like in style.",91,Margerum 2013 Purisima Mountain Vineyard Syrah (Ballard Canyon),,,,
"This late release is dry verging on astringent, with a tight shell of herb and stem. Inside a good core of tart fruit—cranberry and raspberry—still seems young and suggests that decanting and/or further bottle age will see this wine continue to improve.",88,Domaine Loubejac 2010 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Aromas of ripe red berry, fragrant blue flower, cake spice, menthol and an earthy hint of truffle emerge in the glass. The juicy palate offers fleshy cherry, raspberry, licorice and chopped mint alongside firm, velvety tannins. Drink through 2022.",90,Francesco Rinaldi 2012 Cannubi  (Barolo),,,,
"Minerally on the nose but also slightly pickled, with a wet but basic tasting palate that is a touch dilute as it deals grapefruit and lime flavors. Finishes clean, fruity and a bit sweet.",86,Loma Larga 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"This is the first vintage of this 100% varietal, vineyard-designate for the producer, a mountaintop site 1,900 feet high. Red, rocky volcanic soils contribute a dusty concentration to the wine that shows a graceful grip of cranberry, cherry and currant wrapped in buoyant acidity. A wisp of smoke appears at the end.",92,Davies 2013 Red Cap Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),,,,
"Measured acidity lifts the generous green apple, pear, key lime and nutmeg flavors in this well-crafted vineyard designate from the cooler outskirts of Napa Valley. Subtle oak and weight allow the fruit to speak, seasoned with coconut flake accents.",91,B Cellars 2014 Maldonado Vineyard Chardonnay (Napa Valley),,,,
"Firm black cherry fruit opens with a slightly liquorous, Bourbon barrel accent. This young wine is still knitting together, but with ample breathing time it smoothes out, delivering a robust mix of ripe fruit, highlights of sassafras, and a hint of charcoal. Drink now or tuck it away another few years.",92,Bethel Heights 2014 Justice Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
"Oak, toast, coffee, espresso, chocolate and vanilla sensations dominate this wine along with notes of black plum. It lacks fruit richness to balance the oak and the astringent wood tannins on the finish.",87,Olivero 2010 Bricco Rocca  (Barolo),,,,
"A pure, fruity wine, this delights with its crisp apple- and pear-skin flavors. This is finely textured, with acidity and a fine, fresh character that gives lift to the rounded flavors.",88,Domaine François Schmitt 2010 Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"This gold-colorerd wine has fruitless, oaky aromas of squash and pumpkin. It feels flabby, with a resiny oak component to the mouthfeel. Flavors faded if not slightly spoiled white fruits finish with a loud echo of oak.",83,Mocén 2014 Fermentado en Barrica Verdejo (Rueda),,,,
"Smoke and savory spice notes waft from this semi-sweet Riesling. Ripe peach and grapefruit notes are juicy on the palate, accented by zesty lime acidity and a delicate mineral finish.",86,Dr. Hermann 2012 Erdener Treppchen Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Dusty minerals and subtle black cherry and bramble notes lend delicacy to this elegant, but slightly fragile, wine. Fresh cranberry acidity is brisk and cutting on the palate, leading a moderately long finish framed with soft, chalky tannins.",88,Pflüger 2012 Dürkheimer Pinot Noir (Pfalz),,,,
"A fresh lemon nose almost has a touch of herb or grass. The palate rounds this out with a balance of ripe lemon and stone-fruit freshness, while the light and creamy body offers beautifully fine fizz. A dry aftertaste has the tart freshness of green apples. The wine has an elegant, dry apéritif style with wonderful length.",92,Schloss Gobelsburg NV Brut Réserve Sparkling (Niederösterreich),,,,
"Gold in color, with a chunky palate and pushy, reduced, mealy flavors of grapefruit. Vegetal on the finish. Tasted twice with identical results.",80,Ventisquero 2012 Queulat Single Vineyard Gran Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),,,,
"Deep gold in color, this vineyard designate is oaky, with gingerbread, caramel and canned pineapple flavors. It's full, unctuous and creamy on the palate.",86,Gregory Graham 2014 Sangiacomo Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros),,,,
"This blend of Incrocio Manzoni, Trebbiano, Malvasia and Grechetto opens with tutti frutti aromas of ripe banana, pineapple and pear that carry over to the palate, along with mango. The savory palate also has a certain salinity that restrains the exuberant fruit.",86,Cirulli 2011 Hedone Bianco White (Umbria),,,,
"This barrel-fermented effort was not put through malolactic. It retains a very fresh, citrusy profile, a mix of rind and pulp flavors, with streaks of quinine and tonic. Good persistence, with the snap of fresh lime in the finish.",89,Tertulia 2008 Lonesome Spring Ranch Vineyard Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Bright, ripe fruit is the name of the game in the mouth, where blackberry and red plum are countered with a manageable amount of oak. Tannins are chalky; bouquet and finish are more subtle and a little oakier.",87,Santa Ema 1999 Barrel Select Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Maipo Valley),,,,
"The wine is fantastic, albeit tannic. It's not a gushy one to open tonight. The tannins have a dry astringency, but even so, you can taste fabulously ripe blackberries, black cherries and currants. This wine should begin to come into its own next year and hold for many years.",94,Textbook 2005 Mise en Place Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),,,,
"Looking brown around the edges, this wine is showing decline at an age when a good riserva should be hitting full stride. The fruit is stylishly sweet, but attenuated, and past its best in this pretty, older wine. Fading elegance, but why at just past five years of age?",83,Valiano 1995 Riserva  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"Loin de l'Oeil with Sauvignon Blanc gives a ripe, soft and deliciously fruity wine. Finely balanced with tangy acidity over melon and rich red-apple flavors, the wine has a touch of minerality from the gravel soil. Drink the wine now.",88,Domaine Rotier 2015 Les Gravels White (Gaillac),,,,
"Ripe black plum, forest floor, mint and spice notes lead the nose on this savory, medium-bodied red. The succulent, straightforward palate doles out fleshy black cherry and crushed raspberry accented with black pepper and clove alongside round tannins. Drink through 2015.",90,Dei 2012  Rosso di Montepulciano,,,,
"This opens with aromas of woodland berry and spring blossom. Bright and refreshing, the palate doles out wild raspberry and juicy strawberry alongside fresh acidity.",87,Rivera 2016 Pungirosa Bombino Nero Rosato (Castel del Monte),,,,
"Riper and fruitier than Donati's less expensive '08s, the Ezio is a Bordeaux-style blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon. This swaps elegance for a more full-bodied, robust style that comes across as heavy.",86,Donati 2008 Ezio Red (Paicines),,,,
"Now in its maturity, the 2006 Tahbilk Viognier shows developed notes of roses, herbal tea and grain while still evincing a youthful expression of fresh pine needles. It's concentrated, broad and viscous with a medium, hay-flavored finish. Drink now.",87,Tahbilk 2006 Viognier (Nagambie Lakes),,,,
This is a very interesting Pinot Grigio with a unique aromatic profile that includes a green note of chopped herbs or crushed white pepper. There are pretty fruit notes too and the wine is silky and crisp on the close.,87,Vigneti Villabella 2009 Vigna di Pesina Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie),,,,
"Ripe fruit tones and layers of spice (clove, cinnamon and black pepper) fold seamlessly together as one. The wine represents a hardy blend of Negroamaro and Montepulciano and offers the solid structure and firmness that you should expect from these two masculine indigenous grapes.",87,Valle dell'Asso 2006 Negroamaro (Galatina),,,,
"Bready aromas of baked apple, lees and vanilla convey quality. This feels solid and healthy, with length and depth to the palate. Apple, papaya and honeydew flavors are ripe and smooth, while the finish shows honey and green-herb notes.",90,Juvé y Camps 2009 Brut Gran Reserva Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"This round, rich and spicy estate-grown Merlot greets you with all the right stuff (and stuffing) from the first sniff. Clean berry and cherry fruit, with a light touch of peppery herb, rolls into silky tannins and pretty baking spices. A fine value.",91,Gordon Estate 2010 Estate Grown Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Clean lines of nectarine, lemon blossom, orange sorbet and wet rock show on the lovely nose of this bottling from Trey Fletcher. Boisterous energy and a chalky grip power the palate, where citrus freshness dominates, and the acidity is powerful but not overblown. It will age with beauty and grace. Drink 2018–2035.",95,Solomon Hills 2015 Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"A smoky, peppery aroma and equally spicy flavor set this medium-bodied wine apart from the pack. Dry in style, it has a firm, tannic texture. Bring out the lamb or beef to enjoy with this one.",88,Steiner Family Vineyards 2012 Cabernet Franc (El Dorado),,,,
"Toasty but also pickled, with a lot of wood spice and other oak-based aromas and flavors. At one moment the wine seems to have the right stuff: citrus and some length. But upon further inspection the fruit turns foxy and shows itself to be overripe. Loses steam as it unfolds. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",83,Domaine Jean Bousquet 2006 Chardonnay (Tupungato),,,,
"Look out Rutherford dust, here's Eola-Amity dust. Soft and yes, dusty, this intriguing wine brings a sensation of well-tanned leather under black-cherry fruit. The finish adds a dash of beet root, and leaves with some stiffening tannins. Give it ample aeration and it will improve dramatically.",92,St. Innocent 2013 Zenith Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
There was probably too much wood aging of this wine. It shows in the woody character which threatens to smother the black-currant fruit. The acidity at the end helps to give the wine some attraction.,84,Quinta da Lapa 2013 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Tejo),,,,
"This is an easy expression of Nero d'Avola, and it would pair with roasted ham or cheese ravioli in meat sauce. Bright cherry and blueberry notes come with a touch of bitter almond.",87,Tenuta Rapitalà 2011 Campo Reale Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),,,,
"Underbrush, tobacco, new leather, crushed herb and a whiff of mature plum lead the way. The juicy full-bodied palate is still young and taut, evoking ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, clove and a hint of coffee. A backbone of youthfully austere fine-grained tannins and bright acidity gives it an age-worthy structure and balance. Drink 2020–2032.",94,Ruffino 2012 Greppone Mazzi  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"Casale Vecchio is a dark and spicy expression of Montepulciano that opens with sweet aromas of jammy fruit and blackberry preserve. Layers of moist pipe tobacco, new leather and crushed granite or mineral form a nicely integrated finish.",88,Farnese 2009 Casale Vecchio  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),,,,
"Saucy, herbal aromas of tarry berry, olive, carob and mint set up a crisp palate that's lean in composition. Generic plum and buttery oak flavors finish green and herbal.",85,Baron Philippe de Rothschild 2013 Anderra Carmenère (Maipo Valley),,,,
Faint notes of both Conference and Bosc pear scent the nose. These notions also appear on the light-bodied palate where they have an earthier aspect and are presented with a very appetizing freshness and clean finish.,90,Domaine Pfister 2015 Pinot Blanc (Alsace),,,,
"This unusual wine offers aromas of nori, dried flowers, bittersweet chocolate and cherry cola. It's full flavored with a lightly tacky feel.",87,Boudreaux Cellars 2011 Wallula Vineyard Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"This crisp, citrus-flavored wine has bright acidity and a touch of vanilla. It has great fruitiness, dominated by lemon with the tang of orange zest. It is ready to drink.",86,Château de Pizay 2016  Bourgogne,,,,
"Despite this wine's thick veneer of toasty, vanilla-scented oak, it has plenty of underlying fruit, powerful enough to handle the wood. It's full bodied, dense and richly textured, with a long, velvety finish redolent of blackberries and cedar. Approachable now, but should easily age through 2025.",92,Paul Jaboulet Aîné 2009 Domaine de Thalabert  (Crozes-Hermitage),,,,
"From the Alban “Powerblock” clone, this estate bottling shows elegant if still somewhat restrained aromas of black currant and violet on the nose. The palate is extremely well integrated and seamless, with dense black fruits lifted by kicks of purple flowers. Quite beautiful but nothing too flashy in any one direction.",92,Big Basin 2013 Old Corral Syrah (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"San Rustico consistently makes some of the best Amarone available in the United States market. This shows fine qualities of blackberry, chocolate and tobacco, and a polished, silky mouthfeel.",90,San Rustico 2007  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,,,,
"Pungent, zesty and quite varietal in its expression. The nose is racy and intense, with nettle, sweat and passion fruit aromas. Expect a wet, almost spritzy palate with green-edged fruit flavors and light herbaceousness. There's bite and sass to this one, and the finish is quite long.",88,Viña Mar de Casablanca 2008 Reserva Especial Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"This wine's floral, lightly jammy red berry aromas smell like nice bath soap. It's tight and raw on the palate, expanding a bit with air. Its mix of red fruit and herbal flavors is linear and lively, although the finish is slightly abrasive.",89,Adega Cachín 2015 Peza do Rei Mencía (Ribeira Sacra),,,,
"Concentrated, firm, touched by caramel, this wine starts out intensely fruity. Then texture, mineral and fruit skins come in to play. The wine is impressively complete, its acidity ratcheted up a notch by the fine floral, green and white fruit flavors.",92,Alzinger 2007 Steinertal Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),,,,
"Not simply a jammy mouthful of fruity richness, the 2007 Woop Woop shows enough structure to ably partner food rather than replace it. Notes of raspberries, roasted coffee and vanilla are slightly confected, but the firmness on the finish proves this is not a cocktail wine. Burgers, anyone?",89,Woop Woop 2007 Shiraz (South Eastern Australia),,,,
"Wet leaf, black cherry, and assertive barrel flavors of brown sugar, maple syrup and crème brûlée are the dominant notes in this blend of Tempranillo and Cabernet Franc. The short, slightly bitter, green finish is the downside.",85,Cave B 2010 Estate Tempranillo (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Delicate scents of lemon blossom, spring wild flower and citrus waft out of the glass. The vibrant, easygoing palate doles out nectarine, aromatic herb, white peach and a mineral note alongside bright acidity.",88,Principe di Corleone 2015 Pollara Grillo (Sicilia),,,,
"This is a massively rich style of Chardonnay bordering on fat, but delicious throughout. The nose offers aromas of golden apple slices, jasmine, honeysuckle, marzipan, melon and prominent pineapple. Once sipped, vanilla-laced butter and sea-salt caramel flavors ensure.",90,Chamisal Vineyards 2013 Chamise Chardonnay (Edna Valley),,,,
"A remarkably good wine at this price. Lemon meringue and custard meet creamy stone fruit in a balanced, decadent way, a suggestion of orange whip tugging at the edges of the palate. It glides down easy, impressing further with every sip, remaining balanced and graceful.",92,Lynmar 2014 Laguna Ridge Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This wine has a hardness to it that's only partly offset by a touch of residual sugar. The yellow plum and citrus fruit is tart and ungenerous, marked by a slight prickle on the tongue and a lingering mineral finish.",86,Bladen 2000 Riesling (Marlborough),,,,
"Broad spice and almond notes evident on the nose of this hearty Brunello are accented by cherry, bright blueberry and cassis. In the mouth, the wine shows enormous elegance and a silky, streamlined feel.",92,Tenute Silvio Nardi 2006  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"This Cabernet blend includes about 20% Syrah in the mix, which perhaps contributes to a lack of varietal character. It seems to be in a dumb phase, with no specific aromas and nondescript fruit. The finish turns acidic and chalky.",85,Elsom Cellars 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"On the nose, there is a hint of apple freshness amidst the peachy honeysuckle notes. These aromas also dominate the off-dry sweetish palate. The sugar helps to lend lusciousness to the fruit notes while apple and citrus freshness brighten and enliven alongside a lovely bitter edge.",92,Jean-Baptiste Adam 2015 Kaefferkopf Grand Cru Vieilles Vignes Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"Matetic makes a clean, tropical, racy style of Gewürz that's a lot like Torrontés from Argentina. The palate is fresh with kick, while flavors of lemon-lime, lychee and passion fruit are true to the grape and set up a medium-length finish with exotic spice notes. This is perfect for Asian foods.",87,Matetic 2012 Corralillo Gewurztraminer (San Antonio),,,,
"Subtle aromas of acacia flower and a whiff of almond lead the way. The round, easygoing palate offers pear, citrus peel and a hint of hazelnut alongside soft acidity.",86,Dezzani 2015 Monfrigio  (Roero),,,,
"While the nose is austere, suggesting more stone than fruit, the palate of this dry-style Riesling offers loads of juicy, sunny peach and apricot flavors. It's an approachable yet elegant wine with cutting acidity and a lime-pith finish. Drink now through 2021.",90,Fitz-Ritter 2015 Dürkheimer Trocken Riesling (Pfalz),,,,
"Aromas of charred earth, toast, ground pepper, mature black-skinned fruit and espresso lead the nose. The big, ripe palate presents licorice, fleshy black cherry, clove and tobacco alongside a tannic backbone.",90,Poggio Nardone 2010 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"Completely different in style from the estate's Coin Caché rouge, this is primarily Mourvèdre, and primarily aged in new oak. Despite the oak, the fruit shines through, offering up ripe, mouthfilling flavors of blackberry, cola, coffee and spice. Firmly structured, this could repay 5–7 years of cellaring.",91,Mas de la Dame 2005 Le Vallon des Amants Red (Les Baux de Provence),,,,
"This biodynamic Muscat is direct and focused, with a ripe core of stone fruit, melon rind and sweet citrus notes, framed by touches of waxy honeycomb, white flower and soft baking spice. A hint of toast lingers on the long finish, and the mouthfeel is full and lush without feeling viscious, thanks to the vibrant acidity.",91,Domaine Cazes 2008 Vin Doux Naturel Biodynamie  (Muscat de Rivesaltes),,,,
"Wonderfully aromatic, this sure-to-be legendary wine offers richness, ripeness, and pure yellow fruits, peaches and apricots, all alongside a structured strain of chalky minerality. It is a wine for long aging, the wood spice just becoming integrated, the fruit still in its first vibrancy. But even now, it fills the mouth with generous fruits, and a great finish of citrus.",97,Domaine de Chevalier 2007  Pessac-Léognan,,,,
"This solidly made wine is well apportioned in terms of price and quality. With smokiness to the toasty oak, it's a concentrated and juicy wine accented by saddle and black cherry. Medium bodied and rounded, it has a medium finish, as well.",87,Folie à Deux 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"Boysenberry and blueberry aromas mixed with oak scents amount to an inviting, solid bouquet. In the mouth, this is healthy, full-bodied and showing plenty of kick. Flavors of berry fruits, plum and roasted notes end with jammy berry flavors and a good texture. Drink now–2015.",89,Clunia 2010 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),,,,
"Hard and charred on the nose at first, this sheds its tire-like aromas for cleaner berry-fruit notes with airing. A full grabby palate is a bit rough and awkward, while roasted berry, plum and oak flavors finish minty and resiny.",88,Launa 2014 Selección Familiar Crianza  (Rioja),,,,
"Gemtree's Obsidian Shiraz ratchets up the intensity from its usual offerings, adding structure and richness to straight-ahead aromas and flavors of cherries, coffee and vanilla. The wood sticks out a little on the finish, so give it another year or two in the bottle, then drink it over the next 10.",90,Gemtree 2004 Obsidian Shiraz (McLaren Vale),,,,
"The apple and lime aromas are simple yet inviting. It feels round and mellow, maybe a bit low in acidity. The flavors of banana, vanilla bean and pear are friendly, while the finish is smooth and bears a tropical flavor.",88,Shaya 2011 Old Vines Verdejo (Rueda),,,,
"Red apples, sourdough bread, cherry blossoms and strawberry zest show on the nose of this ever-so-slightly pink wine. The sipping experience is reminiscent of a fizzy, foamy mouthful of Pop Rocks flavored by sour cherries, altogether fun, tart and delicious.",91,Riverbench 2012 Cork Jumper Rosé Blanc de Noirs Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"Decima Aurea is a refined and elegant expression of Merlot with deep and long aromas of ripe cherry, blackberry pie, Indian spice, clove and old spice. The wine shows the sophistication of age, but also promises years of cellar aging.",91,Tenuta Santa Maria alla Pieve 2004 Decima Aurea Merlot (Veneto),,,,
"Arione shows its Serralunga d'Alba pedigree via classic aromas of black cherry, leather, truffle and rose petal. The palate delivers lush wild-cherry flavors and hints of truffle, mint and the vineyard's hallmark licorice. It's beautifully balanced, with firm but ripe tannins and just enough freshness, and is simply a gorgeous Barolo.",95,Gigi Rosso 2009 Arione  (Barolo),,,,
"A blend of Carricante and Catarratto from vineyards plated 600 meters above sea level on the slopes of Mount Etna, Quota 600 is among Sicily's best white wines. Compact, tonic and streamlined, it does a beautiful job of presenting delicate floral and peach fruit aromas against an austere backdrop of crushed stone and talcum powder.",90,Graci 2010 Quota 600  (Etna),,,,
"This very pretty wine is built upon soft, forward, ripe strawberry fruit, and dappled with details of cinnamon and baking spices. A touch of chocolate sneaks into the focused, lightly tarry finish, which is nicely balanced. This pioneering vineyard dates back to the 1970s, but much of it has been replanted since the beginning of this century.",92,Knudsen 2014 Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),,,,
"Upon opening, this smells oaky and lemony, although airing brings it around. Fresh and mildly astringent on the palate, this tastes oaky and briny at first, then more complex, deep and toasty as it spreads out. Licorice, herb and background berry flavors are woody and still somewhat fiery on the finish. Drink 2015 through 2025.",92,Raúl Pérez 2010 Ultreia de Valtuille Mencía (Bierzo),,,,
"With lemon-lime and lemongrass aromas, this Cava is slightly exotic on the bouquet. The palate feels good but not terribly interesting or complex, with flavors of dusty apple, peach and vanilla. With a short finish, this vintage sparkler is fine but not as good as in the past.",87,Juvé y Camps 2008 Brut Gran Reserva Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"The Sauvignon (64%) comes from Bacchus with the Sémillon from neighboring Dionysus. After starting out slightly reduced, fig and spice aromas lead to tart, lemon and tropical fruit flavors that need more cohesion and concentration to keep them together.",86,Cloudlift Cellars 2014 Updraft White (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Red fruits and a cool edge characterize this wine from the highest elevation of the Beaujolais cru villages. It has red cherry fruitiness, a crisp layer of acidity and a dry, smoky aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",87,Florent Descombe 2016  Chiroubles,,,,
"This wine is full of all the right elements, from juicy acidity to black currant fruit and a supporting layer of tannins. It has weight, concentration and delicious spice and berry flavors. Drink from 2020.",91,Château Chantemerle 2015 Tradition  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux),,,,
"This has a delicate citrus character and a tangy, minerally texture. The ripe fruits are balanced by acidity.",89,Simon Bize 2010 Les Champlains  (Bourgogne),,,,
"This opens with toasted oak, eucalyptus and violet aromas. The palate is tight and compressed, showing toasted oak and black spice flavors alongside grainy tannins that leave an astringent, mouth-drying finish.",85,Ricossa 2013  Barbaresco,,,,
"A blend of 51% Viognier and 49% Traminer, this wine is made with organic grapes. It has aromas of jasmine and guava flowers and lush tropical flavors of mango and freshly cut guava.",89,Edoardo Miroglio 2015 Bio Viognier And Traminer Made With Organic Grapes White (Thracian Valley),,,,
"The cork label of this rich, smooth wine is a reminder that Alentejo's vines are interspersed with the trees that provide much of the world's cork. The wine has a rich southern character, soft tannins and plenty of blackberry fruits. It is ready to drink.",88,Casa Agricola Alexandre Relvas 2016 São Miguel do Sul Red (Alentejano),,,,
"Old-vine fruit delivers an elegant Pinot that combines low alcohol with graceful details of pretty spices and red fruits. Young, tangy cherry flavors are precisely defined, with a delicate tension. This might very well improve dramatically with a decade or more of cellaring. Drink 2020–2030.",90,Winderlea 2013 Maresh Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),,,,
"The subtlest notes of earth and honey suggest an evolving wine. The palate takes these further and wraps them up in fruit flavors that owe as much to lemon zest as they do to the peel of pear and russet apple. There is focus and poise on the palate and real tension between toned, muscular fruit and sprightly freshness. This is just coming out of its shell. Drink 2016–2026.",93,Trimbach 2010 Réserve Personnelle Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"Smoothness and subtlety come with a texture just rich enough to be interesting, without damping down the acidity that makes this light-bodied wine refreshing. It offers flavors of crisp green apple and a touch of pear.",88,Mirassou 2015 Pinot Grigio (California),,,,
"Peppery spice, cassis fruit and some savory notes sum up this medium-bodied wine. It's just not that complex or concentrated, but it remains an attractive wine for near-term consumption. Drink it with grilled meats to help balance the dry, dusty tannins that poke out on the finish.",89,Maison Nicolas Perrin 2013  Côte Rôtie,,,,
"Delicate aromas of both toasted nuts and pear waft out of the glass. On the lively palate, a mineral vein enhances rennet apple, citrus zest and bitter almond while zesty acidity leaves a tangy finish.",89,Castello di Spessa 2014 Friulano (Collio),,,,
"Soft and simple, this full-bodied effort shows a char of toasted oak as strong flavors of root beer and cola meet dark cherry and berry.",85,Scott Family 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Smoky aromas of graphite, road tar and wild berry set up a wiry, full-force palate with a can't-miss beam of tartaric acidity. Blackberry and chocolaty flavors finish forward, with unabashed freshness and drive. Drink through 2019.",91,Alma de los Andes 2012 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"This is a lively and structured blend that integrates Tannat with Merlot and Petit Verdot. With 11 months in French oak, toasted coffee and tobacco notes ride over ripe cherry, plum and currant aromas. The tannins are sandy on the palate, giving ample structure to a dark fruit-driven wine. Freshly crushed black pepper lingers on the finish.",88,Fabbioli Cellars 2012 Tre Sorélle Red (Virginia),,,,
"The oak is strong on this blend of three of the winery's best vineyards. It shows up as buttered toast, with a distinctive, charry-sweet note of toasted marshmallows. The wine is strong in pineapples and oranges. An eccentric Chardonnay for drinking now.",88,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2011 Cuvée de Trois Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"From the Loazzolo subzone of Piedmont, this beautiful dessert wine presents generous aromas of fresh flower, apricot, honey, baked pear and Golden Delicious apple. The mouthfeel is rich, long and smooth.",88,Borgo Isolabella 2005 Isolabella della Croce Solìo Moscato (Loazzolo),,,,
"Sourced from the Wits' End (estate) vineyard, this is not noticeably different from that designated cuvée. Not that that's a bad thing—the lively raspberry and strawberry fruit flavors (laced with highlights of orange peel) are consistent and crisply defined. There's a light touch of caramel running down the finish.",91,Roco 2014 Private Stash #12 Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),,,,
"A deep, dark, robust Lake County Barbera, tame by Barbera standards, with softened tannins but lots of black licorice, fruit—rustic plum, mostly—and a hint of baked bread. Worth a try with meaty pasta dishes.",88,Rosa d'Oro 2009 Barbera (Clear Lake),,,,
"This varietal Sauvignon Gris isn't as aromatic as the more pungent Sauvignon Blanc. In the mouth, this is medium in body, with good overall texture. Dry racy flavors of scallion and bitter melon are not exuberant but turn fruitier on the finish.",87,Cousiño-Macul 2015 Isidora Sauvignon Gris (Maule Valley),,,,
An immediately attractive fruity wine that's half-and-half Touriga Nacional and Cabernet Sauvignon. Neither of the two grapes' natural tannins show in this wine with its soft texture and blackberry fruitiness. It is ready to drink.,86,Quinta do Casal Monteiro 2012 Forma de Arte Reserva Red (Tejo),,,,
"This is young, quite sharp and still showing some rough edges. The fruit is crisp and pure, with well-defined flavors of raspberry and cherry candy. The tannins have a green tea, earthy quality, but some additional bottle age will help round them out.",87,Maysara 2007 Estate Cuvée Pinot Noir (McMinnville),,,,
"This wine is  dark in color, with just a thin red rim. It smells of ripe blackberries, grilled beef and clove, with flavors as dense as the color. For all its color and flavor intensity and fine-grained tannins, however, it feels smooth and velvety on the tongue and is hard to resist, especially at such a reasonable price.",90,Gnarly Head 2013 1924 Limited Edition Double Black Red (California),,,,
"This hearty red is packed tight with superintense aromas of black fruit, leather, tobacco and roasted espresso bean. Bold, big and meaty, this is richly extracted and inky dark. Pair it with aged Pecorino cheese.",91,Farnese 2007 Opi Riserva  (Colline Teramane),,,,
"Fully mature, this light-bodied Pinot should be consumed before the end of 2017. Scents of cola and earth add interest to cherry fruit, ending with lingering acids.",86,Cairnbrae 2013 Pinot Noir (Marlborough),,,,
"Still quite youthful, this wine is closed and tight, but full of potential. Flavors of citrus fruits, mango and pear are layered elegantly with wood. It's a ripe, while crisp wine that's tightly structured and powerful. Drink from 2016.",91,Pascal Bouchard 2011 Fourchaume Premier Cru  (Chablis),,,,
"Paul Hobbs coaxes beautifully classic Cab aromas and textures from this wine, which comes from the tricky 2011 vintage. Expect black currant, olive, cassis and peppercorn to intermingle on the palate amidst soft elegance, the perfect balance between fruity and herbal. On the finish a dusting of mocha turns up the dial on deliciousness.",93,Paul Hobbs 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"This wine has a vivid spicy, oaky aroma and the same powerful woody character dominates the flavors. It also has full body and enough blackberry flavors to complete a tasty picture, along with a very reasonable price tag.",88,Avalon 2013 CAB Cabernet Sauvignon (California),,,,
"Earthy and mulchy smelling on first take, with leather and solid berry and plum aromas. Feels bold, round and dedicated as it tastes a bit baked, with dark plum and cassis carrying the fruit component. Figgy, smooth and lasting on the finish.",88,Lamadrid 2009 Single Vineyard Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Agrelo),,,,
"This is a ripe and spicy wine, with great touches of lemon and acidity that partner with the rich quince and mango flavors. The wine is ripe and full bodied, a fine expression of a more complex side of Pinot Blanc.",89,André Blanck et ses Fils 2011 Rosenburg Pinot Blanc (Alsace),,,,
This vintage has shaped a bold and powerful expression of Friulano with deeply etched aromas of stone fruit and apricot and thick density in the mouth. This is an extremely food-friendly wine that would work well with elaborate dishes that include cheese or cream.,87,Villa Russiz 2006 Tocai Friulano (Collio),,,,
"Herbaceous in character, this a crisp, lemon-scented wine, still so young and fresh. With its tangy character, it could well age for several months more.",86,Château Roubine 2012 White (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"Aromas of cola, raisin and cassis are ripe and chunky. A sinewy palate displays raisiny flatness, while this is oaky tasting on the surface and more spicy, rubbery and fruity underneath. Flavors of tobacco and wood spice finish tight, with bright acidity keeping things lively.",91,Rioja Vega 2008 Gran Reserva Edición Limitada  (Rioja),,,,
"Pleasant and straightforward, this displays true-to-varietal scents and fruit flavors plus good balance. It's a simple wine that does not reach past pleasant vin ordinaire.",87,Spindrift Cellars 2012 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Grapefruit, peach and nectarine aromas carry over to the racy palate along with apricot. Zesty acidity provides refreshing balance and a tangy finish.",88,Nals Margreid 2014 Kerner (Alto Adige),,,,
"A bit on the sugary sweet side, but otherwise this is a nice cocktail sipper. Shows good acidity coupled with pineapple, Meyer lemon, lime, green apple and spice flavors. Would score much higher if it were drier.",85,Field Stone 2009 Redwood Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Alexander Valley),,,,
"With lees aging, this wine has gained richness, balancing crisp acidity with ripe flavors. Aromatic and with a flinty texture and citrus flavors, the wine is concentrated. The finish shows more of the herbal Sauvignon character.",91,Domaine Girard 2015 Philippe Girard  (Sancerre),,,,
"Hard to like this sweetly cloying, simple Pinot. It tastes like a raspberry, honey and roasted almond granola candy bar, and is already feeling tired.",82,Castle Rock 2010 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County),,,,
"Though labeled simply “Oregon,” this is 100% Hyland vineyard fruit from the McMinnville AVA. Done in a refined, lightly smoky style, it pushes subtle berry flavors into a substantial midpalate laden with highlights of milk chocolate, café crème and a touch of caramel. Smooth as silk, this will be tough to ignore in your cellar, though it will reward another three to five years of bottle age.",93,DanCin 2014 Melodia Pinot Noir (Oregon),,,,
"This elegant Cabernet nicely threads the needle between fruit and herb, slaloming down the palate with a lingonberry here, a sprig of thyme there, underpinned with earth and chocolate. It's a wine that may be sipped and savored, offering subtle pleasures along the way.",90,RiverAerie 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Showing the heat of the vintage, this offers earthy sensations of leather, scorched soil, truffle, stewed prune and ripe cherry. Bracing tannins provide the backdrop.",90,Borgogno F.lli Serio e Battista 2011 Cannubi  (Barolo),,,,
"This is succulent yet delicate, with dried hay and sweet grass flavors. Textural, vivid and racy, it has a Loire-like mix of fruit, flower and herb, with the possibility of improving still further over the next 4–5 years.",91,Barons V 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Perhaps the most accessible of Melville's new 2011s, the Sandy's exhibits cherry, pomegranate and sweet red plum fruit flavors, leading to a long, spicy finish. It's round and mellow in the mouth, with a nice tang of acidity. Drink now–2016.",90,Melville 2011 Sandy's Estate Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Absolutely bursting with scents and flavors of ripe cherries, this delicious wine has amazing intensity. The fruit is as fresh as any wine can be, pure and focused, sweet and still deep, with a tight intensity that suggests good things to come. You have to love its purity.",92,Ken Wright 2010 Abbott Claim Vineyard Pinot Noir,,,,
"Pollen and dust notes lend an earthy, mineral tone to ripe tangerine and peach flavors in this bristling, bright eiswein. It's strikingly acidic, but broad swathes of honey and nectar balance things out elegantly.",92,Robert Weil 2012 Kiedrich Gräfenberg Eiswein Riesling (Rheingau),,,,
"The principal grapes of Dão are all in this ripe, fruity blend: Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Alfrocheiro are rich, full of blackberry fruits and layered with some firm tannins. The wine is ripe while still retaining the structure from the granite soil. Drink now.",87,Messias 2013 Messias Selection Red (Dão),,,,
"This is a soft white wine with sugary flavors of lemon, orange, date, nougat and vanilla candy bar.",82,Pedroncelli 2012 East Side Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Strong in fruit and acidity, this Pinot Noir swamps the palate with gigantic flavors of raspberries and cherries that taste like they were baked into a pie. That includes the pie crust, with it's spicy, vanilla smokiness. It's all a bit in your face, but it's flashy.",90,Talbott 2008 Cuvee Sarah Case Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"This has that distinctive diesel-fuel aroma often associated with Riesling; while that aroma is atypical of Grenache Blanc, this remains a successful wine. Bone dry, bright in acidity and mineral-driven, it shows a citrus flavor, in addition to that petrol note.",88,Tercero 2010 Camp 4 Vineyard Grenache Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"This bold, ripe blend even contains some Muscat that gives richness and a touch of honey and spice to what is otherwise a dry rosé. The acidity acts as a balance to this attractive wine.",87,Ravoire et Fils 2015 Jas des Vignes Rosé,,,,
"This opens with aromas of black currant, crushed violet, resin and a whiff of baking spice. Since it lacks the hefty structure of most Amarones it's more easygoing, offering red cherry, mint and a hint of tobacco alongside fine-grained tannins.",87,Luigi Righetti 2012 Capitel de' Roari  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico),,,,
"One of the better wines on the market in the $30 range, this bottling from winemaker Aaron Walker shows beet, rhubarb, raspberry and dried mint aromas. The flavorful red fruit on the palate is lively and boisterous, its acidity and peppery spice combining for a very memorable sipping experience.",92,Pali 2015 Summit Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Spicy and with a fine pure line of fresh red-berry fruits, this is an attractive fruity wine that has a good core of tannins. It is produced from old vines that give concentration while the acidity adds a great swish of freshness at the end. Drink from 2017.",88,Vignoble de la Jarnoterie 2014 Improvisation  (Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil),,,,
"Dense and structured, this opens with aromas of baked plum, menthol, coconut and toasted oak. The concentrated palate displays cherries marinated in spirits, grilled sage, licorice and roasted coffee bean alongside tightly packed, fine-grained tannins that need time to unwind. Drink 2018–2030.",91,Salcheto 2010 Salco  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),,,,
"Neutral aromas and a light pink color suggest this will be an easy ride. Its shy palate is light on acidity, with generic, mild flavors and a mildly briny finish.",86,Beronia 2016 Tempranillo Rosado (Rioja),,,,
"Rich round cherry fruit, lightly infused with tobacco highlights, introduces this delicious wine. There is a pleasing softness to the palate, without it being in any way flat or flabby. The fruit seems more mature than the young vintage would suggest, and it's drinking more like a wine from half a decade ago, which means you don't need to cellar it to get cellar-style flavors. Pie cherry, orange peel and even a touch of pineapple peeks through the lingering finish.",92,Aubichon Cellars 2015 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Generous strawberry and cherry flavors make this medium-bodied wine taste fruity and fresh, and a gentle texture buoyed by light acidity seems to match their modulated intensity. It finishes dry and with a good touch of tannin.",88,Bravium 2014 Wiley Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),,,,
"Lovely scents of orchard fruit and apple blossom take center stage. The vibrant, savory palate offers crunchy rennet apple, tangerine and mineral while zesty acidity leads to the tangy finish.",89,Caldaro 2014 Söll Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),,,,
"Bone dry yet sweet in fruit, it shows the acids and tannins of this cool section of Napa Valley, which gives such excellent structure to the ripe blackberry and blueberry fruit. It feels vital, offering a different impression with every sip. Wonderful to drink now but capable of aging; drink now–2019.",94,Nickel & Nickel 2009 State Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville),,,,
"The wine is rich, ripe and fruity with good acidity as well as a bite of spirit and old-wood aging. It is well balanced, keeping the freshness of a 10-Year-Old while also showing good signs of its wood aging. Just what a 10-Year-Old should be.",91,W. & J. Graham's NV 10-Year-Old Tawny  (Port),,,,
"Briny grassy aromas of apple and citrus are yeasty as well. This Chardonnay-Pinot Noir blend is foamy and active, while flavors run towards slightly bitter and yeasty, with fruit hard to find. A similar finish renders this good but with issues.",86,Miolo 2012 Millésime Brut  (Vale dos Vinhedos),,,,
"A clumsy wine that aims for white Bordeaux in style and falls far short. There's plenty of oak and lees, but the underlying wine is thin and disappointing in citrus flavor.",83,Cosentino 2008 The Novelist Meritage (California),,,,
"A soft and creamy wine, freshened with a little citrus. It has only light acidity, the main focus being pear and red apple flavors. It rolls easily around the palate, finishing freshly. Screwcap.",84,DFJ Vinhos 2008 Coreto Branco White (Lisboa),,,,
"Full in the mouth, this is a rich style of rosé, with delicious red-berry crispness. It is ready for food with its tangy, textured aftertaste. Screwcap.",89,Château de Pourcieux 2011 Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"Boizel is one of those enlightened producers that indicates the date of disgorgement—and therefore how fresh the wine is likely to be—on its nonvintage bottlings. This Brut, from an April 2014 disgorgement, is an attractively fruity wine with fresh acidity, ripe red apples and a light, bright aftertaste. Drink now.",88,Boizel NV Brut Réserve  (Champagne),,,,
"The nose hints at citric tartness but the palate turns out to be creamy with fine fizz and scented lemon-shortcake freshness. It offers glimpses of richness and cream but never losing its crisp edge. This is freshness framed by autolytic notes of bread crust and bakery, ideal apéritif material with a dry finish.",90,Szigeti NV Cuvée Prestige Brut Sparkling (Österreichischer Sekt),,,,
"There's a vibrant purity to this wine with its aromas and flavors of boysenberry, green olive, wet gravel and smoked meat, with the Viognier blended in (8%) only adding to its perfume. It coats the palate with a plush but still light and lively texture backed by a zing of tart acidity.",91,Kerloo 2013 Upland Vineyard Syrah (Snipes Mountain),,,,
"Chenin Blanc dominates this attractive wine, giving a nutty, almond and honey character. Stewed pear is balanced with lime acidity in a fruity contrast. The wine is aromatic, lively and ready to drink.",87,Cave de Saumur NV De Chanceny Brut Sparkling (Crémant de Loire),,,,
"Acidity marks this wine, giving it a cut that streaks right down the middle of the blackberry, black cherry and cedar flavors. It's very dry, with rich, refined tannins, and that acidity will come in handy paired against a steak.",88,Three Sticks 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"Really charming, with sweetish brambly fruit and smooth plum nuances. Fairly concentrated, with a juicy, date and cranberry finish. Try with barbecue. Drink now to 2011.",85,Snake River 2007 Arena Valley Vineyard Grenache,,,,
"Peach skin and orange peel appear on the nose, the palate is off-dry but fresh and vivid with floral impressions that are more present on the tongue than the nose. There is ripe, fresh peach and honeysuckle and a balanced poise. The aromatic subtlety causes you to pause and wonder, even after the last echo.",91,Klipfel 2010 Clos Zisser Kirchberg de Barr Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"This is a half-and-half blend of Touriga Nacional from northern Portugal and Castelão from the south. It's a wine that has plenty of fruit although the two grapes lie uneasily together. The juicy flavors and red berries are contrasted with a metallic acidity that isn't pleasant. Hopefully, the wine will fill out.",85,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2014 Lagoalva Red (Tejo),,,,
Powdery bath-soap aromas are odd on the nose. The mealy palate boasts flavors of bitter melon and papaya.,81,Autoritas 2014 Gran Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),,,,
"Soft, ripe and fruity, this is an immediately accessible, drinkable wine. It's soft with lemon and yellow fruits coming together to give a fresh, lively apéritif style of wine.",86,Mont Gravet 2013 Colombard (Côtes de Gascogne),,,,
"A touch of wood aging brings spice and vanilla to this ripe, citrus and pineapple flavored wine. Very fruity, and with sophistication from the toast flavors, it finishes with almonds and the freshest acidity. Drink from 2015.",89,Quinta da Ribeirinha 2013 Vale de Lobos Branco Fernão Pires (Tejo),,,,
"This comes from a parcel of red clay that is not found elsewhere in the region. It gives a powerful and hugely dense wine that boasts good concentration and ripe black fruits. There is no sense of any aging yet on this impressive wine with its acidity and opulent ripeness still intact. Drink now, although the wine will age for many years, certainly until 2025.",93,Vignobles Brumont 2009 Château Bouscassé Argile Rouge Red (Madiran),,,,
"A tart and beautifully-defined mix of apple and pear fruit, with a steely spine and dappled baking spices. Excellent balance and mouthfeel, with a finishing mineral note.",91,Cristom 2009 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Candied, oaky aromas of clove outmuscle foxy berry scents. This blend of 60% Merlot and 40% Cab Sauvignon is heavy, tannic and ultimately a bit overweight and flabby. Clove, wood spice and cooked berry flavors finish with baking spice and woody notes.",85,Montebro 2013 Vilamar Reserva Reerva Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon (Terra Alta),,,,
Aromas and flavors like prunes and strawberry jam make an unusual combination in this full-bodied and uncomplicated wine. It is certainly fruity and generous in personality.,84,Joseph Jewell 2013 Alderpoint Vineyard Pinot Noir (Humboldt County),,,,
"This blend holds Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese, Merlot, Syrah and Cabernet Franc, with no variety making up more than 29%. The aromas tussle with notes of blackberry, green herbs, coffee and woodspice. It's medium bodied with cherry flavors and chalky tannins.",86,Blacksmith 2012 Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This blend of top Zin lots from across the region isn't made every vintage. This wine shows slightly sour black plum, dark leather, wet soil and a touch of tar on the nose. Dried red fruit is spiced up by dried herbs on the energetic. Acidity and soft tannins emerge toward the caramel-laced finish.",88,Castoro Cellars 2015 Zinfusion Reserve Zinfandel (Paso Robles),,,,
"This wine is lean, austere with high acidity that leaves fruit well behind. It is structured and dry, only hinting at black-currant freshness. This third-generation family estate also hosts monthly musical and tasting events and sells fruit, vegetables and honey.",84,Château Bardins 2013  Pessac-Léognan,,,,
"Earth and matchstick define the nose of this easygoing wine. The palate is quiet, with low-intensity flavors of passion fruit and citrus that finish mildly pithy.",84,Veramonte 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"Aromas suggesting underbrush, sweat, tobacco and toast reluctantly come together in the glass. The brooding palate is more appealing, delivering ripe cherry, black raspberry, grilled sage and a hint of vanilla alongside tart acidity and ripe, assertive tannins.",90,Rizieri 2012  Barolo,,,,
"An easy effort, this has aromas of pear, white peach and white flower. The bright, perky acidity energizes the medium- to full-bodied palate, with a honeyed toasted-nut note marking the finish.",84,Bogati 2011 Viognier (Virginia),,,,
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Syrah initially smells cool and earthy, then more woody, spicy and animal-like. On the palate, this is concentrated and deep, with milder tannins than the winery's varietal Petit Verdot. Flavors of blackberry and cassis are powerful, while burnt wood, bitter chocolate and peppery flavors drive a muscular finish. Drink now through 2020.",92,Marques de Griñon 2008 Emeritvs Red (Dominio de Valdepusa),,,,
"Foxy blackberry and cassis aromas are young and untamed, with a note of wet animal fur. This Mencía is grapy and rich, with a dense, saturated palate. Chocolaty black-fruit flavors finish with hard tannins, lots of residual fruit and a structure that suggests that this wine is here to stay for a while. Drink 2019–2025.",92,Luna Beberide 2015 Art Mencía (Bierzo),,,,
"Opens with honest green notes of gooseberry, lime and sea foam, and while the palate is a touch soft in texture, it has true Chilean SB flavors of bell pepper, fresh lettuce and melon. Sturdy on the finish, with a forward attitude.",85,Yali 2009 Wetland Winemaker's Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Rapel Valley),,,,
"A blend of 89% Cabernet Sauvignon and 11% Merlot, this wine has subtle baking spice and a velvety texture of soft, red fruit. With the barest minimum of grip on the back palate, it's ready to drink now.",87,White Oak 2008 Napa Reserve Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Coniale is all Cabernet Sauvignon. The nose is rich in dimension and personality and delivers quality aromas of spice, tobacco, chopped herbs, almonds and bursting blackberry. It is inky and dense in consistency with a velvety mouthfeel that builds in structure thanks to gritty tannins.",91,Castellare di Castellina 2003 Coniale Cabernet Sauvignon (Toscana),,,,
"Vanilla, butterscotch and some harsher oak-derived compounds dominate the modest citrus fruit that might have been wine before it was turned into oak juice. For wood lovers only.",80,Laurel Lake 1998 Reserve Chardonnay (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"Cabernet, Merlot, Sangiovese and Syrah produce a sophisticated and refined blend that boasts fantastic power and intensity. The wine is dark, chewy, rich and bursting with flavors of mature berry, spice, cola, leather and tobacco.",92,Castello Banfi 2004 Cum Laude Red (Sant'Antimo),,,,
"An eccentric wine. Rather heavy for a classic coastal Pinot Noir, yet not without charismatic charm. Shows rich, deep flavors of wild raspberries, toffee, vanilla bean and smoky wood. Gathers momentum and interest as it breathes in the glass. Could substitute for everything from Zinfandel to Grenache. Drink now.",90,Sean Thackrey 2008 Andromeda Devil's Gulch Ranch Pinot Noir (Marin County),,,,
"With plenty of weight, but weight that is concentrated around a tight, firm tannic core. The wine has great ripe plum and black cherry fruits, brimming from the glass. The acidity is a strong presence, and with the tannin promises several years' aging.",91,Companhia das Quintas 2007 Fronteira Red (Douro),,,,
"This very ripe interpretation of Touriga Nacional brings out a dark black-plum flavor, which hides the grape's natural tannins. It is chunky, with powerful, forward fruit.",86,Terra d'Alter 2010 Touriga Nacional (Alentejano),,,,
"This is a green, lean and somewhat sour wine, with an herbal personality that lies atop a world of smooth tannins.",83,Rutherford Hill 2011 Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"For a Gewürz, this is restrained, a soft, open and attractively easy wine, lightly hinting at lychee and pear juice. Drink now.",87,Dopff & Irion 2009 Gewürztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"Organically grown and selected from a mix of specific vineyard blocks, Rex Hill's reserve is rather light in 2007, with tannins that are a bit out of proportion to the fruit. It's a carefully controlled effort, but thin and dilute, with strawberry/watermelon fruit and some tomato leaf creeping into the finish.",87,Rex Hill 2007 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Barrel-forward aromas of vanilla and toast are in front of herb and cherry. The palate brings a sense of polish and appeal, with the tannins bringing some squeeze on the finish.",90,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2014 Cold Creek Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This single-vineyard wine is ripe and rich, with structure and plenty of dense fruitiness. Pears and a touch of lychee give a round texture that is smooth and soft. It's ready to drink, although it will develop well through 2017–2018.",88,Paul Blanck 2012 Patergarten Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"Primarily Merlot, with 18% Cabernet Sauvignon (from the Bacchus vineyard) filling out the blend. Lovely aromatics open into a high acid red with raspberries and plums. It profits from extended breathing time, though ultimately fades away into a somewhat chalky finish.",89,Soos Creek 2011 Palisade Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"The Dead Arm rarely wows this reviewer in our blind tastings, and while the 2007 is undeniably a very good wine, it shows a tart edge and a reined-in personality. Toast and vanilla frame cranberry and raspberry fruit, chocolate overtones and savory, meaty elements. Try it after 2015 and see if it has loosened up at all.",89,D'Arenberg 2007 The Dead Arm Shiraz (McLaren Vale),,,,
"This is a structured, full-bodied wine that has solid tannins and concentrated fruitiness. It is packed with red-berry flavors, ripe tannins and spice from the wood aging. The wine will take time to develop. Drink from 2022.",92,Seguin-Manuel 2015 Les Lavières Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),,,,
"Mixed berry, cola and cedar notes dominate the nose, while the palate is packed with cherry cola and leather flavors. The dense texture could use some time to open up, and that suggestion of ageability is reinforced by the finish's dry, dusty tannins. Drink 2010–15. Imported by Tom Eddy Wines.",87,Capel Vale 2005 Regional Series Shiraz (Mount Barker),,,,
"An aromatically reticent wine with notes of mineral, apple, and spice. It drinks just a hair off-dry with tart green apple flavors and sharp edged acids making for a pleasant summer afternoon sipper.",86,Pyrenees 2011 Pinot Gris (Umpqua Valley),,,,
"Dark and sexy; there's something erotic about this wine, with its seductive jammy flavors, velvety texture and spicy, long finish. After an initial bite of acidity, it turns soft as a goose-down pillow. In its own way, it's perfect. And the price is unreal. Best Buy.",92,Terre Rouge 2000 Les Côtes de L'Ouest Syrah (California),,,,
"A very neutral wine, this has some earthy spice on the palate, but is almost bare of fruit. It's clean and neutral but not refreshing.",80,Domaine de la Tour Blanche 2014 Pinot Blanc (Alsace),,,,
"Marked by jammy fruit and high acidity, this Syrah is strong in cherries, raspberries and oak. It's not especially subtle, but it is pretty and polished, and could even acquire bottle complexity over the next 3–4 years.",86,Jax 2005 Y3 Syrah (Napa Valley),,,,
"Lime and green-apple aromas are tight and stony. Bright, juicy and chiseled on the palate, this tastes of wet stones, lime and bell pepper. Citrusy residual flavors along with a note of bitter citrus pith make for an honest finish.",89,Lomas del Valle 2016 Coastal Cool Climate Wine Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"White flower, honeydew melon and lemon aromas meld together on this lively white. The savory, juicy palate doles out green apple, white peach and a white almond note alongside flinty mineral and bright acidity.",88,San Silvestro 2015 Fossili del Comune di Gavi  (Gavi),,,,
"Juicy and smoky with a taste of tar, this full-bodied wine is soft and integrated in terms of oak. Black cherry, blackberry and strawberry play on the palate against measured acidity and weight.",89,Miro 2013 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"This is the first release for the Four Brothers designation. Tastes of brown sugar flavors filling in around a thin core of barely ripe fruit. The sweet impression returns in the finish, this time with a lick of maple syrup.",85,LaVelle 2011 Four Brothers Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Chocolate, cigar, clove and cedar unfurl slowly on the nose and palate of this wine, a rare variety for the appellation, but one to which the producer remains committed. Fruity currant and black raspberry season the firm, integrated tannin and nuanced oak, with a sizzle of acidity as it lingers on the finish. This wine should age well through 2023, and is enjoyable now.",94,Dehlinger 2013 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Russian River Valley),,,,
"A super-rich wine, almost over the top in its honeyed intensity. It is opulent, generous, packed with ripe yellow fruits, mango and pineapple. The wine is so rich that it is hard to find the acidity, but it is there in the orange marmalade flavor right at the end.",91,Château la Varière 2009 Les Melleresses  (Bonnezeaux),,,,
"There is an interesting balance of fruit and cooling herbs here, with cherry and raspberry mingling seamlessly with mint and eucalyptus. Smooth tannins continue uninterrupted through the lingering finish.",89,Golan Heights Winery 2010 Yarden Cabernet Sauvignon (Galilee),,,,
"Crisp, minty, herbal aromas of berry and plum lead to a bright, rumbling, tannic palate with energy. Blackberry and chocolate flavors are good and earthy, while the finish is plump but braced by lively acidity. This is well made and satisfying for a basic roble wine.",87,Señorío de Sotillo 2010 Roble 4 Meses en Barrica  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"This is a tropical-fruited wine, with mango and sweet peach notes showing the wine's richness. As a complement, there is the taut green-fruit acidity that's bright and fresh. The two together lend a rich, yet structured wine.",91,Domaine Fouassier 2010 Clos Paradis  (Sancerre),,,,
"There is a distinct hint of ripe, juicy peach flesh amidst all the pear aromas. The palate is less expressive but still full of friendly, appetizing and generous fruit. A seam of citric freshness again allows glimpses of that peach. Drink while these fruity aromas are out in force.",89,Wolfberger 2014 Signature Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"A pleasant Bordeaux-style blend, this has a light dusting of milk chocolate, along with ripe fruit flavors of berry.",86,Cloudlift Cellars 2010 Halcyon Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"With its aromas of citrus and honey and its exuberant flavors of tropical fruit and toasted spice, this is both pretty and playful. Sweet but full of finesse, the wine has floral element that adds to its allure.",87,Wagner 2006 Ice Vidal Blanc (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This excellent wine has good concentration and pretty, fruit-sweet flavors of berry, cherry, and a splash of Dr. Pepper. It brings in elegant details of truffle and more of that pleasant cola character, and lingers through a generous finish.",90,Hawks View 2010 Hawks View Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),,,,
"This attractive, juicy wine is full of red fruit. It has strawberry and crisp red currant flavors as well as fine acidity. The result is a wine with good balance, richness, spice and tannins. Drink from 2019.",91,Clos Puy Arnaud 2015 Cuvée Les Ormeaux  (Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux),,,,
"There's a density and concentration to this wine that many will find appealing, a mix of leathery cigar box and unfussy notions of clove and currant. Silky-smooth on the palate, it's full bodied and robust, made entirely from Cabernet.",87,Black Stallion 2012 Limited Release Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Intense, nutty, yeasty aromas are briny and a touch creamy. This has a tight, pure, round palate with salty nectarine, apricot and nut flavors. Walnut oil and white pepper notes grace a direct, lively finish.",90,Delgado Zuleta NV Premium Fino Sherry (Jerez),,,,
"Very treacly aromas of overripe strawberry, brown sugar and maple syrup show on this dessert-like wine. It's very sweet on the palate, with sweet tea, prune and raisin flavors.",84,Dubost 2012 Blood of Jove Off-Dry Sangiovese (Adelaida District),,,,
"Shows a tightly wound structure, with big, hard tannins wrapped like a vise around fresh flavors of blackberries, cherries and cassis. There's a firm, minerally tang of iron at the core of this ageworthy wine. Better after 2015, when it should begin to mellow.",94,Joel Gott 2007 GOTT 7 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Delicate aromas recalling forest floor, aromatic herb and a floral note lead the way. The simple, rather diluted palate offers suggestions of red berry and a sprinkling of clove alongside bright acidity and fleeting tannins.",86,Fanti 2014  Rosso di Montalcino,,,,
"Score one for Sonoma Valley and this winery, as the '97 exceeds previous efforts. Lots of enticing deep-berry aromas touched up with leather, dill, and an array of other spices and herbs, even oregano. It's one of those rock-solid winners where the whole is more profound than the parts.",93,Carmenet 1997 Moon Mountain Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"Coming from a site best known for its Syrah, this wine brings high-toned aromas of violets, herb and dark fruit. The black-fruit flavors are rich yet supple, with fine-grained but occasionally toothy tannins providing support. Mocha flavors linger on the finish. It's a bit oak heavy but by and large carries it.",89,College Cellars 2014 Les Collines Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Based in the heart of the Haut-Médoc, this property has produced a wine that shows a dry character, with bitter extraction and too much wood. There are just hints of juicy fruit that will need time to come through. It could well stay dry and firm always.",84,Château du Retout 2013  Haut-Médoc,,,,
"Lively and fresh, this off-dry wine doles out ripe green apple, candied lemon slice and peach flavors alongside a frothy mousse. Bright acidity lifts the rich flavors.",87,Albino Armani NV 1607 Extra Dry  (Prosecco),,,,
"Rich cherry jam, dew-covered thyme and a touch of licorice show on this bottling from a vineyard on the eastern fringe of the Sta. Rita Hills. Round red fruits and an anise character show right away on the palate, which grows more complex with pencil lead, cinnamon and dried herbs.",91,Casa Dumetz 2014 John Sebastiano Grenache (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Slightly foxy on the nose, with rubbery aromas of cherry and cassis, this offers a tight, tannic palate with hard, elastic tannins. Flavors of cherry and cassis are pleasant, while the finish is ripe, warming and healthy.",89,Luberri 2011 Seis  (Rioja),,,,
"Ripe, brambly wood and plummy black-fruit flavors are concentrated in this dense, boldly structured Merlot, but shaded by tart green notes and staunch, grippy tannins.",85,Brotherhood 2010 New York Premium Selection Merlot (New York),,,,
"Straw gold in color, this is a fragrant, delicately aromatic wine. Made from organic fruit, it has pure white fruit and mineral flavors that are cut with intense youthful acidity. It needs to develop, so wait to drink until 2016.",88,Domaine Charles Frey 2011 Vieilles Vignes Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"This is a tight, mineral-textured wine that shows the potential of its rich black fruit, while keeping a close rein on its exuberance. The result is a wood-aged wine that offers considerable aging potential, so it keep for at least three years.",91,Iby 2009 Chevalier Reserve Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),,,,
"89–90. Barrel sample. This is a polished, new-wood flavored wine that has hints of mint as well as an herbal character. It's juicy and soft with black currant fruits lending an attractive aftertaste.",90,Chateau Desmirail 2012 Barrel Sample  (Margaux),,,,
"The difficult Xinomavro grape is wrangled well by talented winemaker Hatzis, though the wine feels slightly discordant. Aromas and flavors of olive, pepper, spice and tart berry offer intriguing layers, and the finish has  sweet spice.",84,Ioannis Hatzis 2004 Xinomavro (Amindeo),,,,
"Almost black in color, this is a Syrah to rival the most concentrated wines from the Rhône. It has weight, richness and power, its dark damson fruit flavors and tannins almost lost in all this intense fruit. Age for 3–4 years or drink now.",89,Château Bouissel 2009 Le Syrah de Bouissel Syrah (Vin de Pays du Comté Tolosan),,,,
"This impressive white from Sardinia opens with aromas of ripe orchard fruit, Mediterranean brush and a whiff of exotic fruit while the juicy palate doles out apricot, pineapple and candied citrus zest. An energizing mineral note brightens the creamy flavors.",91,Vigne Surrau 2015 Sciala Superiore  (Vermentino di Gallura),,,,
"From one of the most beautiful vineyards in the Prosecco Superiore area, this uses fruit sourced from romantically gnarled and twisted old vines. It has crystalline aromas of stone fruit, citrus, almond and crushed white mineral.",88,Ruggeri & C. 2010 Vecchie Viti Brut  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
"Sourced from a pair of Yamhill-Carlton vineyards, this steely effort opens with herbal beet-root aromatics. It's tight and a bit attenuated, with streaks of anise, tart berry and a touch of rhubarb. It slowly fleshes out with ample aeration.",88,The Forager 2015 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Almost black in color, the Hovey Petite is layered and concentrated, deep and soulful with flavors of lavender, berry and licorice segued by a coffee and tobacco kicker. A true Petite Sirah lovers' Petite Sirah.",91,Hovey 2008 Dalton Cuvee Petite Sirah (Calaveras County),,,,
"The label and the name of this wine just exude summer sun. It is tight, packed with acidity as well as bright red fruits. A citrus streak shoots through this light fruity wine. Drink now.",85,Les Maîtres Vignerons de la Presqu'île de Saint-Tropez 2016 Note Bleue Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"There's a modern, velvety touch to this blend of indigenous grapes (Magliocco, Montonico Nero and Greco) that are cultivated in one of the most isolated spots in southern Italy. Black cherry, chocolate and exotic spice notes lend a soft, silky feel to the wine.",88,Spadafora 2005 Telesio Riserva Red (Donnici),,,,
"Forceful from the opening, with floral notes, dark oak, shoe polish and char vying with black fruit aromas. Feels both lush and tough, with hard tannins poking through. Tastes of black fruits, cola and heavily toasted oak. Bittersweet on the finish; lusty and black but neither elegant nor light on its feet.",87,Finca Sophenia 2010 Reserve Malbec (Tupungato),,,,
"With its tough, gritty tannins and forward cherry, red currant, orange and raspberry flavors, this light-bodied Merlot will pair well with something savory and fatty.",87,Rutherford Grove 2006 Estate Merlot (Rutherford),,,,
"Starts out with nice aromas of ripe black fruits and toasty oak, however it drops down in class in the mouth, where pointed, jabby acidity causes tang and sourness. There are good berry and plum flavors to offset the tartness, but it finishes narrow and snappy. Pretty good but needs better balance and structure.",84,Acordeón 2009 Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"The centerpiece of Phil Sexton's current venture (he previously founded and sold both a brewery and a winery) is this single vineyard, from which he makes a Pinot Noir and this wine. The 2012 Chard is a bold yet elegant wine, filled with grilled pineapple and citrus fruit and framed by hints of toasted nuts, vanilla and graphite.",92,Giant Steps 2012 Sexton Vineyard Chardonnay (Yarra Valley),,,,
"This ripe wine from a very fine vintage in Bergerac, is fully structured while also having a fine black-currant fruitiness. Half-and-half Merlot and Cabernet Franc, it has a perfumed edge along with rich juicy acidity and fruits. Drink this fine wine from late 2017.",90,Château le Payral 2015 Red (Bergerac),,,,
"This easy-drinking blend of 33% Cabernet Franc, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Syrah and 17% Merlot opens with blue fruit, herb and spice aromas and leads to sweet, plush fruit and barrel flavors. Lightly grainy tannins provide structure.",88,The Conqueror 2014 Red (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"From right at the northern end of the sweep of Corton Grand Cru vineyards, this rich and complex wine is dense with smoky flavors as well as ripe blackberry fruit. It is solid, densely structured and powered minerality from the chalk in the soil. This is going to be a fine wine, so drink from 2019.",94,Capitain-Gagnerot 2011 Les Grandes Lolières  (Corton),,,,
"Easy aromas of bath oil and mixed tropical fruits are mellow, with nothing too defined. A fresh, lithe palate offers bright acidity and flavors of orange and grapefruit. Light acidity and tropical flavors create a friendly, simple finish.",87,Casa Montes 2014 Ampakama Estate Bottled Torrontés (San Juan),,,,
"A very pretty pale salmon color, this wine offers aromas of strawberry and cherry. The flavor concentration is wanting, not entirely able to hold it all together.",86,Mercer 2015 Spice Cabinet Vineyard Rosé (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"Scents of raspberries, flowers and exotic spices take the lead. The palate feels broad and untethered, featuring glossy tannins, balanced acids and a pliable finish.",87,Lovingston 2012 Josie's Knoll Cabernet Franc (Monticello),,,,
"This is a voluptuous Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon. It's soft, lush and extremely ripe, flooding the mouth with blackberry and cherry jam, cassis, cocoa, sweet fresh green herb and spice flavors. Best now and for a few years, before it sheds its fruit.",89,Eponymous 2005 MacAllister Vineyard Red (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"Smoky black-fruit aromas come with oaky influences of lemon rind, leather and black pepper along with minerality. A ripe, dense palate offers blackened flavors of plum and cassis, while a long, peppery, herbal and spicy finish is staunch but lush and oaky enough to give off rooty, lemony afternotes. Drink through 2021.",92,LTU 2011 Malbec (Valle de Uco),,,,
"Torre Pieve is a thick and creamy Chardonnay that is half aged in oak and half in stainless steel. These two methods give the wine structure and softness, but they also allow for the wine's natural fragrances to stay intact.",88,Santa Maria 2004 Torre Pieve Chardonnay (Veneto),,,,
"Bouscassé is the home estate of Alain Brumont, who also owns Château Montus. The wine may be six years old, but it is still dark and very firm. Dense tannins still show strongly over the tarry black fruits. Just wait and this wine will reveal its richness and smoothness while never losing concentration. Drink from 2018.",94,Alain Brumont 2009 Château Bouscassé Red (Madiran),,,,
"Situated two miles north of the castle of Blaye, this estate has produced an obviously wood-aged, heavily extracted wine. At this stage, this wine is all tannins, smoky acidity and structure. It will always be concentrated with wood, although this will soften.",85,Château Haut-Canteloup 2012  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,,,,
"A seamless commingling of cardamom and allspice around bursts of black cherry, this is a soft, dark and brooding wine, with an earthy soul and a spicy finish. Still young, it should take on further nuance over time, but is good to go right now.",91,Whetstone 2013 Jon Boat Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Nicely done, still young and sharp, but carrying interesting scents of lemon and lime rind, orange liqueur, and peppery spice. Excellent acidity buoys it up through a satisfying finish, with just a slim suggestion of warmth. Should continue to improve with another two or three years in the bottle.",89,Watermill 2010 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This combines ripe fruit flavors on the verge of being sweet with smoky, spicy oak accents and full body for a smooth and nicely complex taste experience. Aromas resemble black plums, the flavors are like black cherry, cinnamon and clove, and the finish lingers. The Grenache gets help from 18% Syrah.",89,Baiocchi Wines 2012 del Maggio Grenache-Syrah (Fair Play),,,,
"Yellow and green pear, leaves of lemon balm and juicy chunks of pineapple play on nose and palate. It's fresh, completely fruit-driven and provides lots of simple, honest joy.",89,Strauss 2013 Sämling 88 Classic Scheurebe (Steiermark),,,,
Mild aromas of apple and generic white fruits are friendly enough. This has a monotone citrusy mouthfeel and flavors of tangerine and grapefruit. A bit of stalky corn and hay flavor rises up on the finish.,84,Coto de Hayas 2013 Chardonnay (Campo de Borja),,,,
"Too oaky. Vanilla, buttered toast, caramel and sweet oak aromas dominate, and the wine turns sweet and extracted in the mouth. There are some decent blackberry and cherry flavors, but this is a pretty common wine.",84,B.R. Cohn 2007 Silver Label Cabernet Sauvignon (North Coast),,,,
"This is dry, full bodied and spicy. It's all about upfront flavors of citrus, green grass, hay, vanilla and honey, brightened with brisk acidity. Easy to drink with a wide range of foods.",88,Salvestrin 2011 LeBlanc Crystal Spring Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (St. Helena),,,,
"Pale salmon-colored, this is all Cabernet Franc. Aromas of herbs, flowers and green pepper are followed by bone-dry flavors that linger.",85,Dusty Cellars 2015 Rosé (Columbia Gorge (WA)),,,,
"This wine tastes taut, young and tannic, as ripe red and black cherry are held in by good acidity and strong tannins that give a bite to the mouthfeel. Made from 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot, it is full bodied but not heavy, feeling very vibrant and structured.",90,Trinity River 2014 Black Bear Cuvée Red,,,,
"A medium-sweet, spicy wine that offers good fresh guava flavor to balance the ripe texture. The finish is fresh. Screw cap.",85,Domaine Zinck 2008 Gewürztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"Molamatta is a very successful blend of some of Friuli's best varieties— Friulano, Ribolla Gialla and Pinot Bianco—that earns high praise for both aroma and mouthfeel. Citrus, pear, peach and almond nut notes are backed by a dense, creamy texture.",88,Marco Felluga 2007 Molamatta White (Collio),,,,
"This wine is a joy to drink with its aromas and flavors of coffee, dark chocolate, herbs and cherry. The opulently styled flavors are rich but well balanced, with chewy tannins backing it all up. It's irresistible.",92,Full Pull & Friends 2008 WWBDX Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"This is an unusual mix of disparate flavors—some spice, some mint, eucalyptus, lemon, pineapple—all with a rather bitter edge. It falls apart on the finish, with a chemical, paint thinner aftertaste.",82,Gresser NV Brut Sparkling (Willamette Valley),,,,
"One of two Tempranillos from Fenestra (the other from Lodi), the Livermore Valley version is bright, tasting of cherry spice, with good acidity. Nearing the finish the taste turns to toasty dark molasses; a nice wine overall.",87,Fenestra 2008 Tempranillo (Livermore Valley),,,,
"A signature wine for Girardin, this is powerful and rich, with apricot, quince and green plum fruits that are layered within the taut texture. A toast note rounds out this complex, ageworthy wine.",93,Domaine Vincent Girardin 2010 Les Caillerets Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet),,,,
"Prickly, sweaty aromas include matchstick and herbaceous green-fruit notes. In the mouth, this is chunky yet citrusy. Flavors of grassy citrus trend toward green, while a pithy, citric finish is bitter.",83,Verum 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Alto Valle del Río Negro),,,,
"This is a bit more punchy and pungent than Zeal's Reserve bottling, but it still offers considerable value. There's ample weight and just enough citrusy fruit to support the sweaty, nettle-y aromatics and herbal flavors. Try it with fresh herb-laden dishes like ceviches or steamed mussels.",88,Zeal 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,
"A solid rendition of Verdejo with apple and pear aromas along with basic minerality. The palate is standard and firm, with good acidity pushing apple and citrus flavors. Perfectly competent but not showing the nuances and higher qualities that would justify a $17 outlay.",86,El Pensador 2009 Verdejo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León),,,,
"A stacked nose includes aromas of tomato, herbs, cocoa, molasses and berry fruits. The saturated palate announces that this is a big one, while spicy flavors of plum and berry fruits are slightly herbal on a finish with excellent feel and flow. Drink this blend of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Carmenère through 2021.",92,Santa Rita 2013 Triple C Red (Maipo Valley),,,,
"Fresh red fruit flavors are framed with interesting and lifting notes of savory herbs, whole tobacco leaf and a touch of milk chocolate. It's juicy and lively with fine tannins and a mouthwatering finish.",87,Gamla 2009 The Reserve Merlot (Galilee),,,,
"Earthy, raspberry-like aromas, nondescript ripe fruit and herb flavors, and a rounded texture make this a serviceable house wine.",82,Cartlidge & Browne 2013 Pinot Noir (North Coast),,,,
"Young, tannic and juicy, filled with sweet blackberry, cherry and cassis flavors, and well oaked, having been aged in 100% new French barrels. Those are the raw facts. The wine itself shows the pedigree of this fine estate, and will no doubt pick up bottle nuances over the years. But it seems to lack the precision of the great 2001, 2003 and 2004 vintages. Try after 2012.",92,Shafer 2006 Hillside Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),,,,
"Sonas is half Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon, and the rest Cabernet Franc. It has graham cracker scents and flavors, and a soft, smooth mouthfeel. The red plum fruit is swathed in plenty of mocha flavors; a most enjoyable, unpretentious wine.",88,O•S Winery 2010 Sonas Red (Yakima Valley),,,,
"A 100% varietal wine from a warm region in a warm year, this discloses a thick, rich and syrupy aspect to the layers of soft tannin and dense blackberry fruit. It calls for pairing with meaty dishes.",86,Summers 2012 Petite Sirah (Knights Valley),,,,
"Smoked pork, roasted fennel, dried sage, oregano and plum fruit combine for an elegant and inviting nose on this blend of 84% Syrah, 12% Mourvèdre and 4% Grenache. Savory flavors steadily emerge on the palate, with blackberry compote, roasted beef, pepper, leather, campfire smoke and vanilla elements.",92,Summerwood 2013 Diosa Red (Adelaida District),,,,
"The bouquet on this blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah is toasty and elevated, a clear invitation to dig in. In the mouth, the flow is silky smooth and just snappy enough, with finely etched acidity pushing raspberry, plum, herb and cocoa flavors. This is excellent in every way; drink now–2018.",92,Enrique Mendoza 2008 Santa Rosa Reserva Red (Alicante),,,,
"Avvoltore offers a soft, supple texture and bright, round fruit. It's a perfect starting point for those who may want to learn more about the many wines of Maremma.",91,Morisfarms 2007 Avvoltore  (Maremma),,,,
"Abnormally high pyrazines give this a sharp, oily nose. This feels and tastes much like it smells; the mouth is sharp and angular, while sour grapefruit flavors and oily bitterness on the finish suggest green Sauvignon Blanc.",82,Zarate 2015 Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"This Grandeau wine is tight and firm. The tannins are a serious component of a wine that will have more fruitiness as it develops. It just escapes being over-extracted, leaving a crisp aftertaste.",85,Château Lauduc 2015 Classic  (Bordeaux),,,,
"This wine is crisp, with a mineral texture that is tight and allows for considerable citric acidity. A riper background conveys rich apple flavors and a taut, nervy, steely character. Drink this concentrated wine from 2017.",91,Domaine Trouillet 2014  Pouilly-Fuissé,,,,
"This is unusual for a reserve, in that it's lower in alcohol than the regular bottling, and more cases were produced. The light fruits and herbs—green apple and lemon verbena in particular—are highlighted with tarragon and citrus peel. The complexity compensates for the just-on-the-edge ripeness, and time in 20% new oak adds a buttery note to the finish.",89,Anam Cara 2013 Nicholas Estate Reserve Chardonnay (Chehalem Mountains),,,,
"Grenache is being treated with more and more respect around Australia, which means more bottlings are reaching the variety's potential. Gentle herbal notes intertwine with bunches of black cherries and a hint of vanilla in this medium- to full-bodied example. Hints of red peppercorn capture a unique combination of fruit and spice, while the finish is long and crisp.",94,Langmeil 2013 The Fifth Wave Grenache (Barossa),,,,
"Here's a Syrah with bursting aromas of mature blueberry, cherry, spice and smoked bacon. The wine is full, round and generous with a supple feel and soft concentration. Pair it with lamb or roasted pork.",88,Caruso & Minini 2006 Terre di Giumara Syrah (Sicilia),,,,
"Iugiter delivers berry, cola and licorice aromas in front of a racy, acid-rich palate that's linear in shape. Flavors of cherry, plum and raspberry are snappy and reflect a cool vintage, while the finish is equally racy, juicy and full of acidic snap.",89,La Conreria d'Scala Dei 2008 Iugiter Red (Priorat),,,,
"Spicy plum aromas are oaky but fail to hold firm as the nose becomes more earthy as it opens. The palate has a creamy, forced-oak feel. Flavors of wood grain, plastic and black fruit finish sweet and minty in flavor, but also lactic in feel.",84,MontGras 2013 Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"A tight, stalky wine, showing black currant and dark plum fruits, intense acidity and a dry, tannic character. It feels light, without great density, very up front and fruity.",85,Château de Cornemps 2011  Bordeaux Supérieur,,,,
"This frankly sweet sparkler smells like toasted almonds and pistachios, and tastes rich, round, floral and nutty. It has a good, fine bead, nice balance from the wine's acidity, and feels smooth and broad in texture.",88,Korbel NV Sweet Cuvée Sparkling (California),,,,
"Always an eye-opening bottling, this blends 50% Sangiovese with 50% Syrah. This vintage shows cooked blackberries, baked plums, balsamic vinaigrette and black rocks on the nose. The palate is juicy and energetic, blending dark fruit with bright acidity, coffee and caramel flavors, with strong tannins for structure.",90,Stolpman 2013 La Croce Sangiovese-Syrah (Ballard Canyon),,,,
"Beaulieu does what it's done so well for so long, producing a Cabernet that reflects real Napa character, at a good price. The wine is dry and fancy, with an elegant structure of acids and tannins housing classic black currant, herb and cedar flavors. With production of 43,000 cases, it's easy to find.",87,Beaulieu Vineyard 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"The dark color tells you right away this is no ordinary vin de pays. Then you sniff it and get cedar, black currants and blackberries. The finish has juicy acidity and dusty tannins, suggesting a couple years' cellaring may be warranted. Impressive.",88,Mas de Guiot 1999 Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Vin de Pays du Gard),,,,
The wine is dominated by perfumed Malvasia. That gives the wine its deliciously scented apples and pears. The texture—lightly mineral—adds a piquancy to this ready-to-drink wine.,86,Casca Wines 2016 Cabo da Roca White (Douro),,,,
"The Gunderloch wines are among the best from Rheinhessen, even their non-site-specific wines like the Diva spätlese. Aromas of bergamot, pear and fresh greens give way to ripe pineapple, citrus and herb flavors. It's fresh and zippy, offering a lot of refreshment value in an off-dry style.",89,Gunderloch 2005 Diva Spätlese Riesling (Rheinhessen),,,,
"Despite displaying less power and weight than the top wine from Rimauresq, this wine shows a delicious sense of harmony and crispness. Peach and lemon flavors are underscored by firm minerality. Good value.",89,Rimauresq 2007 Petit Rimauresq Grenache-Cinsault Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"Plump blueberries, slate, gravel, turned earth and a light fennel character show on this wine, which comes in a custom bottle exclusive to the appellation's estate-grown Syrahs. The palate shows a lively acidity that briskly expresses the black pepper, black currant and espresso flavors.",90,Rusack 2013 Estate Syrah (Ballard Canyon),,,,
"Rounded notes of Bosc pear flesh and peel play softly on nose and palate. There is a very pleasant, slightly bitter phenolic edge, reminiscent of marzipan and a slight sweetness. Together they make for an intriguing and moreish contrast against a fluid, textured palate. The finish is off dry and has that marzipan edge.",93,René Muré 2013 Clos Saint Landelin Vorbourg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"This Lake County Sauvignon Blanc from a Lodi-based producer shows off the North Coast appellation well, with pear compote and marshmallow on the nose, followed by a taste of apricot fuzz and oak, medium in body with a long-lasting finish.",86,Van Ruiten 2012 Rooster Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County),,,,
"An interesting and different Syrah, and a promising release from a young brand to watch. The wine is very high in acidity, giving it a firm grip. The flavors are tremendously rich, offering a tsunami of blackberries, currants, plum sauce, baker's chocolate, leather, grilled meat, pine nut and black pepper. It's youthfully aggressive right now in tannins, and needs time for all the serious parts to marry. Leave it alone until sometime in 2010, and it should haul for years after.",94,Heintz 2007 Syrah (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Zinfandel by another name, this appealing wine has cola and cherry aromas, plus snappy cherry-candy and sweet prune flavors. It's full-bodied and has lively acidity, a silky texture and lingering finish.",87,Rosa d'Oro 2012 Primitivo (Clear Lake),,,,
"With a significant proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, this is a solid, tannic wine. It is also rich, complex and fruity. Fermentation in open lagares gives extra fruitiness, soft extract and great acidity. Drink from 2017.",91,Casal da Coelheira 2011 Mythos Red (Tejo),,,,
"Ripe and full-bodied in pineapple, lemon, pear and green apple flavors, this Chardonnay also shows a good coating of oak, as well as a blast of acidity. It's not terribly complicated, but clean and brisk, and the price isn't bad.",87,Handley 2009 Chardonnay (Anderson Valley),,,,
"Cabernet Franc often shows more stem and herb than either Merlot or Cabernet Sauvignon, but here there is little else to hang your hat on. Hard, chewy and tannic, it might best be drunk with a grilled steak, so those tough tannins are put to work.",83,Cave B 2008 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Given the price this is pretty good stuff. It's plush and offers enough body and ripe fruit to offset the fact that there isn't a whole lot of structure or backbone. For a soft, tasty plum-and-herb style of Carmenère, however, it gets the job done.",85,Simone 2006 Carmenère (Maule Valley),,,,
"Perfumey in lemon curd, this is a focused and fairly lean Chardonnay, crisp in lemony acidity and classic wet stone. Mango and lime surround a core of refreshing, intriguing ginger, and the palate offers creamy softness. A bite of fresh pear lingers on the finish.",94,Dutton-Goldfield 2012 Dutton Ranch Walker Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Green Valley),,,,
"This is a delightfully fresh Prosecco from the Fontana Vecia cru with sharp mineral tones backed by orange blossom, white pepper and stone fruit. It offers creamy foam in the mouth and a full palate of peachy flavors. Serve it at outdoor lunches or at cocktail hour.",87,Colesel NV Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene),,,,
"Clean, fresh, presentable aromas of red fruits are easy to like. This is balanced and offers just enough body to support cherry, nectarine and citrus flavors. The finish is crisp and lingers nicely.",87,Artadi 2013 Artazuri Garnacha Rosé (Navarra),,,,
"Full-bodied, soft and ultra-ripe, this six-variety blend, based on Zinfandel and Carignane, is sweet and rustic. It has jammy flavors of wild berries, molasses, chocolate and pepper spice.",85,Trinitas 2006 Old Vine Cuvee Red (Contra Costa County),,,,
"Zesty, waxy aromas of lime peels and crushed stones belie the bright grapefruit and tangerine flavors in this dry, yet deeply mineral-laden Riesling. It's softly textured on the palate, with bright yet lenient acidity that leads into a lingering lemon-lime finish.",90,August Kesseler 2011 Junge Reben Kabinett Trocken Riesling (Rheingau),,,,
"Showing freshness as well as sweet jelly fruit, this has a young feel to it. An edge of bitter chocolate and spice is layered over tannins that are not yet integrated.",87,Ramos-Pinto 2004 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),,,,
"Though the alcohol lists at 14.3%, this seems thin and flat. There's little depth to the one-dimensional, green fruit flavors, a hint of plastic and some burn in the finish.",84,Silvan Ridge 2008 Reserve Viognier (Rogue Valley),,,,
"Hefty and rubbery on the bouquet, with black-fruit aromas and some dustiness. The palate is fresh feeling, with full acidity and a mildly stretched set of lively berry and roasted flavors. Comes up a bit short and hollow on the finish, but good all totaled.",85,Ochoa 2008 Garnacha-Tempranillo Red (Navarra),,,,
"A small-production wine for the producer, this heavy-hitting release is robust and meaty, built with plenty of structure and a full body. Pomegranate and strawberry fill out the fruit components, while a touch of rose petal dances in the background, the wine taking time ultimately to unwind.",87,Beaulieu Vineyard 2013 Maestro Collection Ranch No. 5 Pinot Noir (Carneros-Napa Valley),,,,
"Compost, tomato leaf and gritty berry aromas control the nose on this underripe and tannic Rioja. Stalky flavors of tomato and berry fruits are definitively herbal, while the finish is toasty due to oak covering but also rough and stalky.",86,Marqués de Cáceres 2008 Gaudium  (Rioja),,,,
"Softly tannic and dry, with a punch of acidity, this Cab has fully developed flavors of red and black currants, raisins, mocha and cinnamon spice. Drink it now with barbecue.",85,Martin & Weyrich 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"A 50/50 blend of Pommard and Dijon 777 grapes, this is the biggest, brightest and juiciest vintage to date for this cuvée. The concentrated raspberry fruit carries a touch of sweetness, set against refined, proportionate tannins. The mouthfeel is smooth and the finish chocolaty, with enough concentration to drink well into the mid-2020s.",92,Anam Cara 2012 Mark VII Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),,,,
"Valpolicella Vigneto Sant'Urbano offers very bright, albeit, one-dimensional aromas of red cherry and blueberry. The mouthfeel is crisp and smooth and the wine promises to pair with light meat or pasta.",86,Speri 2007 Vigneto Sant'Urbano  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore),,,,
"Steely and tight, this is a mineral-driven wine. With its vibrant acidity and tense texture, it is a classic Chardonnay that will fill out slowly and evolve favorably with time. Beneath the tension and forward acidity is a rich wine, though it needs time to show it. Drink from 2020.",94,Chanson Père et Fils 2013 Les Folatières Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet),,,,
"Here is a cheerful and fragrant Sauvignon with aromas of citrus, exotic fruit and natural rubber. The wine has good dimension and personality and a compact feel in the mouth that ends with bright freshness.",87,Ca'Tullio 2007 Sdricca di Manzano Sauvignon (Colli Orientali del Friuli),,,,
"Light bodied and lightly flavored, this wine is a good, basic meal-time beverage. It is dry, nicely tart and nearly neutral in aroma and flavor.",84,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (California),,,,
"For the price, you get a very nice expression of California Pinot Noir. The wine is dry, silky and spicy, and surprisingly rich, with flavors of raspberry and cherry pie filling",86,Mirassou 2008 Pinot Noir (California),,,,
"While savory and smoky on the nose with subdued aromas of apple and pineapple, this dry yet fruity Furmint from Slovenia offers a host of bright tropical flavors. Full bodied with a bracingly high acidity that's a tad off-balance, it's a refreshing wine for everyday.",83,Verus Vineyards 2009 Furmint (Štajerska),,,,
"This wine, produced by the team of Château du Glana, is big, bold, solid and very firmly structured. With weight, richness, black plum skins and dark tannins, it's a fine wine for aging, so give it at least 6–7 years.",90,Château du Glana 2010 Terre du Lion  (Saint-Julien),,,,
"Reduced on the nose, and showing strong barrel influence, this is a tangy, grippy, weighty wine. It's ripe and tightly wound, a sign of the vintage and most likely, vineyard site. Needing time to open in the glass, it unwinds slowly.",87,Willowbrook 2013 Kaufman Sunnyslope Vineyard Clone 777 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain),,,,
"A very grapey earthy aroma and a flavor like apple jelly make this full-bodied wine a little unusual. It's not what's normally expected from a California wine, but a decent drink.",83,AuburnJames 2016 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills Lake County),,,,
"Ripe black cherry and a lick of herbs are wrapped up in a solid structure of balanced acidity and tannins, with a slightly savory finish. The oak is prominent, as is the ripe fruit, but for the price, this is the kind of bargain Shiraz Australia once built its Stateside reputation on.",86,Banrock Station 2015 Shiraz (South Eastern Australia),,,,
"Scented impressions of ripe pear and aloe vera pervade this wine. The palate shows texture and more fruit than you might expect from slender Sylvaner. The finish is brisk, clean and taut.",89,Boeckel 2015 Vieilles Vignes Sylvaner (Alsace),,,,
"Slicks of butter, cream and spice in this unusual barrel-fermented Gewürztraminer may evoke divisive love-it-or-hate-it reactions, but the intensity and quality of this deeply concentrated wine is hard to deny. It's gorgeously fruity and floral, bursting of honeysuckle, rose petals and melons, yet elegantly balanced in acidity and alcohol. It's deeply penetrating, with reverberating waves of bright citrus notes and a lingering tea-toned astringency. Drinks well now, but should be an interesting wine to mature over the next decade.",91,Keuka Spring 2013 Umlaut Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Pale in color, the aromas are quite light, making you strain into the glass to get at them. The cranberry and herb flavors bring a sense of purity and appeal, with the oak dialed way back. One wants more aromatically but the palate delivers enjoyment. It should perform well at the dinner table.",87,Wilridge 2015 Angiolina Vineyard Grenache (Yakima Valley),,,,
"A young, fresh blend of Arinto and Fernão Pires, the wine is fruity, light and with a crisp, bright aftertaste. Drink now.",84,Quinta do Casal Monteiro 2015 White (Tejo),,,,
"Rusty in color, this maturing Tannat-led blend smells warm, earthy, raisiny and like molasses. It's a bit wiry, rough and acidic on the palate, while raisin, baking spice and woody flavors end short and pile on with raisiny ripeness. Drink now.",87,Familia Deicas 2009 Preludio Barrel Select Lot N°92 Red (Juanico),,,,
"Aged in 100% new French oak, aromas of roasted coffee bean, herb, char and dark fruit give way to lightly grainy dark-fruit flavors. The wood seems a bit primary at present but it still brings a lot of appeal. Give it some time to integrate.",91,Adams Bench 2014 The V Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"With its flavors of butterscotch, vanilla, pineapple and peach jam, this is a rich wine that will appeal to fans of creamy, oaky Chardonnays.",87,Patz & Hall 2010 Hudson Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros),,,,
"This is an attractive wine with fresh tones of stone fruit, almond and a slight touch of vanilla. The Friulano grape exhibits very good structure and texture, which makes it a natural pairing partner to a wide range of foods.",87,Volpe Pasini 2007 Zuc di Volpe Friulano (Colli Orientali del Friuli),,,,
"Lovely perfumed fruit with delicious, soft sweetness, raspberry and sweet plums. The acidity attractively cuts through this ripeness.",89,Chanson Père et Fils 2007 Les Dominodes Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),,,,

"As the tannins soften, this wine will become rich with generous fruitiness. Blackberry flavors and acidity are developing well to give a wine that is full and will be well balanced. Drink this Ducourt family wine from 2016.",87,Château La Rose du Pin 2013  Bordeaux Supérieur,,,,
"Polkura's first value-priced Syrah opens with earthy black-fruit aromas that are thick yet not precise in character. The palate feels wide, chunky and not particularly elegant. Flavors of baking spice and herbal blackberry finish peppery and chunky, with a touch of resiny oak.",87,Polkura 2012 Lote D Syrah (Marchigue),,,,
"This is firm, dusty and seemingly built for the cellar. Toasty, cedary and chocolaty oak frames dark fruit, yet it remains fresh in character, not dried or overripe. The finish is long, tannic and reminiscent of fine Bordeaux. Try after 2020.",93,Vasse Felix 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River),,,,
"Half of the wine was fermented with native yeasts, and 30% saw new oak. What shines is the juicy, fresh, delicious fruit—a jumble of raspberries and cherries—plus the finish, which hangs deliciously.",89,Stoller 2010 JV Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),,,,
"There's a healthy 17% Cabernet Sauvignon and 1% Cabernet Franc in this wine, which is classically structured in red fruit, soft oak and peppery spice. Its cedar notes speak to the Cab within, while the overall texture and breadth of the wine is lengthy, food-ready and impressive.",90,Frog's Leap 2013 Merlot (Rutherford),,,,
"Part of this wine was barrel fermented, which gives it a creamy, spicy richness. The rest was raised in stainless steel, preserving vital fruitiness and acidity. The result is a richly powerful, interesting wine, vibrant in citrus, fig, melon and spice flavors, that finishes thoroughly dry. Sommeliers should note this wine, not only for its inexpensive price but for its versatility and sophistication.",89,Robert Hall 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles),,,,
"With its tough tannins, this solid wine also shows dark fruits and black plum skins, finishing with fresher acidity.",87,Château Coutelin Merville 2011  Saint-Estèphe,,,,
"A touch of petrol lends a slick, mineral sheen to this lusciously peachy, yet zesty dry Riesling. Delicately textured yet mouth-filling, it finishes long on a lingering lime-zest note. Enjoy now for its youthful, primary nature",88,Von Der Leyen 2013 Riesling (Nahe),,,,
"Stalky, rustic aromas of plum and animal hide lead to a round, solid palate with plum, cherry, herb and spice flavors that are simple as a whole. A lasting but largely fruitless finish is more oaky than anything.",87,Altocedro 2013 Año Cero Malbec (La Consulta),,,,
"Incorporating a small amount of Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a floral Merlot, with notes of violet counterpointed by barbecue smokiness and earth. Big, rich tannins are dry and robust, veering on full bodied, before the acidity in the wine pulls things back into balance.",90,Trefethen 2012 Merlot (Oak Knoll District),,,,
"A single vineyard wine with the typical spice and richness of Rotgipfler, a rare grape found only in Thermenregion, south of Vienna. Just off dry, so soft and warm in character, it has ripe pear, lychee and kiwi fruit flavors. Ready to drink, or age another year or two.",91,Johanneshof Reinisch 2011 Satzing Rotgipfler (Thermenregion),,,,
"This is very aromatic, with minerality vying with fruit and tense acidity. This complex wine has an austere side, both rich and structured that will soften in a couple of years.",90,Domaine Laporte 2010 Le Rochoy  (Sancerre),,,,
"Lodi-based Michael David turns to Lodi, Sonoma's Dry Creek Valley and Lake County to craft this white wine, mostly Sauvignon Blanc with a drop of Sémillon too. Ready for a summer's day with subtle Mandarin orange, mango and lime notes, it finishes quick and crisp.",86,Michael David 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (California),,,,
"This wine is from a blend of four vineyard sites, including the single-vineyard-designated Silver Pines, chilled by Petaluma Gap air. Clear and light in color, the wine is vibrant and earthy in dark cherry, clove and petulant Asian spice. The tannins are well integrated and soft, rounded in forest floor and toasted oak.",93,Bailiwick 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"A bit foxy and jumpy at first, and then familiar aromas of berry and plum settle in. The palate is jammy and tannic, while flavors of berries and currants seem roasted. Tobacco and olive notes are present on the chewy, weighty, textured finish.",85,Porta 2008 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Aconcagua Valley),,,,
"Although the nose of this blend of Tempranillo, Syrah and Grenache starts out subtly, it opens into deeper aromas of blueberry, soy and char. The palate is dry and tightly wound, its mineral flavors of graphite, slate and lava rock leading to blue fruit and tobacco touches on the finish.",88,Trenza 2012 Tinto Red (San Luis Obispo County),,,,
"Creamy and crisp, this lovely wine is delicately scented with yellow apple and mineral. The flavors carry over to the linear, elegant palate along with a note of pear while vibrant acidity lends plenty of verve.",90,Erste Neue 2014 Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige),,,,
"Berry and rubber band are the lead aromas. The wine has texture and lasting freshness despite being more than a year old already. It's medium in size and body, with red fruit and apple skin flavors. Solid, fruity and just lively enough.",86,Finca El Origen 2010 Malbec Rosé (Mendoza),,,,
"Valpolicella Vigneto Sant'Urbano offers very bright, albeit, one-dimensional aromas of red cherry and blueberry. The mouthfeel is crisp and smooth and the wine promises to pair with light meat or pasta.",86,Speri 2007 Vigneto Sant'Urbano  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore),,,,
"From the producer's dry-farmed estate vineyard, this elegantly powerful wine opens in cracked black pepper, dried herb and cedar, continuing the peppery theme on the palate. Black cherry and high-toned blackberry combine with the more savory elements, with an overall softness of texture and lengthy finish.",93,Tres Sabores 2012 Zinfandel (Rutherford),,,,
"This Cab Franc is rich and ripe in red and black currants and cherries, with a mocha sweet earthiness leading to sweet oak buttered cinnamon toast and a slight caramelization. It's dry and smooth in tannins. Best of all is an acidity and minerality that lend structure. Drink now–2015.",90,Frazier 2009 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),,,,
"With rich tiers of blackberries, cherries, currants and sandalwood, this Petite Sirah also has a salt and pepper meatiness to it, like a great hamburger. Its sturdy tannins will play well with roasts. Should hold for some years, but if you open it now, give it plenty of time to breathe.",88,RustRidge 2007 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),,,,
"Aromas of white clover, carnation and lime leaf lead the nose of this crisp and easy white. Fruity tones of underripe peach and melon rind unfold on the palate, coupled with zippy lime-like acidity and a saline streak that lifts the close. Drink up.",85,Saint-Jean des Sources 2015 Picpoul (Languedoc),,,,
"Now mature, this smoky, wood-aged wine is rich and complex. It has firm and dry tannins that are typical of the Tannat although these are a part of a solid, dark wine. The aftertaste brings out a perfumed, rich side that is attractive. The wine is ready to drink.",91,Domaine de Gensac 2008 Terre à Terre Tannat (Gers),,,,
"This is a lightly smoky wine from vineyards in the hills behind the Côte de Beaune. It is spicy with a touch of wood as well as red-cherry fruitiness. The wine needs to age a few months, so drink from late 2018.",87,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2016 Les Belles Roches  (Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Beaune),,,,
"Funky and sweet smelling, with odd fruit aromas and unfamiliar spice notes. The palate has a snappy, clacky feel and flavors of red fruits, citrus, herbs, tomato and oregano. Sharp on the finish, and overall it tastes like pizza.",83,Terra Andina 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley),,,,
"The vintage was very kind to Chardonnay, and the balance shows in the fantastically ripe, exotic pineapple tart, lemondrop candy, buttered toast, sandalwood and sweet, dusty spice flavors of this immaculately dry, crisp wine. It's strong and impressive now, and not particularly subtle, but should have a narrow window of near perfection. 2011–2013.",94,Gary Farrell 2007 Rochioli-Allen Vineyards Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This is a textured, dense and concentrated selection that has notes of white fruits and white flowers. It's a wine for medium-term aging.",88,Albert Bichot 2010  Savigny-lès-Beaune,,,,
"Even before you smell it, you can tell this is a sweetie from the old-gold color and thick texture. Aromas of vanilla custard and crème brûlée, apricot preserves, orange-blossom honey and vanilla. Flavors are extravagantly fruity and sweet, with a honeyed aftertaste that lingers. It could use a bit more acidity to balance out all that sugar.",86,Geyser Peak 1998 Reserve Late Harvest Riesling (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"A simple Zinfandel, with sweet, spicy pie filling berry and cherry flavors. It has some extra features of minerality that are interesting, but it's still fundamentally one-dimensional.",83,Wilson 2009 Ellie's Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Made with organic grapes, this charming young red has a delightful fragrance of blue flowers and woodland berries. The zesty palate doles out crunchy red berry and a hint of white pepper accompanied by lively acidity.",87,Salcheto 2013  Chianti,,,,
"Complicated scents of bacon, wet leather, organ meats and damp dirt open this funky wine from Santa Barbara County pioneer Richard Longoria. On the palate, the forest floor and gaminess persist alongside heavy herbal notes, a unique muskiness and smooth but present tannins.",87,Longoria 2011 Tempranillo (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Truffle, leather, berry, grilled herb, oak and a whiff of game lead the nose. The dense, taut palate doles out Morello cherry, raspberry compote, baking spice and a hint of pipe tobacco alongside close-grained tannins. A bitter sage note closes the firm finish. Drink 2018–2023.",90,Rattalino 2013 Quarantadue  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Pretty fierce in acidity, but flavorful enough, with plenty of raspberry and cherry jam, accented with cola and spices. Drink now, after decanting.",85,Perbacco Cellars 2007 Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),,,,

"A typically light Brouilly that is fresh, full of cherry acidity and soft tannins. It has a juicy element, lightly herbal and with stalky, tight fruit at the end. Drink now.",85,Château de Pizay 2012 Château de Saint Lager  (Brouilly),,,,
"While a touch weightier in mouthfeel, Schloss Vollrad's standard-label bottling, this boasts the same peach and pink-grapefruit intensity that's so appealing on the Kabinett. Edged by a lacy fray of sugar, it's lip-smackingly sweet, but irresistably quaffable and neatly balanced by a streak of tangerine acidity. Drink now through 2020.",89,Schloss Vollrads 2014 Riesling (Rheingau),,,,
"The aromas pop on this 100% varietal, with notes of dark plum, mountain blueberry, vanilla and cream. The flavors are smooth and sultry, mixing fruit and barrel with a plush feel and a lightly astringent finish. The variety is hard to get but it delivers a lot of enjoyment.",89,Tamarack Cellars 2015 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Flavors are followed by intense crisp citrus fruit. This is a lively style, very fresh with a delicious tang of orange zest, light caramel and vibrant acidity.",90,Domaine de la Chapelle 2008 Madame Noly  (Saint-Véran),,,,
"From the intensely steep Monts Damnés vineyard, this wine is rich and full of ripe tropical and citrus fruits, with a tight line in steely minerality. It's still too structured and firm, so drink from 2016.",94,Domaine Vincent Delaporte 2013 Monts Damnés  (Sancerre),,,,
"Dark and racy, with a Northern Rhône-style aroma of black pepper, cedar and black currants, but there's nothing Rhône-like about the flavor. It's distinctly California, with soft, sweetly ripe tannins bursting with blackberry jam, black currants, anise, vanilla and sweet oak flavors. The wine is fully dry. Absolutely first-rate Syrah.",95,Novy 2005 Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Lifted and vibrant, this expressive Syrah shows great life and freshness. The red berry and blueberry fruit backbone balances the creamy vanilla and sweet smoke frame. Raspberry, cocoa-dusted cherry, coffee and anise flavors fill the round mouth with a lush, velvety texture; black pepper and baking spice notes remain through the long finish.",91,Golan Heights Winery 2007 Yarden Yonatan Vineyard Syrah (Galilee),,,,
"Rondineto is a slightly caramelized expression of Pinot Grigio that offers tones of butterscotch, candied apricot and sweet honey. In the mouth, this Italian white is creamy and thick.",84,Fattoria Giuseppe Savini 2011 Rondineto Pinot Grigio (Colli Aprutini),,,,
"This 100% varietal is blended from a mix of excellent vineyards, principally Candy Mountain. It delivers stiff, tart, elegantly proportioned red fruits, set in a frame of citrus and steel. Barrel aging in one-third new oak adds scents of cedar and spice.",92,L'Ecole No. 41 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Yellow plum, sweet apple and juicy pear form an appetizing, aromatic trinity. Those apple flavors, some of them fresh, some bruised, some baked, become the central theme of the lemon-focused palate. With some time, honeyed notes come to the fore and suggest that many things still lie hidden in this fruit-laden Riesling. The finish is dry, the entire wine is focused and still taut. It's delicious now but will reward cellaring.Drink 2015–2025.",92,Boeckel 2013 Brandluft Vieilles Vignes Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"Very light in color, this bottling is one of the first submitted in the vintage. It offers fresh lemon-lime soda, tangerine skin, lime zest and pear-blossom aromas. There's a touch of sweet to the palate, with poached apple, pear cider, tangerine juice and orange-skin flavors. The honeyed element grows quickly as the wine sits open.",88,Joyce 2015 Tondre Grapefield Riesling (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Although the Chestnut Hill selection from Lemelson remained stubbornly hard and tight after opening, it rewarded extra patience with added depth and polish. The red fruits showed the most concentration of all the 2009s from this producer, and oak accents of cinnamon and toast were beautifully integrated. A seamless middle and exceptional length mark this wine as one to cellar.",93,Lemelson 2009 Chestnut Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This opens with delicate aromas reminiscent of white spring flower and a whiff of orchard fruit. On the palate, fresh acidity underscores creamy Bartlett pear and nectarine zest that lead to a clean, bright finish.",89,Schiopetto 2015 Pinot Grigio (Collio),,,,
"This bottling from a vineyard west of the Sta. Rita Hills by David and Anna deLaski explores the lower ripeness, exotically spiced range of Pinot Noir. Aromas of tart boysenberry, sour hibiscus, sumac and white pepper show on the nose. The palate picks up a bit more viscosity to deliver cranberry, Kalamata olive and cardamom flavors.",90,Solminer 2015 Duvarita Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Superripe and flamboyant, as you'd expect from the vintage, bursting with plum, blackberry, tobacco, sage and green olive flavors, and the tannins are a wonder. Velvety soft and luxurious in the mouth. A trace of acidic bitterness in the finish loses a few points.",90,Jamieson Canyon 1999 Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"Golden honey and banana flambée aromas make for an inviting if quite rich introduction to this wine from Kamasutra-themed LXV. Baked apple and poached peach flavors meet with vanilla dust and salted caramel on the palate, which is rich and creamy with a balance of tension.",87,LXV 2015 Summer Satine Viognier (Paso Robles),,,,
"With fruit from coastal Leyda in the blend, this Curicó wine surprises with crisp, focused understatement. The mouth is fresh but basic, with juicy, perky apple and citrus flavors followed by a crisp, slightly pithy finish. Overachieves in the context of  Echeverria's past Sauvignon Blancs.",89,Echeverria 2010 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Molina),,,,
"Pristine apple, pear and peach are marked with hints of nuts and crushed stones in this sprightly yet deeply complex auslese. It's lacy and sheer on the palate, yet lime and lemon tones are bracing. Hold till 2020 to allow the subtleties to intensify.",94,Joh. Jos. Prüm 2012 Zeltinger Sonnenuhr Auslese Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"The first impression is of strawberry preserves, not jammy but with the texture and loose-knit fruit flavor of a fruit spread. Behind it are lip-licking veins of licorice and cola, finishing with dusty tannins. Chehalem dust? Don't rule it out.",91,J. Christopher 2010 Lia's Vineyard Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),,,,
"This is a richly structured wine with great tannins and ripe black fruits. It's also a dense wine, from an estate managed by Georges Vigouroux. The firm tannins and the smoky character show this wine's great potential. Drink from 2020.",90,Georges Vigouroux 2014 Château Léret Monpezat Malbec (Cahors),,,,

"A bright star within Hudson-Chatham's strong lineup of red wine, this Pinot Noir offers loads of fresh pristine black-cherry and berry flavors.

Drink now through 2022.",90,Hudson-Chatham 2014 Columbia County Pinot Noir (Hudson River Region),,,,

"Blackberry juice mixes with graphite, cedar and dried herbs on this bottling by Fred Brander and Fabian Bravo, which is more focused on earth than ripe fruit. Bright boysenberry fruit is lifted on the palate by more dried herbs and hints of purple flowers.",90,Brander 2014 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"This light, bright wine comes from the north of the Vinho Verde region. It has freshly squeezed lemon juice with a touch of lime zest as well as spice. The lightest prickle on the tongue gives the wine a final lift.",86,Quintas de Melgaço 2014 QM Terra Antiga White (Vinho Verde),,,,
"This traditionally crafted Barolo has a balsamic fragrance of sage, leather and berry notes. The palate shows wild cherry and mint flavors, and bracing but ripe tannins. This is one to open soon or to enjoy over the next few years.",90,Aurelio Settimo 2009  Barolo,,,,
"From the famed vineyard named for the colorful author, this wine remains a standout for the producer, and a tremendous deal for the quality. It exudes notes of eucalyptus on the nose, before unveiling big-boned but balanced tannins, with leather and cranberry notes meeting a tensile line of minerality. It finishes with a taste of mocha.",91,Kenwood 2012 Jack London Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Mountain),,,,
"The 2007 Clarendon is in a more feminine, approachable style than Roman Bratasiuk's other 2007 Grenaches, featuring dried spices, watermelon and cherry aromas and fine—almost delicate—tannins.

"Broad, woody, buttery aromas blend with blackberry, cassis and grapy notes on a full-force bouquet.

A long, woody, toasty finish confirms high quality, length and power; drink through 2022.",92,Zuccardi 2012 Aluvional Altamira Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"This cuvée is a barrel selection, aged in 35% new oak. It's a mix of cola, beet root, stem and earth flavors, but lacks the presence of ripe fruit. In fact, it feels a bit green through the finish.",86,Maison L'Envoyé 2014 The Attaché Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This is an oak-driven expression of Aglianico with heavy and deeply penetrating aromas of black spice, mature blackberry and polished granite or mineral. The wine is soft and chewy in the mouth with thick concentration and a long trail of smoke and ash that speaks of the volcanic territory that shaped it.",89,Fattoria Selvanova 2004 Selvanova Aglianico (Terre del Volturno),,,,
"Aromas of hard spices, licorice root and earth override any berry fruit notes this Cabernet blend shows. Round on the palate, with juicy acidity, this tastes of plum and spicy oak. A long, woody, spicy finish brings it home.",86,Viñedos Altamira Valley 2011 VAV Tres Fincas Red (Uco Valley),,,,
"Aromas suggest prunes, black cherries, resin and a whiff of exotic spices. The straightforward palate delivers raisins, dried cherries marinated in spirits and roasted coffee bean alongside assertive tannins.",88,Bolla 2009  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,,,,

Flavors of green melon and spiced apple lead to a similar tasting finish. For freshness and balance, this wine gets it right.",87,Sumarroca 2011 Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Penedès),,,,
"With its crisp and strongly mineral character, this is true terroir wine. It is stony, steely, very textured, with the apple skin and strong pink grapefruit citrus flavors pushing through to give a fresh character at the end. The structure shows the wine needs to age, so drink from late 2015.",89,Quinta da Calçada 2013 Edição Terroir White (Minho),,,,
"Subdued lemon and forest fruit back up the bright, blush colour of this fruitful, almost fleshy rosé. While this is an easy-drinking party wine, it nonetheless finishes with real freshness and leaves you utterly quenched.",88,Weixelbaum 2015 Strassertaler Rosé (Niederösterreich),,,,
"This ripe, sweet-fruited wine is soft and quite mature. Red fruits have developed into a smooth and round texture with a delicate mushroom character. Drink now.",89,Hugel 2009 Jubiléé Pinot Noir (Alsace),,,,
"Warm earthy berry aromas are mostly solid. This Tannat has a fresh rubbery mouthfeel and dark peppery flavors of mixed black fruits. The finish deals chocolate, coffee and spice notes. For entry-level Uruguayan Tannat, this is a good one.",87,Bracco Bosca 2015 Ombú Tannat (Atlantida),,,,
"From one of the westernmost vineyards in the county, just a few miles from the chilly Pacific, comes this dark, intense Pinot. Tasted in 2007, it was too tightly wound and too young to appreciate fully, with grapy, primary fruit flavors of blackberries, cherries and cola. It should be mellower now, however.",88,Ojai 2005 Solomon Hills Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"Aromas of cassis and brandied cherry are rich and full but not overly complex. Flush and ripe on the palate, with tough tannins, this tastes of baked berry fruits. After that, a slight raisiny note blends with latent cassis on a ripe finish.",88,Bodega Classica 2011 El Pacto  (Rioja),,,,
"Chalky earth, black pepper and clove comprise the nose on this wine, which gets a boost from 10% Merlot. The flavors are spicy and complex, with cedar, tea and a tiny bit of varietally distinct green pepper.",88,Oso Libre 2010 Querida Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Paso Robles),,,,
"Actress Drew Barrymore's project with Carmel Road shows aromas of sliced golden and red apples, wet cement and freshly cut grass. It's slightly salty on the palate with a tremendous amount of apple cider-like zing that runs through the whole sipping experience, showing both the floral and bitter flavors of ruby-red grapefruit pith.",88,Barrymore 2013 Pinot Grigio (Monterey),,,,
"Big, tough and totally dry, this has blackberry and currant flavors. It was grown in the southerly Coombsville area, showing good acidity. It's already throwing some sediment, but all bets are off for whether or not it ages.",86,Ackerman 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Here's a riserva Brunello that opens with inky, dark concentration and tertiary aromas of graham cracker, dried carob powder and ripe berry fruit. The wine shows a dusty, powdery side that makes it appear older than it really is. Black currant, cured meat and leather appear on the close. Drink now.",90,Lazzeretti 2007 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"Almost too much of a good thing, this wine was aged for 15 months in oak to produce a superrich and extracted red wine that is heavy, dense and powerful.

"Briny, with a hint of salted caramel, this is a high-toned white wine, refreshing in lemon and pear notes, with a slight suggestion of orange peel that's entirely welcoming.

"Streamlined and bright, this offers the aromatic intensity and complexity one should expect from Roero. Aromas include chopped mint, cola and wild berry.",88,Matteo Correggia 2009  Roero,,,,
"Stagecoach is a highly regarded vineyard, but this Zinfandel doesn't show it at its best. This wine is too high in alcohol, and it has Port-like prune and blackberry flavors. It has hard tannins that surface without sweetness.",85,Rock Wall 2010 Stagecoach Vineyard Zinfandel (Napa Valley),,,,
"Here's an absolutely terrific, but informal sparkling rosé from southern Italy (made with Negroamaro grapes). Sweet berry, chopped mint and peach come to the fore and the wine is soft and slightly sweet. It's easy, fresh and would make a great cocktail choice.",86,Villa Mottura NV Rosé Extra Dry Negroamaro (Salento),,,,
"Earth, leather, a touch of compost, soy, hoison sauce and raisin aromas all vie for attention on this tannic, ripe, almost stewy Toro. Seriously ripe flavors of sun-baked berry fruits and black currant veer towards prune and raisin on a rich, chocolaty, figgy finish.",89,Maurodos 2011 Prima  (Toro),,,,
"A very savory take on this close Zinfandel cousin, this bottling shows dried herb, peppercorn, forest floor and dessicated red fruit aromas. The palate is a tad riper, with black cherry and cola flavors, spiced with black pepper and more herbs, including oregano and marjoram.",89,AronHill 2014 Estate Grown Primitivo (Paso Robles),,,,
"Aromas of toast, vanilla and citrus zest lead the way and carry over to the bright palate along with Golden Delicious apple, lemon drop and mineral. Firm acidity offsets the fruit flavors while a walnut note closes the finish.",88,Primosic 2013 Gmajne Chardonnay (Collio),,,,
"This is a honeyed, sweet wine (a fact not indicated on the label). Spice is surrounded by ripe fruits, apricot and lychee, with added pepper. Some citrus acidity comes through at the end. Drink now.",89,Helfrich 2009 Steinklotz Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"Half of this year's Poet's Leap Riesling is sourced from The Benches, one quarter from old-vine plantings at Dionysus, and the rest from Yakima's Phil Church vineyard. Marvelous concentration and a panoply of lush orange, apricot, peach and papaya flavors carry this beautifully balanced wine through a long and satisfying finish. Delicious young, it could also be cellared for a decade or longer.",94,Poet's Leap 2012 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
Light fig and pear flavors on a rich texture make this wine a sleeper. Quiet on the first sip it gains ripeness and interest with subsequent tastes. It's very smooth and full in the mouth.,88,Rock Wall 2015 Kristen's Cuvee Viognier (California),,,,
"This fruity wine has bright acidity and a perfumed character. With its crisp texture, it is full of lemon and green apple fruit. Drink now.",84,DFJ Vinhos 2015 Bigode Branco White (Lisboa),,,,
89-91. Barrel sample. There is a good balance here between the ripe blackberry fruits and the solid tannins. This wine shows new wood and a touch of green flavor.,90,Château de Chantegrive 2011 Barrel Sample  (Graves),,,,
"This dry-farmed property produces concentrated grapes. Particularly in this vintage, it offers burly, tannin-laced fruit with a tendency to brood. Soft and velvety on the palate, it veers into tangy, oaky and spicy finishing touches.",92,Emeritus 2013 Hallberg Ranch Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Despite the cool, challenging vintage this 100% varietal wine shines through with notes of blackberry, cola, vanilla and cherry. The palate shows a pleasing mixture of tart fruit, grainy tannins and rich barrel flavors. It should only benefit from additional time in the bottle.",91,Corvus 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),,,,
"Januik makes just four barrels of this 100% Walla Walla Cabernet. The usual plushness of the Seven Hills Vineyard comes with a harder, steelier edge—a hallmark of Januik's style. It's structured for aging, with black cherry fruit that's annotated with tobacco, coffee and baking spice.",92,Januik 2009 Seven Hills Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (OR)),,,,
"Tight, taut, mineral-driven wine, lively with a light prickle on the tongue. This is very fresh, with citrus and grapefruit flavors. Delicious, bone-dry Vinho Verde.",87,Quinta de Santa Maria 2009 Quinta do Tamariz Loureiro (Vinho Verde),,,,
"Winemaker: Andrea Mullineux. This is an interesting wine, made from a 40-year-old, dry-farmed vineyard on the Paardeberg. Pretty floral tones of white clover, honeysuckle and orange blossom dominate the bouquet, with subtly supporting white melon and pear fruits. The medium-weight palate is smooth yet fresh and balanced, with lingering accents of dried grass and soft baking spice that continue through the finish. Drink now–2020.",90,Mullineux 2015 Cape Winemakers Guild Clairette Blanche Clairette (Swartland),,,,
"Done in a distinctive style that is just shy of over-the-top, this is fermented and aged in neutral oak barrels, and sports near-15% alcohol. Rich, round and ripe, it's lightly buttery, with appealing apple and pear-tart flavors, light toast and impressive power.",90,River's Edge 2014 Pinot Gris (Elkton Oregon),,,,
"Smoke and bramble lend a savory, herbaceous tone to this ripe, lusciously fruity wine. Ripe red plum and cherry flavors are contrasted with bitter, dense tannins that build through the midpalate, adding structure and weight.",87,Millbrook 2012 Cabernet Franc (New York),,,,
"This is serious and concentrated, probably built to age a few more years before its peak. It smells soaked with black cherry and black currant aromas, tastes deep, ripe and compelling, and feels full bodied and firmly tannic. The flavors are powerful enough to match the big texture, so it should improve through 2020.",91,Paul Dolan 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino County),,,,
"Its brisk acidity and dry, tart lemon-and-lime flavors make this a nice wine to drink now. It has the herb and tobacco notes you often find in Napa Valley Chardonnay.",86,Hill Wine Company 2011 Black Dog Series Chardonnay (Napa Valley),,,,
"After a bit of searching through a blanket of coffee and cocoa, fresh red currant and plum show on the nose. A solid concentration of crunchy red and black berries meets an enlivened vein of pencil lead, with pleasantly bitter cocoa lingering on the finish. There's a nice balance of plushness, medium-grained tannin and persistent acidity, making this wine easily enjoyable now.",88,Black Star Farms 2012 Leorie Vineyard Merlot-Cabernet Franc (Old Mission Peninsula),,,,
"Bürklin-Wolf's standard label Wachenheim-dry Riesling has all the vivacious acidity and citrus flavor of its premier cru counterparts but is also starker and leaner in style. Its sharp, angular feel is elegant and penetrating though, finishing with a nuanced dusting of saffron and crushed minerals. Drink now through 2018.",90,Dr. Bürklin-Wolf 2014 Wachenheimer Dry Riesling (Pfalz),,,,
"Lots of rich, forward pineapple, ripe pear jam, vanilla cream and buttered toast flavors in this Chardonnay. It will satisfy your sweet tooth, with its honey-rich finish. Drink now.",86,Bedarra 2008 Reserve Chardonnay (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Dusty blackberry and dark plum aromas come with spice, particulary pepper. Feels crisp, juicy and tight on the palate, with plum, cherry, red licorice candy and peppery flavors. Dry on the finish, and only slightly herbal overall.",87,Emiliana 2010 Natura Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"Very ripe and bright in acidity, with clean, vibrant flavors of Meyer lemon custard, Key lime pie, vanilla sorbet and crème brûlée flavors. Could be more elegant, but it's certainly not shy.",88,Terra Sávia 2008 Reserve Chardonnay (Mendocino),,,,
"This blend holds 59% Syrah, 24% Grenache, 13% Petite Sirah and 4% Zinfandel. Slightly reserved at first, with some patience it begins to show violets, boysenberries and sandalwood on the nose. Aromatic purple flowers arise on the sip, along with dark chocolate and black currant. But the wine is rigidly structured, remaining quite wound-up even after many hours open.",89,Guyomar 2012 Laity Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"Earthy and leathery, this medium-bodied, ripe varietal wine dabbles in vanilla, blueberry and coffee cake aromas and flavors, finishing with a welcome softness.",88,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2013 Bastoni Vineyards Petite Sirah (Sonoma County),,,,
"Tingling lemon and grapefruit pith make for a tantalizing experience in this white made from several vineyard sources throughout the Napa Valley. Saline and wet stone provide the minerality, with a searing seasoning of lemongrass. The wine finishes on a tart, herbal note that yearns to be matched with seafood.",90,Atalon 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"A soft and rounded wine, full of ripe fruits that command all the attention. Red fruits dominate, just supported by tannins and a firm dryness. This is a rich wine that will age quickly, worth drinking in the next two years.",88,Nuiton-Beaunoy 2010  Beaune,,,,
"Heavy and globular on the nose, then mulchy, salinic and disjointed for the rest of the ride. Awkward and lemony feeling, with herbal berry flavors, tartness and just not much Pinot pizzazz. A jumbled wine that does not shine.",81,Morandé 2008 Edición Limitada Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"Sappy, grapey fruit is joined by strong herbal overtones reminiscent of dried oregano and parsley. While some panelists felt it had potential to develop over the next couple of years, others dismissed it for saline aromas that they termed “fishy.”",83,Midnight 1999 Nebula Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),,,,
"Subtle aromas of grilled bread, citrus curd and peach set the stage for a plump, medium-bodied wine that boasts restrained flavors of white peach, pineapple and lime. Drink now–2016.",89,Howard Park 2013 Flint Rock Chardonnay (Great Southern),,,,
"Lustau calls it dry but Los Arcos definitely has some aromatic and palate sweetness. The nose settles on brown sugar, peach, mixed nuts and honey. It's not super tight or acidic, and thus the palate drips maple and molasses. Medium-bodied and balanced, but with that shot of sugar offset by honest but mellow acids.",89,Lustau NV Dry Amontillado Los Arcos Sherry (Jerez),,,,
"A pretty, polished wine that's easy to like for its low alcohol and silky texture. Made from an unusual blend of Merlot, Sangiovese, Dolcetto and Cabernet Franc, it's dry and elegant, with pleasant berry-cherry and spice flavors.",88,Stateside 2009 Winemaker's Reserve Red Wine Blend Red (Sonoma County),,,,
"Get to know the local red grapes of Gaillac that make up this blend: Duras, Braucol and Prunelard. Together, they create impressive structure, concentration and intensity. Acidity balances the bold red fruit and ripe cherry flavors. It's a serious wine with good potential and will be best from 2020.",93,Domaine Rotier 2014 Renaissance Red (Gaillac),,,,
"This is somewhat lean, but its elegantly tailored in its brisk acidity and dryness. While the cherry and berry flavors are modest, the wine's austerity makes it versatile with an enormous range of foods.",87,Stephen Ross 2010 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"A different breed of blended wine, with earthy aromas of dried cheese, leather, dill and vanilla. The palate is tight and mildly tannic, with sweet cola, roasted berry and earthy tobacco flavors. Not your normal bulky, dark wine; it's complex and based on 85% Garnacha and Carignan.",89,Martí Fabra 2005 Masia Carreras Red (Empordà),,,,
"For a $5 wine, it offers pretty good red berry aromas along with a decent mouthfeel and proper acidity. The palate pops with red plum and raspberry flavors along with mild stalky, brambly notes that are more in the background than up front. Not overwhelming but doesn't disappoint.",84,Zamarro 2009 Malbec-Bonarda (Mendoza),,,,
"Fermented in an open stone lagar, giving great depth of color as well as rich, plummy concentration. The wine is ripe and bold, a plethora of licorice and bitter coffee to go with the rich red fruit. The tannins and acidity are finely in balance.",90,Quinta de Chocapalha 2007 Tinto Red (Lisboa),,,,
"Scents of salted caramels, smoke and apple blossom make this wonderfully enticing. It's a straightforward, easygoing wine, but highlighted by fresh apple and pear notes that melt into richer, rounder flavors of nuts and cream.",85,Wagner 2008 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This wine is fairly soft and muted, with delicate aromas of straw, apple and underripe white melon. The palate is similarly light in feel and intensity, with low acidity and a short finish.",84,Les Jamelles 2016 Viognier (Pays d'Oc),,,,
"From what are considered as the highest vineyards in Europe, this vibrant, elegant white reveals lovely fragrances of honeysuckle, jasmine and alpine herb. The linear palate delivers yellow apple, citrus, thyme and a hint of mineral alongside brisk acidity.",89,Cave du Vin Blanc de Morgex et de la Salle 2013 Tradizionale Blanc de Morgex et de La Salle Prié Blanc (Valle d'Aosta),,,,
"Candied lemon and rich blossom honey hit the brain with their lifted, intense scents. A touch of smoky stone can be glimpsed before the sweetness of the palate takes over. Here, a pleasantly bitter note edges the richness with welcome texture and bite. Candied-citrus notes swish across the palate, trailing blossom, honey, nectar and candied peel in their wake. The finish is fresh and clean.",94,Gunter Triebaumer 2013 Ruster Ausbruch Welschriesling (Burgenland),,,,
"This is bold and bullish, but also acidic and raw in feel. The opening berry aroma conveys a wild side, and the mouth is racy and grating, with the feel of fruit skin and flavors of plum and cherry. This captures the rugged, hard-core side of Maule Carignan.",84,Undurraga 2010 T.H. Carignan (Maule Valley),,,,
"Scents of white grapefruit and honeydew rind introduce this dry, refreshing Riesling. It's quite delicate in structure but concentrated with fresh apple flavor accented by bright lemon-lime acidity. Finishes on an earthy saffron note.",87,Red Newt Cellars 2011 Bullhorn Creek Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes),,,,
Inky cool herbal black-fruit aromas set up a choppy tight palate with pounding tannins. Flavors of black coffee and blackberry are heavily toasted. The finish keeps that toasty theme while introducing notes of pepper and horseradish.,87,Gimenez Mendez 2015 100 Años Viñas Mendoza Malbec (Montevideo),,,,
"The producer has several parcels in Moulin-à-Vent which go into this blend. It is a firm and structured wine at this stage: dense and with both spice and black fruits. It is obviously made for some long aging, so don't drink this serious wine before 2019.",93,Richard Rottiers 2015  Moulin-à-Vent,,,,
"A slightly reduced nose signals that this wine needs to breathe. A little time in the glass reveals fresh, ripe flavor that's perfectly suited to summer picnics. It's fruit-forward and uncomplicated, with a light but ripe body.",88,Winzerkeller Andau 2015 Zweigelt (Burgenland),,,,
"This is not necessarily a classic Grenache, but there is no denying its bold but sophisticated personality. Pomegranate and blackberry aromas are tinged with earthiness, and the flavors are rich in fruit as well. The texture is lush and the body is very full. Think of it as very ripe and delicious, while sleek and smooth in spite of high alcohol.",90,Cline 2013 Big Break Vineyard Grenache (Contra Costa County),,,,
"From two vineyard sites, Martaella and Martinelli Frei Road, this lovely wine is built from the ground up, with elements of rich vanilla, toasted oak and baked pear. Big in style on the nose, it finishes crisp and focused, a mixture of complexity and lightness of being.",91,Benovia 2013 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"A dusty cherry aroma turns harsh with airing, setting up a tight, acidic palate that's marked by tart raspberry and plum flavors. Scouring, spicy and peppery on the finish, this amounts to a tight, hard and basic Rioja.",83,Bodegas Ontañón 2008 Crianza  (Rioja),,,,
"Young, strong and vigorous. Despite a plethora of ripe blackberries, plums and dark chocolate, this Cab seems to lack some breeding and elegance. Could surprise down the road. Try after 2014.",88,Somerston 2007 Priest Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Hints of spice and soy sauce highlight lifted red cherry aromas on this full-bodied Cabernet Franc. The fruit is a bit lean, with slightly underripe red-fruit flavors, but it finishes brisk and clean.",85,Montezuma 2011 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This wine reflects the difficulty of the cool, wet 2014 vintage. It's lean and diluted, with medicinal sensations that recall adhesive bandage and mineral.",83,Subida di Monte 2014 Malvasia (Collio),,,,
"Light in color and rustically earthy on the nose, this wine offers ripe black cherry and licorice, with a touch of tartness on the finish. It takes on weight and body as it goes, peaking as the wine hits the back of the tongue.",86,Weather 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Clean and bright, this opens with light aromas of fresh green apple, underripe pear and melon rind. The lightweight palate is fresh and racy, with a friendly and enjoyable mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2018.",88,Raats Family 2016 Original Unwooded Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch),,,,
"Available in magnum only, this is an occasional bottling from the winery. A winery spokeperson told me my bottle was entirely 1993 vintage, but not all other bottles are. The wine is extraordinarily fine, but compared to other California bubblies, it's sandpapery and almost harsh at this point. As it warms up in the glass it shows an immense toasted nut and grilled fruit richness with an impossibly long finish. This is one to stash for the long haul.",97,Iron Horse NV Joy! Sparkling (Green Valley),,,,
"The nose has pretty elements of hazelnut and chocolate in a Nutella-like twist that is accented by smoke, black stone, leather and wild berries. The wine has good intensity, acidity and a streamlined mouthfeel that suggests it needs at least five more years in the bottle.",91,Massolino 2005 Margheria  (Barolo),,,,
"Floral overtones join ripe pear notes on the nose. The palate comes in with even more generous, juicy pear fruit, the rounded flavors boosted by a little residual sweetness that makes the wine finish off dry.",88,Domaine Fritz Schmitt 2015 Vieilles Vignes Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"Mild flowery aromas suggest lilac and bath soap. This feels plump and chunky, with no distinct center point. Salty, yeasty but bland flavors lead to an oily feeling finish with early onset oxidation.",84,Espiritu de Chile 2015 Reserva Chardonnay (Curicó Valley),,,,
"This is an honest wine, with an herbal aroma and notes of tomato and red plum. It feels zingy due to tomato-like acidity, with red fruit flavors followed by a lean finish.",84,Quasar 2008 Selection Carmenère (Molina),,,,
"Steeped plum, baked earth, grilled herb and tobacco aromas come together on this structured wine. The savory palate offers rich black cherry, mocha, clove, dried herb and licorice alongside firm, ripe tannins. Drink after 2018.",93,Rivetto 2011 del Comune di Serralunga d'Alba  (Barolo),,,,
"Made from 100% Petite Sirah grown in the estate vineyard, this is a massive wine. It's as big as Petite gets, filled with blackberry, blueberry, chocolate, black currant and new oak flavors. So ripe, it turns porty in the finish, but it's a good portiness, rich and heady. The official alcohol is 14.9%, but it tastes higher than that.",91,David Fulton 2010 Petite Sirah (St. Helena),,,,
"Honey is the dominant star in this bottling, drizzled all over yellow apples on the nose. The golden liquid also shows strong on the palate, with flavors of pears and apples soaked in honey water.",85,Sarah's Vineyard 2013 Viognier (Santa Clara Valley),,,,
"Intense aromas of smoke, nuts and dried hay lend a savory note to this, woody Chardonnay. Fresh apple and lemon flavors are bright and brisk on the palate, but compete for spotlight amidst unyielding tones of American oak.",84,Six Mile Creek 2012 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),,,,
"The nose is murky and overdone, seemingly a victim of the rainy 2002 harvest. The palate is heavy and dark, with sweet plum and berry fruit, but not the pulsating, pure type normally sought.",83,Miguel Torres 2002 Santa Digna Merlot (Curicó Valley),,,,
"A perfect balance between Syrah and Petite Sirah from Calaveras County-based Prospect 772 this new offering hits it out of the park in terms of its dark, near-black color and subdued leather saddle and blueberry aromas. With rounded tannins, this is an intense wine with a distinct sense of personality, concentrated, savory, earthy and ready to age until 2019–2029 or decant awhile before settling into your glass.",94,Prospect 772 2011 Bro Black Tie Charlie Cuvée Syrah-Petite Sirah (California),,,,
"Calina usually makes a nice value Chardonnay, and this vintage is no different. The wine has a chunky dry-peach opening, which is backed by a round, smooth palate and flavors of sweet pear, baked apple and roasted corn. Honey and orange notes make cameo appearances. Good for the price.",87,Calina 2009 Reserva Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"Sure it's a bit simple and fruity—the flavors run toward berries and citrus—but it's also cleanly made, with a slightly creamy mouthfeel and a soft, easy-drinking finish.",84,Patriarche Père et Fils NV Eclat Carmin Rosé Sparkling (Vin Mousseux),,,,
"Made entirely with Merlot, this full-bodied red opens with aromas of menthol, dark berries and cooking spices. The firm, savory palate offers ripe plum, juicy black cherry, cinnamon, clove and dark chocolate alongside velvety tannins. Drink through 2020.",92,Barone Ricasoli 2011 Casalferro Merlot (Toscana),,,,
"This is 100% single vineyard Merlot; broad, beautifully integrated, with seamless black fruits, streaks of coffee and smoke, and black pepper spice. A powerful Merlot with muscle and verve, it finishes smooth and lightly tasting of chocolate.",91,Dunham 2006 Lewis Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Rusty in color and murky on the palate, this earthy, mature wine smells a bit too much like a mud puddle, with herbal, green notes mixed in. Tannic, drying and austere, this Cabernet tastes leafy, with a salty, earthy, stewy finish.",83,Casa Valduga 2006 Gran Reserva Villa-Lobos Cabernet Sauvignon (Vale dos Vinhedos),,,,
"With a slightly chemical smell, this is an intensely spicy, relatively dry wine. It's not abundant in acidity and freshness, so drink soon.",85,Domaine Fernand Engel 2011 Réserve Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"Lighter in color, this Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant blend shows alluring notes of cherry, assorted herbs and bittersweet chocolate. It's elegant in style with a velvety feel to the fruit flavors.",91,Pondera 2010 Cuvée Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Opens with horsey notes typical of Lemberger, followed by tones of cherry pie and preserved lemons. Crisp, almost tart on the tongue with a short-to-medium finish of singed cherries. Drink up.",85,Keuka Spring 2007 Lemberger (Finger Lakes),,,,
"There's a hint of smoke throughout the nose and palate that adds a layer of complexity to this sweet, pretty Riesling. Aromas of honeysuckle blossoms combine with the freshness of pressed apples and a bright, high-toned acidity. Smoke, slate and stone kick in to create a long, elegant finish. Overall, a well balanced, enjoyable wine.",88,Lamoreaux Landing 2009 Round Rock Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes),,,,
"The aromas of baked apple, vanilla and baking spices are direct, with the oak in the lead. The flavors are broad in feel and continue to linger on the finish.",88,Big DeVine 2014 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"With a gold color and heavy, pithy aromas that are becoming oxidized, this is a mature, highly stylized Albariño. It's also a touch flat, with flavors of bitter citrus and nectarine pit. Overall this is more leesy and mature than vital and outwardly delicious.",86,Zarate 2010 Balado Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"Juicy sweet is an apt moniker for this fruity, forward Riesling. The grapey, sugary palate is a bit confected in style, but easy and approachable.",84,Fulkerson 2014 Juicy Sweet Riesling (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Dusty aromas of apple and mild yeast form the bouquet on this traditional Cava. In the mouth, it's frothy and foamy on contact, while the flavors veer from peppery and dry to apple and citrus. This finishes nice and peppery, with proper dryness for a brut sparkler.",87,Segura Viudas NV Reserva Heredad Brut Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"Banana custard and charred marshmallow scents show on the nose of this bottling. The palate is similar, with charred brioche and cream pie flavors.",85,Testarossa 2014 Cuvée 107 Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Though the wine saw less than 10% new oak, it carries a rich, smoky note of espresso from first whiff to last swallow. It's dusty and dense, with fragrances of baking spice and incense. The flavors bring accents of citrus rind, orange peel and white pepper, showing lovely balance and varietal strength throughout.",90,Amavi 2010 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"The wine's golden color and rich appearance are very attractive, but its aromas of rubber and sour fruit are somewhat awkward. This does have a fresh and vibrant feel in the mouth with nice crispness on the finish.",84,Zorzettig 2007 Chardonnay Chardonnay (Colli Orientali del Friuli),,,,
"Heady aromas of honeysuckle, jasmine and white stone fruit lead the way on this round semisweet sparkler. On the silky palate, tangy acidity brightens ripe white peach, green apple and candied tangerine slice. A creamy mousse provides the polished backdrop.",90,Le Colture NV Dry  (Valdobbiadene Superiore di Cartizze),,,,
"Pure Petit Verdot is not an easy wine to balance. Here the cool vintage seems to have led to a disjointed wine with flavors that don't quite sync up. The grapy fruit shows a hint of residual sugar, the acids are tart and citrusy, the tannins chalky. More bottle age may help pull it all together.",85,Merry Cellars 2011 Petit Verdot (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Bold but not too full bodied, this dry wine made from Syrah and Malbec has vivid, grapey, dark-fruit aromas and flavors liberally accented with spicy, smoky, earthy accents. Laden with fine tannins, the texture conveys a thick but smooth mouthfeel.",88,Sexual Chocolate 2014 Red (California),,,,
"This oak-aged blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Marzemino opens with sweet aromas of ripe fruit and Christmas spice backed by leather, pipe tobacco and honey-glazed almond. The wine shows crisp freshness and citrus accents on the close.",87,Collalbrigo 2005 Red (Marca Trevigiana),,,,
"Yeasty aromas are suggestive of vanilla wafer and corn cakes, with apple and melon scents lurking. A plump, low-acid palate delivers pithy, lightly bitter citrus and stone-fruit flavors, while notes of melon and honey fail to make much noise on the finish.",83,L.A. Cetto 2013 Chardonnay (Valle de Guadalupe),,,,
"Full, rounded, attractively fruity, this wine is light in texture. It is juicy and without great complexity, but with a generous, ripe feel. Screwcap.",84,Château Recougne 2012  Bordeaux Blanc,,,,
"This new vintage of Chaleur Estate Blanc is still quite young and tight. It shows the toasty scents of pretty new oak, set in an elegant frame of mixed fruits. Cucumber, apple, citrus and melon flavors emerge, suggesting an overall lighter style from a cooler vintage. Graceful and polished.",91,DeLille 2010 Chaleur Estate Blanc White (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Planted in 1998, this vineyard is relatively new to Soléna's lineup. Plenty of toast and Bourbon-barrel scents lift the open, with a hint of sharpness from the alcohol. Though only a quarter of the barrels were new, the spice and coffee accents are in full display, wrapped around tart red fruits. An earthy bottom, hinting at forest and mushroom, completes the experience.",91,Soléna 2009 Willakia Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
"If the staunchly herbal and green-bean scents and flavors often found with this grape are your cup of tea, this will prove enjoyable. It's smooth and not overly tannic, with those intense green-bean aromatics and a taste of tomato.",85,Season 2013 Limited Edition Series Carmenère (Southern Oregon),,,,
"An offbeat blend of Sangiovese and Syrah, and quite a good wine, at that. It's dry, medium- to full-bodied and tannic, with complex flavors of cherries, leather, tobacco, Dr. Pepper cola and peppery spices. It is high in alcohol, but wears the heat well.",90,Tessa Marie 2007 Coquette Sangiovese-Syrah (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Like Chambers' entry-level Muscadelle, this Muscat offers an affordable introduction to the Rutherglen style of sticky. The Muscat is full and round, with relatively simple notes of spiced orange and crème caramel and a finish that is sweet but balanced.",90,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards NV Muscat (Rutherglen),,,,
"All black cherry and blueberry jam, this South Coast Syrah is fruity and spicy, full and fleshy with pepper and cinnamon spice and a teaspoon of black tea playfully showing through. Consistent throughout, a wine that's easy to like and complex at the same time. It spent close to two years in French oak, 30% of it new.",89,Leonesse Cellars 2008 Vista Del Monte Vineyard Syrah (Temecula Valley),,,,
"Pear, apple and a drop of petrol work the nose on this German-style Riesling from Chile. A touch of spritz offers bubbly zest to the palate feel, while acid-driven flavors of lemon-lime, mango, pineapple and white peach finish chalky and a touch sweet.",88,Concha y Toro 2012 Terrunyo Costa Los Boldos Vineyard Block 6 Riesling (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"Although this smells a bit oily, gritty and pyrazinic—an indication that it's living on borrowed time—at the moment this SB is still in fairly good shape. Pithy grapefruit flavors finish plump and citrusy. Drink immediately.",85,Bodegas Cerrosol 2015 Monte Palma Sauvignon Blanc (Rueda),,,,
"Applesauce aromas come with a note of sugar-coated beignet. This feels a little sticky, while scattershot flavors of grapefruit juice, lychee, mango and lime finish sweet but also green.",83,Undurraga NV Brut  (Central Valley),,,,
"A touch of Riesling accentuates the fresh citrusy backbone on this Cabernet Sauvignon rosé. Dry in style with a sprightly light-footed tone, it offers loads of concentrated cherry and berry flavors. The finish is brisk and clean.",89,Osprey's Dominion 2016 Dry Rosé (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"This bright passito dessert wine delivers a steady stream of apricot, honey, almond and candy-like aromas. The wine is thick, syrupy and ends with a fresh note of citrus zest.",89,Sartarelli 2008 Passito  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi),,,,
"Stone-fruit aromas come with a note of cultured milk that one finds in yogurt. A healthy mouthfeel revolves around bold acidity, while this tastes of melon, peach and wood spice. A salty, oaky finish is balanced by lasting acidity.",86,Príncipe de Viana 2015 Chardonnay (Navarra),,,,
"Hailing from chilly Casablanca, this Syrah shows a soupy, vegetal smelling nose that's mildly green and earthy. The palate feels pretty good and chunky, but the flavor profile runs green, with an herbal finish.",84,Loma Larga 2008 Syrah (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"Produced for Force Majeure by Syncline's James Mantone, this riveting wine is a blend of 47% Mourvèdre, 42% Syrah and 11% Grenache. Lush and redolent with wild berry and wet rock aromatics, it carries a thread of sweet grain along with bright, detailed berry fruit and balancing acidity. Delicious already, it can be enjoyed now through 2020.",93,Force Majeure 2011 Collaboration Series VI Ciel du Cheval Vineyard G-S-M (Red Mountain),,,,
"Appealing aromas of butterscotch, cream, spice, lees and tropical fruit lead to medium-bodied fruit flavors that bring a sense of richness but also delicacy. It shows a touch of warmth on the finish.",89,Côte Bonneville 2014 Estate Bottled DuBrul Vineyard Chardonnay (Yakima Valley),,,,
"There's a stewy rustiness to this wine on the entry, an evocative recall of the old country, when grandfather made wine in his basement. From a high-elevation vineyard site, it takes time to open. Once it does, the full-bodied expression of juicy blackberry and leather combine to nice effect.",88,Romililly 2012 Monte Rosso Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"This 100% varietal wine opens with beautifully lush aromas of blackberry and licorice, before a seamless, soft layering of leather comes in. Soft tannins mark the midpalate, followed by a finish steeped in smoky vanilla and herb.",88,Murphy-Goode 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"This wine is full of juicy Merlot, ripe with sweet tannins and jammy fruit. It is soft, with the freshness of the year as well as having hints of structure.

"This rosé gets its pretty eye-of-the-partridge color from having undergone cold soaking. Dry, soft and subtle, it shows peach, vanilla and spice flavors. Great with cioppino or grilled salmon.",87,Morovino 2011 Avila Beach Sunset Dry Rosé of Pinot Grigio (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Rich, fruity wine that is full of black plum juice and soft tannins. Milk chocolate sweetness adds to the generous nature of this juicy wine. Drink now.",88,Georges Duboeuf 2009 Domaine de Michelons  (Moulin-à-Vent),,,,
"Effectively half-and-half Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is a tremendous wine. With very fine tannins, spice from a touch of wood and swathes of ripe fruits give this wine its concentration and its huge potential. The wine has weight and a dark, dense structure that will allow it to age for many years. Drink from 2027.",97,Château Angélus 2014  Saint-Émilion,,,,
"A blend relying on 70% Cabernet Franc with the remainder an equal split of Malbec and Merlot, this offers a lot of raspberry tart and caramel, along with a tropical element of coconut. Softened tannins and mellow oak combine to good effect, before an abbreviated finish of vanilla.",86,Terlato 2011 Devils' Peak Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"89-91 Barrel sample. A wine that has all the grace of Château Margaux, but just a hint of depth and power. The tannins stay soft, there are hints of spice and a distinct acidity.",90,Château Margaux 2008 Pavillon Rouge de Château Margaux Barrel sample  (Margaux),,,,
"Aromas like petrol and turned earth along with fruity, very sweet flavors make an interesting combination in this luscious dessert-style wine.",88,V. Sattui 2012 Select Late Harvest Riesling (Anderson Valley),,,,

"Produced from organically grown grapes, this wood-aged wine from the Dupuy family is rich and full, packed with black plum and ripe berry flavors. With 30% Cabernet Franc in the blend, the wine is perfumed and structured with a smoky aftertaste that is balanced by acidity. Drink this well-made wine from 2017. The vineyard was certified organic in 1996, early in Bordeaux terms, and is managed by Gérard Dupuy.",88,Château Beauséjour 2012  Puisseguin Saint-Émilion,,,,
"At first this smells raw and oaky, so much so that notes of paint and paste are as prominent as vanilla. In the mouth, however, this is a fresh wine with tomatoey acidity. Flavors of baked berry, plum and raisin blend with herbal notes, while the finish is long and tastes of vanilla and spice.",88,Vivanco 2010 Crianza  (Rioja),,,,
"Made of 85% Sangiovese and 15% Canaiolo, this opens with violet and leather aromas. The savory, straightforward palate offers mature black cherry, sage and anise flavors, supported by lithe tannins. Enjoy through 2020.",89,Pietro Beconcini 2013 Riserva  (Chianti),,,,
"This is an earthy, stemmy wine, hugely concentrated and ripe in strawberry and rhubarb. Subtle in texture and bite, it shows a streak of cardamom on the finish.",88,Winc 2014 Porter and Plot Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"With hints of pineapple and peach flavors, this is a ripe wine with a refreshing juicy character. It's a food wine thanks to its mineral texture and tangy acidity. It could age a few more months, so hold until 2016.",87,Adega Cooperativa do Cartaxo 2014 Bridão Classico Branco Fernão Pires (Tejo),,,,
"True to label, this dry, invigorating Riesling is a showcase of Mosel-style minerality. Racy lime, pineapple and tangerine flavors are intensified by slatey, salty tangs of minerality that reverberate on the finish.",90,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler 2014 Dry Mineral Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Bold and ripe, this tastes almost sweet due to the aroma and flavor of cherries and vanilla. It is full-bodied, fat in texture and carries heat on the finish. It matured in 40% new oak barrels.",88,Edmeades 2012 Gianoli Vineyard Zinfandel (Mendocino Ridge),,,,
"Loamy, rich aromas of blackberry, licorice and chocolate cake come before a bold, balanced palate with acidic kick.

"Elegant black-cherry and cassis flavors are accented with savory tones of ripe stem and leaf in this slightly understated Cab Franc. Overall, the palate is lean in profile, but it's a brisk, straightforward wine offering plenty of varietal character.",85,Raphael 2010 Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"Feels heavy and ponderous now, almost like a common Grenache, and might age, but it's a gamble. Made in a particular style of extreme ripeness, the wine features blackberries, currants, red licorice and spices, and is fully dry.",85,A.P. Vin 2007 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,
"Lots of fun to sip this showy, overt, no-holds-barred Zin. Lavish use of new oak gives aromas of toasted bread, maple syrup and smoked bacon. The flavors say ripe strawberries and sweet blackberry jam, and the finish is sweet and spicy at the same time.",89,Ironstone 2012 Old Vines Zinfandel (Lodi),,,,
"Soft and fruity, this Syrah is technically dry, but so fruity, it almost tastes like a candy. Shows red cherry, red currant, cola, roasted almond and licorice flavors, like a fruit bar you buy in the health store.",84,JAQK Cellars 2006 Soldiers of Fortune Shiraz (Napa Valley),,,,
"Fermented in a 500-liter French oak puncheon and put through full malo, this stands in stark contrast to the winery's Her Silhouette Chardonnay. Both are exceptional, yet this is rounder, fuller and more elegant, with crisp apple and pear fruit accented with cinnamon spice.",92,Amalie Robert 2014 Heirloom Cameo Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Voluptuous blackberry and plum flavors are edged by hints of bitter coffee and spice in this richly bodied wine. Fringed by a bare feather of tannins, it's luscious in mouthfeel, with an unctuousness that persists luxuriously on the palate.",89,Wölffer 2013 Caya Cabernet Franc (Long Island),,,,
"A standout among Tinhorn Creek's wide-ranging portfolio, this full-bodied wine offers a generous serving of the grape's signature floral aromatics and spices, but there's plenty of ripe fruit also. Citrus peel and candied ginger along with fleshy pear and lemongrass make this a fine choice for grilled shrimp.",91,Tinhorn Creek 2014 Gewürztraminer (Okanagan Valley),,,,
"A gorgeous aroma like roses and blackberries meets richly concentrated and ripe black-fruit flavors in this full-bodied, luxuriously textured wine. While extremely ripe and bold, the wine is also smooth and voluptuous, balanced out by silky tannins that keep the mouthfeel lively and fresh sip after sip.",95,Easton 2014 Old Vine Rinaldi Vineyard Zinfandel (Fiddletown),,,,
"Prickly aromas of nettle are simple as well as diluted. This feels basic and fresh, while green, citrusy flavors end with pithy notes and an oily feel.",84,Concha y Toro 2015 Reserva Casillero del Diablo Sauvignon Blanc (Chile),,,,
"Dark garnet in the glass, this wine features aromas of black cherry, candle wax and freshly picked oregano. Soft tannins offer a foundation for flavors of cherry, cassis, mint, espresso bean and Mediterranean herbs. Fruit and savory notes continually make way for one another on the palate, concluding in an herbal and lemon zest finish.",89,Barkan 2011 Superieur Cabernet Sauvignon (Galilee),,,,
"Made from Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon in equal parts, this wine aims for the fences and largely succeeds. It's stupendously delicious and addictively drinkable, bearing blackberry and blueberry jam, mocha, anise and sandalwood flavors. It will probably pick up bottle nuances in a few years, but why wait?",93,Peju 2009 Fifty/Fifty Red Wine Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"The 65% of Merlot in the blend gives a wine that is soft and rounded. With its acidity and fine tannins, it is fresh and fruity. Black currants and berries dominate a wine that will be ready to drink from 2019.",87,Château Haut Beyzac 2014  Haut-Médoc,,,,
"This single vineyard selection is softly herbal, with peppery strawberry fruit. The finish leaves an impression of water crackers.",85,Oak Knoll 2012 Tuenge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Vanilla, cherry and a crunch of barbecue chips greet the entry of this full-bodied, weighty wine that's soft in tannin. Baked plum and cinnamon make it inviting and satisfying on the palate, finishing with a zest of racy acidity.",88,Cast 2013 Watson Vineyard Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Round and softly fruity, this white Burgundy comes with a hint of vanilla. With its ripe apple, lime and yellow fruit flavors, it's instantly drinkable. The finish is touched by acidity.",84,Jaffelin 2010 Les Chapitres de Jaffelin  (Bourgogne),,,,
"This young Chianti Classico is still a bit closed, but it reveals cherry and raspberry sensations along with black- and white-pepper notes. It's still tightly knit but it should should open up well after one or two more years bottle aging.",87,Tenuta di Lilliano 2011  Chianti Classico,,,,
"The tea and raspberry aromas are easygoing, and that best describes this organic Cabernet Sauvignon. It's powerful enough on the palate, with a good berry flavor that tilts towards raspberry. The finish is herbal and peppery.",85,Vicente Gandia 2010 Organic Cabernet Sauvignon (Spain),,,,
"Big and bold in body, earthy in aroma and showing ample fruit flavors, this assertive and high-alcohol wine packs quite a punch in texture, too. The impact of lots of tannin is apparent in the astringency.",85,Longevity 2011 Vintner Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),,,,
"Zesty lime and green melon notes resonate throughout this ethereally light but scintillating dry Riesling. Dusty mineral and pollen notes lend an earthen dimension to crisp, green plum and herb on the palate. It's spine tingling and revitalizing yet lingers persistently on the finish.",92,Dr. Loosen 2014 Wehlener Sonnenuhr GG Alte Reben Grosse Lage Dry Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"Lovely citrus-heightened notes of pear color a dry, fresh, clear-cut palate. With time, the fruit gains more nuances of both tart and red apple. A beautifully balanced wine.",89,Biegler 2015 Pinot Blanc (Thermenregion),,,,

"Frothy (beware the cork upon opening), this sparkling Muscat is sweet in jasmine and vanilla that finishes clean and quick.",85,Sorelle Winery 2013 Frizzante Muscat (Lodi),,,,
"This balances crisp citrus and apple flavors with a touch of toast to make for a dry, full-bodied wine.",91,Pannier 2004 Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),,,,
"Superfresh and fennel-laced on the nose, this cool-climate Syrah shows underripe plums, raspberry, charcoal, lavender, pepper sauce, thyme and forest underbrush on the nose. It's impressively floral on the energetic, not overly dense sip, with lavender, rosehip and white sage touches enlivening the dark red fruit.",93,Melville 2014 Donna's Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"This beautiful Riserva Brunello is characterized by very good balance, enduring sensations of richness and aromatic generosity. The wine's natural density and bright berry flavors carry forth over the long finish.",93,Donatella Cinelli Colombini 2005 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,

"Notes of raw cherry, coffee syrup, ripe blackberry and moist pipe tobacco all play major roles on the bouquet. This is boldly extracted and rich, with toasted espresso and almond notes on the finish.",88,Caldora Vini 2007 Yume  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),,,,
"This wine opens with aromas of overripe black fruit, coffee, oak and hints of balsamic herbs. The palate, however, is rather tired; most of the fruit has dried up, leaving oak, espresso and alcohol sensations that finish abruptly.",84,Cantina Tollo 2009 Riserva Cagiòlo  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),,,,
"A solid structure and layers of dense fruit characterize this wine. Rich acidity, red cherry flavor and a dry, dark tannic core are surrounded by juicy red berry fruits and the freshest finish.",94,Camille Giroud 2008 Charmes Chambertin  (Charmes-Chambertin),,,,
"Attractive and herbaceous, this has an apple flavor that's laced with a citrus note. Fresh and crisp, it's fruity, forward and can be consumed now.",86,Wines & Winemakers 2011 Samora Branco White (Tejo),,,,
"A top-flight Cab-Merlot from Hawkes Bay, Te Awa's 2007 is loaded with plum and cassis, dressed up by elegant oak-derived notes of vanilla and baking spices. It's full-bodied, lush and layered in texture, with a long velvety finish. So good now, the only question is how long it will last. Drink now–2015.",91,Te Awa 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Hawke's Bay),,,,

"Alluring scents of Spanish broom, iris, berry and a hint of dried herb come together on this. The bright palate offers candied cherry, nectarine zest, white pepper and a hint of fennel while a mineral note signals the finish.",90,Tornatore 2015 Rosato (Etna),,,,
"Fruity is the best way to describe this young wine that shows touches of weight and darkness but mostly simple, fresh, lightly candied berry aromas and flavors. There's crispness and intensity to the palate, while the finish is clean.",88,Paco Garcia 2011 Seis  (Rioja),,,,
"High toned red fruit, cola, and baking spice notes are revealed after some vigorous swirling in this initially shy wine. Tightly wound tannins on the palate are balanced by a good lick of acidity and fairly prominent oak.",85,Nga Waka 2015 Three Canoes Lease Block Pinot Noir (Martinborough),,,,
"This has rather light aromas of red cherries and raspberries, mildly rich fruit flavors and a texture that's half silky and half firmly tannic. Those traits add up to deliciousness and good balance.",88,3 Ball 2012 Zinfandel (California),,,,
"Briny like lime salt, this coastal wine is lovely in stony mineral and tart oak. Medium bodied and moderate in acidity, it refreshes in a context of refinement and grace.",91,Boheme 2014 Taylor Ridge Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Goes down so easy; if you can't get away to Cancun for vacation, this is the next best thing. This is a tropical Chardonnay if ever there was one, with pineapple and melon notes on the palate, and with pineapple and coconut on the nose. Finishes dry, with some citrus peel.",86,Riverina Estates 2001 Warburn Chardonnay (New South Wales),,,,
"A dark, ruby-colored rosé with aromas of blueberry, raspberry and fresh lavender flower. It's an intense wine with good complexity, density and long-lasting flavors of almond and berry fruit. Pair it with heavy fish dishes like cod or mackerel.",87,Cataldi Madonna 2005 Piè delle Vigne Cerasuolo Rosè  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),,,,
"A fruity, lemon-scented wine, this is attractively crisp, with the bright acidity of the vintage. Drinkable now, or age for a year.",85,Roux Père et Fils 2010  Bourgogne,,,,
"Earthy aromas of underbrush, tobacco and new leather lead the way while the structured, spicy palate offers Morello cherry, clove, ground pepper and licorice. Firm, refined tannins provide the framework.",91,Poderi Colla 2012 Bussia Dardi Le Rose  (Barolo),,,,
"A riper aspect of Bosc pear plays about this Grüner. The palate, however, reins this back in with punchy, zesty flavors of arugula, lemon rind and green pear. There is quite some concentration on the core as well as real verve and nerve.",90,Hirsch 2015 Hirschvegnügen Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),,,,
"Scents and flavors suggest dried grain and cracker, along with black cherry fruit. At first, the wine flattens out in the midpalate, but ample breathing puts more fruit and flesh on its frame.",87,Schmidt 2012 Syrah (Applegate Valley),,,,
"Not many wineries hold back Syrah this long, but it must have been because the wine was so tannic. It's still pretty tannic and dry. But there's enough sweet blackberry, currant and cherry fruit to satisfy, especially with char-broiled beef.",85,Montevina 2003 Terra d'Oro Syrah (Amador County),,,,
"The Grandlieu lake, to the west of the Sèvre et Maine Muscadet vineyards, produces softer wines, like this. This wine is ripe, with hints of toast and vanilla as well as fresh and crisp apple acidity. It's a full-bodied, rounded wine that is just ready to drink and will be better from 2016.",91,Domaine de l'Aujardière 2013 La Noë Sur Lie  (Muscadet Côtes de Grandlieu),,,,
There's a strong mineral component that recalls ash or dusty stone; it is backed by mature notes of peach and melon. It's sweetish and fruity in the mouth but finishes dry.,85,Poderi del Paradiso 2007  Vernaccia di San Gimignano,,,,
"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Syrah, this wine offers aromas of dark plums, blackberry, dark chocolate and asphalt, with floral and spice top notes. The fruit flavors are sweet and approachable, backed by lightly chalky tannins.",90,Matthews 2012 Blackboard Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A field blend from old-style Port vineyards where as many as 27 grape varieties grow all mixed up. The result is a surprisingly traditional style, with fruitiness combining with a dark and tannic character. It is sweet, the raisin fruitiness a signature.",88,Quinta do Portal NV Twenty Seven Grapes Reserve  (Port),,,,
"This smells a bit stalky and murky, without much pop or freshness to the nose. A medium-bodied palate feels about right, while this tastes earthy, stalky and like roasted plum. Herbal notes come up on the finish.",85,Árido 2012 Sustainably Farmed Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"It must be unique to find any Bordeaux in a Burgundy style bottle. Certainly this ultra-rich wine owes much to Burgundian Chardonnay. But under the sweet fruit, there is no mistaking the Muscadelle perfume and spice that give a bite, a dry, peppery finish and a very different character",90,Chateau de Launay 2009 Les Vignes d'Elisa  (Bordeaux Blanc),,,,
"A good value in a super-oaky Chardonnay, brimming with pineapple, vanilla and butterscotch flavors that finish sweet and clean.",83,Snap Dragon 2007 Chardonnay (California),,,,

"From vines situated on the plain below the Saint-Émilion slopes, this wine has firm tannins against a soft, fruity backdrop.

"New wood gives this wine a polished feel, its berry fruits pushing through dense tannins. It is balanced in the sense that fruit and wood are coming well together, but this impressive wine needs several years' aging.",93,Casa Cadaval 2007 Marquesa de Cadaval Red (Tejo),,,,
"This Cabernet is a mixed bag. It's oaky and also fruity, but a little vegetal, with some green notes alongside sweet raspberry and cherry candy and caramel flavors. A real disappointment, coming after a series of good bottlings, but the vintage was difficult.",86,Knights Bridge 2010 Beckstoffer Dr. Crane Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena),,,,
"Arnione, a blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Petit Verdot, packs heat and intensity and is a beautifully integrated and generous wine. Thick extraction is accented by chocolate, cherry, leather, cigar, liquid vanilla and root beer. It's tight in the mouth with bright fruit flavors. Drink after 2015.",94,Campo alla Sughera 2004 Arnione  (Bolgheri Superiore),,,,

Drying wood tannins give an astringent and abrupt finish.",90,Vietti 2010 Lazzarito  (Barolo),,,,
"This fine, ageworthy wine is rounded, smooth and full of ripe yellow fruit.

"Perfumed berry, rose, new leather and dark spice are some of the enticing scents you'll find in this vibrant wine. It's still tightly wound but already dazzles with juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, nutmeg and pipe tobacco flavors. Youthfully austere but noble tannins and bright acidity provide balance and serious aging potential. Don't be tempted to open it soon—the best is yet to come. Drink 2022–2042.",99,Il Marroneto 2012 Madonna delle Grazie  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"The inviting scent and flavour of green but ripe Conference pears sloshes joyously around the palate on this fruit-foward, easy and fluid wine. With its light but fruit-driven body it just seems to have been made for a summer party and spells easy joy and fun.",88,Dürnberg 2015 Falkenstein Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel),,,,
"A blend of Chenin Blanc, Cabernet Franc and Chardonnay, this is a round, mouthfilling sparkling wine with ripe apple flavors layered with grapefruit acidity and a tight, final texture that is crisp and mineral.",90,Langlois-Chateau NV Brut Sparkling (Crémant de Loire),,,,
"There's a subtle oak component to this wine, hinting at toast and vanilla, but the main thrust of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc remains intact, driving forward with sweaty, pungent notes, prickly pear and pink grapefruit. Drink it over the next couple of years.",91,Marisco Vineyards 2013 Craft Series Pride & Glory Waihopai River Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,

"This isn't the greatest Long Meadow Ranch Cabernet ever, but it is a very fine wine, considering the cool vintage, and shows the winemaker's ability to play with the cards he was dealt. The wine is dry, with rich tannins framing blackberry, currant and cherry flavors with earthy hints of sage and tea. Drink now–2018.",90,Long Meadow Ranch 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"This Syrah is really attractive upfront, with aromas of sweet pastry crust, baked plum, licorice and cracked pepper. The plum and blackberry fruit is balanced by some savory elements on the palate, which doesn't show a lot of weight or length. A pretty wine to drink over the next couple of years.",87,Gunn Estate 2007 Silistria Syrah (Hawke's Bay),,,,
"This is a yeasty offering that's full on the palate, with a rich mousse. Yellow and white fruits contribute to its richness, a touch of bitterness balanced with the fruity acidity. Drink now, or age for a year.",87,Wunsch & Mann 2009 Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),,,,
"From fruit grown in Avize and Aÿ, this pure Chardonnay is mineral textured while also full of ripe fruit. Ripe apples contrast with zingy acidity that gives a good lift at the end. This is a delicious wine to drink now.",90,Lallier NV Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),,,,
This serious wine is beginning to mature. Its spicy wood and mint flavors are now integrating with the rich structure. The finish is bright in a final burst of fruit. Drink from 2018.,90,Barton & Guestier 2012 Thomas Barton Réserve Privée  (Médoc),,,,
"Deep plum and sweet tobacco leaf aromas mesh with sour and candied blueberry in this layered and luxurious wine from Petite Sirah specialists MCV. The palate is pleasantly broad, with chocolate and smoked cactus flavors, reminiscent of tequila. Both the tannins and acidity are proper and smooth.",93,MCV 2012 Rosewynn Vineyard Petite Sirah (Paso Robles),,,,
"Austere and slightly bittersweet at the start, this wine evolves into flavors of lemon and lime around large wrappings of oak that give it a woody taste. The finish is lean and brief.",86,Stickybeak 2013 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This is a structured wine, probably because of the Touriga Nacional in the blend. That also gives a perfumed edge to this ripe, full wine with its juicy red fruit acidity. It is fruity and will be ready to drink from late 2016.",86,Caves Velhas 2015 Casaleiro Colheita Seleccionada Red (Tejo),,,,
"This big, bold red in a leopard-spotted bottle is made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, and it's powerfully concentrated with tobacco aromas, boulder-sized tannins and cherry-like fruitiness. Ancillary sparks of cedar and sage contribute intrigue.",91,JCB 2014 Leopard Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Grassy, green aromas are dull and fruitless. The palate is citric at first but then it collapses. Flavors of citrus and tarragon finish bland and with vegetal leanings.",82,Trapiche 2013 Broquel Chardonnay (Mendoza),,,,
"Pungent, high-pitched notes of turmeric and dried flower hit the nose first, with underlying scents of tobacco, char and cassis.

"Made with organically farmed grapes, this pretty Tuscan blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot offers a deliciously succulent taste profile with aromas of smoked meat, leather, tobacco and loads of black fruit.

There's no mind-blowing complexity but it delivers just the right amount of fruit, freshness and structure for effortless drinking pleasure.",89,Castello San Donato in Perano 2010  Chianti Classico,,,,
"Outcrop was planted in 1982. A hint of leather (not too much) along with scents of sassafras and crushed roses, open into a peppery palate with cranberries and red fruits. Ample acidity carries it into a penetrating finish. Drink 2020 through 2035 and beyond.",92,The Eyrie Vineyards 2013 Outcrop Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),,,,
"Juicy black plum finds a robust tension of tar, licorice and meat in a full-bodied expression of this grape, more usually found in blends in the Napa Valley than standing on its own. This one achieves a balance between power and smoky succulence.",90,Rutherford Hill 2013 Malbec (Napa Valley),,,,
"Smoky and a bit stark with whiffs of struck flint and stone. This off-dry Riesling is piercing on the palate with nervy lime-juice and lime-skin flavors. The finish is medium long, ending on a softly floral, crushed-stone note.",86,McGregor 2010 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This opens with aromas suggesting underbrush, tobacco and a whiff of cooking spice. The dense, full-bodied palate offers dark berry, licorice, vanilla and a hint of oak alongside bracing tannins. A hint of sage closes the finish.",90,Aldo Conterno 2012 Bussia Colonnello  (Barolo),,,,
"Still a little closed, this does not yet want to give too much away of its ripe, almost sumptuous flavors. The palate however, signals that all is there: concentration, balance and rich fruit cut through with ample freshness. Yeasty savoriness and white pepper play on the midpalate. This will open up. Drink as of 2017.",94,Eichinger 2013 Lamm Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),,,,
"The wine is fruity, tangy with spice. It has acidity to balance its sweetness with attractive open raisin and prune fruits. The aftertaste is crisp and rich with toffee",88,Niepoort NV The Senior Tawny  (Port),,,,
"The purity of fruit is the most striking aspect of this wine. While it is relatively light in texture, it revels in its fresh red-fruited character that gives an impressive intensity. With balanced touches of tannin and acidity, the wine should age well.",90,Domaine Emmanuel Giboulot 2009 Lulune  (Beaune),,,,
"A rich and creamy sort of Malbec that pours on the weight, extract and oaky, coconutty character. The palate is syrupy, with huge flavors of roasted berry, molasses and sweet spices. Arguably on the baked and heavy side, but definitely a rich, huge wine with just enough core acidity to keep it balanced.",89,Siesta 2007 Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
"Tangy black cherry and cassis flavors are punchy and penetrating in this Bordeaux-style blend (with an emphasis on Cabernet Sauvignon). It's richly, densely textured, but uplifted by a strike of cranberry acidity and granite. It's a polished wine with a long, meandering finish.",90,Damiani 2012 Meritage (Finger Lakes),,,,
"88-90 Barrel sample. Finely structured, a wine that boasts great fresh fruits, firm tannins and berry fruits. The wine is structured with considerable acidity.",89,Château La Mission Haut-Brion 2009 La Chapelle de la Mission Haut-Brion Barrel sample  (Pessac-Léognan),,,,
"As rich and intense as the same producer's Non Vintage Brut, this is a ripe finely textured wine, its acidity giving great freshness to the red berry fruits. Grand Cru vineyards speak tellingly.",90,P. Louis Martini NV Bouzy Grand Cru Brut Rosé  (Champagne),,,,
"91-93 Powerfully tannic wine, the dryness balanced with sumptuous fruit. The wine shows balance, although the tannins are a major element.",92,Château de Pez 2010 Barrel sample  (Saint-Estèphe),,,,
"This vineyard, and the AVA it occupies, is often characterized by some sharp metallic mineral-driven flavors. Here it seems just marginally ripe, with beet, black tea and metal dominating the astringent finish.",87,Soléna 2015 Hyland Vineyard Pinot Noir (McMinnville),,,,
"This is the last vintage of a joint venture between J M da Fonseca and Cristiano van Zeller (the 2005 is a solo production by J M da Fonseca). It's a dry, dark, structured wine, with some minerality, full of ripe black plums and concentrated tannins.",91,J.M. da Fonseca and Van Zeller 2004 Domini Red (Douro),,,,
"Young and precise, this balances flavors of wild raspberries against a mineral foundation. Suggestions of wet stone and a dash of brown spices come through, with lots of supporting acidity. As it fades, there's a lick of chocolate from aging in 29% new French oak.",90,Adelsheim 2013 Zenith Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),,,,
"Solid white-fruit aromas blend with a grassy note of hay as well as dusty floral scents. A smooth mouthfeel is devoid of edginess, while friendly white peach, melon and apple flavors are round on the finish.",88,Lonia NV Brut Reserva Selección de la Familia Sparkling (Cava),,,,
"Lean and racy, typical of the Saar even at these high ripeness levels, with hints of slate and mint or tea gracing pineapple fruit. The long, vibrant finish is crisp and mouthwatering, with the residual sugar dropping into the background. Drink now-2030+.",93,Schloss Saarstein 2007 Auslese Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer),,,,
"This blend of 60% Carmenère and 40% Carignan opens with campfire, cassis, chocolate, oak and minty aromas. A wall of acidity greets you on the palate, creating a clampy, rough feel. In terms of flavor, oak is up front and behind that there's graphite and minty, herbal fruit in front of a finish with tobacco, vanilla and length.",88,Vistamar 2009 Enki Carmenère-Carignan Red (Central Valley),,,,
"Good and delicious, but so ripe, soft and oaky, whatever terroir that Spring Mountain contributed has largely been obscured. With lip-smacking black currant, chocolate and anise flavors, the wine is made in an anonymous international style.",86,Amicus by X Winery 2005 Special Blend Red (Spring Mountain District),,,,
There's a modern touch to this wine thanks to its generous and long-lasting tones of espresso bean and chocolate backed by fruity cherry aromas. Beyond those standard characteristics are tones of dried herbs that recall coastal Tuscany. It's huge in structure but should also be ready to drink in two or three years.,91,Castello di Bolgheri 2004  Bolgheri Superiore,,,,
This is a crisp cherry-flavored wine. Cool-climate Pinot Noir has a light texture that gives the wine a hint of tannins although it is much more about fruit and bright acidity. Drink now.,85,Domaine de Reuilly 2015 Pinot Noir (Reuilly),,,,
"The wine comes from the Grand Cru village of Chouilly in the Chardonnay vineyards of the Côte des Blancs. It is crisp, mineral textured and still developing. Bright acidity and lemon-zest flavors give this wine its lively and also full-bodied character. Drink from 2018.",92,A.R. Lenoble  NV Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs Chouilly Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),,,,
"This Rosso represents a blend of Sangiovese (60%) with equal parts Sagrantino and Barbera. The wine offers meats and chewy cherry flavors with accents of spice and leather followed by a rich, velvety texture.",88,Tabarrini 2009  Montefalco Rosso,,,,
"Fragrant, fresh and loaded with finesse, this blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot opens with scents of fragrant blue flowers, perfumed berry and a whiff of pine forest. The bright, silky palate delivers crunchy red currants, juicy raspberries and white pepper. It's nicely balanced, with firm, polished tannins and lively acidity. Drink 2016–2022.",93,Tenuta San Guido 2013 Guidalberto Red (Toscana),,,,
"The grapes were grown on the Central Coast, mostly in Arroyo Grande, and the wine is characterized by vibrant acidity. There is an intense taste of raspberries, more usually found in a red variety like Grenache than a white wine, but Grenache Blanc consitutes nearly half the blend, along with Roussanne.",87,Bonny Doon 2005 Le Cigar Blanc White (California),,,,
"This wine is stylish, with layers of wood, black currant notes and a structure that will allow the juicy fruitiness to develop relatively quickly. It's balanced, with fruit, texture and acidity all coming together. Drink from 2016.",91,Prats & Symington LDA 2012 Post Scriptum de Chryseia Red (Douro),,,,
"Dark and roasted scents introduce this firm, tannic, rather muscular Syrah. There is a citrusy acidity underscoring the mix of mineral, earth and brambly berry, along with a slight suggestion of bacon fat. This has the fine-tuned structure to age for another half decade or longer.",91,Novelty Hill 2010 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Made from Cortese grapes from northern Italy, this bright and easy white wine offers drying mineral notes that frame a solid core of yellow fruit and citrus. The wine is light, lean and washes down beautifully.",86,Natale Verga 2012 Verga Collection  (Gavi),,,,
"A respectable effort, this offers attractive aromas of fig, melon and nectarine, but doesn't follow through with much intensity on the palate. It's light to medium in body, with hints of citrus pith and a bit of bitterness on the finish.",85,Stonecrop 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Martinborough),,,,
"From the Vogelsang, or “bird song” vineyard, this wine sings melodiously. It has bright green and citrus fruits, lively acidity and a crisp, dancing feel. There is a youthful feel to the acidity that demands a year in bottle. Screwcap.",89,Bründlmayer 2012 Berg Vogelsang Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),,,,
"Clean, brisk and balanced, with good varietal flavors of pineapples, limes, peaches and exotic tropical fruits, brightened with zesty acidity. This is a good price for a classic California Chardonnay.",87,Irony 2008 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),,,,
"Can Blau's wines are always black in color and fully extracted. This is no different, and its aromas of boysenberry and wood smoke are inviting. Full, flush and meaty on the palate, this multigrape blend pours on the black plum, blackberry and boysenberry flavors, while the finish is dense and chocolaty. Drink through 2020.",90,Can Blau 2012 Red (Montsant),,,,
"Kalbarri's Cab boasts plenty of red-berry flavors and a soft, easygoing, maybe even slightly sweet, finish.",83,Kalbarri 2006 Bin Select 513 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Eastern Australia),,,,
"This is a smooth-textured, medium- to full-bodied wine loaded with scents of cedar and spice. Red berry fruit emerges on the palate and lingers alongside the cedar notes on the long finish. Drink now–2020.",91,Kilikanoon 2009 The Duke Grenache (Clare Valley),,,,
"Funky, oaky aromas are low on fruit and fail to strike the high notes. Racy but heavy on the palate, this tastes oaky, earthy and lightly fruity.",84,Morandé 2014 Gran Reserva Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"Creamy, herbal freshness shines in this wine, recalling yeast and sage, lemon zest and aloe vera. The palate is sprightly and fresh, delivering loads of lemon and lime flavor in its slender, easy frame. A slight spritz makes it even more refreshing.",90,Hermann Moser 2016 Karmeliterberg Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),,,,
"The name of the wine says a lot about its structure. It definitely has a mineral tang to it although the ripe yellow fruits do give it a soft cushion. The acidity however makes it crisp, refreshing and ready to drink.",87,Cave des Grands Crus Blancs 2015 Minéral  (Mâcon-Loché),,,,
"This offers aromas of raisin, mature black fruit and spice. The palate is very lush and ripe, with plum and black cherry flavors layered with oak, chocolate, vanilla and espresso accents. It might not have much personality or complexity, but the flavors are defined and alluring.",88,Ca' Rugate 2009  Amarone della Valpolicella,,,,
"A grassy hint of freshness accents this wine's ripe green and red apple-inflected nose. The palate is slightly dilute, but a touch of spritz and herbal spiciness make it fun and easy to drink. Fruit-driven and slender in body, it finishes refreshing and dry.",88,Martinshof 2016 Gemischter Satz White (Niederösterreich),,,,
"Though billed as a Super Tuscan, this is an odd but refreshing wine for those seeking something different. The Cab-Sangio blend offers strong black pepper, brambleberry, pink peppercorns and a touch of pasilla chile on the underripe nose. The palate is light in body but full of bright cranberry fruit and intriguing herbals, led by green peppercorns.",88,Bella Luna 2011 Estate Riserva Cabernet Sauvignon-Sangiovese (Templeton Gap District),,,,
"Tight, crisp and mineral driven, this wine has citrus fruits and a steely texture, demonstrating that it needs to age for a year.",87,Château de Bonhoste 2011  Bordeaux Blanc,,,,
"Viader has a long history of producing great Bordeaux-style blends grown at a high elevation on Howell Mountain. This 2010 is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, with almost the same percentages as the superb 2009 bottling. The wine is rich, dry and complex. It shows a fantastic array of blackberries, dates and dark chocolate, with fascinating notes of lavender and dill. The tannins are gorgeous, the acidity fine, and the application of oak is deft. It's hard to describe just how good this wine feels in the mouth. Drink now, after decanting, or within the next 20 years.",97,Viader 2010 Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Mainly Pinot Noir with a touch of Gamay, this is a crisp red-currant flavored wine. It comes from northern Burgundy giving a cool character to this fruity wine. The acidity and the orange zest at the end are really refreshing.",88,Bailly-Lapierre NV Rosé Brut  (Crémant de Bourgogne),,,,
"Blackberry, black currant and toasty oak make for a dark, charred, manly nose. This is full but not heavy, with racy acidity and firm tannins. Blackberry, baked plum and savory flavors finish with notes of prune and leather as well as salted cured meat. Drink through 2022.",92,Consejo de la Alta 2011 Cata de Consejero  (Rioja),,,,
"Aromas of forest floor, cassis and blackberry are solid, smooth and inviting. In the mouth, this wine shows penetrating acidity and controlled sharpness. Flavors of cherry, plum and mixed berries are propelled by acidity, and that's also how this ends.",88,Bodega Catena Zapata 2015 High Mountain Vines Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),,,,
"Cigar box, green olive, herbal notes and field scents define the bouquet on this single-vineyard Cabernet. With bright acidity, the palate displays raciness along with oak-driven flavors of chocolate, mint, vanilla and herbal berry fruits. A lasting finish is spicy, herbal and mildly green in flavor.",88,Michel Torino 2011 Don David Finca la Urquiza #8 Cabernet Sauvignon (Cafayate),,,,
"This is a refreshing picnic wine with light acidity, touches of pears and some sweetness. Its low alcohol makes it great for summer sunshine.",85,Louis Perdrier NV Brut Excellence Sparkling (Vin Mousseux),,,,
"Ripe, rounded and grassy varietal flavors set this apart from more slender offerings of the new world. This is Sauvignon Blanc from a continental climate, with substance and roundness that puts flesh on the bones of this sleek variety. This is ideal for pairing with soft, washed-rind cheeses.",88,Manfred Tement 2012 Berghausener Sauvignon Blanc (Südsteiermark),,,,
"From the Ranch House block of the famous vineyard, this fleshy, lushly layered wine made by Kenneth Juhasz, is robust with cardamom and strawberry flavors. It builds intensity as it opens, revealing a velvety texture.",91,Dunstan 2014 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Stylish and complex, with its fleshy pear fruit set in a frame of bracing minerality, this is a wine of lucid clarity. It conveys the depth of looking into a deep, transparent mountain spring, with that same tongue-tickling minerality.",91,King Estate 2013 Domaine Pinot Gris (Oregon),,,,
"A nose of lemon, tropical fruit and flowers gives this vibrant Chardonnay from Chateau Julia a clean start. Lively with fresh fruit and floral flavors, it's crisp with depth. A great food wine—or one to sip alone.",88,Domaine Costa Lazaridi 2008 Château Julia Chardonnay (Drama),,,,
"This blend of Sangiovese and Sagrantino is aged in tonneaux and offers aromas of black berry, cherry and oak. The palate has a vibrant black-cherry core accented by pepper, cinnamon and espresso notes, as well as bracing yet ripe tannins.",87,Inalto 2011  Montefalco Rosso,,,,
"Made from Sangiovese, this savory wine opens with earthy underbrush and berry aromas, accented by a whiff of spice. The palate offers bright cherry layered with licorice and espresso notes. Pair this with pasta topped with meat sauces.",87,Fossacolle 2011  Rosso di Montalcino,,,,
"From a tough vintage, this has friendly flavors of chocolate-chip cookie dough and walnuts. The chocolaty character, which is far more noticeable than the fruit, helps to mitigate the tough, chewy tannins. Drink soon.",87,Raptor Ridge 2011 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Loaded with dark cherry earth, this is a dense, drinkable Pinot Noir. From a tiny Watsonville-based producer who sources from all over the state to make a handful of different wines.",86,"MICA Cellars 2010 Smith Road Vineyards, Rows 2–5 Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)",,,,
"High toast and burnt wood are initially off-putting. The tannins in the wine are also on the smoky side. However, there is fruit here, offering some balance in this powerful, dry wine, and giving some blackberry juiciness, which gives relief from the intensity of the wood.",87,Château Lagarosse 2006 Les Comtes  (Premieres Côtes de Bordeaux),,,,
"All spice, juicy fruit and dry tannins, this certainly evokes the spirit of the grape. There is a mineral quality to the red berry fruits, which comes through in the youthful, firm edge. Give this wine another two years so the  fruit will open up.",88,Quinta de Ventozelo 2004 Touriga Franca (Douro),,,,
"Crisp and lively, this starts with soft scents of pink peony and thyme that add depth and interest to the citrus, pear and tropical fruit core. Medium acidity lifts the palate and carries through to the mouthwatering finish. Drink now.",87,Buitenverwachting 2016 Beyond Sauvignon Blanc (Constantia),,,,
"This wonderful Brunello opens with sultry aromas of black fruit, cherry, spice, leather and tobacco. It's a rich and penetrating wine with a soft, lush mouthfeel and a hint of crisp acidity on the close. You'll want to keep this treasure in your cellar for a few more years.",93,Argiano 2006 L'Orciaia  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"Lightweight, very herbal Sauvignon Blanc, full of green fruits, lemon zest and refreshing acidity. Ready to drink, it finishes as fresh as can be. Screwcap.",85,Guy Saget 2010 La Petite Perrière Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de France),,,,
"Blueberries, smoke and pepper-crusted beef aromas emerge on this solid offering. There's a lot happening on the palate, with flavors of tobacco, blackberries, dark plums and purple flowers, all grounded in tart plum-skin tannins.",88,Callaway 2010 Winemaker's Reserve Syrah (Temecula Valley),,,,
"A solid value, the Marquee Victoria Chardonnay has an appealing restraint, hitting pretty high notes on the nose but turning serious and weighty in the mouth. The cream and papaya flavors reach a nice intensity before fading to a mouthwatering finish of guava and pine nuts. Drink now.",86,Marquee 2008 Classic Chardonnay (Victoria),,,,
"Deep ruby to the eye, this wine offers rich aromas of cherry, black licorice and orange rind and flavors of blackberry, black cherry, cassis, anisette and eucalyptus. Long-lasting tannins coat the mouth but there is always a sense of fresh fruit on the palate and a brightness that lingers right into the satisfying finish.",92,Recanati 2013 Merlot (Galilee),,,,
"The aromas are bright, with notes of peach and flowers that display a sense of delicacy. The flavors are light but nuanced, displaying a fine sense of balance.",89,Brian Carter Cellars 2014 One Olsen Vineyard Viognier (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Tastes constructed and manipulated, with sugary-sweet pineapple and mango flavors and an acidity that seems unnaturally tart. Finishes with a candy, granola sweetness.",84,Heliodoro 2009 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Violet, lavender, mulberry, black cherry, cola, graphite and a touch of sarsaparilla lead the nose on this bottling from this vineyard planted in 1997. Tart cranberry, pencil lead, dried orange rind, bay leaf, fennel and bay leaf all show on the palate, which is tremendously grippy and offers strong depth way into the finish.",92,Sanford 2013 La Rinconada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"The cold and fog actually helped this Chardonnay, which achieves a remarkable delicacy and tartness despite the power of its fruit. Really remarkable for the flood of golden mango, Asian pear and Key lime pie richness, which is grounded by a firm minerality. Oak influence and aging on the lees lend the perfect touches of smoky, buttered toast and zesty creaminess to this dry, polished wine. A mere 587 cases were produced.",97,Dutton-Goldfield 2010 Dutton Ranch Rued Vineyard Chardonnay (Green Valley),,,,
"This concentrated Pinot Noir calibrates power with finesse, juxtaposing rippling black cherry and berry flavors against complex mineral and earth tones. It's luscious and layered in mouthfeel, enriched over four years of extended lees contact. While decadently delicious now, it has enough structure to age elegantly through 2019–2021.",92,Shaw 2009 Reserve Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),,,,
"Bell pepper and sharp red fruit aromas provide a shaky start, which is followed by cranberry, tart cherry and other pointed flavors. The feel is racy and tight, with gritty acids. Airing does improve it somewhat. Tasted twice; this is a review of the better bottle. Cabernet, Merlot, Cab Franc and Carmenère is the blend. From Brazil.",82,Aurora Cellars 2004 Proprietary Red Red (Serra Gaúcha),,,,
"Violet, rose, perfumed berry and a whiff of sweet cake spice are some of the enticing scents you'll find on this impressive wine. On the delicious palate, notes of clove, cinnamon, mocha, licorice and raspberry weave seamlessly throughout the juicy black cherry core. It's elegantly structured, with fresh acidity and firm, ripe tannins. Drink 2020–2036.",95,Castello di Verduno 2011 Massara  (Barolo),,,,
"Cherry, plum and balsam-wood aromas make for a good opening. This wine feels full, with cheek-grabbing tannins. Flavors of woodspice, cherry and plum hold appeal, but this feels a bit hot on the finish, with residual oak.",88,Viñestral 2014 Crianza  (Rioja),,,,
"A well-balanced wine that both shows an herbaceous character and a ripe, full flavor that brings in yellow fruits and green plums. It has a well-judged hint of spice from wood aging to give extra richness. Drink from 2013.",88,Château Magnol 2012 Les Charmes de Magnol  (Bordeaux Blanc),,,,
"Pressed apple and pears seem to be dusted in pollen and saffron on the nose of this savory, spicy Riesling. It's off dry and delicate in style, but concentrated in lip smacking tangerine and lime flavors. Dusty, earthy tones persist through the moderately long finish.",89,Dr. Pauly Bergweiler 2013 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"This Brunello Riserva is defined by a layer of coffee and espresso that peels back nicely to reveal dark fruit, cassis, leather and tobacco. It's smooth, ripe, fresh and structured.",92,Altesino 2006 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"This is an elegant, cinnamon-spicy Cabernet from Corey Beck, the head winemaker for Francis Ford Coppola. Balanced and soft, it has a texturally pleasing mouthfeel of velvety herb and cassis and a fully realized, lingering finish.",91,C. Beck 2010 Barlow Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
New wood flavors go over the structured fruit and give currant flavors. It is already coming into balance and is for medium-term aging. The vineyard is on the plain beneath the hill of Saint-Émilion.,87,Château de la Cour 2009  Saint-Émilion,,,,
"Attractively herbaceous, this is a crisp, light and bright wine. Tight green fruits and plenty of acidity give it a juicy character that makes it refreshing. Drink now. This is one of 15 Bordeaux chateaus by Crus and Domaines de France.",86,Château Mezain 2015  Bordeaux Blanc,,,,
"Coming from Wautoma Winds and SageCliffe vineyards, this wine offers notes of burnt toast, stone fruit and sweet corn. It's broad and lightly creamy in feel with abundant apple and stone fruit flavors.",88,Patterson 2013 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This wine is powerful and full bodied, from the cocoa and raspberry-syrup aromas to the potent blackberry and Port-like flavors. It needs to pair with some aged cheese or a juicy cut of beef.",86,Amador Cellars 2013 Reserve Red (Amador County),,,,
"This sweet wine smells like ripe plums and tastes fresh, grapy and sugary, with a little sparkle in the texture. It's quite sweet on the finish, too.",86,Moscato Rubino 2014 Sweet Red Muscat (California),,,,
"There's no doubt this estate-grown wine is at first funky on the nose, a mix of forest, mint and farmhouse cheese. It develops in the glass to embrace its quirks, complementing them with vibrant acidity, ripe texture, and hints of orange, rhubarb and spicy clove.",92,Acacia 2013 Winery Lake Vineyard Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Carneros),,,,
"By sourcing French Colombard and force carbonating like beer, David Potter made this fun and tasty wine as an antidote to the high prices that sparkling wine traditionally require. Aromas of apple cider, crisp Granny Smith apples, key lime, yellow melon and chalk lead into a palate laced with fatter bubbles and flavors of more apple and pear.",90,Municipal Winemakers 2016 Mubbly Sparkling (California),,,,
"Roasted and rubbery on the nose, this has herb and leaf accents. It feels thick, chunky and a bit syrupy, with flavors of herb, mint and roasted blackberry. This turns grittier on the finish, with bacon, hickory and rubbery flavors. A blend of 50% Monastrell and 50% Syrah.",84,Nabuko 2009 Monastrell-Syrah (Yecla),,,,
"On first take, this small-batch blend of País and Cinsault is overtly oaky, with earthy berry and plum notes lurking in the background. A drawing tannic palate lets you know that País is in the house, while this tastes of oaky berry and plum. On the finish, this is more resiny and woody than toasty. Only 235 cases made. Drink through 2021.",90,Undurraga 2015 T.H. Terroir Hunter Rarities País-Cinsault La Soledad Red (Cauquenes Valley),,,,
"A big, dry, immature wine, firm in acids and tannins, whose strong black pepper notes add to its tart pungency. Underneath all that are immaculate blackberry and roasted meat flavors. Impressive for the price, and should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",91,White Oak 2006 Syrah (Napa Valley),,,,
"This opens with aromas of spring flowers, tropical fruit and a whiff of peach. The vibrant palate delivers creamy Granny Smith apple, underripe pear and a citrus note alongside bright acidity and a creamy mousse.",87,La Gioiosa NV Extra Dry  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
"Full of tropical fruit flavors, this is rounded, ripe and very accessible. At the same time, its structure shows through in the tang of green apple skin, judicious wood aging and taut aftertaste.",94,Château de Fieuzal 2009  Pessac-Léognan,,,,
"This is a serious, firmly structured wine, impressively rich as well as tannic. Black fruits push through the considerable structure, offering balance as the wine ages. It is young now, with hints of mint from wood aging. Powerfully textured, give this 4–5 years.",92,Jean-Luc Baldès 2009 Château Labrande Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"Perfumed with violet, fragrant ripe berry, leather, dark spice and a balsamic note, this is a textbook Nebbiolo. The elegant palate offers Morello cherry, cranberry, white pepper and star anise while firm but ultrarefined tannins provide support. It's already delicious but has the structure to cellar for several years or more. Drink 2017–2026.",93,Produttori del Barbaresco 2011 Ovello Riserva  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Tannic and dry, this turns twiggy and earthy on the finish. There's a burst of acid-inspired black-cherry flavor on the midpalate.",86,Coho 2009 Stanly Ranch Pinot Noir (Los Carneros),,,,
"Intensely fruity and subtle in oak, this wine is smooth and juicy, with a pronounced sense of cherry and strawberry. Substantive tannin provides weight and breadth, along with a grippy, leathery finish.",88,Kobler 2014 Campbell-McKinney Vineyards Grenache (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This Syrah is bone dry, tannic and simple. The blackberry jam and pepper flavors are tasty, but unable to rise above the astringency. Drink now.",84,San Simeon 2008 Syrah (Paso Robles),,,,
"This is a classy Albariño with lemon, melon and minerally aromas that come across pure. The mouth is round and elegant, with layers of texture. Pure lemon and apple flavors have sweetness as well as cut, and the finish is powerful and offers a touch of green-herb flavor. Drink this complete wine right away.",90,Adega dos Eidos 2011 Eidos de Padriñan Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"This wine is full and opulent, and its yellow fruit is at the fore. The ripeness is tempered by the complex notes of spice and almond as well as the taut, steely acidity. Age for at least four years.",94,Bründlmayer 2011 Kammerner Lamm Erste Lage Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),,,,
"Pinot Grigio Punggl opens with rich, creamy density and lovely aromas of peach, lemon zest and cantaloupe melon. That dense texture in the mouth is what sets this wine apart from the rest.",89,Nals Margreid 2010 Punggl Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige),,,,
"Classic scents of dark-skinned berry, chopped herb, dark spice and new leather take the lead in this wine. On the firm elegant palate, youthfully assertive, noble tannins support dried Marasca cherry, licorice and clove flavors while bright acidity lends balance.",92,La Spinona 2013 Bricco Faset  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Obviously a wine for Baby Boomers, this is bright and fresh, packed with red fruits and a perfect light pink color. The final taste is lively, clean and crisp.",88,Château Miraval 2009 Pink Floyd Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"Structured, dense and packed with black fruits, this is complex wine. Yet with all of its ripeness, it offers a great line of freshness and a smoky wood flavor, with blackberry-like acidity on the finish. Age for five years or more.",93,Domaine Drouhin-Laroze 2010 Lavaut Saint-Jacques Premier Cru  (Gevrey-Chambertin),,,,
"Herbal, green-leaning aromas of red berry fruits and coffee grinds come in front of a tight, restricted, rubbery feeling palate. Flavors of red plum, herbs, spice and olive finish with green-tobacco notes and raw tannins. Drink this blend of Cab Sauvignon, Carmenère, Malbec and Cab Franc through 2020.",89,Casa Donoso 2011 D Red (Maule Valley),,,,
"For 10 bucks you get a decent, 10 buck wine. Nothing fancy, just fruity, off-dry and crisply drinkable.",82,Cottonwood Creek 2010 White (California),,,,
"A good, richly flavored Cabernet that shows proper varietal character without any special qualities. Flavors of blackcurrants drink dry, wrapped in smooth tannins. May improve a bit with a few years in the cellar.",86,Imagery 1999 Sunny Slope Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"This wine's menthol, oak-driven spice, toasted oak and dried herb aromas slowly take shape. The lean palate offers sour cherry and roasted coffee flavors alongside grainy, astringent tannins that leave a tongue-drying finish.",85,Ca' del Baio 2012 Asili Riserva  (Barbaresco),,,,
"This is the only Long Island version of this white grape variety from northeastern Italy, but perhaps there should be more. Fermented in a mix of stainless steel and used wood, there's a touch of custardy richness and some dried-spice notes, but the emphasis is on clean, crisp melon, pineapple and citrus fruit. It's medium-bodied, with an appealing focus to the lingering finish that would make it an attractive pairing to many of the region's seafoods.",88,"Channing Daughters 2006 Tocai Friulano (The Hamptons, Long Island)",,,,
"Soft and one-dimensional but interesting, this Cabernet has upfront flavors of blackberry jam, black currants, anise and oak. It's dry and tannic, but doesn't have the stuffing to age. Drink now–2016.",88,Lake Sonoma 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),,,,
"This is a light, fresh Riesling with just a touch of residual sugar (at 7.5 g/l most people won't really notice it). From a sandy site, it doesn't show great power or complexity, just a pleasing mouthful of easy-to-drink lemon-lime flavors.",86,Darting 2007 Durkheimer Fronhof Kabinett Trocken Riesling (Pfalz),,,,
"A great price for this well-made Primitivo, Uvaggio opens with juicy, bright red raspberry and dark cherry flavor, stays light through the mid palate and finishes with a long lingering streak of vanilla. Dry and fresh, it'll pair perfectly with thin-crust pizza topped with basil out of the garden.",89,Uvaggio 2011 Primitivo (Lodi),,,,
"Sassy aromas of stemmy red fruits, haystack and herbs set up a full yet raw feeling palate with herbal, gr een-leaning flavors of tart plum and raspberry. A shallow finish fades quickly.",84,Bodega NQN 2011 Malma Finca la Papay Malbec (Patagonia),,,,
"Dried herb and sage provide aromatic complexity before this full, generously styled wine takes on deeper, richer flavors of boysenberry, graphite and cedar. Soft oak and tannin provide approachability amid moderate structure.",88,St. Supéry 2013 Dollarhide Elevation Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Made of 85% Sangiovese and 15% Canaiolo, this opens with violet and leather aromas. The savory, straightforward palate offers mature black cherry, sage and anise flavors, supported by lithe tannins. Enjoy through 2020.",89,Pietro Beconcini 2013 Riserva  (Chianti),,,,
"This brand reliably produces varietally correct, down-the-middle wines, and this is no exception, starting with aromas of Anjou pear, underripe honeydew, tight white-flower buds and freshly cut key lime. The ripe stone-fruit flavors on the sip are cut by citrus and wet cement, offering all the elements to please many a Sauv Blanc fan.",88,SeaGlass 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"This full-bodied, full-flavored, ultraripe and smooth wine smells rich and fruity, tastes ripe and generous, feels velvety and finishes softly. The rich plum and strawberry aromas and flavors meld with the full, viscous mouthfeel.",91,Domaine Anderson 2012 Dach Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),,,,
"Clear as crystal up front, and then come flavors of lemon and green apple. There is almost no overt sweetness to it; it's quite acidic and sharp, which is common for the Hondarrabi Zuri grape from Northern Spain. As might be expected, green apple and lime control the austere finish. Good but very narrow in scope.",84,Kurmisti 2007 Table Wine Hondarrabi Zuri (Vino de Mesa),,,,
"This opens with aromas of woodland berry, crushed herb and a whiff of well-integrated oak. The firm palate delivers dried Morello cherry, baking spice and mocha alongside firm, fine-grained tannin. It closes on a note of star anise. Drink 2016–2021 to capture the fruit richness.",90,Cascina Ballarin 2011 Bricco Rocca  (Barolo),,,,
"Despite amazingly luscious aromas of star anise, stewed black cherry, black currant pie and coffee cake, this bottling still offers a prominent line of wet gravel and river stone minerality on the nose. Exotic mulberry and black cherry flavors ride atop the soft tannins and an underlying acidity, while white pepper dust and menthol unfold on the finish.",95,Walt 2015 Rita's Crown Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"A light, elegant nose of almonds, apple and honeysuckle, followed by fresh flavors of nuts, apple and flowers on the palate. Pretty, balanced and lingering in the finish. A great food wine.",87,Red Newt Cellars 2007 Curry Creek Vineyards Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This spicy wine with its aromatic character is fruity while also having some structure. The 90% Malbec/10% Merlot blend has a dry core, juicy red currant fruits and considerable acidity. With only a minimum of wood aging, it is ready to drink.",86,Château Fantou 2012 L'Enclos des Graves Malbec-Merlot (Cahors),,,,
"Straightforward Pinot Noir scents of red fruit, deep raspberry, fennel and menthol make for an uncomplicated but alluring nose on this wine from an historic vineyard. The  palate ranges widely, soft and expressive with pomegranate, tart raspberry and a touch of clove.",88,Testarossa 2012 Sierra Madre Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
This rich expression of Nerello Mascalese (a grape native to Sicily's Mount Etna) offers thick density and extraction followed by fresh notes of berry fruit and spice. It ends with chewy tannins and bright cherry flavors.,88,Cottanera 2007 Barbazzale Nerello Mascalese (Sicilia),,,,
"Produced from vines in the Lima Valley in northern Portugal, the home of the Loureiro grape, this light and fruity wine is immediately attractive, with its gentle citrus flavors and intense acidity. Drink this aromatic wine right now.",87,J. Portugal Ramos 2014 Lima Loureiro (Vinho Verde),,,,
"Wild berry, forest floor, chopped herb and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find in this bright, elegant red. The vibrant, medium-bodied palate offers crushed raspberry, red cherry and baking spice flavors, buttressed by taut, polished tannins and fresh acidity. A blast of orange zest further lifts the finish. Drink 2019–2027.",94,Gianni Brunelli 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"The firm tannins of Saint-Estèphe are strongly in evidence in this wine that is dry, dense and only hinting at fruit. While there is some juicy acidity, it also has a bitter character that needs some time to soften. It will probably always be on the dry, structured side. Drink from 2019.",87,Château Clauzet 2013  Saint-Estèphe,,,,
"Unless you knew that this was Dominus and had tasted older vintages, you might not be impressed. In its youth the wine is tannic and dry and linear. However, it is Dominus and it does need cellaring. Right now it shows blackberry, black currant, cedar and baker's chocolate flavors. Will slowly open and reach maturity after 2011, and could easily develop for far longer.",93,Dominus 2006 Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Dense intitial aromas suggest rubber on top of blackberry. In the mouth, this Tempranillo is deep as a trench, with layering and firm tannins. Flavors of toasty oak, blackberry, coconut and herbs dance together like a world-class ballet troupe, while the finish is textured, toasty and loaded with power. Drink from 2015–2021.",93,Teso La Monja 2011 Victorino  (Toro),,,,
"Soft and fragrant, this is a warm feeling Riesling. Of course, it has fine, steely acidity but it also has a riper fruity character, white fruits, hedgerow flavors and an edgy feel. Ready to drink. Screwcap.",88,Pratsch 2011 Lange Ried Riesling (Niederösterreich),,,,
"This earthy red offers aromas suggesting stalky underbrush, Mediterranean scrub, toast, leather and a whiff of espresso that carry over to the robust palate along with dried cherry, grilled herb and a hint of licorice. Close-grained tannins provide the framework.",88,Voliero 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Crisp and lively, this is a tight and mineral wine. Baked-apple fruitiness is balanced by bright acidity and a tangy aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",86,Domaine des Deux Roches 2015 Tradition  (Saint-Véran),,,,
"This pretty wine opens with fresh aromas of melon, stone fruit and fragrant honeysuckle. This expression offers more richness and intensity than many of the Falanghinas available today.",87,Vinosia 2011 Falanghina (Beneventano),,,,
"This offers everything you want in a Napa Cabernet, and at a decent price. It's dry, balanced in acidity and tannins, and elegantly constructed, with classic blackberry and cassis liqueur flavors touched by oak. Not an ager, and doesn't pretend to be; just a nice wine to drink now.",90,B Side 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"This wine seems to show a bit of oxygen exposure, which distracts from its aromas of orange peel and flower. It's a shame as it is flavorful and varietal, with floral notes persisting on the finish.",87,Stevens 2016 StevensDivio Viognier (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Pushy, forceful aromas of vanilla and oak blend with berry and spice notes. The palate is quietly full bodied, with plum and spice flavors in front of a toasty, dry, nicely oaked finish. For a lively, nervy wine, this is honest and good.",87,Undurraga 2011 Reserva Especial Sibaris Pinot Noir (Maipo Valley),,,,
"Enticing floral, woodland berry, new leather and tilled soil aromas come together in this stunning red. Vibrant and elegant, the linear palate delivers wild cherry, red raspberry, cinnamon and clove notes, framed by firm, refined tannins and vibrant acidity. The youthful tension is pleasant, but give it time to develop even more complexity. Drink 2020–2033.",92,Palazzo Vecchio 2013 Maestro  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),,,,
"There's an inkling of Petite Sirah in this Cab-driven blend, an easygoing wine that's soft and enjoyable, with characteristics of herb, clove and black pepper. The fruit side of the equation is populated in black cherry and berry.",85,Madrigal 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"So ripe and beautiful in fruit and oak, so balanced in tannins and acids, that it's hard to know whether to enjoy this Cab now or age it. Right now, it's elaborate in blackberry, cherry, currant and new oak flavors, wrapped into insanely fine tannins. But it's also balanced enough to develop bottle complexity over the next 10 years.",93,Pine Ridge 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),,,,
"This might be a touch volatile at first, but saucy tomato-like aromas are offset by fresh red-plum notes. A tight and tannic palate softens with time in the glass, while berry flavors carry herb and spice notes onto a lightly herbal finish.",86,Echeverria 2014 Reserva Merlot (Central Valley),,,,
"This is fresh, bright and majoring on slightly stony, flinty lemon notes on a slender body. Drink soon, it will provide ample refreshment.",88,Steininger 2014 Steinhaus Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),,,,
"Sadly, just 44 cases were produced, from Block 1 of the original estate vineyard. Rhubarb, cherry, cinnamon and suggestions of light tropical fruits are delicately entwined here. It would be easy to skip over the wine's complexity; you must let it breathe open and it will reward you with fascinating, subtle layers that slowly unravel.",94,Adelsheim 2008 Quarter Mile Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),,,,
"Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot are the building blocks of a grippy, chalky and bold red wine, strong in blueberry, blackberry and leather. Around those more concentrated layers are contrasting accents of cedar, dried herb and red currant.",91,Trinchero 2012 Forte Estate Grown Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Aromas of overripe, slightly bruised red apple, ale and apple skin are at the fore. It brings a spritz to the off-dry apple-juice flavors, seeming to have not fully settled into the glass.",85,Kiona 2016 Chenin Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A mature, more traditional Spanish wine that's ready to drink. The nose mixes tomato leaf, mint and maturing berry aromas, while the starchy, grabby palate shows aging raspberry and strawberry fruit with ample leather and dryness. Caramel, vanilla and toast notes grace the finish.",87,Viña Albali 2004 Reserva Tempranillo (Valdepeñas),,,,
"In a touch of irony, Versace is a no-frills Nero d'Avola that opens with a bright berry note and light touches of spice and toasted nut. The smooth finish would pair well with breaded veal.",87,Feudi del Pisciotto 2010 Versace Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),,,,
"This blends together grapes from several vineyard sites in three AVAs. It opens with a bouquet of milk chocolate and mocha, leading to a tart cranberry flavor. There's are hints of herb and bark in the finish. This is designed (successfully) as a fruit-driven, drink-now style of Oregon Pinot.",88,J. Christopher 2011 Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"A nice Cabernet for drinking now. It's rich in berries, cherries, currants and oak, with smooth tannins and soft acidity. Shows an elaboration that makes it upscale and elegant.",86,Simple Math Cellars 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),,,,
"Black licorice and compost add life and breadth to this roundly tannic, richly layered wine. Huckleberry and dark cherry give it a welcome fruitiness that's ripe and lush, as vanilla and cardamom complement the fruit.",92,Nicholson Ranch 2014 Dry Farmed Estate Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"The appetizing perfume is a perfect fusion of lemon zest and tart apple. The palate also pitches that same, ripe freshness against zingy tang. The palate is dry, textured and juicy and thus very moreish. This is very alive and appetizing with a super-clean, lip-smacking finish.",91,Domaine Charles Frey 2014 Frankstein Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),,,,
"Some green, vegetal notes mar this otherwise fine Pinot Noir. It's dry, silky in texture and brisk in acidity. Despite some good raspberry jam and sweet oak flavors, it's a hard wine to like.",83,Foley 2010 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"This shows simple flavors of orange and apricot juice wrapped into a creamy texture that seemingly finishes slightly sweet. The best thing is the acidity, which is brisk and stimulating.",85,Dahlia 2010 Chardonnay (Monterey County),,,,
"Spanish broom, honeysuckle and exotic fruit aromas carry over to the rounded palate, along with yellow peach and candied lemon drop notes. A bitter almond flavor closes the finish.",88,I Capitani 2016 Gaudium  (Fiano di Avellino),,,,
"From its floral, lime-driven aromas to its citrus and baked-apple flavors, this is a textbook Riesling. It's plump and friendly, offering a mouthfilling texture and easy-drinking appeal at a bargain price. Drink now.",88,Leasingham 2006 Magnus Riesling (Clare Valley),,,,
"Grapey and pinched on the nose, jammy smelling and unconvincing. Supernarrow in the mouth, tannic, lemony and sucks the life out of your cheeks and palate. And that's not even mentioning the price.",81,DSG Vineyards 2008 Phincalali  (Rioja),,,,
"Layers of cherry, currant and herbs give this fresh Cab an elegant but earthy feel. A lovely balance of fruit and acid, topped with supple and structured tannins, add to the success. Very pretty and collectible.",91,Stark-Condé 2005 Twin Peak Vineyards Unfined and Unfiltered Cabernet Sauvignon (Jonkershoek Valley),,,,
"This beautiful wine includes 9% Cabernet Franc that gives a lift of floral violet and grainy cedar. Classic all around in its etchings of coconut shavings, graphite, spice and dust, the fruit is additionally savory in bright red currant and a crunch of cassis, with an underpinning of soft, succulent blackberry.",94,Ramey 2013 Annum Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Made from the Négrette grape found in Fronton near Toulouse, this wine has a light structure to balance its dry acidity and citrus crispness. It's packed with clean, forward red currant fruit, ready to drink now.",85,Lionel Osmin & Cie 2016 Villa la Vie en Rose Rosé (Vin de France),,,,
"Wakefield (known as Taylors in Australia) was founded in Clare with the goal of producing world-class Cabernet Sauvignon, so it's no surprise this wine is a solid effort. Cassis and black-tea notes are carried easily by the medium body and dusty tannins that turn silkier on the finish. Drink now–2025.",89,Wakefield 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Clare Valley),,,,
White currant aromas give an exotic character that is confirmed by the spice and ripe apricot flavors. Acidity is bright and fresh while the aftertaste moves the wine more to a warmer character.,86,Château la Freynelle 2013  Bordeaux Blanc,,,,
This is a rounded smooth wine. It does have a crisp edge of red currants and acidity but the main flavor comes from the ripe red-berry fruits and touch of caramel. Drink the wine now.,86,Casa Agricola Alexandre Relvas 2016 Herdade de São Miguel Colheita Seleccionada Rosé (Alentejano),,,,
"Aromas of tobacco, vanilla and dried fruit take on a grassy note after airing in the glass. A cool, wet vintage for the region yields a slightly astringent and acidic palate. Flavors of dried plum, cherry and vanilla carry a tart streak, while the finish is both earthy and a bit sour.",87,Solar de Libano 2008 Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"Underbrush, leather, scorched earth, ripe black-skinned berry and a whiff of sweet baking spice abound on this. The big bold palate offers layers of ripe Morello cherry, raspberry jam, cinnamon, vanilla and a confectionary note. Hearty, somewhat grainy tannins grip the finish. Drink from 2017 through 2022.",90,Piero Busso 2012 San Stunet  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Violet and berry aromas are pleasant, fresh and not too demanding or loud. This is solid in feel, maybe a bit simple overall, with plum, berry and a touch of char making up the flavor profile. Generic berry flavors and a dry feel define the finish.",88,Bodega Patritti 2011 Chúcaro Malbec (Patagonia),,,,
"The winery's more accessible offering, this hearty full-bodied red is impressive in its smoky char and herbal kick—elements that ride along a thickness of tannin and black-fruit concentration.",90,Darioush 2013 Caravan Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Crisp and structured, this is an intensely mineral wine. It has great acidity and a strongly zesty, tangy character that still needs time to soften. It's bright, fruity and full of dancing freshness. It's good to go now, but keep until 2017 and it will be that much more complex.",92,Deutz 2007 Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),,,,
"Estate grown, this 100% Syrah has excellent concentration and round, mouthfilling fruit flavors. Cherries and plums are highlighted with baking spices and a finishing wash of rich mocha. Very tasty, forward, and drinking at its best right now.",90,Plumb Cellars 2008 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A solid and concentrated wine. it promises much for the future. For now, the red fruits come with a stalky structure and high acidity. These will integrate well, to grow into a wine that is rich and firmly structured. Drink from 2015.",88,Château Coudray Montpensier 2012 Le Grand Bouqueteau  (Chinon),,,,
"Following in the wake of the marvelously ripe 2009 Tendril, this does not carry the same weight and authority. It's well made and accurately reflects the cooler, difficult vintage. Strawberry fruit is lightly coated in chocolaty tannins; the wine remains firm and compact, with medium body and balance throughout.",89,Tendril 2010 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Named after the 13th-century house at the center of the estate, this is a rich, full-bodied wine. With citrus flavors at its heart, it also shows a texture that gives minerality from the granite soil, followed by juicy yellow fruits and finishing with intense acidity. Give this wine until mid-2015 to settle down.",90,Quinta de Paços 2013 Casa do Capitão-mor Alvarinho (Vinho Verde),,,,
"Aromas like spiced apple and brown sugar lead to luscious fruit and spice flavors and a plush texture in this medium-bodied wine. It has the richness and near-sweetness that can pair well with slowly cooked meats and mildly spicy dishes, but sips well on its own as well.",90,Shannon Ridge 2012 High Elevation Collection Zinfandel (Lake County),,,,
"Two-thirds of this wine is Malbec and one-third is Merlot. Aromas of asphalt, plum and orange rind lead to a palate that possesses a lovely sense of balance and length.",91,Flying Trout 2015 Deep River Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Earthy aromas that recall leather, truffle, ripe plum, blue flower and exotic spice take shape in the glass. The full-bodied palate shows dried black cherry, blackberry jam, sage and clove alongside close-grained tannins that leave a grippy finish.",90,Molino di Sant'Antimo 2011 Varco 84  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"A subtle nose of strawberry and honey, followed by elegant but cheerful fruit flavors, makes this a fun everyday rosé. Acidity and a clean finish give it food-friendly panache. Not complex, but easy to like.",84,Chaddsford 2007 Rosé Chambourcin (Pennsylvania),,,,
"This is one of Chandon's sweeter bubblies. It has flavors of honey, limes, pineapples and oranges, with yeasty notes of vanilla and toast. The mousse is delicate, making it extra drinkable.",87,Chandon NV Brut Classic Sparkling (California),,,,
"Tasted shortly after bottling, this needed some airing to blow off the sulfur. Once open it showed itself to be a palate-pleasing, round and spicy wine, elaborating its pear fruit with notes of orange peel and Meyer lemon.",88,Hawkins Cellars 2014 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),,,,
"92-94 Barrel sample. Spiced pears in red wine, an exotic range of sweet berry fruits and nutmeg, along with a solid core of structure. Intriguing wine.",93,Château Pape Clément 2009 Barrel sample  (Pessac-Léognan),,,,
"Made from old vines, this rich rosé is full of fruit. It has fine acidity as well as wild-strawberry flavors. The texture, lightly mineral, gives the wine a crisp, tight shape. With a fresh aftertaste, the wine will be just right for food.",88,Wines & Winemakers 2015 Lua Cheia em Vinhas Velhas Rosé (Douro),,,,
"This is a bright and fruity wine that is also rich. Yellow fruits are accompanied by fresh, textured citrus and given a crisp aftertaste by the lively acidity. Drink now.",87,Quinta de la Rosa 2013 Dourosa Branco White (Douro),,,,
"Charred, smoky aromas of blackberry are ripe as can be, with a note of graphite. The palate is huge, polished, pure and ideal if you like ripe, modern Rioja. Flavors of toast, blackberry, spice and mocha finish toasty, with strong notes of pepper and coffee. Drink this smooth, silky single-vineyard Rioja through 2021.",94,Artadi 2012 Viña el Pison  (Rioja),,,,
"This wine shows crisp apple and pear notes over a backdrop of minerality. Its ripe fruit is ribbed with anise, fennel and lemongrass scents.",90,Acacia 2014 Chardonnay (Carneros),,,,
"This well-balanced nonvintage Champagne from this major producer in the Aube region is dominated by Pinot Noir, giving rich character and structure. Red apple and ripe melon flavors mean everything is in place, making for a wine that is deliciously ready to drink.",90,Drappier NV Carte d'Or Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"A candied caramel aroma subtly lifts from the bouquet of this wine, nearly overtaken by fresh-cut rose. Earthy and full of forested characteristics, it's smooth and lush, with a spicy cinnamon finish and restrained oak. It's ready to enjoy, the use of more than 50% whole-cluster in the fermentation adding an exotic, tangy element.",92,Inman Family 2012 Olivet Grange Vineyard Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This varietal Petit Verdot is dry, tannic and oaky, with a linear profile, suggesting violets and cassis. It's elegant and complex, but lacks generosity.",88,Trinchero 2010 Central Park West Vineyard Petit Verdot (St. Helena),,,,
"Tropical fruit and vanilla-cookie aromas come with a note of nectarine. This feels juicy, racy and citric, with flavors of tangerine and nectarine. Despite having tangy acidity, the wine turns heavy on the finish.",84,Zuccardi 2012 Serie A Chardonnay (Uco Valley),,,,
"Give this Pinot Noir a few hours in the decanter before drinking it. Right out of the bottle, it's tight and brittle, but air brings out the core notes of cherry, vanilla, red currant and cedar, and makes it develop a drink-me-now appeal.",91,Dierberg 2009 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Rather lean and austere, this is a tight, structured wine. Its future lies in the firm tannins and the juicy red-currant fruit. Wait for this wine and don't drink before 2020.",90,Michel et Joana Ecard 2014 Aux Serpentières Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),,,,
"An attractive entry level Port, fruity with a light tannic structure and a sweet character. Blackberry jam dominates the fruit flavor of this everyday Port.",86,Croft NV Fine Ruby  (Port),,,,
"This wood-aged blend of Rolle and Ugni Blanc comes from selected parcels on the ancient estate Hubert Rouy began renovating in 2003. It is smooth, rich and full of toasty flavors as well as ripe, tropical fruits. It can be drunk now although it will be so much better from 2017.",91,Château d'Ollières 2015 Haut du Pigeonnier White (Coteaux Varois),,,,
"Edna Valley is a pretty chilly growing area, and you can taste the climate in the thick tannins and zingy acids that mark this Petite Sirah. It shows the variety's classic flavors of blackberries and currants, with notes of dried leather, tobacco, beefsteak and pepper.",85,Wolff 2006 Petite Sirah (Edna Valley),,,,
"This wine is produced from two of the quintas owned by Ramos-Pinto. It's fruity and crisp, packed with bright fruit and lively acidity, and finishes on tangy citrus with a riper, creamy texture. Drink from late 2017.",86,Ramos-Pinto 2015 Duas Quintas Branco White (Douro),,,,
"Sourced entirely from the Olsen vineyard, macerated on the skins for six weeks, and aged 10 months in neutral oak, this “orange” wine is bone dry, with head-turning aromas of orange liqueur, rose petals and citrus peel. Sip it slightly chilled as a warm weather apéritif.",90,Two Vintners 2012 O.G. Gewurztraminer (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Classic Sauvignon aromas of cut grass, straw, tropical fruit and crushed tomato vine mingle in the glass. The vibrant, elegant palate shows finesse and balance, delivering juicy white peach, grapefruit and green melon alongside crisp acidity.",93,Russiz Superiore 2013 Sauvignon (Collio),,,,
"A strongly wood-aged wine, firm, spicy and with a burnt edge. Chocolate and black plum-skin fruit combine in this strongly tannic wine. There is, though, a smooth element from the ripe Merlot in the blend, giving potential richness in 2–3 years.",88,Château de Parenchère 2011 Cuvée Raphaël  (Bordeaux Supérieur),,,,
"Smooth, rich, round and packed with lush black cherry, raspberry, cedar, spice and cinnamon flavors. The tannins are silky, and the acidity is firm and bright. Slightly warm at the end.",92,Williams Selyem 2000 Rochioli Riverblock Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"The oak barrel influence comes across quite strong in this Chardonnay. The wine itself, made from fruit sourced from this mountain appellation in the central part of Sonoma County, is rich in tropical fruit and pear flavors, with zesty acidity.",85,Mi Sueño 2009 Chardonnay (Sonoma Mountain),,,,
"This wine from the southern Mâcon appellation is crisp with a mineral edge as well as the ripe fruit of the vintage. It has a tangy, lemon-like texture that gives it a lift, adding to the fresh, fruity aftertaste. Drink now.",88,Vignerons des Terres Secrètes 2015  Saint-Véran,,,,
"Floral red-berry and cassis aromas are steady and fresh. In the mouth, this wine turns raw and jagged. Cranberry, currant and red-plum flavors show very little oak before a lean, powerful finish. This cool-vintage wine will last for years but probably not improve.",89,Bodegas Palacio 2013 Cosme Palacio Viñedos en Altitud Crianza  (Rioja),,,,
"One of a growing number of micro-boutiques in Oregon, Vidon made its first wine in 2003. Subsequent vintages were quickly sold out, with quantities as low as two barrels of individual wines. This 2007 is in better supply, and well worth seeking out. Fragrant with sweet strawberries, hints of fresh herb, a Dr. Pepper soda streak particular to Oregon and nicely laid-in oak, it's a seductive and focused effort that masks its high alcohol effectively.",90,Vidon Vineyard 2007 Three Clones Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),,,,
"The top Australian Cabernets retain distinct varietal character without veering into overly green territory. This one features hints of mint and tobacco alongside cassis and coffee. The texture is a treat: creamy at first, then firming up on the finish. Drink now-2015.",89,Taltarni 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Pyrenees),,,,
"A remarkable shade of slightly purple bubblegum, Kathy Joseph's wine shows strawberries and buttery croissants on the nose. The flavors are boisterous and nearly effervescent, with berries, yeast and a long-lasting sense of strawberry mousse. This one goes down all too easy.",91,Fiddlehead Cellars 2014 Pink Fiddle Rosé of Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"An earthy, traditional tasting wine, expressing the dark schist terroir of the Douro. The structure is taut, dry, tannic, but it leaves room for a wine that has some volatility and blackberry juice flavors.",85,J. & F. Lurton 2005 Pilheiros Red (Douro),,,,
"This is richer than most Pinot Grigios. It opens with aromas of toast, yellow flower, vanilla and a balsamic note while the round, full-bodied palate offers baked yellow apple, candied lemon drop, nectarine zest and almond. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy fruit while a vanilla note closes the finish. You can barely detect the warmth of alcohol on the close.",88,Renato Keber 2012 Pinot Grigio (Collio),,,,
"A compelling effort, stylish and dark, this has a crisp minerality that underpins fruit flavors of black cherry, fig and plum. The texture, length and definition are first-rate.",91,Grizzly Peak 2012 Cabernet Franc (Rogue Valley),,,,
"Tarry dark-fruit aromas are piercing and slightly herbal. This is a staunch, rock-solid Cab with tannic bite and structural grip. Flavors of black fruits and oak finish spicy, with notes of licorice and woodspice. Freshness combined with ripeness and body weight conveys the wine's depth and overall quality.",89,Château Los Boldos 2012 Sensaciones Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Cachapoal Valley),,,,
"Bright, ripe strawberry and cherry flavors are contrasted with the firm tannins of wood aging. This is a very young wine, with layers of acidity, spice and toast. Drink from 2016.",85,Clément Klur 2011 Pinot Noir (Alsace),,,,
"This sultry, supple wine exudes aromas and flavors of baking spices and dark cherry pie, remaining brooding atop a full-bodied texture. Despite the oaky density, it retains a floral back note and bright, lengthy finish.",91,Davis Bynum 2013 Jane's Vineyard Dijon Clone 115 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Earthy up front, with roasted, smoky berry aromas and herbal accents. Feels good, with tomato, red plum, leaf, herb and oaky flavors. Turns more juicy and rugged as it opens, with a light green character to the finish.",86,Graffigna 2009 Centenario Reserve Malbec (San Juan),,,,
"A color so deep it could be a Pinot Noir, flavors bursting with plum and wild blackberry and a velvety texture make this dry rosé taste more like a red. Bucking the trend toward lightness, it has medium body, a creamy mouthfeel and lingering finish.",90,Carol Shelton 2014 Wild Thing Rendezvous Dry Rosé (Mendocino County),,,,
"Elena Walch's fantasy wine is a blend of Chardonnay and four other varieties that she does not reveal. Eighteen months in oak give the wine a fine, toasty character and creamy fruit, but still leaves the hallmark Alto Adige crispness and freshness.",90,Elena Walch 2001 Beyond the Clouds White (Alto Adige),,,,
"Tropical in character, this wine has soft acidity and an attractive texture. With ripe mango flavor, it's full in the mouth and ready to drink.",84,Jean-Marie Challand 2012 Vieilles Vignes  (Viré-Clessé),,,,
This neutral and mineral-driven Greco offers tones of white stone and dried flowers. The wine is lean and crisp with a thin but refreshing consistency. It would make an excellent companion to spicy Indian or Thai foods.,87,Mastroberardino 2007  Greco di Tufo,,,,
"This is a robust Sauvignon Blanc that announces itself with aromas of grass, spice and straw, leading into a combination of fresh fruit and earthy spice flavors. A great balance of acid, fruit and spice means it's assertive, but still poised. A fun wine with lots of character.",87,MAN Vintners 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Coastal Region),,,,
"Enticing aromas of balsamic, leather, menthol, crushed herb, blue flower and dark culinary spice unfold on the nose. The focused palate boasts wonderful, nervy energy, showing red cherry, cranberry, white pepper, cinnamon and clove flavors framed by firm, elegant tannins and vibrant acidity. Drink 2022–2032.",95,Rizzi 2014 Nervo  (Barbaresco),,,,
"One of the best wines made on the beautiful island of Sicily, Donnafugata's Mille e Una Notte exhibits gorgeous smoothness in the mouth and exceedingly rich aromas of black currants, chocolate, spice and tobacco. Under all that are notes of toasted almond and pistachio that are characteristic of the Nero d'Avola grape.",93,Donnafugata 2006 Mille e Una Notte  (Contessa Entellina),,,,
"This is a fresh, fruity rendering of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. Ripe, peachy notes on the nose give way to hints of nectarine and citrus on the palate. It's plump and round in feel, with a moderately long finish.",87,Wakefield Bay 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),,,,

"Sold in 1-liter Tetra Prisma packaging meant to reduce greenhouse emissions, this is an ecofriendly wine that tastes good. Its bouquet is its strongest asset, offering floral, perfumy notes of white pepper and rhubarb, while the palate is on the light side for Shiraz, but clean and supple. Drink now.",85,Green Path 2006 Organic Shiraz (South Eastern Australia),,,,
"A pale, lemon color Riesling. The complex nose of honey, delicate stone fruit, elder-flower and stony minerality is deliciously inviting, while intense, focused ripe fruit prevails all across the palate. This is sweet, yet crisp and oozing freshness, with a taut, lively texture. Very long, complex and subtle at the same time.",91,Dr. Loosen 2008 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Auslese Riesling (Mosel),,,,
The wine is light and crisp with lemon acidity and with a zesty bright texture. There is a touch of minerality and a clean lively aftertaste. Drink now.,87,Ollivier Frères 2016 Domaine de la Grenaudière Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine),,,,
"There's a lot of rich, ripe blackberry, blueberry, black currant and cassis flavor in this Cabernet, but it's still finding its balance. The fruit is primary in nature with strong tannins and oak that's not yet integrated. The wine lacks subtlety now, but on the other hand, it doesn't seem to have a long life ahead, so give it 3–4 years and drink with steak.",88,Groth 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),,,,
"“Gas station” isn't necessarily the most attractive fine-wine descriptor, but it's both apt and complimentary for a dry Riesling. This one reeks of petrol and tar. On the palate, a warm tar presence slowly evolves toward vanilla. A vibrant, tingling acidity indicates decent cellaring potential. At the very least, this is a great wine to show your friends how petrol can be a defining and excellent character in wine.",91,Coquelicot 2012 Riesling (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Bob Lindquist's bread-and-butter bottling does not disappoint, especially for the price point, with voluptuous aromas of black cherry, blackberry, smoke, soy and mocha.

"Fragrant with cranberry and strawberry fruit, this forward and appealing wine looks and drinks like a cru Beaujolais. The tasty fruit is delineated with a chocolate lining, and the tannins carry a whiff of fresh earth.",90,Patton Valley 2008 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This is a sophisticated and smooth Chardonnay with an extraordinarily soft and silky texture in the mouth. The wine's aromas recall peach blossom, caramel and butter squash and are delivered with intensity and confidence.

"This is an attractive, juicy fruity wine With its red-cherry flavors, it is smooth and perfumed. There is just the right amount of acidity to keep the freshness right up front. Drink now.",88,Château des Pertonnières 2015 Côteau Belle-Vue  (Beaujolais),,,,
"Golden color and hints of oatmeal on the nose signal some evolution. The palate rewards this notion with rounded harmony: there is the merest touch of dark honey to the autolytic notes of wholemeal biscuit. Rounded lemony freshness stirs through everything and is dispersed with all of the tiny bubbles bursting. Lovely, resonant, very integrated and lasting.",91,Chapel Down 2010 Three Graces Sparkling (England),,,,
"Lilacs and violets meet with black raspberries, blackberry pie and savory sage on the nose of this 42% Grenache, 38% Syrah and 20% Mourvèdre blend.

"Something seems off here, or perhaps it is just a young wine throwing off some bottling aromas. In any event, it's thin, simple and sugary, without the complexity of the excellent 2010.",84,StoneCap 2011 Estate Grown Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Spelt is a mature and richly extracted Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, with deep tones of black tobacco, ripe berry, prune, plum and spicy rum cake. It exhibits soft texture and a plush, rich finish.",90,La Valentina 2005 Spelt  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),,,,

"Scents of tangerine peel and lanolin add a spicy complexity to intensely fruity, sweet peach and nectarine flavors on this gorgeously honeyed, yet easy-drinking Riesling. Striking lemon acidity and crushed stone notes add delicacy and nuance to the finish.",91,Markus Molitor 2010 Ürziger Würzgarten Auslese Riesling (Mosel),,,,
"An outstanding vintage for this cuvée, this sports a concentrated mix of plum and cherry fruit, matched to perfectly proportioned acids.

"Soft oak tones of vanilla and spice surround the wine's bright base of bitter berry fruit.

"Initial murky aromas clear up while remaining a bit gritty and stalky. This crianza has a raw, choppy feel. Gritty, earthy flavors of leathery plum and berry fruits finish peppery and spicy. Drink through 2022.",90,Lleiroso 2012 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"The 2010 Widowmaker shows a bit more fruit, less funk than usual. It's a pleasing mix of berries, cherries, plums and figs, along with clean earth, green tea and a hint of chocolate. The tannins are smooth and the flavors linger gracefully and slowly fade through the finish.",93,Cayuse 2010 The Widowmaker En Chamberlin Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"While relatively neutral on the nose with notes of savory apple and pear, the palate is deeply earthy with flavors of mushroom and dried herb. Light in body and alcohol, it's brisk on the palate with a streak of lemon-lime acidity.",81,King's Garden Vineyards 2011 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes),,,,
"This medium-weight Chard is fresh and mildly dusty smelling, with aromas of pear and apple. The palate is lifted, fresh in feel and offers punchy acidity in front of lime, gooseberry and herb flavors. For under $20, this is nicely made and hints at elegance.",88,Undurraga 2011 Sibaris Reserva Especial Chardonnay (Maipo Valley),,,,
"“Wow” is the first word that comes to mind when tasting this superconcentrated and immensely fruity wine. It practically overwhelms the nose and the palate with ripe, jammy boysenberry and blackberry, sprinkled with licorice and black-pepper nuances that add attractive complexity. It's a big wine all the way, but not extreme in alcohol.",92,Artezin 2014 Old Vine Zinfandel (Mendocino County),,,,
"Wild berry, iris, rose and a potpourri of culinary spice aromas emerge on the nose of this stunning red. Radiant and full bodied, the palate is young and primary at this stage but already evokes morello cherry, licorice, pipe tobacco and aromatic herbs. Bright acidity and taut tannins provide impeccable balance and an impressive, age-worthy structure. Drink 2025–2043.",97,Elvio Cogno 2013 Ravera  (Barolo),,,,
"Combines a delicate body with punchy flavors to create a feminine wine of considerable power and finesse. It avoids jamminess, coming down on the side of less ripe earth and tomato, although there are gorgeous stone fruit notes and a sumptuous overlay of smoky oak. The flavors and texture are absolutely terrific.",93,Sebastopol 1999 Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Green Valley),,,,
"Taking the best from each individual clonal selection, this blend shows both muscle and finesse. The chunky core of cherry fruit is fringed with orange peel, lifted with crisp acidity, and finished with a light touch of cinnamon. It's drinking well, and can best be enjoyed through 2020.",91,Amalie Robert 2011 Amalie's Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This offers strong oak and smoke aromas, plus ripe black cherry, chocolate and plum flavors. Full body and firm tannins make it assertive. Not a cocktail wine, this needs to pair with some heavy meat.",87,Joel Gott 2012 815 Cabernet Sauvignon (California),,,,

"This opens with underbrush, sun-baked earth, spiced plum and espresso aromas. On the taut, full-bodied palate, licorice, clove and grilled herb notes accent a core of black cherry and crushed raspberry fruit. Tightly knit, fine-grained tannins suggest ageing potential. Drink 2020–2028.",92,Fossacolle 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,

"Bright apple, pear and orange notes lead the nose of this well-balanced Chardonnay, with secondary accents of toast, sweet spice and nut.

"Succulent and complex, this wine offers substantial body and lush plushness on the palate, alluring in its layering of cardamom spice and orange, cranberry and cherry. Satisfyingly ripe, with inimitable balance, it shows the elegance possible in spite of the appellation's power.",94,Rochioli 2014 Little Hill Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,

"Here is a luscious and generous white wine from northeast Italy with a slightly more saturated color and golden highlights. The nose boasts aromas of white mineral, stone fruit, mature melon and yellow rose and the mouthfeel is thicker, creamier and more sophisticated than most Pinot Grigios.",88,Volpe Pasini 2008 Zuc di Volpe Pinot Grigio (Colli Orientali del Friuli),,,,
"Crushed minerals and steel reverberate amidst concentrated lime and lemon in this racy, laser-edged Riesling.

"From the eastern-reaching Chiles Valley appellation, the vines planted in 1975, this is a soft, juicy and well-made wine, blended with 3% Merlot. Red and black berry star, complemented by a treasure trove of clove. Grippy on the finish, it should cellar well, a robust, full-bodied wine that finishes with a taste of coffee.",91,Herencia 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"This ultrarich, opulent wine has such purity of fruit. With its pepper and spice flavors layered over mango and ripe nectarine, it is a straight line of pure flavor, rich and complex.",95,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2009 Clos Saint Urbain Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"Light and only gently structured, this is a cru wine that is more about juicy red fruits. It has attractive acidity and a touch of spice. It is likely to be ready to drink in the next few months, certainly by mid-2017.",87,Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2015 Léon  (Moulin-à-Vent),,,,
"This often-overlooked grape brings big, blocky, fruit-powered flavors of lemon and pear. It falls on the sour side of acid, with just a hint of vanilla.",86,Cottonwood Winery of Oregon 2012 Estate Müller-Thurgau (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Ripe blackberry, graphite, balsam wood, vanilla and kirsch aromas combine to provide a fine opening to this Cabernet-led blend.

Drink now–2016.",90,Morandé 2008 House of Morandé Red (Maipo Valley),,,,
"Always aged for a year before it is released, this iconic wine is impressive. It is superrich without losing freshness.

"This rich, creamy, juicy wine is full of strawberry fruits and ripe tannins. It has weight and density as well as powerful structure.

"This unoaked Chardonnay shows admirable weight on the palate, but slightly one-dimensional, citrusy flavors. Clean and correct on the finish; drink now.",85,Woop Woop 2009 Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia),,,,
"Here's a structured and spicy Barbera with an enticing fragrance of black fruits, white pepper and exotic spices.

"The winery brings a Pinot Noir-esque touch to this Syrah, with its silky-heavy texture and cherry, cola and white pepper flavors.

"Chocolate, sweet spice, tobacco, leather and dark berry fruit give this Brunello a bold and impactful first impression. When it comes to the mouthfeel, the wine plays a more subtle game with polished tannins, mild cherry fruit and a bright point of fresh acidity.",91,Casanuova delle Cerbaie 2008  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"This dark, dry, tannic wine is rich in blackberries and cherries, with earthy notes of mushrooms and herbs. It's pretty tight and astringent now, but should soften over the next 5–6 years. The blend is Tempranillo, Touriga Nacional and Souzão.",88,PasoPort 2009 Vinho Tinto Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"Scratchy berry and rubber aromas roll into a grabby, aggressive palate, with a burnt note and resiny oak overshadowing a berry flavor. The finish is rubbery and chunky.",83,Montebuena 2010 Cuvée KPF  (Rioja),,,,

"With fruit sourced from the excellent Hyland Vineyard, this blends a pair of Dijon clones and was aged in half new French oak for 15 months. Black cherry and cola syrup flavors combine in a sappy, concentrated midpalate. Highlights of underbrush and balsamic add flavor interest, and the dry, polished tannins frame the flavors perfectly. There's every reason to believe this can age well, but why wait?",94,DanCin 2012 Melodia Pinot Noir (McMinnville),,,,
"Dark, dense in structure and fairly tannic, this Syrah floods the mouth with powerfully ripe flavors of blackberries, cherries, cola, leather, spices and sandalwood. It's a very good wine whose strength calls for strongly flavored meats, sauces and cheeses. Drink now.",91,Coquelicot 2007 Black Oak Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,
"Beautifully made, complex and complete, this full-bodied wine embraces seductive, spicy oak flavors, ripe fruit and a mouthfilling texture.

"Aromas of white flower, tropical fruit and an herbal note lead the nose on this medium-bodied white. The juicy, generous palate doles out ripe pear, tangerine, mineral and white almond. Soft but fresh enough acidity offsets the creamy flavors.",88,Marco Porello 2015 Camestri  (Roero),,,,

"Initially this Rioja seems topped by gritty aromas of tire rubber and burnt leaves, but with airing it gets more earthy and presentable. Tight tannins and a firm structure are the greeting on the palate, while flavors of stewed berries, herbs and oak take things to a warm, lightly baked finish with balance and length. The more this wine breathes, the better it shows. Drink through 2020.",91,Bodegas Vínícola Real 2006 200 Monges Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"A blend of Sean Thackrey's four Pinot clones, all grown in one block of the Wentzel Vineyard, this wine is a baby still, soft and lush and ready to develop further.

"Raspberries and cherry blossoms mingle on the nose of this pretty, perfumed wine.

It's brisk in acidity and layered with fine, firm tannins.",89,Millbrook 2012 Proprietor's Special Reserve Cabernet Franc (Hudson River Region),,,,

"Winemaker Mike Mooney adds complexity with 16% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Merlot on this bottling, which shows blueberries, crushed black rocks and dark chocolate on the nose, but doesn't offer a lot of Cab Francness. The palate does offer some, however, with grippy tannins and dried oregano touches laid across rich black cherry, blueberry, fudge and espresso notes.",90,Chateau Margene 2013 Signature Series Cabernet Franc (Paso Robles),,,,

"The blended wine from Two Paddocks is a crowd-pleaser in 2015, offering medium body, silky tannins and enjoyable notes of baking spices and red cherries. It's a fine introduction to the brand and the region, delicious now, yet capable of aging through at least 2020.",90,Two Paddocks 2015 Estate Vineyards Pinot Noir (Central Otago),,,,
"Made in a delicious, dry style, this has a vivid yellow-gold color, lemon and butter aromas, a touch of honey in the Bosc pear flavors and a creamy texture that leads to a long finish. Not much of this variety is made in California and the acreage is dwindling in Livermore Valley, so this bottling is a rare treat.",90,Fenestra 2013 Semillon (Livermore Valley),,,,
"A blend from several premier cru vineyards in Pommard, here is a wine that exhibits just the right firm but dusty tannins of the appellation. But because it is 2005, the natural exuberance of the fruit is also there, lively red berries under the dry structure. It needs some aging, but already the richness is there, along with a smoky aftertaste.",91,Bouchard Père & Fils 2005 Premier Cru  (Pommard),,,,
"One of the small Sauvignon Blanc areas close to Sancerre, Menetou-Salon produces a light, crisp and herbal style of wine. This fits that bill well, its freshness contained within the flavors of hedgerow fruits and tangy acids.",88,Fournier Père et Fils 2010 Côtes de Morogues  (Menetou-Salon),,,,

This is a fine, concentrated wine that is now ready to drink.",93,Quinta de Chocapalha 2011 Tinto Red (Lisboa),,,,
"Concentrated and woody smelling, this ripe Cabernet is cut from the modern mold, meaning it's weighty and fully oaked. As for mouthfeel, expect severe tannins but also cuddly depth. Flavors of roasted, earthy berry fruits and cassis finish with oaky flavors of cocoa and mocha as well as herbal notes. Drink this integrated Cab through 2021.",92,Viña Cobos 2012 Bramare Marchiori Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Luján de Cuyo),,,,
"Very fresh, light and a little candylike in flavor, this vivid-pink wine is dry and fruity. It is charming and easy to sip.",88,Scotto Family Cellars 2016 Dry Sangiovese Rosé (Lodi),,,,
"With maturity beckoning, this wine already emphasizes its petrol, its herbal fruit character. The aromas of white flowers are there, but the acidity is less fruit, more texture, surrounding toast and lime jelly flavors. Screwcap.",90,Hirsch 2002 Gaisberg Riesling (Kamptal),,,,
"Get a case of this and make it your house wine for easy drinking. It's dry and spicy, and has enough cherry, berry and cola flavors to satisfy your tastebuds.",85,Lost Angel 2009 Merlot (California),,,,
"Single vineyard Zinfandel from a young vineyard on the Columbia River, this is pretty rather than powerful, smooth and chocolaty, with bright, tight raspberry fruit.",87,Barnard Griffin 2008 Hells Gate Canyon Vineyard Zinfandel (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Dry and elegant, this has fine berry, currant and cola flavors that turn sweetly attractive on the finish. With its touch of earthiness, this should pair well with mushroom-based meat and poultry dishes.",87,Keenan 2009 Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"Aromas of woodland berry, alpine herb and crushed flower lead the nose. The palate offers red cherry, rosemary and green tea, while fine-grained tannins provide support.",89,Cantina Produttori Bolzano 2012 St. Magdalena Riserva Pinot Nero (Alto Adige),,,,
This is an oak-driven Brunello with fresh notes of red fruit backed by spicy aromas of vanilla and clove. The wine exhibits dense extraction and concentration but also offers vibrant cherry flavors in the mouth.,88,SassodiSole 2003  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"If you're looking for a decent everyday Chardonnay at an inexpensive price, consider this one. It's dry and creamy in texture, with slightly sweet, oaky tangerine and pineapple flavors.",84,CK Mondavi 2010 Willow Springs Chardonnay (California),,,,
"Sourced from a single vineyard on Oliver's North Bench, this was fermented and aged in one-quarter new French oak barrels. The time in oak has somewhat muted the snappy vitality of the fruit (some tasters might argue it has simply rounded it off). Grassy hints of fresh asparagus remain, and with peppery herb, juicy gooseberry and citrus peel.",90,Township 7 2015 Blue Terrace Vineyard Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Okanagan Valley),,,,
"Not a simple refreshment, this has a deep pink color tinged with copper. In aroma and flavor it's almost as substantive as a red wine. It has plummy, rich and slightly earthy aromas, a smooth mouthfeel, and soft cherry and spice flavors.",86,Galatea Effect 2013 Conoscenti Rosé (California),,,,
"This initially opens with funky aromas of barnyard and truffle that soon blow off to reveal ripe plum and kitchen spice aromas. The forward palate offers up fleshy black cherry, anise and grilled sage alongside grippy tannins that leave a bracing finish.",88,Ada Nada 2012 Rombone Elisa  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Really appealing on the nose, with smoky, meaty scents that give the impression of a Shiraz that's savory, yet packed with fruit. But the wine is less impressive in the mouth; it's soft and cuddley—deliciously ready to drink—without anything apparent in reserve. Drink now.",86,Xavier Flouret 2009 Waroo Shiraz (Pemberton),,,,
"Easygoing and enjoyable, this has aromas of mature black-skinned fruit, violet and an earthy whiff of truffle. The juicy simple palate offers black cherry and a hint of baking spice alongside supple tannins. Drink soon.",84,Valori 2014  Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,,,,
"Tart and lean, this unusually brisk Tocai Friulano juxtapoes savory apple and citrus against a bounty of leafy green and herbal tones. It's refreshingly spry but vegetal in tone.",83,Ventosa 2012 Tocai Friulano (Seneca Lake),,,,
"This opens with an aroma of cola syrup, and it seems devoid of a tannic structure and a finish.",84,3 Steves Winery 2009 Zinfandel (Cienega Valley),,,,
"Very tannic and gritty now. Shuts the fruit down with a dry, sandpapery astringency. But what great fruit. It's rich in blackberries, black cherries, currants, licorice and mocha, and is bone dry. Could and should age, but there's a certain sharpness that makes you wonder.",88,St. Francis 2007 Anthem Meritage (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"The awesome nose of this wine is redolent with barbecue sauce, or perhaps a hickory-laced plum sauce, and it's incredibly distinctive if a little bizarre. The palate is full and rich with a similar saucy character, but also shows more complex notes of lush blackberries, rose hips and licorice.",93,Pianetta 2012 Tuscan Nights Red (Central Coast),,,,
"This is a big, rich, flashy Cab. It's very ripe, brimming with jammy blackberry, currant, chocolate-covered raisin and spicy olive flavors. Drinks soft and opulent in instant appeal, but doesn't seem like a longterm ager. Best now through 2010.",88,Beringer 2004 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
This is a very likable and easy-to-drink blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon that moves over the palate with bright fruit intensity and silky tannins. The wine is fresh and would pair well with a heaping plate of sausage and white Tuscan beans.,88,Tenuta di Trecciano 2006 Daniello Red (Toscana),,,,
"This is a great wine for fans of the flashy, almost sweet, dark colored and fully oaked style of Zin. It has a tasty sense of maple syrup on waffles, boysenberries and vanilla. Full-bodied and concentrated, it's firm in texture and slightly sweet on the finish.",88,Klinker Brick 2012 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),,,,
"With proper doses of orange rind, vanilla, minerality and melon on the nose, this opens in very good form. The palate is round, pithy and citric in feel, while flavors of white grapefruit, orange and melon finish with a mild oily mouthfeel and a touch of bitterness.",89,Val do Sosego 2012 Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"Zin hardly gets riper or fruitier than this. Blended with a little Petite Sirah, which accounts for the tannins and depth, it's jam-packed with wild berries, currants, licorice, cocoa, black pepper and sandalwood, while high alcohol gives it a rich, glycerine mouthfeel.",90,Vermeil 2010 Frediani Vineyard Zinfandel (Calistoga),,,,
"Just two barrels of this 100% Grenache were bottled, after aging 20 months in French oak. It's bright and spicy, showing cranberry and cherry fruit highlighted by orange peel, cinnamon, pepper and red licorice. The lovely fruit shines right on through a lingering finish.",89,Jaxon 2012 Grenache (Rogue Valley),,,,
"This 100% varietal wine is velvety and dense in all the right ways, striking a balance between fruit-forwardness and savory coomplexity. Blackberry, blueberry and coffee flavors lead the palate, highlighted in supple tannin.",91,Madrigal 2013 Petite Sirah (Calistoga),,,,
"This wine hits the mark, combining intriguing flavors of vanilla, shortcake and cinnamon with a bracing but supple texture and a fine-grained mousse. It is dry, subtle, complex and elegant.",90,Biltmore Estate NV Brut Sparkling (California),,,,
"Earthy, dense, smoky and charred, this Pinot is showing clear signs of coming from a warm year. Tomatoey acidity and a leathery quality drive the palate, while flavors of stewed, briny raspberry and plum are leathery and finish savory and slightly salty.",87,Casas del Bosque 2012 Gran Reserva Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),,,,
"Here's a fresh and approachable selection, with notes of crisp citrus, green melon and apple. There's a hint of sweet lemon on the palate, followed by a brisk, mouthwatering finish. Drink now.",87,Domaine Delsol 2011 Picpoul de Pinet Picpoul (Coteaux du Languedoc),,,,
"Delicate aromas of white spring blossom, citrus and orchard fruit waft from the glass. The round palate delivers white peach, creamy green apple, lemon drop and and a hint of vanilla brightened by fresh acidity. A mineral note marks the finish.",90,Pratello 2012 Il Rivale  (Lugana),,,,
"A totally ready-to-drink wine that is full of bright red fruits and crisp acidity. It has some soft tannins and a dry edge, though the wine just bursts with fruit. Drink now.",86,DFJ Vinhos 2015 Brigando Red (Lisboa),,,,
"Slightly rusty in color and ready to drink, this lovely blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot conveys a lightly roasted bouquet, with cigar box, earth notes and tons of berry fruit. It feels rich but lively, with sweet black-fruit flavors, cocoa, mocha and licorice. This is toasty and chocolaty on the finish. Drink now.",91,Masies d'Avinyo 2007 Abadal Crianza Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Pla de Bages),,,,
"This blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Fernão Pires is aromatic and ripe. Its fruitiness is tropical, with pineapple as well as apricot flavors. It's softly textured  and ready to drink.",86,Wines & Winemakers 2012 Companhia das Lezírias Catapereiro Escolha Branco White (Tejo),,,,
"A nice debut from this new label under the Tendril umbrella. Intense in color and deep in flavor, this pure varietal rosé pushes forward raspberry and cherry fruit with plenty of juicy pizzazz. The back end revs up with a burst of citrus rind.",90,Child's Play 2016 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Black raspberry, blackberry, lavender and pepper show on the deeply purple nose of this blend of 67% Grenache and 33% Syrah. Dense black fruit shows first on the palate, followed by a zesty explosion of acidity, flowery spices and cola.",90,Chesebro 2013 Las Arenas Red (Arroyo Seco),,,,
"Rich and creamy, this wine has weight as well as the hallmark freshness of 2007. The yellow fruits and spicy pear flavors are smoothed out with spice, with some herbaceous elements and a fine waft of apple skin structure. Worth aging for 3–4 years. Screwcap.",94,Château la Louvière 2007  Pessac-Léognan,,,,
This wine has a touch of caramel as well as spice. Both work well with the red fruits that shine through this ripe wine. It is ready to drink.,85,Château Lalande Méric 2016 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),,,,
"Very young, very tannic, this wine is hard and not showing much fruit at the moment. Heavy extraction has left a wine that's tough and needs to age to get anywhere. Try again in 2016.",86,Pascal Granger 2013 Le Bouteau  (Beaujolais-Villages),,,,
"Adam Comartin's San Jose-based label shines a bright light on this new appellation. This wine shows blackberry shave ice, black cherries, black pepper, cola and the lifting aromatics of violets on the nose. More black pepper spices up the palate, with the balanced cherry and berry power proving quite distinctive and regal.",92,Comartin 2012 Tierra Alta Vineyard Syrah (Ballard Canyon),,,,
"This wine surprises in its sanguine nature, dusted in currant and cranberry, with a dustiness to the firm, but not overbearing tannins. Structured and light-bodied in an elegant way, it remains lively in the glass.",90,Collier Falls 2012 Hillside Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley),,,,
"Pretty nice Merlot, soft and sensual, like Merlot is supposed to be, and wonderfully ripe in blackberry, cherry, blueberry, plum, chocolate, cedar, vanilla and spice flavors. A pretty complex wine that finishes long and smooth. Drink now.",90,Whitehall Lane 2004 Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"Berry and plum aromas are clean and composed. The wine feels juicy, pure and medium to full in body. Flavors of cherry and plum are spiced up with a white pepper note, while oaky spice and dusty pepper flavors create a lasting, long finish.",89,Patrocinio 2010 Zinio Crianza  (Rioja),,,,
"From one of Lazio's most promising wineries, this white blend of indigenous grapes delivers a fragrant bouquet of peach blossom, citrus, pear and apple. The mouthfeel is smooth and silky, with a touch of crisp freshness on the finish.",86,Tenuta di Pietra Porzia 2011 Saula Carta Bianca  (Frascati Superiore),,,,
"This wine seems rather unfocused with indistinct tannins and fruit. There is a soapy texture, and the red berry fruits seem awash with acidity.",83,Château Bernés 2011  Bordeaux,,,,
"A red-fruited wine, this is a bright and crisp selection from the lightest of the Beaujolais cru villages. Its acidity cuts through the soft fruit flavors, and it has touch of tannin. Ready to drink.",87,Château de Pizay 2011  Régnié,,,,
"Tastes super-jammy and extracted in cherries and raspberries, and pretty oaky, too, with a veneer of vanilla and charred wood. But it somehow lacks the structure to support all this richness. Feels a little flabby, and not likely to age well.",86,Tolosa 2007 Edna Ranch 1772 Syrah (Edna Valley),,,,
"A very nice Cabernet, with a rich vein of tannins that gives it a crunchy texture, and forward black currant, cherry, and plum flavors that are as juicy as they come. Nearly 100% varietal Cab, it feels upscale and plush in the mouth, and gets better as it warms in the glass. Fair price for a Cab this good.",92,Rodney Strong 2004 Estate Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),,,,
"Put this on the scale and watch it tip. It's a monster of a Cab that's quite tannic and therefore narrow on the palate. But if given time in a good cellar it may soften into something much more evolved than it is now. Early openers should expect black fruit in spades, with nail-like tannins. Best to have a steak on the grill if you are drinking this any time soon.",89,Lapostolle 2006 Cuvée Alexandre Apalta Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"This is an intriguing wine, with notes of dried sage, fresh herbs, mineral and black tea. The palate offers sweet, dense, layered vanilla, clove and cherry flavors backed by dry tannins. Still young, this wine needs extended time in the cellar to be properly appreciated. Best after 2022.",89,àMaurice 2010 Owl & Crown Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"Fragrant and fresh, this vibrant wine offers alluring scents field flower and white stone fruit scents. The creamy palate delivers white peach, honeydew melon and citrus flavors, brightened with crisp acidity.",91,Selva Capuzza 2016 Selva  (Lugana),,,,
"A highly perfumed nose offers potent aromas of bath soap and lychee. The palate is chunky but kept on par by lively acidity. Lychee, melon and lemon flavors finish sweet yet briny. Drink now.",85,Alamos 2013 Torrontés (Salta),,,,
"This wine is soft and fruity, with a smoky touch that adds interest. Red-cherry flavors and balanced acidity allow easy accessibility. The wine, with its gentle texture, is ready to drink.",84,Nicolas Idiart 2014 Pinot Noir (Val de Loire),,,,
"Fresh minerality and dancing floral notes make the nose on this reserve Riesling enticing. On the palate, typical Riesling flavors of spice and flowers are slightly slowed by a viscous, heavier mouthfeel, but overall, the wine is harmonious. Great with a spicy Indian dish like Vindaloo—it could hold its own.",84,Debonné 2006 Reserve Riesling (Grand River Valley),,,,
"Delicate scents suggesting aromatic herb, citrus blossom and a whiff of orchard fruit come together on this. The palate is round but rather shy, offering notes of mature yellow apple, honey and bitter almond.",87,San Quirico 2015  Vernaccia di San Gimignano,,,,
"Thin and tight, this high-acid Syrah is stubbornly closed. It's difficult to predict when—or if—it will open up. Right now, it doesn't show much beyond acid and stem.",84,Ryan Patrick 2009 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Tough, dry and gritty in tannins, with a bite of acidity. There's a solid core of blackberries, ripe and sweet from the summer sun, but this wine isn't offering much, and it finishes a bit on the hot side.",86,Silverado 2009 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"This is the producer's proprietary Merlot-driven blend, the variety comprising 60% of the whole, with 30% Cabernet Franc and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. Like its other blends, it spent 21 months in French oak, 75% of it new. Sanguine in currant and plum, its thick structure holds richer notes of chocolate and coconut. Drink now through 2023.",91,Blackbird Vineyards 2013 Illustration Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"Always one of New Zealand's top Syrahs, Le Sol delivers again in 2014. On this occasion it was surprisingly reticent on the nose, yet the class on the palate is undeniable. It's full-bodied, rich and velvety in texture, with pristine flavors of vanilla and black cherries that ease gently through a long, creamy finish. The most elegant Le Sol to date. Drink now–2025.",93,Craggy Range 2014 Le Sol Gimblett Gravels Syrah (Hawke's Bay),,,,
"This Bordeaux-style blend is 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, with the balance a mix of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec. It's a sophisticated blend that retains its youthful freshness. Deep flavors run from black cherry through cassis, adding streaks of licorice, baking chocolate and a hint of bark and herb. Supple, graceful and polished, this wine would seem to have another decade of life ahead.",91,Brian Carter Cellars 2008 Solesce Red (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Aromas of stewed berry fruits, olive and herbs combine to form a soupy bouquet. This is fairly racy, with a touch of spiky tartaric acid creating mild astringency. Stewy, roasted flavors of black fruits and carob finish herbal.",85,Echeverria 2012 Classic Collection Carmenère (Curicó Valley),,,,
"Ripe apple and banana flavors lead this native yeast-fermented, oak-aged wine. Its loose-knit mix of fruit seems on the cusp of oxidation and is countered with tart, lemony acidity.",87,Twill 2014 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This wine opens with mature black plum, blue flower and cooking spice aromas. The juicy, easy-drinking palate delivers ripe blackberry and blueberry jam flavors, with a hint of pink peppercorn. Velvety tannins provide smooth support. Enjoy through 2020.",88,Morgante 2014 Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),,,,
"Soft and ripe, this has flavors of almond, pink grapefruit and attractive, crisp acidity. With its warm character that's embellished with toast, it is ready to drink now.",86,Roux Père et Fils 2010  Mâcon-Villages,,,,
"Very sprightly lemon notes sprout from the more rounded apple flavors on nose and palate. There is a slight backdrop of autolytic bread notes but a frothy, almost urgent freshness that wants to come to the fore. This might well serve as a palate-freshener between courses. The friendly apple scent makes it a welcome pick-up.",89,Jean-Baptiste Adam NV Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),,,,
"Coombsville has emerged as the hottest appellation in Napa Valley, and Cameron Hughes is right there, doing his negociant thing. The Cabernet was blended with Malbec and Merlot, and the wine is fantastically satisfying. Its rich, sturdy tannins frame elaborate blackberry, blueberry, red currant and smoky oak flavors that are wonderfully complex, with an elegant, balanced finish. This is an unbelievable price for a Cabernet of this high quality.",93,Cameron Hughes 2011 Lot 451 Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville),,,,
"This elegant sparkling wine has a subdued fragrance that reveals delicate floral and nut aromas. The palate is more expressive, offering citrus, tropical fruit and roasted almond flavors. The pleasant foamy texture is accompanied by lively acidity.",89,Antica Fratta NV Brut Sparkling (Franciacorta),,,,
"Stony lemon-lime aromas are low on fruit but clean and familiar. This is racy and fresh, with cutting acidity. Flavors of lime and passion fruit register as common, while the finish is zesty, with an emphasis on grapefruit.",85,Viña Bisquertt 2014 Petirrojo Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"This blend of Semillon, Traminer, Shiraz and Frontignac (a form of Muscat) features orange, berry and spice aromas and sweet flavors not unlike berry sherbet, with just a squeeze of citrus on the finish. Soft and frothy; drink now.",84,Yellow Tail NV Bubbles Sparkling Rosé Wine Sparkling (South Eastern Australia),,,,
"Here's a slightly sweet, warm-climate white with dense aromas of almond, peach and honeydew. The wine offers an easy, lean structure and a no-fuss approach.",84,Borgo di Colloredo 2006 Malvasia (Terra degli Osci),,,,
"Citrus and tropical fruit aromas blend together in clean, attractive fashion. The palate is crisp and cleansing due to firm acidity, while flavors of lime and pithy orange finish tight. This is a clean, clear presentation of Salta Torrontés.",87,Alta Vista 2012 Premium Torrontés (Salta),,,,
"Clean lines of lemon-lime juice, orange zest, pink rose petals and peach show on the crisp yet ripe nose of this bottling. The palate is zesty and framed by a chalky tension, showing slightly sour flavors of lime peel and hints of stone fruit in the background.",88,Chesebro 2016 Rosé of Grenache (Arroyo Seco),,,,
"This blend of Touriga Nacional with Merlot is perfumed and light. It has a salmon pink color, layers of citrus as well as red-currant fruit and a soft texture. Drink now.",84,Quinta da Lapa 2015 Vinho Selection Rosé (Tejo),,,,
"Made with native grapes Corvina, Rondinella e Oseleta, this wine has a fragrance of black fruit, raisin and spice. The smooth palate delivers ripe plum and blackberry layered with pepper notes and a hint of cocoa.",89,Masi 2009 Brolo Campofiorin Red (Veronese),,,,
"Just hinting at maturity, this rich and stylish wine features finely balanced tannins, a juicy blackberry flavor and fruity ripeness. Using fruit sourced from the small appellation of Canon-Fronsac, on the hill close to Saint-Émilion, this wine is ready to drink and is full of flavor, with concentration on the finish.",90,Château Canon 2005  Canon-Fronsac,,,,
"The brilliant garnet-pink color of this wine makes a great first impression but the wine loses a few points on the nose where Camembert cheese or Parmigiano-like aromas are a distraction. Red-berry fruit fragrances do work their way to the top and the wine has an attractive crisp, spicy close.",86,Cantina Terlano 2006 Rosé (Alto Adige),,,,
"Fresh and crisply fruity, this is a balanced, lively wine. A touch of caramel adds to the tannic edge, giving the wine a good structure along with ripe strawberry fruits. The wine is ready to drink.",89,Château de l'Aubrade 2015 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé),,,,
"A bit of bottle age has made this vintage quite fascinating, with cola, black tea, black plum and mulberry on this wine's deep and peppery nose. The flavor profile is hearty with star anise and dried spearmint as well as deeper dried red-fruit touches. The texture is mild but the overall experience is complete.",92,Black Ridge 2011 Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),,,,
"The floral, candied aromas seem odd for Chile. On the palate this feels powerful and wide, with flavors of floral red berry, kirsch and spiced jam. It feels juicy and high in acidity; the finish lacks some texture.",85,Cremaschi Furlotti 2008 Edición Limitada de Familia Red (Loncomilla Valley),,,,
"A 100% varietal and estate-grown wine, this has a puckering density to the palate amid a plushness and richness of body and weight. Dense in blackberry and plum, it offers additional elements of tar and crackling bacon.",89,Westwood 2014 Annadel Gap Vineyard Estate Syrah (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"This opens with aromas of toast, oak and roasted coffee bean that follow through to the tense palate of raw berry and powdered sage. Astringent tannins provide the framework.",87,Sassi San Cristoforo 2012  Barbaresco,,,,
"This is too oaky. The wine is just overwhelmed by charry toast and strong, spicy oak wood flavors. Some people confuse the taste of Chardonnay with the taste of oak, but they are not the same.",83,Bonneau 2005 Catherine's Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros),,,,
"The wine is structured and still firm, showing tight tannins and acidity over the red fruits. A cool edge elicits the fresher character of the fruits. Drink from 2016.",86,Domaine Jean Petitot et Fils 2011 Les Vignottes  (Côte de Nuits-Villages),,,,
"Shows good Sonoma Coast character in the tart acids and cool-climate flavors of pomegranates, cherries and cola. Lots of new French oak adds rich notes of buttered toast and smoke. Appealingly dry, it's a fancy, elegant wine from this fine producer, but finishes a little short. Drink over the next 2–3 years.",89,Patz & Hall 2011 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"The lemony nose promises freshness. Tangy citrus fruits are abundant on the flowing palate, which wraps you up in its easy freshness. This is balanced, fruity and very refreshing.",90,Türk 2015 Kremser Wachtberg Reserve Riesling (Kremstal),,,,
"Gorgeous violet and spiced red-cherry notes are fragrant on this harmonious Pinot Noir. Elegant and brisk, this has tart, sour fruit flavors that are accented by loads of fresh green herb and a crushed-stone minerality.",89,Bloomer Creek 2009 Vintner's Select Unfined & Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),,,,
"A delicious apple flavored wine, fruity-crisp and packed with lively acidity. It has a fine, light mousse, smoothly textured and with lively, perfumed final acidity. Drink now.",87,Dão Sul 2010 Condessa de Santar Extra Brut Sparkling (Dão),,,,
"Supple purple fruits with hints of game, coffee and pepper demonstrate the validity of Mourvèdre as a stand-alone variety. Excellent definition and a character more sleek than Syrah, more gamy than Cabernet.",89,Bunnell 2007 Northridge Vineyard Mourvèdre (Wahluke Slope),,,,
"A blend of Sémillon and Cabernet Franc, this is a smooth, soft wine. It has soft fruitiness, some fresh acidity and a light but clean aftertaste.",83,Jaillance NV Brut  (Crémant de Bordeaux),,,,
"This slightly sparkling wine opens with heady aromas of spring wild flowers, white peach and Bartlett pear. The vibrant palate doles out beeswax, chamomile, acacia, green apple and citrus zest alongside tangy acidity and small bubbles.",89,Perlage 2014 Riva Moretta  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
"This producer impresses again with this vibrantly layered, fleshy coastal-grown white, which is golden in color and brooding in baked lemon and a length of spiced apple. Its nicely contoured acidity supports a tang of crisp citrus.",93,Lombardi 2014 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"This wine has distinct acidity, probably too much. Red currant fruits dominate, giving the wine elegance, but also showing some unripe fruit flavors and a texture that is too light and unfocused.",84,Maison Champy 2006 Les Champs Pimont Premier Cru  (Beaune),,,,
"Pale blush to the eye with a soft bouquet of apple and peach, this wine has flavors of grapefruit, aniseed and menthol with sophisticated savory undertones. The rounded finish offers just the right touch of brightness.",88,Suvla 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc Rosé (Thrace),,,,
"Firm and dense, this is a wine with a good future. Its blackberry fruits, smoky dry tannins and touches of wood aging are joined with acidity to bring out a structured character. Drink from 2016.",87,Château Grand Billard 2012  Bordeaux,,,,
"Round, ripe and quite pretty cherry fruit flavors, showing a hint of loam and a briny note. Tannins have smoothed out, and the length is better than average. Score could improve with further bottle age.",89,McCrea Cellars 2007 Boushey Grande Côte Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley),,,,
"Produced from Grand Cru vineyards in Oger, this is a intensely fresh and crisp wine. It has the brightest lime juice acidity that is cool, perfumed and bright. This lively bottling could do with a few more months in bottle.",91,Jean Milan NV Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),,,,
"This pink sweet sparkling wine opens with sweet notes of raspberry, vanilla cream, cinnamon and a touch of white pepper. The smooth mouthfeel is supported by fizzy effervescence. Incrocio Manzoni 13.0.25 was created in the 1930's by Italian professor Luigi Mazoni and is a cross between Raboso del Piave and Moscato d'Amburgo grapes.",85,Bonotto delle Tezze NV Manzoni Moscato Rosé Sparkling (Veneto),,,,
"Aromas of tropical fruit and citrus blossom lead the nose on this rich sparkler. The round, rather sweet palate doles out banana, green apple, yellow peach and apricot alongside a foaming mousse. Less sweet than a dessert wine, it would pair nicely with vanilla ice cream or cream-filled pastries.",87,Zardetto 2014 Zeta Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore),,,,
"The under-$10 high scorer is fast disappearing, so take a good look at this young, jammy Tempranillo-Shiraz blend that hits nicely with ripe boysenberry and black plum. The Shiraz seems to have darkened the wine, and the mouthfeel is ripe and lush.",88,Volteo 2006 Tempranillo + Shiraz Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),,,,
"Big, raisiny and obtuse up front, this fully extracted Malbec is heavy on the palate, with raisin, prune and cassis flavors that show interior notes of green herbs. This tastes minty, herbal and hot on the finish, with barely any freshness.",84,Bodega Cuarto Dominio 2014 Lote 44 Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
Here is a creamy and dense Chardonnay that is driven forward by sharp lines of lemon and citric fruit. This cool-climate expression shows balance and complexity.,88,Tiefenbrunner 2009 Chardonnay (Alto Adige),,,,
"A little bit softer on the nose than the winery's appellation blend, this shows cola, candied purple fruit and cinnamon on the nose. The palate focuses on tight cherry and wild berries, made tart with black cherry and plum skins. It manages to show a great deal of balanced restraint for rather ripe fruit.",91,Wedell Cellars 2011 Fiddlestix Vineyard The Barn Find Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"While the Arinto is normally found further south in Lisboa, this wine comes from vines that have the same ocean influence. That keeps it fresh even through the oak aging, so the wine is both rich, toasty and cut with attractive citrus acidity. This one is still young and will be better from 2017, although it is ready to drink now.",88,Adega de Cantanhede 2014 Marquês de Marialva Reserva Arinto (Bairrada),,,,
"Sports an explosively fruity nose of berry and plum, with cloves and toasty oak in support. Medium-weight, with very nice fruit and good structure, it displays some engaging chocolate and spice notes. The finish is brisk and tangy, with bitter cocoa notes and firm, drying tannins. Hold until 2005.",91,Monticello Vineyards 1997 Corley Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"89-91 Firm and structured, plenty of bitter chocolate as well as sweet fruit. The wine is very dense, wearing its tannins on the surface. Power here, dark and firm.",90,Château Belgrave 2010 Barrel sample  (Haut-Médoc),,,,
"A wine made like this doesn't come along every day. It was 100% whole-cluster fermented with wild yeast and aged in all neutral barrels. Its rich, soothing and complex personality makes it perfect for a special occasion that involves something like roast quail, sauteed mushrooms or beef bourgignon. It has full body and layered aromas of black tea, ripe plums and cigar box, combined with both fruity and savory flavors and fine tannins.",94,Baxter 2013 Oppenlander Vineyard Whole Cluster Pinot Noir (Mendocino),,,,
"This wine is predominately Cabernet Sauvignon, with smaller amounts of other Bordeaux red varieties. Together, they offer bold, ripe red-currant and -berry flavors, with a rich entry and gravelly texture. Highly stylized, grippy tannins and a leather note provide additional strength.",93,Joseph Phelps 2014 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,

"Made with organically farmed grapes, this delicious white opens with aromas of citrus blossom and white stone fruit. The tangy, medium-bodied palate offers a lovely depth of flavors that include juicy tangerine, lime, white peach, bitter almond and mineral. Crisp acidity brightens the rich flavors and carries through to the clean finish.",91,ColleStefano 2015  Verdicchio di Matelica,,,,
"The aromas are completely dominated by oaky tones of toast, yet the palate shows the true character of this wine: juicy red-currant and blackberry flavors pop against a veil of lightly grilled herbs. Medium in weight and round in feel, the palate shows an appropriate balance of tannin and acid. While this is a late release, it still needs a few more years to integrate. Drink from 2017.",87,Veritas 2010 Cabernet Franc (Monticello),,,,
"Fermented in stainless steel and neutral oak, this light-bodied, well-structured white impresses with pretty citrus blossom scents and tart, high-toned acidity. Pungent with lemon and lime flavor, it develops bolder melon and pear notes as it opens in the glass.",92,Stewart Cellars 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),,,,
"Important and sophisticated, this has aged gracefully over the years.

"From the winery's Bordeaux study series, this Merlot-based blend shows roast beef, smoke, lilac, violet, lavender and shy black-cherry fruit on the nose.

Lohr 2013 Cuvée Pom Red (Paso Robles),,,,
This spicy wine offers peppery strawberry flavors and plenty of citrusy acids. It's still a little disjointed and could benefit from additional bottle age.,87,Sol Stone 2011 Solare Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,

"Opens with a sweet opulent nose driven by aromas of plump cherry, moist pipe tobacco, chocolate fudge, vanilla bean and ground espresso. But the wine is not modern or overtly international in terms of its style. It shows deep roots in Montalcino tradition and a bold, overt personality. Earth, leather and dried tobacco drive the finish.",92,Cordella 2007  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,

Try as a softer, gentler version to Cabernet.",92,C Square 2007 Merlot (Bennett Valley),,,,
"A monumental Cabernet that succeeds on every level. It's deep, dark and ultrarich, showing massive blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate, violets, minerals and a touch of sweet, smoky oak. Beyond the flavors is the dramatic structure, with fabulously ripe, dense tannins and a bone-dry, long finish. Surely a tremendous wine capable of long-term aging. Try 2012–2018, at least.",97,Trefethen 2005 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Oak Knoll District),,,,
"Rich and concentrated for an entry-level wine, with earthy, bold aromas and a lush, well-balanced palate feel. Deep and sweet in terms of flavor, with a mix of ripe black fruits and herbs.

"Smooth and spicy, this has lots of raspberry, cherry and smoky wood flavors that taste sweet and savory, but turn nicely dry and complex on the finish. It shows real class. Best over the next few years.",90,Kenwood 2010 Jack London Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Mountain),,,,
"Bold and fruity, this saignée-style rosé is 75% Syrah and 25% Pinot Noir. Tart, tangy, primary fruit flavors of watermelon, strawberry and cranberry fill the mouth, turning just a little bit sour in the finish.",87,Coeur de Terre 2013 Rustique Rosé (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Wild berry, herb and rhubarb aromas precede a wiry, grabby palate with generic berry flavors, herbal accents and spice.

"This is a superrich and ripe wine that many will find over the top, but it will certainly wow those looking for extreme concentration.

"Smashed berries, honeyed coffee, leather, beef jerky, cola and black pepper show on the nose of this complex wine by the legendary Hearst family.

"Smooth, integrated aromas of cookie dough, forest floor and briary berry fruits lead to a palate that's plump on the edges but more intense and pulling in the middle.

"This aromatic wine offers rich fruit and floral scents. It's tart and spicy on the palate, with bright red fruit.

"Here's a pretty Brunello that shows interesting complexity and bright aromas that really distinguish this wine from other 2008s.

"The aromas of this robust rosé scream “Pinot Noir,” with their earthy, leathery, cherry and barnyard elements.

"Lush, opulent aromas of tropical fruit, spice and honey lead this Tokaji from Hungary. On the palate, the wine is supple and unctuous without heaviness, coating the tongue with more pineapple, orange and honey and finishing off with a delicious, lingering finesse.",91,Patricius 2000 Aszú 5 Puttonyos Tokaji (Tokaj),,,,
"Light in color, intriguing aromas of cedar, mushroom, orange peel, smoke and cigar box are followed by somewhat faint elegantly styled red-fruit and spice flavors. It falls a bit flat on the palate.",86,The Walls 2014 Wonderful Nightmare Stoney Vine Vineyard Tempranillo (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"This is a low-production wine sourced from a single block in the winery's estate vineyard. It has a modest oak influence and brisk acidity. The wine is easy to like with tart papaya, lime, peach and vanilla flavors.",88,Kunde 2012 Vineyard Block 4SB20 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"This barrel-fermented wine drinks like a beautifully proportioned Chardonnay. It takes bright, intense fruit flavors of melon, yellow apples and green bananas, and puts a Burgundian spin on the mouthfeel with judicious acids and a touch of caramel. It's delicious, complex and should age nicely for another five to six years.",93,Harper Voit 2015 Surlie Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley),,,,
"There's a slight bit of pleasant funk to the nose of this appellation blend, as well as graphite, sour cherry, soy and shiitake mushroom aromas. The palate is wound around tight acidity, with wild raspberry flavors lifted by incense and pine forest elements.",92,Dragonette 2014 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"Lemon mousse, pear and peach notes open the nose of this fresh Greco di Tufo. There is a drying mineral tone at the back that holds the wine together nicely.",87,Vesevo 2011  Greco di Tufo,,,,
"This extreme wine has vivid earthy aromas like wood smoke and cured meats and equally smoky, meaty flavors. The mouthfeel is quite dry and tannic, and any fruit flavors take a back seat to the gamey character.",84,Jelly Jar 2013 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lake County),,,,
"Made mostly with Chardonnay and aged in barriques, this full-bodied white leads with aromas of white spring flower, beeswax, honey and toasted oak.

"Crushed slate, plush rose petals, red cherry, smoked beef, vanilla and a slightly feral quality arise on the nose of this bottling from the region's most iconic vineyard. There is great tension on the sip, with tart plum skin, bright raspberry and dark cranberry fruit meeting with black spice, sandalwood and incense flavors. Acidity binds it all together.",93,Testarossa 2014 Pisoni Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),,,,

"This year's blend of 53% Mourvèdre, 18% Counoise, 17% Grenache and 12% Cinsault shows squeezed elderberries, black raspberries, dried rose petals, potpourri, dried sagebrush and wet slate on the nose. The palate pops with more raspberries, pomegranate, dried fennel, white pepper and a touch of cooked lamb.",91,Epiphany 2013 Gypsy Red (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"An open and inviting scent of ripe pear is freshened by an impression of wet pebbles, cold stone and citrus. The palate is textured and expressive, giving a broader canvas to these fruity, fresh flavors that have a lovely edge of gentle bitterness. The palate finishes just off dry.",90,Domaine Fernand Engel 2014 Cuvée Engel Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"Solid, very structured, packed with dense and dry tannins. There is a core of acidity and darkness that gives the wine a brooding, powerful character. At this stage, it seems austere although it does have the weight of fruit typical of the year.",96,Château Haut-Brion 2009  Pessac-Léognan,,,,
"Rubbery, herbaceous aromas of iodine, grass and black olive are challenging to say the least. This is high in tartaric acid, with saucy, herbal berry flavors that finish with residual olive notes.",84,Ventisquero 2013 Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"There are only a few examples of Grüner Veltliner from the state, and this one—from the Columbia Gorge and Terrace Heights—shows the variety's promise at the right site and in the right hands.

"The color of this wine is deep, with a bright ruby rim. Effusive and enticing aromas of spicy cinnamon, toasted oak and red cherry notes meld into black cherry and pomegranate flavors.

"89–91. Barrel sample. In its ninth harvest as the Médoc bottling from Château Cos d'Estournel, Goulée is coming into its own as the vineyard matures.

"Made from a third each of co-fermented Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, all from the family estate, this is a dense, lovely wine, rich in red fruit, chocolate, clove and cedar, with a generosity of tannin that suggests aging. Drink now through 2020.",91,Volker Eisele Family Estate 2012 Terzetto Red (Napa Valley),,,,

"This Syrah has a fine, complex structure of tannins and acids, with flashy black currant and oak flavors. Flavors of grilled meat sprinkled with black pepper lend a profile that's characteristically Syrah.

"Cool-climate aromas of passion fruit, nettle, tarragon and minerality are present in this Chilean SB.

Firm black fruits hold down the core.",90,Market Vineyards 2010 Arbitrage Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A little hard on the nose, with burnt undertones. The palate is hollow in the middle and the wine collapses on itself. As for flavors, look for mildly toasted and creamy white fruits and vanilla.",84,Finca Vides 2009 Torcidas Chardonnay (Mendoza),,,,
"This is a plump, medium-bodied rosé at a reasonable price. Pomelo or grapefruit notes combine with stone fruit, then finish stony-dry and tart.",87,La Châsse 2016 Prestige Rosé (Côtes du Rhône),,,,

"Ripe, baked black-fruit aromas go heavy on the raisin and prune, with a hint of spice cake thrown in. On the palate, this is saturated and a bit thick. Baked berry, cassis and creamy oak flavors finish lush and chewy, with flavors of oak grain and chocolate. Drink now through 2020.",92,Valduero 2012 I Unacepa  (Ribera del Duero),,,,
"Bridlewood has crafted a very serious Syrah, from a region of Santa Barbara County that excels at this Rhône variety. The wine is fully dry and full-bodied, with rich, dense tannins, but what's notable is the depth of flavor. The blackberries, currants, licorice, cola, mocha and smoky oak flavors are very rich. Drink now and for a few years.",92,Bridlewood 2004 Estate Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),,,,

"For a wine with high-end designs, this has a few issues, namely a pinched, leathery bouquet and then an herbal essence to both the palate and finish. But seeing that it's 55% Carmenère and 45% Syrah, that makes sense. What's best about Vertice is the solid mouthfeel and the way it avoids being jammy or overly sweet and candied.",87,Ventisquero 2005 Vertice Apalta Vineyards Red (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"This small-batch Merlot (57 cases total) is concentrated up front, with aromas of balsam wood, cigar box, asphalt and hard-charging black fruits.

It's drinking well now.",91,Boëté 2005 Saunders Vineyard Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Carmel Valley),,,,
"Dark purple in color, this is a fully realized Pinot Noir, aged longer in bottle before release, to great effect. Spicy and earthy, it offers a density that's not overwhelming but gives the wine an ideal combination of style and substance, complex in cherry and vanilla.",92,Fort Ross Vineyard 2010 Reserve Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview),,,,
"Sunny tropical fruit and honey on the nose contrast with the brisk mineral tones on the palate of this refreshing dry wine. Crisp and quaffable, it's an elegant introduction to this mysterious, slightly savory grape.",86,Castell 2013 Castell Trocken Silvaner (Franken),,,,
"Many vintners are now using stone and concrete vessels to craft part of their blends, but this Niven family project goes all the way by bottling their stone-aged wine solo.

"This bargain-priced wine is oaky and bland, with a smell of menthol.",81,Harlow Ridge 2011 Chardonnay (Lodi),,,,
"This has a warm and inviting cherry compote aroma.

"This wine plays with the herbal, slightly green side of the Bordeaux grape, with oregano, thyme and just-cracked pepper spicing up the soft red strawberry and plum fruit on the nose. Dried herbs show strongly on the palate, alongside elderberry fruit and cedar.",86,Maddalena 2011 Merlot (Paso Robles),,,,
"Young, tart and compact, this is still in the primary fruit phase of its development.

"The cool Coonawarra region can produce Shiraz with more elegance and complexity than is seen in hot regions, and this is a fine example, balancing ample weight with juicy acidity. Toasty oak frames flavors of cassis and mint, blackberry and spice. Drink this great value from now–2020.",91,Penley Estate 2005 Hyland Shiraz (Coonawarra),,,,
"This full-bodied red opens with aromas of ripe plum, crushed violet, leather and dried aromatic herb. The firmly structured palate delivers dried black cherry, aniseed, tobacco and clove accompanied by tightly knit, assertive tannins. Wait a couple of years for the tannins to unfold then drink up to capture the remaining fruit richness. Drink 2017–2021.",89,Canneto 2011 Riserva  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),,,,
"This is a structured, firm wine that's intensely tannic, but full of potential. Still brash and youthful, it's full of concentrated black-cherry and berry flavors that are unabashedly forward. The texture is dry and dense, but with age the wine should integrate. Drink from 2016.",92,Patrick Javillier 2011  Aloxe-Corton,,,,
"Full and ripe, this wine also has good acidity that gives a lively edge to the yellow-fruit flavors. Along with the peach and apricot fruits, it presents refreshing crispness. The aftertaste delivers a great lift of acidity.",89,Domaine de la Croix Senaillet 2014  Mâcon-Davayé,,,,
"This young, fruity Champagne has delicious red-berry flavors balanced by lemon-zest acidity. It conveys a cool texture with its blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay from the Côte des Blancs. The aftertaste is mineral-tight.",89,Gauthier-Christophe NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne),,,,
"Simple, bright and refreshing, this offers aromas of white flower, stone fruit, citrus and crushed mineral. Flavors of sweet fruit and peach are followed by creamy foam and lemon-lime acidity.",87,Macaron NV  Prosecco,,,,
"Convincing and individual across its aromas, flavors and nuances. Casa Marin is a leader in coastal Sauvignon Blanc, and this full-bodied, racy wine grabs your attention with its crisp, pure personality. It is zesty and alive, with apple and green-fruit flavors, while the focused finish isnarrow and committed. Drink now.",89,Casa Marin 2008 Cipreses Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (San Antonio),,,,
"Peppermint tea and eucalyptus combine on the bouquet, providing distinctiveness. High-strung rhubarb and orange follow suit, the overall experience in the glass light and bristling. Unique, this wine may not be for everyone, but is appealing nonetheless.",88,Robert Mondavi 2013 Pinot Noir (Carneros-Napa Valley),,,,
"High-toned aromas of black cherry syrup and orange peel carry the nose. The thick, syrupy palate lacks much acidity and is reminiscent of flat Dr. Pepper, yet a roasted coffee tone is welcomed on the finish.",82,Haak 2009 Light Madeira Jacquez (Texas),,,,
"Smooth and oaky, this value-minded wine offers varietal notes of cassis and cranberry, with traces of dried herb, cedar and pencil lead. A heftier midpalate strengthens in the glass before a long, clove-infused finish.",88,Franciscan 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"A smoky, well-toasted bread aroma carries through in the flavors, giving a black pepper counterpoint to the ripe and easy apple and almond notes. A creamy texture helps carry and blend those complex traits from the first sip to the lingering finish. It should improve through 2018.",89,Chatom Vineyards 2013 Semillon (Calaveras County),,,,
"This lovely wine has a great depth of decadent, succulent aromas of citrus and apple blossom, that explode around tangy acidity. Pear, quince and lemongrass-ginger spice dot the palate in measured, beautiful ways, finishing balanced and crisp.",91,Schug 2014 Schug Estate Chardonnay (Carneros),,,,
"Hekate, made with a blend of aromatic grapes from Sicily, is a rich and decadent wine that opens with a luminous amber color and intense aromas of candied orange, sweet almond paste, dried flowers, peach and honeysuckle. The wine is thick and dense with crisp citrus flavors and would pair with crème caramel.",91,Feudo Arancio 2007 Hekate 500ml White (Sicilia),,,,
"Pungent stony citrus aromas include a distinct whiff of passion fruit. This feels tight, crisp and elegant on the palate, while slightly salty citrus flavors suggest grapefruit and sea brine. A briny finish retains snap and freshness.",89,Errazuriz 2016 Max Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Aconcagua Costa),,,,
"The mighty Martha's spends three-and-a-half years aging in French Limousin oak barrels. It has years to go, its structure so expertly captured in the bottle, yet still willing to impart a lightness of sage and sarsaparilla, the tannins firm and integrated, with slight hints of cigar, coconut and that ever-famous mint. Drink now through 2025.",94,Heitz 2010 Martha's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),,,,
"Situated two miles north of the castle of Blaye, this estate's vintage delivered tannins as well as fruit here, with acidity and blackberry fruit. It is a structured wine, still young with its bright fruits and crisp character. Drink from 2018.",88,Château Haut Canteloup 2014  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,,,,
A rich mouthfeel and considerable sweetness come with oaky spicy aromas and jammy fruit flavors in this full-bodied and rather tannic wine that was blended from mostly Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon.,87,One 2015 Flock Red (California),,,,
"Hard and herbal on the nose, with cherry and a note of wet cement or chemical. Narrow and fairly choppy and tannic in the mouth, with forceful cherry, plum and buttery oak flavors. Sweetens up with time but remains tannic and hard.",83,Salton 2006 Talento Red (Campanha),,,,
"Anywhere but in Oregon, this could be labeled Pinot Noir, which makes up 80% of the blend; the rest is Zinfandel. It's a combination that makes sense in the Columbia Gorge. The Pinot is more earthy and tannic than in the Willamette Valley, and the Zin lighter than you find in California. The result is a wine tasting of wild cherries, tart, spicy and quite quaffable.",87,Cathedral Ridge 2008 Necessity Red Red (Columbia Valley (OR)),,,,
"A brawny yet refined expression of oak and coffee, this is an intense red wine crafted from mostly Syrah grapes, with smaller amounts of Petite Syrah, Zinfandel, Alicante Bouschet and Mourvèdre. Well-made it is balanced and age-worthy, the proper pour for a slab of grilled meat slathered in spicy sauce.",88,Borra 2010 Fusion Red (Lodi),,,,
"Aromas of leafy underbrush, cellar floor and crushed herb carry over to a palate of raw red cherry and dried sage. Astringent tannins give it a tongue-drying finish.",87,Paitin 2010 Vecchie Vigne Sorì Paitin Riserva  (Barbaresco),,,,
"You'll love the vertical delivery of this delicate Barolo. Aromas of cherry cola, cedar, truffle and anise go straight to the nose and are followed by subtle shadings of wild berry, clove, allspice and a hint of dill. Instead of intensity, this wine offers penetration and persistency with a bright and crisp mouthfeel.",90,Barale Fratelli 2004 Vigna Cannubi  (Barolo),,,,
"This ripe, balanced wine is structured and packed with fruit. The firm tannins of Tannat are given a perfumed lift by Cabernet Franc, filling the palate with blackberry fruit and fine, balanced acidity. It's still young and bursting with fruit, ready to drink from 2018.",90,Famille Laplace 2015 Aydie L'Origine Tannat-Cabernet Franc (Madiran),,,,
"This fine vintage of Insignia combines 87% Cabernet Sauvignon with 9% Petit Verdot, 2% Malbec and 2% Cabernet Franc. Soft, supple and seamless, it offers rich but balanced cassis and milk chocolate flavors, with supportive and complementary oak. It should do well in the cellar and will be best from 2024–2034.",96,Joseph Phelps 2014 Insignia Estate Grown Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"This Greek Sauvignon Blanc is both fruity and dry with a crisp, fresh nose and simply good lemon and spice flavors. Clean with a medium body. A good everyday white for lighter dishes.",84,Protopapas 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Pageon),,,,
"Restrained in style, with modest pear and honey notes tinged with a toasty, mealy edge. Shows some nice creaminess to the midpalate, then fades gradually on the finish. Drink now.",85,Paul Jaboulet Aîné 2006 Les Cèdres White (Châteauneuf-du-Pape),,,,
"Called “Apiana” because Muscat is attractive to bees, this is very dry and lightly perfumed. It has great fresh acidity to complement the grape and spice character.",87,Domaine Vincent Stoeffler 2010 Uva Apiana Muscat (Alsace),,,,
"This nonvintage cuvée sums up the Gosset style in its precise texture and crisp, taut acidity. A blend of fruit from the Montagne de Reims and the Côte des Blancs, it shows some attractive maturity. Given its balanced, perfumed aftertaste and great fruitiness, this is a Champagne to drink now.",92,Gosset NV Grande Réserve Brut  (Champagne),,,,
"This opens with aromas of camphor, dried herb and red berry while the firm palate shows black licorice, peppercorn, sour cherry and a hint of tobacco. A backbone of assertive tannins provides structure. Drink after 2020.",90,Podere Ruggeri Corsini 2012 Bricco San Pietro  (Barolo),,,,
"There's no shortage of heavily charred oak, and early on it may seem a bit mulchy and leathery. But as it knits together and the fruit rises, you'll see that there's a compact, serious wine laying in wait. Flavors of blackberry, licorice and herbs are authentic and powerful. Clacky tannins make food almost mandatory.",86,TerraNoble 2006 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"Mineral and leather aromas are a combination of the wine's rocky soil origins and heat and dryness from 15.2% alcohol. Evolves in the glass, going from tasting spicy/earthy to medicinal plum and berry. Finishes round, sweet, hot, herbal and syrupy.",86,Las Rocas de San Alejandro 2009 Garnacha (Calatayud),,,,
"Even the very best Txakoli won't appeal to everyone, and this rosé is far from the best. Fruitless aromas of arugula and vinaigrette set up a sour palate with arrow-sharp acidity. Piercing, tart citrus flavors end with scour and sizzle.",83,Txomín Etxaníz 2014 Rosé (Getariako Txakolina),,,,
"This is a muscular Merlot, exotic in cinnamon/cardamom spice that's otherwise soft, structured and complex. The tannins are most pronounced on the finish and need time to further integrate, but make the wine long-lasting in leathery cassis and tobacco flavor.",89,Occasio 2010 Thatcher Bay Vineyard Merlot (Livermore Valley),,,,
"Perfumed with leather and black pepper, this wine is ultimately overly tart and flatly structured.",82,Peter Cellars 2014 Syrah (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"This lively, muscular, full-bodied wine ripples with smoky, meaty, peppery aromas. A thick, almost chewy texture partners with rowdy blackberry flavors and vivid tannins that will tame the rarest steak or wildest game.",91,Saxon Brown 2010 Parmelee-Hill Vineyard Owl Ridge Block Syrah (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Shows wonderfully ripe, pure Pinot Noir fruit flavors, with black and red cherries and currants elaborated with exotic Asian spices and sweet, smoky sandalwood. Very tasty and elegant now and for the next several years.",88,Buena Vista 2006 Pinot Noir (Carneros),,,,
"The layer of tannins verges on too much. It is saved by ripe fruit that cuts through to give a warm, red currant and berry freshness. Acidity is well in balance in this wine that needs a few months to age. Drink from 2016.",86,Château Ballan-Larquette 2013  Bordeaux,,,,
"This bargain-priced offering is simple, fruity and direct, marked by peach and pineapple notes and a silky texture. Drink now.",85,Settlers Rise 2016 Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia),,,,
"Initially fresh and herbaceous, then exotic with a tropical-fruit note, this wine boasts both a steely edge and a ripe center. It's young and could age, but at the moment it is fruitily delicious.",88,Patrick De Ladoucette 2011 Les Deux Tours Sauvignon Blanc (Touraine),,,,
"There is a lovely, poised balance between fresh, crisp fruitiness and peppered spice in this wine made from the increasingly rare Chasselas. It is light, flavored with apple and quince, very attractive and ready to drink now.",90,Domaine Schoffit 2012 Vieilles Vignes Chasselas (Alsace),,,,
This elegant 50-50 blend of Barbera and Nebbiolo (a popular blending formula for many Langhe red wines) offers the pulpy fruit and acidity of Barbera set against the finesse and menthol-like intensity of Nebbiolo. It's a match made in heaven.,88,Elvio Cogno 2008 Montegrilli Red (Langhe),,,,
"A white pepper aroma and full citrus and mineral flavors make this an interesting and multifaceted wine that also refreshes the taste buds. It has good, bracing acidity, medium body and subtle layering.",90,Two Angels 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (High Valley),,,,
"95–97. Barrel sample. Full and powerfully concentrated, this wine has dense acidity, sweet black fruits and very fine tannins. The concentration is enormous but it expresses itself through the prism of smooth, velvet-textured tannins.",96,Château Lafite Rothschild 2012 Barrel Sample  (Pauillac),,,,
"The nose on this bottling is very smoky and flinty, but also shows underlying pear and apple aromas. There's an intriguing lime-zest character to the palate, with a base of dried apples and a smoked-wood character that's hard to ignore.",87,Cameron Hughes 2014 Lot 526 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Round and velvety, it has aromas of ripe berry, chocolate and exotic spices. The rich palate delivers juicy black cherry punctuated with ground black pepper, cinnamon, carob, pipe tobacco and mint. Forward and sweet, this is already extremely accessible so enjoy soon. Drink through 2018.",91,La Poderina 2008 Poggio Abate Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"The winery's reserve-level bottling, this has the extra concentration to warrant the designation. Tart young berry/cherry fruit carries the brunt of the midpalate. The barrel treatment is delicately balanced, bringing in nuances of toast, coconut and almond. Very well made, and cellarworthy. Drink now through 2025.",93,Patton Valley 2012 Lorna Marie Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Aromas of wildflower, orchard fruit and hazelnut open on the nose. The lively, linear palate shows crunchy green pear, bitter almond and a hint of nutmeg alongside racy acidity.",87,Petrucco 2014 Friulano (Friuli Colli Orientali),,,,
"Antrum is a hugely bold and masculine wine that won't appeal to everyone. The appearance is inky black and the bouquet shows prune, toasted spice and leather. The tannins are sharp and slightly astringent despite the many years of bottle aging that have already occurred.",89,Ciavolich Giuseppe 2006 Antrum  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),,,,
"Plum cake, resin, leather, raisin and exotic spice aromas come together in the glass. On the dense palate, licorice, chopped sage and tobacco notes accent prune and blackberry while firm, fine-grained tannins offers support.",90,Corte Moschina 2011  Amarone della Valpolicella,,,,
"This good varietal rosé has a little more body and a little more breadth in the mouthfeel than many others, along with mild strawberry and cherry flavors that give it substance.",87,Cline 2016 Ancient Vines Mourvèdre Rosé (Contra Costa County),,,,
"This opens with sun-baked soil, mocha, prune and leafy underbrush aromas. The densely concentrated palate offers black cherry jam, espresso and vanilla flavors, with scorching alcohol and assertive tannins that leave an astringent finish.",87,Agostina Pieri 2012  Brunello di Montalcino,,,,
"Just barely acceptable, this soft, semisweet Cab has Lifesaver candy flavors of cherries and raspberries.",80,Pianetta 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Monterey),,,,
"This is an interesting wine that pushes the boundaries beyond the usual offerings in California. Blended from Viognier, Vermentino, Verdelho and Sauvignon Blanc, it's dry, tart and complex, with a broad range of citrus, white peach, dried apricot and white pepper flavors. Don't serve it too cold.",91,Vina Robles 2011 White4 White (Paso Robles),,,,
"Quite dry to the point of astringency, this stylish Syrah brings flavors of toast, coffee grounds and tangy berries. There is just a hint of finishing heat.",90,Rulo 2009 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"A pristine core of blackberry and cherry extend from nose to palate here, but there's an ample dose of spice, coconut and toast as well. Full bodied and supple in texture, it's a robust wine with an accessible fruity style.",88,Martha Clara 2012 Island Series Syrah (North Fork of Long Island),,,,
"This wine is soft and velvety, awash in classic notes of black currant and berry, textured in full-bodied, oaky waves of toast and cigar box. Approachable on the palate, it winds its way powerfully though softly from start to lengthy finish.",91,Turnbull 2012 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),,,,
"Ripe stone fruit and floral notes are accented by a dusty, chalky minerality on this bright, elegant Silvaner. It's dry in style, with sprightly acidity and just a hint of characteristic smoke and dried herb. Finishes with a touch of lime skin zest.",89,Castell 2012 Castell Trocken Silvaner (Franken),,,,
"Soft and pliable in body, it has gentle citrus hints and crisp acidity.",84,Landhaus Mayer 2013 Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),,,,
"Coconut-laden oak kicks off the entry of this wine, a crisp version of the variety that nonetheless exhibits plenty of oak characteristics and a rich ripeness of baked apple, pear and pineapple.",86,Bellacana 2013 Bellacana Vineyard Chardonnay (Alexander Valley),,,,
"This portion of the winery's vineyard always yields Cabernets of enormous concentration with hard tannins. The 2009 is a classic, detonating in the mouth with laserlike blackberry and cassis flavors, to which new oak brings additional richness of smoky cedar. It's really a beautiful wine, but very tannic, even by Von Strasser standards. Give it at least eight years, and it could be drinking well 20 years from now.",95,Von Strasser 2009 Sori Bricco Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),,,,
"Aromas bring notes of white flowers, candlewax and summer squash, showing no overt new-oak influence. The palate is medium bodied, delivering easy-drinking appeal.",87,Browne Family Vineyards 2016 Heritage Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Edgy and herbal, the 2010 Reserve mixes cranberry fruit with Mediterranean herbs. There's a suggestion of black olives also, and the tangy tartness adds lift to the mouthfeel.",88,David Hill 2010 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"A very rich and smooth Pinot Noir that is impressively concentrated. It has rich, structured fruit and fragrant acidity, red plums and a sense of tannin. This could certainly age, so drink after 2015.",90,Fournier Père et Fils 2010 No 22  (Sancerre),,,,
"Made in a tart, juicy style, this well-structured Cabernet Sauvignon should be decanted. The acid-driven berry flavors carry a hint of gun metal. A few more years of bottle age would be advisable.",91,Foundry Vineyards 2009 Artisan Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
An aroma like canned fruit and rather lean flavors make this a basic wine with a narrow profile.,82,Rotation Vineyards 2014 Chardonnay (California),,,,
"Minty, with a strong menthol character, this wine is high in acidity and overtly earthy. It offers a smoky after-note of leather and clove.",87,Chasseur 2014 Sexton Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"This Malbec opens with a blast of raw woodgrain, a lactic smell, leather and finally some black fruit. The palate is racy and potent, with resiny oak leading herbal berry flavors. A fiery, hot finish brings this to a scouring close.",85,Vistamar 2013 Sepia Reserva Malbec (Maule Valley),,,,
"Luscious dark-cherry aromas find milk chocolate and cherry-cola flavors in this medium-bodied, smooth but firm-textured wine made from Syrah and Petite Sirah grapes with a dash of Petit Verdot.",87,Tanner 2013 The Mineshaft Red (Sierra Foothills),,,,
"Aromatically brooding, this suggests dry chocolate, violets, brown stems, herbs, black pepper and smoked meat. It's restrained in style with pure, tart blue fruit flavors and a light squeeze of tannins that need additional time in bottle to settle in fully. Enjoy it at the dinner table to see it at its best.",91,Kerloo 2012 Les Collines Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),,,,
"The local white grape of Bairrada, Bical is normally used for sparkling wines, but here makes a light, fruity still bottling. It has a tangy orange-zest texture and crisp apple fruits, finishing with classic acidity. Drink the wine now.",86,Campolargo 2014 Branco Clássico Bical (Bairrada),,,,
"Fresh and linear, this offers spring wild flower and white stone fruit aromas while the luminous palate offers Bosc pear, citrus and a hint of white almond. It has a bright, slightly tangy finish.",88,Gianni Tessari 2016 Monte Tenda  (Soave Classico),,,,
"This is a soft, fresh and fruity wine. It has red berry flavors that are gently lifted by fine tannins. Acidity and a juicy aftertaste complete an attractive, ready-to-drink wine.",85,Casa Santos Lima 2013 Quinta do Figo Red (Lisboa),,,,
"Aromas of oak, toast, espresso and a whiff of violet come together. The firmly structured palate offers dried black cherry, orange zest and licorice alongside bracing tannins.",90,Ca'Romè 2012 Cerretta  (Barolo),,,,
"Complex mixed stone fruits dappled with sweet cinnamon spice lead into a fairly lush midpalate. The dominant flavor is fresh cut pear, and the creamy texture spreads the flavors broadly through the mouth. A lovely wine to match with halibut or swordfish.",89,Daedalus 2006 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This is a ripe, perfumed wine with smooth, generous texture and broad black fruits. An earthy, leathery edge gives extra character, and the suggestion of maturity comes from the wood aging and the ripe berry fruits. Drink now.",89,Château de Cénac 2012 Cuvée Prestige Malbec (Cahors),,,,
"Montevetrano is an impressive blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (60%), Merlot and Aglianico that shows the enormous potential of red wines from southern Italy. It will age 10 years or more, and it already shows deeply sophisticated flavors of tobacco, dry fruit and spice.",92,Montevetrano 2009 Montevetrano Red (Campania),,,,
"The aromas of coffee, red currant and red plum are bright and effusive, with tar and cough medicine notes in the background. The cherry flavors are plush and full, with coffee notes lingering on the finish.",88,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2013 Canoe Ridge Estate Merlot (Horse Heaven Hills),,,,
"Coppo's beautiful La Rocca Gavi is precisely the kind of wine you'll want to serve with smoked salmon, grilled tuna or fresh vegetables. There's a crisp, flinty quality that gives the wine a bright and lively feel followed by tones of citrus and honeydew melon.",88,Coppo 2011 La Rocca  (Gavi),,,,
"This Riserva blend of Negroamaro, Montepulciano and Malvasia Nera delivers very ripe and rich notes of strawberry jam and fruit preserves. The mouthfeel is polished and well-structured, but the wine exhibits a mature taste profile.",85,Agricole Vallone 2005 Riserva Vigna Flaminio Red (Puglia),,,,
"Cabernet Sauvignon from Champoux and Weinbau vineyards make up the heart of this wine, with a balance of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. Cocoa, vanilla, dark plum, spice and herb aromas are followed by generous dark fruit flavors that coat the palate from end to end, with a lingering coffee note. At once hedonistic and balanced, it has a long life ahead of it. Best after 2022.",92,Januik 2014 Reserve Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Grapy aromas of plum and pomegranate turn more wild with airing. Grabby, tannic and punchy across the palate, this wine tastes of herbal berry fruits, with a firm finish.",85,Bodegas Paniza 2015 Garnacha (Cariñena),,,,
"Although it's soft, it shows enough structure to support exceptionally ripe blackberry, black currant and spice flavors, with richness added by a heady note of liqueur. The tannins are substantial, and the wine is already throwing some sediment. Very nice now, and it should develop bottle nuance over the next 6–8 years.",93,Macauley 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Off-dry, this is very nearly a dessert wine, but it's crisp and minerally enough to consider as a dry table wine. Shows tart, clean flavors of citrus, peach, apricot and wildflower, with the diesel taste of Riesling.",87,Mirassou 2008 Riesling (California),,,,
"Blackberry and blueberry flavors are ripe on this easy drinking, off-dry wine. It's juicy and rich, but lifted by a spray of crisp red cherry on the finish.",85,P.J. Valckenberg 2012 Dornfelder (Rheinhessen),,,,
"This wine is fruity although it also has weight and a rich strand of spice and red plum-skin tannins. This 100% Gamay could age at least until early 2016, although one can just drink it now.",85,Louis Jadot 2014  Beaujolais,,,,
"Give this immature Pinot 3–5 years in the cellar to mellow. At just a year and a half, it's all fresh and raspberry jam-like, with brisk acidity that gives it a bite of cranberry tartness.",89,Von Holt 2011 Hummingbird Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),,,,
This is the producer's first release of this wine. Fruity aromas of plum and tart cranberry add to its overall sense of lightness and understatement.,86,Hindsight 2012 Estate Grown Petite Sirah (Calistoga),,,,
"A full rich and ripe wine that has toast as well as juicy citrus and yellow fruit flavors. It's a young wine, full of crisp fruitiness that will soften and fill out. With its mineral texture, typical of Douro whites, it is a wine for aging. Drink from 2017.",91,Conceito Vinhos 2014 Conceito Branco White (Douro),,,,
"This perfumed wine is very aromatic and crisp. It's still young, not yet fully integrating the acidity, spiced fruits and mineral texture. Wait until 2016.",85,Paul Blanck 2013 Pinot Gris (Alsace),,,,
"Made from grapes grown in the Ritchie Vineyard, as well as others, this rich, mineral-laden expression of the variety is balanced and savory, with a touch of salty brine. Golden-hued, it shows complexity and focus, with a nuanced palate laced with apple skin and pear notes.",94,Della 2015 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Hints of earth and spice accent savory apple aromas on this slightly off-dry Riesling. Brisk lemon and lime acidity make it a refreshing, if straightforward, Riesling.",82,Charles Fournier 2012 Gold Seal Vineyards Riesling (Finger Lakes),,,,
"The aromas are quite muted, not revealing much about what's inside the glass. It's a shame because the palate is quite flavorful, ripe with cherry and spice flavors that show persistence. If the two come together it could move up a notch.",88,Wilridge 2014 Estate Barbera (Naches Heights),,,,
"Here's a fresh and bright rosé from Central Italy with a delicate bouquet of wild flowers and forest berry. The wine is luminous, pristine and would pair with appetizers or light summer pasta or chicken curry salad. In the mouth, the wine tastes fresh, crisp and clean.",87,Talamonti 2009 Cerasuolo  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo Cerasuolo),,,,
"While this wine is crisp and clean, and the price is right, it's a little thin in flavor. Suggests peaches, pears and citrus fruits that finish with a touch of honey. It's okay for everyday food, especially Asian.",84,Kendall-Jackson 2012 Vintner's Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (California),,,,
"In this attractive blend, perfumed Vermentino is filled out by broad, ripe Chardonnay. The result is a wine that, while light, also has a rich character. Full of fruit, it's ready to drink.",88,Domaine de Terra Vecchia 2016 Vermentino-Chardonnay White (Ile de Beauté),,,,
"This bright wine has red fruits, citrus and a light minerality, finishing crisply. Wait until late 2014 for it to open up.",87,Château les Valentines 2013 Le Caprice de Clémentine Rosé (Côtes de Provence),,,,
"There is an elegant integration of aromas on the nose of this bottling, with black cherry, smoked beef and a touch of tobacco. The mouthfeel is very soft and full, presenting flavors of blueberry, crushed asphalt and tart black plum skin. A solid sipper now, it's likely to improve with some aging.",89,Ancient Peaks 2013 Merlot (Santa Margarita Ranch),,,,
"Leathery, rubbery aromas are pinched, stalky and unripe. This Patagonian blend is drawing and astringent, with bland, cool-climate red-berry flavors that have an herbal streak. Saucy, tannic and heavy on the finish, this ends with a note of salami and fennel.",83,Verum 2012 Los Cisnes Coalescence Red (Alto Valle del Río Negro),,,,
"A pleasant, tropical-flavored “house white,” it hints at banana and pineapple flavors and is soft and easy in texture. The winery blended 52% Chardonnay grapes with the aromatic Symphony variety and a few others.",82,Crushed 2011 White (California),,,,
"Raspberry Jell-O and strawberries-and-cream aromas appear on the nose. The medium-bodied palate is slightly flabby in feel, with bramble berries meeting a delicate black pepper note.",84,Pedernales 2015 Dry Rosé (Texas),,,,
"This gorgeous new release, from a young winery with a Riesling focus, is resplendent with an enticing mix of flowers, fruits and stone. The scents well up from the glass and the flavors fill the mouth with a lively zest, pulling together streaks of lemon, lime, nectarine and apricot, accented with citrus rind and wet rock, honey and lemon tea.",93,Trisaetum 2009 Estate Riesling (Willamette Valley),,,,
"Aromas of French oak, strawberry and coconut carry over to the lean palate along with a note of coffee bean. Firm but fleeting tannins lead to a short, astringent finish.",85,Tenuta San Giorgio 2014 Campoleto  (Rosso di Montalcino),,,,
"This red wine might just make you purr with satisfaction. It delivers everything you want in a Merlot. It's dry, but soft, with plush tannins and rich flavors ranging from red cherries and currants to cocoa, violets and cedar.",90,Ballentine 2010 Pocai Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this offers aromas of forest floor, tilled soil, violet, woodland berry and a whiff of leather. The structured but elegant palate doles out juicy black cherry, licorice, tobacco and ground pepper alongside velvety tannins. It's already delicious but hold for more complexity. Drink 2016–2026.",94,Castelli del Grevepesa 2011 Panzano Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico),,,,
"Plusher and rounder than the Special Reserve bottling, Millbrook's standard label Merlot suggests soft red-cherry flavor accented with cocoa powder, savory mushroom and beetroot. Gentle acidity and fine-grained tannins accentuate its plump juicy feel. Drink now through 2019.",86,Millbrook 2014 Merlot (New York),,,,
"Fresh and clean with a personality largely driven by citrus, stone fruit and toasted bread or yeast, this Italian sparkling wine shows background tones of talc powder and almond skin. There's a touch of sour fruit on the close.",88,Moletto 2009 Brut Millesimato Sparkling (Veneto),,,,
"Lots of new oak brings buttered toast flavors to this Chardonnay. Sur lees aging adds notes of sour cream. The underlying fruit veers toward intensely flavored green apples and limes. Tasted in January, the components haven't come together. Give it until the fall of 2013.",90,Truchard 2011 Chardonnay (Carneros),,,,
A good amount of sweetness fills the profile of this superjammy-smelling and thick-tasting wine. Aromas suggest dark raisins and prunes; the flavors are equally overripe with vanilla and maple accents. The texture is soft and unctuous.,85,Caricature 2012 Red (California),,,,
"This vibrant, dry expression of the Moscato grape from Noto, Sicily opens with an intense floral fragrance of wild rose, jasmine, orange blossom and citrus. The palate delivers nectarine zest, white peach and a hint of Mediterranean brush balanced with fresh acidity. Sip as an apéritif or pair it with shellfish.",90,Planeta 2013  Moscato di Noto,,,,
"This is a lighter Schindler than in the past, reflecting the difficult, rain-soaked 2007 vintage. But it shows the character of the vineyard, with subtle hints of blood, rock and herb providing the foundation below the tangy, spicy and tart red fruits. Great winemakers make good wines in even the most difficult vintages; this is the proof.",89,Sineann 2007 Schindler Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This wine opens with toasted nut, dried herb and citrus zest aromas. On the linear, lean palate, thyme and mineral notes back up yellow apple flavors, with lively acidity. It closes on a bitter almond note.",88,Selva Capuzza 2013 Menasasso Riserva  (Lugana),,,,
"Tasted in a flight of more expensive Pinot Noirs, this beauty did just fine. It's an absolutely lovely wine to drink now. Dry and silky, with refreshing acidity, it offers complex berry, cherry, cola, spice and oak flavors. Easy to find, with 4,700 cases produced.",90,La Crema 2008 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"A blanket of oak sits atop apple aromas. This is healthy and fresh in feel, but regular overall. Salty, lean, lightly oaked white-fruit flavors are briny on a racy finish. This is Chardonnay with 11% Pinot Blanc and Pinot Grigio.",85,Trio 2015 Reserva Premium White (Chile),,,,
"Crisp, lightly herbaceous wine with a delicious creamy apple and pear character. This is finely balanced with a lively, crisp aftertaste. Screwcap.",87,Château Briot 2012  Bordeaux Blanc,,,,
"Made with Malvasia grapes that have been dried for 40 days, this intense, savory dessert wine opens with aromas of dates, dried apricot and a hint of thyme. The persistent aromas carry over to the velvety, concentrated palate, along with candied citrus and orange honey. The long, lingering finish closes on a toasted almond note.",94,Hauner 2010 Carlo Hauner Passito Riserva  (Malvasia delle Lipari),,,,
"Loads of fruit show on the nose of this wine: green and red apple, strawberry and ample, zesty citrus. The palate is taut, fresh, dry and precise, shot through with appetizing fruity flavors. A wonderful, flavorsome rosé, with or without food.",90,Schloss Gobelsburg 2016 Cistercien Rosé (Niederösterreich),,,,
"In a ripe style, this is soft, with creamed apple and pear flavors, smooth and light. There is a touch of attractive spice to go with the final acidity.",88,Gritsch Mauritiushof 2009 Axpoint Fedespiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),,,,
"There's a reduced, concentrated effect to this wine, a bold expression of the variety rich in tobacco and black tea, the fruit bittersweet and elusive. Tightly wound, it benefits from air and time in the glass, and will please a Cabernet lover's palate most of all.",87,Napa Cellars 2013 V Collection Pinot Noir (Carneros),,,,
"Ripe fruit and oak mark this Cabernet Franc-dominated blend. That's both to its credit as well as a drawback. The wine is massive in cherry jam, currant and caramelized oak flavors, wrapped into firm tannins. But it's somewhat one-dimensional. Drink now–2016.",86,Terlato 2010 Devil's Peak Red (Napa Valley),,,,
"While there is a somewhat meaty edge to this wine, it also has good rich texture. It probably needs time to bring out the full potential of its ripe yellow fruits.",88,Bret Brothers 2008 En Carementrant  (Pouilly-Fuissé),,,,
"This wine is all spice and sweetness. If the sense of terroir is missing, it does offer ripe swathes of apricot and spiced pear flavors lathered with honey. Drink now.",87,Wunsch & Mann 2012 Steingrubler Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),,,,
"There's a sour, brambly note of white cherry or wild berry here that is characteristic of Piedirosso, a native variety of Campania. The wine is naturally thin in structure and persistency and makes the perfect match to Neapolitan pizza al forno.",85,Mastroberardino 2008 Piedirosso (Lacryma Christi del Vesuvio),,,,
"This is the first release from Cadence's estate vineyard, a 94/6 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc. Sharp and intense, the nose brings out tightly wound red fruit scents, annotated with leaf and white pepper. In this inaugural vintage the Cabernet Sauvignon clearly dominates. A supple, muscular, focused wine with the structure to develop nicely for up to a decade.",92,Cadence 2006 Cara Mia Vineyard Camerata Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),,,,
"This is done in a lightly spicy, lightly toasty style. It's clean and supple, with a mix of apple, peach and melon fruit. Ample acidity keeps it fresh and lively through the finish. It spent six months in a mix of one-third stainless and two-thirds neutral oak.",88,Lazy River 2014 Pinot Gris,,,,
"Plum and cherry notes struggle to show themselves under a heavy layer of coconut and sawdust from new American oak. This wine is tightly wound and dense in the mouth, with refreshing acidity and a medium-to-long finish. A year or two in the cellar will allow for better integration.",87,Swedish Hill 2007 Optiumus Red (Finger Lakes),,,,
Attractive hints of oak in the aroma and fresh cherry-berry flavors make this medium-bodied wine interesting. A good layer of fine tannins adds welcome traction to the texture.,87,Sobon Estate 2013 Rocky Top Zinfandel (Amador County),,,,
"Earthy, lightly herbal and stewed aromas of spiced plum, prune and raisin lead to a grabby, tannic, somewhat abrasive palate. Given that this is now seven years past harvest, it's interesting how ripped, gritty and lively it feels. Herbal chunky flavors of spiced berry fruits and residual oak close with energy. Drink through 2022.",90,Valdivieso 2010 Éclat Vigno Old Vine Dry-Farmed Carignan (Maule Valley),,,,
"A nose of redcurrant signals tart freshness. The palate has this in spades but seems tinged with bitter earthiness that detracts from the berry charm. This light, fresh wine would benefit from chilling. Drink soon.",86,Martinshof 2015 Zum Martin Sepp Zweigelt (Weinland Österreich),,,,
"Too oaky-sweet, with buttered toast, honey and buttered popcorn flavors overwhelming the natural pineapples and tropical fruits. Lots of people will like it, but for purists, it's too much of a good thing.",85,Riverbench 2009 Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),,,,
"Mature, solid and alluring on the bouquet, with cigar box, dried leaves, citrus peel and mature berry fruit aromas. Stylish, lifted and fresh in the mouth, with herb, tobacco, caramel and dried fruit flavors. Composed throughout, with coffee and mocha on the finish. Drink now through 2014.",91,Berberana 2003 Viña Alarde Gran Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"This blends 68% Syrah and 32% Cabernet Sauvignon from one site, the whole having aged for 16 months in 50% new French oak. Bright, brooding and velvety, it tastes of berry pie and chocolate-covered strawberry, with a softness to the leathery finish.",90,Lobo 2015 Howl Wulff Vineyards Custom Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
"Dark-hued wine, dominated by acidity as well as firm tannins. It shows solid, chunky structure, ripe fruit and plenty of sweetness. Of course, there is acidity as well, the charm of Gamay coming through in the fresh cherry flavors. Age 2–3 years.",92,Georges Duboeuf 2010 Domaine Montchavy  (Morgon),,,,
"Ciel du Cheval, Klipsun, Obelisco and Quintessence make up this wine. The aromas of smoke, dark plum, cocoa, herb and spice lead to black-fruit flavors that show a sense of sophistication. There's no question it comes from a warm vintage and region but it shows a judicious touch.",91,Mark Ryan 2014 Dead Horse Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),,,,
"Scents of green apple and plum lead the bouquet, with a strong lime-pith note that carries through to the palate. The texture is soft and somewhat flat on the midpalate, but ample acidity and a pleasant astringency help to lift the close. Drink now.",85,KWV 2015 Classic Collection Chenin Blanc (Western Cape),,,,
"A heavier style of Rioja, with raisin and prune aromas and a brandied character. The palate is expectedly flush and ripe, with weight and size along with black cherry and herbal tea flavors. Shows good stamina and fullness on the finish. Ready to drink now before it starts to fade.",88,Bodegas Franco-Españolas 2004 Barón D'Anglade Reserva  (Rioja),,,,
"This beautifully ripe and juicy wine adds a hint of menthol to the ripe black currant and black cherry aromas and delivers round, rich fruit impressions on the palate. It has a lush mouthfeel, mild tannins and a clean, fruity finish. Cabernet Franc makes up 40% of the blend, along with Petit Verdot, Malbec and Syrah.",90,Miraflores 2013 Estate Meritage (El Dorado),,,,
"With light wood-aging flavors, this creamy wine is still young, with tangy orange and lemon zest as well as touches of vanilla. Let it develop further and drink from late 2017.",85,Adega Mãe 2014 Chardonnay (Lisboa),,,,
"This is a soft, heavy Viognier. Despite some rich flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, it has a vegetal edge, and finishes jammy sweet.",84,Deep Sea 2009 Viognier (Santa Barbara County),,,,
"Stewy, baked aromas of raisin and prune boldly announce that this Malbec is ripe to the point of overripe. The palate is syrupy and soft; cooked, baked flavors of blackberry syrup finish  sticky, stewy and slightly bitter.",86,Lamadrid 2009 Single Vineyard Gran Reserva Malbec (Agrelo),,,,
"This wine is barely rosé in color, more off white. The flavor, from Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, is bright and creamy, deliciously fresh with flavors of watermelon and creamed pear. Light and fragrant, it's ready to drink.",86,Les Rocailles NV Brut Rosé  (Vin de France),,,,
"This is a very dry Cab whose blackberry flavors have nuances of green olives and smoky oak. Notable for its balance, it's a nice, inexpensive red wine to have with fancy meals.",85,Napa Family Vineyards 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),,,,
This opens with the delicate scents of citrus blossom and white stone fruit. The lively palate tastes of white peach and lemon zest while firm acidity gives it a fresh finish.,86,Cembra 2014 Vigna delle Forche Müller-Thurgau (Trentino),,,,
"Aromas of toast, oak, coconut, vanilla, mocha and mature plum lead the nose. Oak-driven sensations drive the robust palate along with ripe berry and a confectionary note. Scorching alcohol dominates the finish and throws this off-balance while bracing tannins leave an astringent close.",89,Tenuta San Giorgio 2011 Ugolforte  (Brunello di Montalcino),,,,
"Lean, tart, angular and edgy, this delivers just what some people are looking for in a Sauvignon Blanc. The fruit is tinged with green throughout, focusing in on lime zest, although there is some yellow plum. It's crisp and clean on the finish.",85,Fowles Wine 2014 Farm to Table Sauvignon Blanc (Victoria),,,,
"Ripe berries, black cherries, earth, chocolate and herbs all mark this nose of this solid Merlot. Fairly full on the palate, it has a supple feel and plum and berry flavors. The finish is reserved, maybe even a bit austere, with dry, semisweet chocolate notes on the tart plum fruit.",86,Cousiño-Macul 1998 Reserva Merlot (Maipo Valley),,,,
"The dried tobacco, vanilla, green olive and cocoa aromas seem somewhat unusual for the variety and vintage. The chocolate and cherry flavors are creamy in feel, displaying a good sense of balance and length.",89,Dunham 2012 XVIII Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"Focused on the more delicate aspects of the grape, this wine comes from a vineyard recently leased long-term by this Kathyrn Hall-owned brand. It shows rose petals, anise, baked plum, mulberry and alpine strawberry on the nose. The palate combines cola, pencil lead, dark cranberry and black pepper.",91,Walt 2013 Clos Pepe Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),,,,
"There are some problems here, beginning with a vegetal, asparagus smell and ending with a soft, simple syrup finish. In between are some decent cherry flavors wrapped into harsh tannins.",82,Buena Vista 2004 Merlot (Carneros),,,,
This inviting blend of Barbera and Bonarda from Lombardy offers aromas of black fruit and spice with an earthy note. The palate delivers black cherry and peppery flavors along with soft tannins. Pair this with smoked meats or seasoned cheeses.,88,Castello di Luzzano 2010 Riserva Romeo  (Gutturnio Colli Piacentini),,,,
Simple and sugary sweet with pineapple and mango fruit.,82,Amberhill 2010 Secret Blend White (California),,,,
"Aromas of black currant, orange zest and lemon thyme set the scene for a three-way balancing act of fruit, savory and cool flavors. On the palate, notes of black cherry, lingonberry, eucalyptus, mint and thyme stand out, and gentle tannins ride on through a cherry and mint finish.",90,Flam 2011 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Galilee),,,,
"Clos de los Siete is a perennial leader among under-$20 wines from Argentina. Blueberry and graham cracker aromas are ripe and a touch reduced. The palate is saturated yet juicy, while blackberry, boysenberry, cardamom and nutmeg flavors feed into a dark tasting, compact finish. For a 50,000-case wine, this is a prize to behold.",90,Clos de los Siete 2010 Red (Mendoza),,,,
"The aromatic delivery is bright, fresh and pristine. Bright acidity is backed by flavors of stone fruit, citrus and Golden Delicious apple. It's the kind of white to serve with summer salad lunches by the pool.",87,La Vis 2010 Intaglio Pinot Grigio (Trentino),,,,
"Packed with ripe, upfront raspberry, cherry and cola fruit, this Pinot certainly delivers in the flavor department. But it goes well beyond that, framing the richness in a fine structure of smooth tannins, crisp acidity and a deft application of oak. Straddles the line between immediate drinkability and ageability, so drink it now and over the next four years.",93,Joseph Jewell 2009 Appian Way Vineyards Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
"Round, floral, fruity and just a bit bretty. Almost everything is right about this value-priced wine. The fruit is dark and veers toward black cherry and plum, while the feel is good. Finishes with a nice run of dry oak and chocolate flavors.",89,Viña Bisquertt 2006 Casa La Joya Gran Reserve Merlot (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"This wine shows smooth red fruit that is light and generic, with modest weight and an earthy flavor. The wine spent a bit of time in 25% new oak, though it doesn't show up in the flavors.",87,Maison L'Envoyé 2013 The Attaché Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),,,,
"This wine is aged in neutral oak and shows salty lemon and guava notes atop a creamy, crisply layered texture. Bright and bold, it satisfies on the palate and should impress further as it opens in the glass, or even with a touch more time in the bottle.",92,Keller Estate 2014 Oro De Plata Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),,,,
"Lemon custard, ripe Gala apples and a seemingly sweet candy element show on the nose of this wine from a family-owned producer. Bright energy and ripe apple characterize the palate, along with green pear skins and stonefruit.",87,Joullian 2014 Family Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Carmel Valley),,,,
"Way too sweet in ripe, jammy cherry-berry fruit and caramelized oak, resulting in a Cabernet that tastes like the wine equivalent of a granola candy bar. Fans of this sweet style will like it.",85,Signaterra 2008 Three Blocks Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley),,,,
"High-altitude vines yielded this full while also crisp wine. It is fruity, touched by caramel and spice and some toast flavors from wood aging. This is a rosé style that goes with food.",86,Muxagat 2013 Rosé (Douro),,,,
"This is a glamorous, fashionable wine that gives the pleasure you want in a bubbly. It's dryish and crisp, with doughy yeast, raspberry and lime flavors. A good price for a California sparkling wine of this quality.",90,Domaine Carneros 2007 Brut Sparkling (Carneros),,,,
"This wine is just over three-quarters Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Merlot. Aromas of black currant, woodspice and a violet top note are followed by plentiful black-fruit flavors supported by firm tannins that need time to stretch their legs.",88,Two Vintners 2013 Legit Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"91-93. Barrel sample. Along with its Saint-Estèphe tannins, this wine proves to be richly fruity and complex, with notes of spice. The finish shows the acidity of the year.",92,Château Cos Labory 2011 Barrel Sample  (Saint-Estèphe),,,,
"Straightforward apple and lime flavors are simple and stony. Lemony acidity gives the palate snap and purpose, while flavors of kiwi, orange, lime and lemon finish tangy, with length and vitality. Drink now.",89,Condes de Albarei 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas),,,,
"This off-dry wine offers fresh acidity and delicious hints of honey and yellow fruits. It is fruity, rich while still full of the typical freshness of young Chenin Blanc. Let the wine round out and drink from 2017.",86,Domaine Pichot 2014 Le Peu de la Moriette Demi-Sec  (Vouvray),,,,
"From the Bokisch family's splendid Lodi vineyard comes this Sonoma-made Albariño, lemony with a touch of peach that's austere in texture and body, but rich in acidity, spicy herb and pepper.",89,En Garde 2012 Terra Alta Vineyard Albariño (Lodi),,,,
"Aromas of scorched soil, truffle, ripe black-skinned fruit and cedar lead the nose of this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. The concentrated palate delivers ripe black cherries, blackberries, orange zest, grilled herbs, clove and tobacco, while firm, velvety tannins provide support. A licorice note closes the finish.",92,Brancaia 2011 Ilatraia Red (Toscana),,,,
"In 2007 the winery's Estate bottling seems to capture a bit more nuance and detail than the reserve, though admittedly it does not have quite the same concentration. For those who prize finesse, this is the wine of the vintage. Herbal and resiny, it's like sniffing a fine wine in a pine forest. It balances raspberry and sour cherry fruit with the tart and herbal “wild” side of Oregon Pinot. Penetrating and complex.",91,De Ponte Cellars 2007 Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),,,,
"This is a wine that showcases the Mourvèdre grape (80% of the blend). That gives a wonderful perfumed wine, bringing out fine tannins and a rich structure. Aged in wood for 20 months, the wine has a spicy edge to balance the ripe black-plum flavors. It is only just ready to drink and will be much better from 2018.",92,Hecht & Bannier 2013 Red (Bandol),,,,
"Estate grown, this 100% Syrah has excellent concentration and round, mouthfilling fruit flavors. Cherries and plums are highlighted with baking spices and a finishing wash of rich mocha. Very tasty, forward, and drinking at its best right now.",90,Plumb Cellars 2008 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),,,,
"This lightly volatile wine shows notes of cherry cola, dried fruit and woodspice. It doesn't drink entirely dry with the alcohol riding high on the medicine-cabinet flavors.",83,Stina's 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Wahluke Slope),,,,
"Punchy citrus and minerally aromas open this fresh SB. A juicy, citric palate points in the right direction, while this tastes like tangerine and orange peel mixed with lime and green herbs. A crisp, persistent finish closes it out.",89,Concha y Toro 2015 Serie Riberas Gran Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Colchagua Valley),,,,
"This wine's grilled herb, celery, dark spice and camphor aromas follow through to its bracing palate. The fruit is completely dried out, leaving toasted notes framed by aggressive, astringent tannins.",84,Taliano 2010 Tera Mia Riserva  (Barbaresco),,,,
"Softly floral and brightly spicy, this wine rocks in red cherry and tangy citrus, sure to please a broad range of palates in its approachable elegance and restraint. Toasted vanilla oak rounds out the finish.",91,Gehricke 2014 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),,,,
This is one of those luminous Pinot Grigios that sits well in the mouth and satisfies on all fronts. The wine is redolent of exotic fruit and citrus but has the creamy density to match shellfish or prawns.,87,Masottina 2008 Vigneto ai Palazzi Pinot Grigio (Piave),,,,
"92-94. Barrel sample. Very dry, firm and hard, this is heavily dominated by new wood. It's only the underlying weight that suggests the black fruit potential.",93,Château Angélus 2011 Barrel Sample  (Saint-Émilion),,,,
"Baked blackberry, vanilla, dust and chocolate show on the nose of this blend of 69% Petite Sirah, 22% Grenache and 9% Tannat. The palate is ripe with plum, blueberry and black currant and lifted by dried ginger and nutmeg, but the dazzling acidity and tannic firmness is what takes it to the next level.",93,Pulchella 2014 The Revision Red (Paso Robles),,,,
"Sweetish and simple, but ripe and lusty in berry and spice flavors, this is a bistro-style wine for everyday drinking. Production was high and the alcohol level is low.",84,Cottonwood Creek 2010 Red (California),,,,
"Attractive fragrance and a pleasureable mouthfeel characterize this medium-weight offering. A 50-50 Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc blend, it offers  pear, lemon, and vanilla-oak flavors on the nose and mouth. The long smooth finish is unexpectedly elegant, something not often found at this price. Best Buy.",88,Calvet 1998 Reserve  (Bordeaux Blanc),,,,
This overtly ripe white shows a generosity of guava and mango flavor—a tropical outpouring of perceptible sweetness that's wrapped in a boldness of body and vanilla oak.,85,Pellegrini 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Bennett Valley),,,,
"Vibrant and elegant, this radiant sparkler has enticing aromas of wild flower, apple, graphite, Alpine herb and a whiff of bread crust. The fresh linear palate delivers ripe pear, nectarine, mineral and a hint of toasted almond alongside lively acidity. The bone-dry finish closes crisp and clean.",91,Altemasi 2008 Pas Dosé Metodo Classico Sparkling (Trento),,,,
"This is a big, smoky Lodi Zinfandel, explosively jammy and thick with bacon flavor.",83,Delta Landing 2011 Zinfandel (Lodi),,,,
"Aromas of mint, talcum powder and dried cherry lead you to a delightful palate of red and black plums and black raspberries. Soft tannins and a persistent finish make this a notable Bulgarian Merlot.",89,Domaine Boyar 2015 Reserve Merlot (Thracian Valley),,,,
"This is a sturdy, dry wine with hefty texture and straightforward, almost neutral flavors. It has an unusual salmon-amber color, light peach aromas and slightly earthy notes on the palate.",83,Ambrose 2015 AMB Rosé (California),,,,
"Robust, dense and meaty, this 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot dances around well-concocted swirls of black tea, herb and cedar. Soft and smooth on the palate, the oak is subtle, coaxing out flavors of tobacco and black currant, finishing with purpose.",90,Taken Wine Co. 2012 Taken Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Napa Valley),,,,
"You'll find aromas of raisin, wet underbrush, anise, oak and dried herb on this. The firm palate is robust but lacks fruit richness, offering licorice, the heat of evident alcohol, roasted coffee bean and a suggestion of dried-up black cherry. It also has a green note of powdered sage while raspy tannins leave an astringent, mouth-puckering finish.",86,Mamete Prevostini 2012 Albareda  (Sforzato di Valtellina),,,,
"Compact, inky aromas of blackberry, balsamic notes, earth and smoke are complete. This is lively yet full-bodied in feel, with dark, toasty black-fruit flavors that come with hints of chocolate, pepper, herbs and fig. A long, toasty, slightly hot and burning finish keeps this smoldering for a while. Drink through 2018.",92,Zolo 2010 Black Malbec (Mendoza),,,,
